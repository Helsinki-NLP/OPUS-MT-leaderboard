Tampere's 9-year-old son was found
The police have had to search for a 9-year-old boy because he was pregnant with Tampere for eight nights.
The report on the disappearance of a boy from West Tampere has been published in the social media.
According to the police station, the boy has been contacted, and he has no risk to life and health.
The boy's father told the night-Samom in the news that his son had been found.
He's all right, and now we're going to start the follow-up.
The boy found the house next door, Dad told me.
Ronaldo resuscitate - repi meal in the Messiah
Cristian Ronaldo had five lands in Spain for a week and continued to work in the Mestres.
The link between Lionel Messin and Christian Ronaldo from the Mesterian overseas became at least a few minutes’ noticeable progress.
Real Madrid Ronaldo moved alone to the bottom of all the ages of the painting industry when he shot the visitor Shahtar Donetskin into the network of two shootings and one game scene.
Ronaldo was in his 80 ’ s when he was in his 80 ’ s when he was on vacation with him in Barcelona Messil, where there are 77 pieces.
Real won the prize 4-0.
Juventus has originally been compromised by the Italian football team in Serie A, but in the D-loc of Mesteria, it began with a strong 2-1-wishing force from Manchester City.
The battery was about ten minutes before the end of the Juventuus Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack broke down the fragile Sergei Aguero's escape.
Aguero, who was shot in the weekend election game, came to the field for the last ten minutes.
Also, Manchester's second follow-up to the United experienced severe PSV in the Netherlands in the face of the 1-2 battle against PSV Endhoven.
Luke Shaw's visit, a 20-year-old representative of ManU, is always just a matter of waiting.
The PSV's dangerous appearance of Hector Moren became so dangerous that the attack against the ManU package was so bad that Shaw probably got confused.
Shaw sakg Eindhoven's home at ten minutes before the medical staff took him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay will take you to the 41st minute, 1-0, but ManU's joy lasts only a few minutes.
Moreno recovered before it was too late.
The PSV’s battery was on the other side of Luciano Narsingh.
On the way through the landscape, the cross of the Mestres started in the Paris St. Germain.
In the case of Manchester United's successor to the PSG, Angel Di Maria was replaced by Angel Di Maria.
Di Maria was moved right through the palace, and the palace was filled with the destruction of Malmö's painter Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made the second half of the PSG 2-0.
The PSG has been weakened by a number of long-term successes.
It is not wrong to be angry, but Malmö, which is too young, is not the best possible comparison point.
PSG's major actor Zlatan Ibrahimovic first met his professional team at Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmös in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team Moskova TsSKA lost the B-class in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party called for an immediate difference - the president had made a mistake.
Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe spoke the same way he had spent months ago.
Mr Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, has spoken again in the country's Parliament, which he had to speak at the end of the month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe did not appear to have felt the same thing.
The talk raised doubts as to whether the 91st year of Mugabe is in full force.
The MDC party requires Mugabe to be different because this is too old to rule.
The supporters of Mugaben were quick to say that the scandal had occurred only in Mugaben's presence and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugaben spoke earlier and now the impact of China on the economy of the country.
Germany and Austria want more summits on refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have introduced the summit of EU leaders for the first week because of the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council for Summits, assesses the request.
According to Germany's Deputy Director Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with non-members and how they will be able to achieve more effective registrations in Europe.
According to Merkel, negotiations on the quota for asylum seekers are part of the internal ministers' window.
The professor gives his girlfriend a shot in the emergency call.
Professor Shannon Lamb of the University called on a few senior police officers at his home and told him that they were shooting their girlfriend.
Lamb mentioned in particular that their love of their dog was in place and alive and probably in fear. The professor said that the contact information of a woman’s family was on the woman’s phone.
The police in the house found a message written to Amy Prentiss in the body and to the white paper: "I am very sorry and I hope I can undo my actions. I loved Amya, and he is the only woman who has ever loved me," in Lambi's signature, including by the authorities.
There was no sign in the board that Lamb, who taught two network courses at Delta State University in Mississippi Cleveland, had already travelled 500 kilometers to the school head camp. The police found from the camp his work room to the door as a dead history professor, Ethan Schmidt, who is believed to be shot by Lambin.
Delta State University police officer Lynn Buford announced that the university official had received information on the bombing at 10.18 a.m.
According to him, Lamb called the emergency call sometime after this.
One more death was possible on the day, and Lamb himself was breathing when the police wanted him.
The next day, the students and the teaching staff stopped behind the doors, and the authorities were still trying to explain Lambi’s motives.
Researchers discovered details in both communities, and Lambi’s experiences told about a man. The researchers were given a picture of a generous but also of a problem teacher.
The students always said they were waiting for the teacher's feelings.
According to the police of the Prentissian death camp, Professor Gautier had not previously been involved in violence or crime.
Schmidt had in his book Lambi, in which he had given recognition to "some people", with whom he was able to lead an academic life.
Both worked on community data and history, with 17 members of the educational staff. Many of the students attended the courses of both men.
However, references to problems arose.
Lambia invited student Brandon Beavers to say that the professor was impressed by the sudden and nervousness of "if he had anything to do with it."
Another student, Michael Sykes, said that Lamb had told him of his stress at the end of 2014-2015.
Lamb had previously taken over Delta State University sick leave because of some kind of health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the remuneration policy of the university meant that the claim for which Lamb had done hard work was not automatically returned to him by the assistant professor’s office.
Director of the University, William LaForge, said there was no information about the differences between Lambi and Schmidt, but he realized that Lambia was clearly in trouble.
Lamb can't answer these questions anymore.
The police from the camp found out what Lamb had come from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before the police targeted Lambin, he had himself been busy with a 38-caliber life gun at the back of the room in Mississippi Greenville, about half a mile from his parents' home, told Methhel Johnson of the Washington area.
The Lamb's car was still on the road.
The police didn't immediately understand why Lamb had just gone to this house, but Johnson told him that he believed that the man knew the house.
He was in his early teens.
Lamb started working as a teacher at a university with 3,500 students. There were 12,000 inhabitants in the city in 2009 .
She got a doctor's degree in growth at noon.
One of Lambi's longest friends described this as smart, charismatic, and fun.
Carla Hairston told me that he met Lambi's friends when he was 15 and Lamb at the age of 20.
He was still a friend in the library, and Lamb was interested in the older guy who had been trying to teach Irish school for years.
"Lamb was then quite a heart attacker.
All the girls were in his hospital," said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the city of Jackson in Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously in the past for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb told his wife that he had killed her, but no document said they had been hurt.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, and they lived in the railway station in the small town of Gautier.
According to the police, the dog was fine.
Prentissian, former husband Shawn O'Steen, told her about Prentiss 15 years ago. The Parisian society had remained friends, and they have a daughter who is now 19.
"He was very upset," O'Steen said to his daughter.
"The daughter and mother were best friends."
O'Steen didn't meet Lambi, but she heard from her daughter Abigail that Lamb had music and called blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail appeared three years ago.
Later, they called each other together.
According to O'Steen, his daughter is going to play and present her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies through the network.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and a part-time winter coordinator at The Julep Room's restaurant outside Gautier, told him that he saw Lambi and Prentissin on 5 September when Lamb had called a cook and a nurse to a rare public.
There was nothing to say that something would have been wrong.
"Saffrey Paris," Shaffer said.
"We were watching together.
Both had a good humor."
"Professor Schmidt took the lead in the first year's seminar and had specialized in the history of the Indians and the transitions", English Professor Don Allan Mitchell told.
She was married, and she had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was the president of his own brotherhood and university.
At the Delta State University campus in Cleveland, there are 900 people gathered in the monumental valley. Among them were the educational staff, other staff, students and residents of the region.
Schmidt's wife, Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the occasion when the university tower presented the chapters "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The teaching goes on in the middle of the week.
"We're trying to get students back," said LaForge.
"The crisis is over.
This is a day to improve."
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported on Mississippi Cleveland.
Contributors: Associated Press Providers Emily Wagster Pettus Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana New Orleans.
The story is correct, because the police now tell us that Lamb called after the storm came upon Schmidt, and it was also clarified that even though Lamb referred to Prentiss' wife in the emergency, their marriage is not evidence.
Toys R Us is going to hire fewer length workers
The Soys R Us is not going to hire as many hairdressers as last year. However, the resales of toys and baby products tell current workers and hairdressers about the possibility of additional work.
The company is going to hire 40,000 people for sales and distribution centres across the country. In 2014 it hired 45,000 waiters.
Most of the workplaces are part-time.
The applicants' questionnaires will be launched this month, and new workers will start in October to July.
Although there are still months of rent, the trade season is approaching a good pace, and companies are preparing to pay temporary workers for sales and the delivery and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox smiles at her "treffet" with Princess Diana
Back in the future, Michael J. Fox had an important moment for the U.S.
The first night was also a personal matter.
"We sat in the theater and waited for royal arrivals. I noticed there was an empty spot next door. To me, my white sister Diana is coming to my neighborhood," Fox told the next Back in Time document trailer.
"When the film began, I realized that the situation was very much remembered with Princess Wales."
Back in Time document is related to future images, and the documents also challenge Fox's Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd as well as the leader of Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg.
After the future, the image was first taken 30 years ago.
"This film is definitely a time series for me," said Spielberg.
Back in Time will be published in VOD and DVD format, and will be presented in the selected movies from October.
UN Secretary-General: no military solution in Syria
The UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon commented on Russia's strengthened military activities and said that nearly five years of conflict would not be a military solution and that weapons would only bring more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General once again called on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unite their forces and to support extensive negotiations to find a political solution.
In a press conference last Wednesday, the Ban announced its intention to meet five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France, to discuss the situation in Syria.
Ban regretted that the deterioration of the security Council, the Syrian people and the regional powers had caused a situation that could not be resolved.
The Bank invited five permanent Member States to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity in the context of the Syrian crisis as achieved by the Iran nuclear agreement.
Number 8 of support questions: Is Donald Trump real?
Trumpy's been trying to be an empty chat room.
She's been treated as a joke, too.
Part predicts Trumpy's collapse.
In the Republican borders, the result has been sought by all means to take the lead in the drop of Trump.
Ten of the 10 national golf courses show Donald Trump double-numbered support courses, and the part is already seriously based on what it actually tells about the potential of the construction module.
The choices are really the opposite in the beginning.
Nothing has yet been said that Trump is chosen as a representative of the Republican people.
Experts point out that Rick Perry, who was in the 2011 hearing camp, was able to give rise to Herman Cain, who did not finally win a bid election in any of the Member States.
There would be a lot of trouble in the general election.
External groups such as Jeb Bushin Super PAC and the Economic Conservative Group Club for Growth have noted the strong position of Trump and began to dig for his escape.
The following minor Gallup data show that the fixed-up mollusc can't be used for the treatment of alkaline:
There's been a full order in the crowd's support.
Just before Trump announced his proposal in the middle of June, only two of the ten republicans, according to the University of Monmouth, had a positive picture.
By mid-May, 40 percent had already been positive.
The corresponding share at the beginning of August was 52 per cent.
Now, six out of ten Republicans, Donald Trump is a welcome guest.
About three out of ten people are forbidden.
These lists shall also be kept in the Member States in which the elections are first organized.
In the last week, 60 percent of Republicans in the Quinnipac gallery had a positive view of Trump.
Two thirds of the Republicans would be satisfied with Trump's proposal.
In the last week of CNN and ORC, 67 per cent of Republicans were declared to be very satisfied or satisfied with the possible choice of Trump.
Only two out of ten would be very dissatisfied with Trump's proposal.
Ben Carson gets almost the same enthusiasm as Trump (43% would be very satisfied with Carson's proposal and 40% with Trump's proposal).
Who is the next proposed candidate?
The third is Marco Rubio, whose corresponding percentage is 21%.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of Republicans would be either dissatisfied or very dissatisfied if Jeb Bush were to be elected as a candidate for the party.
Most Republicans don't think that Trump's temperature is a problem.
Donald Trumpia has been widely criticized for his excellent position and excellent comments. 52 per cent of Republican supporters around the world hold the properties of the construction module in agreement with the President. The views are expressed on the opinion of the ABC News and Washington Post.
The same is true of Iowa, where the defence meeting is organized first: 52 per cent of Republicans, according to the Quinnipiac-Gallup, hold the personal characteristics of Trump as appropriate to the Chief of Defence Forces.
However, according to the ABC and Post Gallupa, 44 per cent of them consider that Trump is not able to function effectively, and six out of ten are considered to be unable to reach the White House.
The Republicans are starting to think.
They're starting to deal with Trump.
When the Republicans are informed, who is most likely to be elected as a candidate for the party, four tenths believe in the possibility of Trump, according to the CNN and ORC.
The situation has changed since the mid-July, when four out of ten had to put their money on the left side of Jeb Bush.
Totality: The Republicans have not previously had a highly reliable crystal ball in use.
At this stage, only 28 percent of the last four of the ten Republicans were likely candidates for Rick Perry, and only 28 percent of Mitt Romney.
Most people seem to think that Trump's campaign is an insurance policy.
Although the Republicans would support one another's proposal, Trump will hide almost all the other proposals.
Some experts believe that the distributed weapon is likely to benefit from Trumpa when its opponents share with the various sponsors.
At the beginning of September, the opinions of the University of Monmouth revealed that Trump and almost anyone else in the two-dimensional debate between the Republican province of Trump would always have a greater support force.
He leads Carly Fiorina on 13 points, Marco Rubiota on 14 points, Walker on 15 points, Jeb Bushia on 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasichi and Chris Christie on 33 points.
Ted Cruz and he's at the level.
Is Cruz Trump the only real opponent?
Ben Carson won 19 points from the Trump in a two-pound game.
A small majority of Trump's supporters already have a voting decision.
According to CBS and NYT, the right-hand side of Trump's supporters is certainly for voting.
The situation may have changed for a number of reasons, and at the moment, a certain voter can also change his mind.
46 per cent of the supporters of the Group have not made a final decision.
At this moment, Trup's most active competitor is neurosurgery Ben Carson, but the voters who have already voted on his proposal will vote twice more likely.
Six of the ten Republicans agree to the Trump's vision of the transition.
Donald Trump, who was invited to the campaign two months ago, from Mexico, has been a hot topic in 2016.
Some are concerned about the significant Latin American voters from the republican groups and the renewed brand.
However, according to ABC News and Washington Post, six of the 10 Republicans published yesterday, however, have the same lines with Trump on the transition issues.
As long as the transfer takes place in the sky, so is Donald Trump.
Dissatisfaction with government is on its way.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now gathering together about half of the Republicans' voices. It is important to suggest that they both have come out of the world.
ABC News and Washington Post, according to the latest opinion of the Republican Group, was six of the Republicans.
These two proposals are also expensive to Washington.
According to the opinion delivered by Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Iowa, three of the four Republicans in Iowa have been affected by the activities of the Republicans at the Congress: 54 per cent are unhappy and 21 per cent by the armed forces."
Jeremy Corbyn debed at the Prime Minister's question
After the election, the Prime Minister's priority for Corby's initiative was expected at the hour of the election.
The work side of Labour’s new lyrics, Jeremy Corbyin, is about to rise for the first time to measure the strength of David Cameron’s question at an hour later.
Corbyn asks the first six questions after a few days, the media and the representatives of the working party are following him very closely.
Corbyn's been rehabilitating less theater and adding facts to the weekly show.
He has also found that he can leave a part of the meetings and leave them to his colleagues.
At the meeting, Corbyn's leadership will be first mentioned in connection with the first time.
In the 75-year-old events of the Ison-British Air Force organized during a national session of the Labour Party, the decision to vote has been criticised in part by several representatives of the Tory Party. The opinion has also been concluded in the search for a number of statements.
Corbyn’s death during a national song
The representative of Corbyin, during the National Assembly of Corbyn, expressed his respect for the silence of the Royal Air Force in the British War.
However, the BBC's Two's Newsnight programme, Mr Owen Smith, of Corby's Security Board, said that it would have called on the Head of the Party to join the national song despite this monarch's opposition.
Ten Secret Ministers have refused to leave, according to Corbyin's units, to separate economic, defence and external affairs, and less than half of the six-members supported the election of Corbyn to the side.
BBC policy writer Robin Brant considers that political differences between the EU membership of the UK and the benefits of the government have been used in the workplace following the name of Corby.
At the TUC meeting, Corbyn said that it was going to propose changes to remove the restrictions completely.
A few years later, Minister of Labour and Housing of the Department of Safety Smith stated that the position of the party is very clear: it only contradicts the Government's plans to limit the amount of 26 000 points to 23 000 points.
Corbyn is the fifth Labour Leader, whom David Cameron faces over the past decade under the leadership of the Tory Party.
With a new approach to policy, Commissioner Labour will say that the questions raised by Cameron from the public will be covered by 30 000 proposals.
According to Islington Northin's selection, Corbyn has too much consensual connotations. He also promises to avoid harsh words and slander and instead say that he focuses on serious issues, such as poverty, inequality and the problems of young people.
Corbyn has found that Minister Angela Eagle brings him in hours of question, for example, when Cameron is outside.
Corbyn has also been disappointed with the idea that others could also vote in favour of each other, and she is talking with the President of the House of Parliament, John Bercowin.
After Corbyn's election in 2005, Cameron pointed out that he wanted to be a bedtime politician, which is often associated with the hour of question, but some years later he admitted his failure in his attempt.
Since the first time the hour of question was televisiond in 1990, it has been regarded as a central measurement of the ability of the Director to evaluate, manage the premises and the situation. However, according to the critics, the hour of question has become a caricaty that requires measurable revisions.
Shot in Joburg: coded young photographer
The centre of Johannesburg is an environment that is disturbing to the homeless.
A group of former Catholics has found an idea of how to learn and learn.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a winning non-profit painting studio, which teaches homeless young people to watch movies at home and deserve the same.
The BBC News met a young man who was made through the project in the first group.

The point is confirmed on the rise of the Ison-British prizes
The score was confirmed at the awards in Isosa, Britain, and SABMiller increased the FTSE 100 index.
In October and July, wages rose by 2.9 per cent in Iso-British Britain compared to the corresponding period of the last year.
The accelerated growth was then rapid in 2009.
The point was determined by 1 per cent and the rate was recorded at $1,5505. The point was also established in relation to the euro, and the point was stated at EUR 1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1.49 per cent and ended at 6,229.21 points.
The biggest increase was SABMiller, whose rate fell by 20% when the company received a competitive offer from AB InBevil.
In the course of trade, the world would combine two large printing companies and another under the same roof, such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
The Burberry share increased by 0.9% in the age of the positive results of the Richemont group, which is competitive in general production.
The latest sales conditions in Richemont are forecast to be better, and the development of the sale was also a result of growth in the opening market in Burberry in China.
Glencoren's share increased by 5 per cent, as indicated by its intention to reimburse the share of $2.5 billion as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The share of the packaging and paper group Mond was the largest drop in volume of 4.3 per cent when Goldman Sachs dropped the company's share price for the sale purpose.
JD Sport’s course increased 3.1% after the company announced that its production prior to tax increased by 83% at 46.6 million points.
JD Sports -pomo: greater payables could be affected by enlargement
According to the president of the JD Sports Group, Peter Cowgilli, the minimum salary in the United Kingdom would mean more purchasing power for potential customers.
However, the increased purchasing power does not suffice to cover the higher labour costs incurred by the company.
According to Cowgil, rising labour costs can jeopardise JD Sport’s expansion plans and reduce the need for additional activity.
Metcash launch against Aldi's shooting campaign
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA from Aldin's power in South and Western Australia.
Metcash has launched a food support campaign to maintain IGA’s market share in South and Western Australia against the invasion of Aldin $700 million in Australia.
Aldi intends to open two distribution centres and the first 120 shops in South and Western Australia first in the first year. Metcast and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and build IGA brands on the market in government and social media, as well as organizing events such as Adelaide show.
IGA amphibians and conservationists, as well as many brands, are included in the campaign. For example, Simmo, located in Dunsborough, offers a master IGA bath, and merchants sell shoes to customers in South Australia's football games at low cost.
Metcashi is expected to publish more detailed information on the defence strategy on 29 September, where the food, alcohol and iron trade will be organised on the annual investment day.
This is important for markets, as South and Western Australia constitutes nearly 30 per cent of Metcashi IGA mines, and in these areas there is a higher decline in production than in the IGA mining network of the former Member States.
South and Western Australian consumers are known for their roundup culture, and IGA branches also have a significantly higher market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. South Australia has 30 per cent and 24 per cent in Western Australia, while only 14 per cent in the former Member States are involved.
For example, analysts Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will drop 5% of the food market in these two Member States within 12 months of the opening of the first shops.
This week, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimated that the sale of IGA copper could be up to 360 million and that Metcashi would sell 250 million dollars by the end of 2016.
The advantage is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 sales in South and Western Australia in the first year and sell 500 million dollars and 600 million dollars in these areas.
Metcashi's fixed costs are high, so the loss of food consumption and volume can mean a $13 million loss resulting from the loss of fees and taxes, Kierath's reality.
At the same time, Metcast is losing market share in the former Member States mainly for Aldi and Coles, although, according to a recent study by Roy Morgan, IGA’s customers are the most reliable.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food consumption will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018. Its market share will fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent in 2020.
Last week, Governor Hamish Douglass of the Magellan Financial Group told Melbourne that he was very likely to lose Metcash within ten years.
Metcash has refused to take public position on Douglas' comments.
It is understandable that a member of the Metcashi Government contacted Douglas last week.
The IGA market share has decreased by 18 per cent since 2010 to 14 per cent, and the result of the Metcash food business of 1200 is calculated by 43 per cent at 2012 level.
However, the retail operator is engaged in countermeasures and makes an annual balance of over 150 million Australian dollars to meet Colesin and Woolworth's prices per week for hundreds of products. The customer wants to support trade in the renewal of sales, so that they can increase the supply of products and improve the consumer's choice of food brands.
According to Metcash, the price revision and sales reform plans are in good shape, and the company is able to grow again in 2017 for the first time in four years.
The President of the Australian Technological Union Steve Healy defends Thanasi Kokkinak
Thanas Kokkinakis deserves to be used instead of the specific criteria of the country.
According to the president of the Australian tennis club Steve Healthy, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a popular victim in the recent episode of Nick Kirgios. Kokkinakis deserves a special criticism.
The two younger parties named "Special K" in Kokkinakis had an unexpected turn of events when the bad boy Kyrgios tried his opponent Stan Wawrinka in Montreal's ATP market.
Shortly after this, in the Cincinnati game between Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison, the judge had to separate his competitors from each other twice. "Wawrinka should have given the Kirgios and my friends there," said Harrison.
In the open U.S., Kokkinakis was once devastated on the ground of the country when powerful cramps broke his grip. Healy has been faithfully protected from Kokkinaki.
At present there is a workshop in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Grothin, a simple two-pounder, behind Bernard Tomic, at Davis Cup in the semi-finals of Isoa-United Kingdom.
"I firmly believe that Thanas has been taught by his criticism," said Healy.
"He broke the mail when he destroyed the office in the United States. He is not at all the first player to break his mail because of corruption. I know Thanas's reputation well that he's not successful.
However, he has endured very well, for example, the use of Harrison in the open in the United States, and he deserves recognition from me.
He's got a strong team and a loyal family around him, and I think he's just a little unfair to me.
He is very capable of 19 years of age, he does hard work and complements well with a team. He has never had problems with other players, and he is respected in the middle of the players. He exercises hard, is in good shape and is a really strong and capable young man. I think he should be evaluated on the basis of his own merits."
Healy also supported the decision to release Kyrgios Australian team as a whole from an important cycle. Hey describes the solution as a common decision for all parties. However, he supports Canberra's return to the group as a long-term commitment.
"First of all, we want to focus entirely on the steps that have nothing to do with Kyrgyzstan," said Healy.
Nick has grown up on the street fast. As Federer and Murray have noticed, a young man must be kept in the public fire. He deserves to be criticized for his bad mistakes. However, we try to support him so that he can understand the consequences of his actions. We also try to organize his own peace. I believe it is best for the whole team as well as for Nick."
Europe's transition crisis: Hungary publishes emergency, closes borders, keeps transfers
The emergency department announced that Hungary had closed its southern border with Serbia as a hostage and arrested illegal asylum seekers. The aim was to prevent the transferist from coming to Serbia.
The border was created when hundreds of immigrants came into use in non-traditional countries, and the Serbian authorities reacted violently.
People with disabilities were forced to stay in the border between the border inspection posts of the countries for an unlimited period of time
The drying started to rise on the surface.
On the plane of the police helicopter, these “Open the Borders” and cried out to the Hungarian melka police.
Some became protestors in the food and drink store.
The Serbian Foreign Minister stated that it would not accept the transferees to be sent back to Hungary at the same time as further access to Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of a solution, not to add harm.
The situation needs to be discussed in Brussels as well as in other countries," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
At the border between Hungary and Serbia, the day came later when a group of 28 countries failed to develop a common transitional policy at a Chinese meeting in Brussels.
However, the Ministers agreed that 40 000 asylum seekers were in a common position in Italy and Greece, and at the meeting, they hoped that the agreement would be reached by the end of the month or by the end of the year, which would be taken by the EU Member States against 120 000 immigrants, including Hungary.
For the next week, the German Deputy Heads of State Angela Merkel and Austria invited the school to attend an additional summit to discuss the manterior crisis.
However, Hungary did not wish to take long action in Brussels or neighboring countries.
In the meantime, the emergency situation has developed so that the authorities in the two southern regions have been able to take more effective measures, namely to close you and speed up the legal processes related to security matters.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that Hungary is also planning to extend the border to Romania in order to prevent the flow of the trans-shipment virus from coming from it, now that Serbia's border is ready to help.
CBS News writer Charlie D'Agata reported that even the prisoners had been involved in the tendering of the final trade negotiations between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has come to the European Union with clear bottlenecks and crossings, many of which are refugees from Syria and other Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said that most of the people who have reached the age of life are non-combatants who have the right to seek security, and the view of other EU countries, as well as Germany's views, is different.
In Hungary, when the new law comes into force, it is a crime to exceed or damage four metres of the foothills, which the government has implemented to the southern border towards Serbia. The laws also identify the longer prisoners for convicted persons.
"Because of the situation of mass migration, the government announces a crisis in the country," reported the government's rapporteur Zoltan Kovacs to the publishers in the city of Szeged in the south of the country.
"We're building a strong line: the bordering of the law is a crime."
In practice, Parliament still has to accept military action expected the first week.
The Orban Internal Security Adviser, Gyorgy Bacondi, said that the authorities have taken over 45 levels of activity at the border immediately and 15 times longer.
As a result, people who have gone beyond the border are now under the control of the police, and they are charged with crimes on the basis of new laws.
Officials will be able to help you.
In addition, the Hungarian authorities closed two seven border crossings on Serbia's border. One border crossing site was closed through a border crossing.
Gaos ruled in the capital of Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened up a small metal count in a case where people packed into it.
About 20 were able to enter, but thousands remained outside.
The second transitional group supported a summit that unites Serbia and Hungary. People announced their presence in the dining room and Christmas until they were rescued in Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's leader Bernie Sanders's meeting with the national gallery
First Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton's support percentage is still a double-numbered national candidate for democracy. However, Senator Bernie Sanders has been deeply disappointed.
Clinton's support is now 47% of the voices of Democrats (less than 58%) when Sanders is seconded by 27% (up 17%).
The vice-president, Joe Biden, has not yet reported his possible departure to the Presidential Council, and his support for democracy is 15 per cent.
More than five months before the majority of democracies have been told that they support this proposal.
However, Clinton's supporters are more likely to choose from other candidates.
CBS News has lost the support of many democracies since the last month after the collapse of CBS News, while new supporters have joined the Sanders Army.
Clinton is still in charge of women and Malteses, but the leadership has been delayed.
Clinton's support in the middle of men has fallen significantly, and he only has five percent of the language for Sanders.
Clinton has lost his leadership in the middle of a 50-year-old democracy, and he is now at levels with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a clear position of interest among the parents.
In the last month, the benefits of Clinton's support in the liberal centre of Sanders' view were double, but now Sanders has taken five percentage points in Clinton's debt to this group.
About half of the Democrats report their support to Clinton in their opinion if he is elected as a candidate for the Party.
Fourthly, Clinton would support little money, and 15 percent would only support him because he's a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support Clinton.
It is not surprising that Clinton's current supporters would also be particularly enthusiastic supporters if he was elected as a candidate.
There is more confusion in the perspective of those who are not currently supported by Clinton. Only about four of them would actively support him.
48 per cent of the Democrats would be supported by Clinton, and only 35 per cent of the Republican voters would be actively supported by Donald Trumpi, a well-advised representative of the Republican people.
When Clinton's voters are asked to explain freely why they support his proposal, the recommended basis is Clinton's right experience (16%). Secondly, the answer is that it is time to choose a woman president (13%) and thirdly that Clinton is the best candidate (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention his contact with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
In addition, the joint views and opportunities are mentioned to overcome existing options.
The vice-president still has the potential to propose, and 57% of the Democrats would hope to leave the country as he did, and thirdly, he would be willing to leave the country.
When a candidate for a party is notified to the Democratic People's Republic of the Congo, most of them choose Biden.
Of Clinton’s supporters over the side of Biden, after Clinton, the second was the most popular and most popular Sanders.
If Biden does not go to the democratic petition, Hillary Clinton will increase its progress towards Sanders. With Sanders, there are 20 percentage points of interest, and it will grow to 30 percent if Sanders does not go to China.
55% of Democrats consider Clinton to be a candidate with the best chance of winning foreign elections. However, the share has been estimated at 78% in the last month.
The Biden in both is far from Clinton, but more than ever, he believes in Biden’s chances of winning his own choice.
However, Democrats consider views on the potential of the candidates in question to be more important.
The voters do not consider democratic candidates or potential candidates to be unacceptable.
The voters shall respect democratic proposals or possible proposals in accordance with the characteristics.
Most of them consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be real, reliable and leadership.
Bidenies are usually created as real, while Clinton is often considered to be the type of leader.
Of the Democrats, up to 30% don't think Clinton is honest and reliable, 15% for Sanders. 27% can't say if Sanders is real.
From the viewpoint of Democrats, the views of Clinton, Sanders and Biden are close to their own ideology.
There is no opinion on the nature of all the characteristics of Sanders.
When voters are asked about the use of Hillary Clinton’s personal e-mail and its services as Foreign Minister, most of the Democrats are told that they are pleased with Clinton’s explanation and that it has not changed the approach of these voters from Clinton.
The larger Americans are different.
Half of the Americans are dissatisfied with Clinton's solution, and only three are satisfied.
The nation’s opinions were divided in March, when the explanation had just become public.
Most Americans believe that the use of a negative e-mail has not affected their overall image of Clinton. 36 percent say that the mind has changed to a negative direction.
Of these 36 percent, six out of ten, are Republicans.
Although the voters on their part consider Clinton to be true and reliable, there is a risk of improving the views of all voters in these circumstances: Clinton only holds 32% as real and reliable, which is 8 percent less than last month and 15 percent less than May.
62% of all voters do not consider Clinton to be true and trustworthy.
On the other hand, 55 per cent of all voters throughout the country also do not consider Trump to be real and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump get good values of leadership.
On the sixth question involving the present proposal, Bidenia, Carsonia and Bush were considered more reliable.
Most people think Sanders is true, but as in Carson's case, many don't have the opinion of Sanders.
The answer is 351 votes, and the error margin is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson was arrested by Donald Trump on behalf of national support
According to CBS News and New York Time's latest support issue, Ben Carson has reached Donald Trumpi.
These two candidates were over half of the votes on the new issue and left the other candidates long behind.
In the centre of the country's Republican voters, Trumpil still has support. The support rate has risen before Fox News in the last month organized a claim of 23 per cent of the CBS's issue.
Carson's support, however, would slow down at the same time, by 6% to 23%.
According to the question, Carson has strong support in all groups of people, and in the high-school group, he's suddenly stalking Trump.
Other candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, are staying longer. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support is weak and has fallen by 10 percent in the last month to 2 percent now.
Florida's former Governor Jeb Bush, Arkansas's former Governor Mike Huckabee and Senator Marco Rubio were awarded 6 per cent of the third position.
The first margin of 376 Republican voters is 6 per cent to the other, and the question was made in September.
According to the latest issue published last week by CNN and ORC, Carson's support is rising, with 19% of the Republicans supporting it when Trump's support is 32%.
Also, in the latest issue of ABC News and Washington Post, Trump had a clear lead in front of Carson.
During the last week of the men's encounter, Trump filed inconceivable charges against the retired neurosurgery. However, Carson apologized for his misgivings about the Tromp's faith.
"We need energy," Trump called it last night in Iowa's campaign.
Five members of the department were charged with Baruch College's death.
Nearly two years ago, five people were murdered after the death of a student in the ritualized section of Pennsylvania Poconovuor.
Baruch College (City University of New York) Pi Delta Psin's members have been badly blamed for the rapes of Chun "Michael" Deng in September 2013. According to the policy, the department did not report Dengi to the hospital at times, which was considered to have an adverse effect on his death.
According to the authorities, the eyes of the victim had been attached, his eyes had been made up of nearly 15 kilograms full of apples, and his shirt had been used repeatedly while trying to reach a destination that had been placed on the other side of the lead.
The coin is first told of the headache and then lost consciousness.
According to the police, the members of the Pi Delta Psi department did not call the emergency number when Deng lost his mind. They are accused of waiting an hour before Deng's exit to the hospital.
Commissioner Chris Wabner told the press that the members, however, had to change Deng's clothes, take his symptoms and contact the president of the department, Andy Mengi.
"At this stage the members began to hide the instruments by putting the department's interests ahead of Michael Deng's health," Wagner said.
The case is not rehabilitated, and he died the next morning.
According to the Dead Sea Scroll, dengia had been cut several times over the head, the upper chamber, and the left side of the journey.
" Too many families have had to suffer from a breakdown of the department, as at least one student has died as a result of the merger since 1970", said author Douglas Fierberg in his opinion.
The departments and their members must be responsible for the important step taken by the authorities.
The High Commissioner of the Monroe Region presented five members of the department to be charged with the murder of a third-party.
In addition, the members of 32 departments receive charges of fraud and of criminal secrecy, including Meng.
"We want to be responsible not only for individuals, but also for the official or informal approval organisation," Wagner said in the press.
The Baruch College set up a department's mandate, and the national department was elected from the local department.
I saw the rise of the United States Central Bank (Fedin) peaks
The rise in prices and the rise in the market in share, the production of securities is rising and the economy is beginning to collapse.
We know that.
And we don't know how long it takes all the time and how long the effects will last.
Especially with regard to the economy, we find a history of timeliness.
The lama has reached its first peak in 11 months and has lasted up to 86 months.
The Central Bank is often aggressively proud, not always, and the critical factor is how the economy and financial resources react.
Therefore, the central bank officials have stressed very quickly that investors would not pay attention to the beginning of the rise of the peaks but to how long the normalization of the situation would take place.
There are a number of changes in this regard.
In the end, however, market operators may note that all haircuts related to the rise of the peaks may be excessive.
"The first rise of the Central Bank after the global financial crisis has undoubtedly been interpreted as often as bad money ending," Julian Jessop told the capital Economics chief of the global economy to customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect the slow normalization of the peaks to be almost low, which is a lot of fear of standing.
However, this does not mean that it would not have any effect.
The following historical examples of how the effects can be seen in different economic areas:
As seen in the market for about a month, the rise in peaks can increase uncertainty for some time.
When the waves finally rise, the effect is not so dramatic.
"The trend would appear to be the rise in capital surpluses in the first 12-24 months after the first rise, which is again reflected in the monetary policy, the Deutsche Bank's analysis of the short-term impact of the increase in peaks.
Over 35 years the market has generally seen a steady rise in peaks, about 14 per cent, almost the next 250 days (mean increase of 2.6 per cent), and 500 days later, the average peak output is 14.4 per cent, says Bob Doll, Nuveen Asset Manager's Chief Equity Strategy on Barron's page.
According to Deutschen, the impact on components is usually increased in a slightly later stage and the crop products begin to decrease.
It's true in the economy, but the rise of the peaks is generally due to it.
In this case, if the Central Bank is faced with conditions that were not in existence before and could speed up the calculation process.
A special point is that the gross profit is always the lowest in the Central Bank's leadership system.
According to Deutsche Bank, at the 118th anniversary of the year 1950, only two of the nominal value was less than 4.5 per cent.
Although the second quarter showed 3.6 per cent in 2015, many did not imagine it sustainable, and the third quarter was 1.5 per cent, says the Atlantic Regional Central Bank.
On the rise of the peaks in the economic situation, it may be at risk and may be asked whether this situation is different, Deutsche said.
On the market, operators have talked about the rise of the leadership team throughout the year, and they are also going to the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends in the autumn.
Many strategies and economies believe that while the Open Market Committee would approve the rise at this meeting, the Futurism trade would only show a 25% probability.
"In our research since 1950 all the rise cycles have been in a supercycle, which also has risen very quickly before the calculation of the BKT has begun to rise," says the report.
Breathing has been very slow compared to the worst form of cybercrime.
The cycle is clearly the length of which the Central Bank has been waiting for since last year. The accident has been 35 months, now it's gone for 74 months.
The value-added securities have also been miscellaneous in the interest of the markets, and the plan is also restored on the basis of capital.
"The obvious difference is that the effect is in crowd books faster than in shares when the central bank changes the rates.
In the case of group books, the product appears to change the direction immediately when the first growth/duty cycle is started.
At the end of the growth cycle, the products will be calculated immediately," Deutsche said.
The strategicists of Charles Schwabin believe that the corps will get long and short-term team lists to draw closer to each other and re-balance the journey.
"In such an environment, collective income is often better, even though we are still cautious about products," said Kathy Jones, an analyst in Schwabin's real estate securities.
It is interesting, according to Jones, that the market has already been adapted to the future of the Central Bank.
"In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and the adaptation of the fiscal policy to inflation," Jones says.
The short-term growth rates are rising, the production rate is high, the credit margin has increased and the volume has increased, and all have a typical market situation where the central bank is expanding policy.
Widely adopting companies operating mainly on the US market, benefiting from a high level of growth and local products starting to fall.
The views of indebted multinational companies are weak, as a strong dollar will bring their products to the world market and debt to the attention of the public.
"The history shows that quality measures are more productive in the next three months," Goldman Sachs' analyses point to customers.
The companies at which the level is strong started down by five percentage points after the 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital output and low volume shares have also improved their quality, average level 4 and, respectively, 3 percentage points.
"The brother is a big question.
Companies that have a significant share of variable debt lose most," Goldman said.
In general, consumers outside the market are benefiting from the strengthening of the dollar.
Savers also benefit from higher production, and experts are very special about how fast the effects appear.
Parliamentary Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 on Classic FM
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticized the mass popularization of radio stations.
According to Bingham, the canal is now difficult to distinguish from its commercial competitor.
BBC Music Awards is also responsible for copying only a copy of the Brits Gaal.
Parliamentary Damien Collins, on behalf of The Voice, is accusing the lack of identity.
According to the noted parliamentary government, BBC Radio 3 is gradually becoming a copy of the Classic FM channel.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told BBC that the radio station has become too popular and can no longer distinguish itself from its commercial competitor.
"I don't want to talk about popularization, but Radio 3 feels like a change in the direction of the Classic FM channel," Bingham said.
Also, the BBC Music Awards, organized last December, will receive criticism from Bingham in part:
"Last year's BBC Music Awards for the first time affect a copy of the British football field.
These two are examples of the fact that instead of new and different, only what is already on the market," Bingham says.
The president of the BBC rejected the charges and admitted that BBC Radio 3 offers a significantly higher content of live music and choice of content.
"Radio 3: I learned classical music from what I can't learn from other channels.
The Canadian commitment to live music and to make music is exactly his own class.
I also consider it important that Radio 3 is also committed to looking for new music and new works," said the president.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3's leader Alan Davey said that the position must be more important than the public's interest, because the British know more about classical music than ever before.
However, Radio 3 is not the only hard-to-do review of commercial channels, which was part of the BBC channel, with a limited cultural, media and sports committee.
Parliamentary Damien Collins of the Tory Party assessed The Voice, which the BBC purchased from Dutch producer Talpa Media. The price of trade is estimated at 22 million pounds.
"The programme will not be discussed just because it is not unique or very different."
According to Lord Hall, the program presented by BBC1, which is the highlight of Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced in a typical way to BBC.
In addition, Collins called for the company to seek the company's own rent when it next launchs a new winter season.
However, Collins did not agree to close down the fact that The Voice would continue to exist or that the taxpayers' money would be used in other forms of winding up.
The growth of the network trade in all ages in August – due to the black economy
In the first month of 2015, online sales increased by seven percent.
The sales of the network market have been estimated since 2000. In recent months, growth has been a major part of all times.
The online trade was confirmed three years ago by mobileization.
Experts believe that in November, your family can stop shopping.
More than ten years have passed since the government of the network trade had granted many British purchases.
According to experts, references to net sales are being made and new sales terms show only seven per cent increase during the first three months of 2015.
In August, the growth in total sales was strong all the time, when the sales of the net sales had been recorded since 2000. In recent years, the net sales increased by only five percent.
According to experts, references to net sales are being made and new sales terms show only seven per cent increase during the first three months of 2015.
"When compared to last year's growth to the 2000 readings, it is clear that growth will be achieved over time," IMARG’s chief executive, Andy Mulcahy, told Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, online sales increased three years ago when consumers paid for mobile phones.
"It was also increasingly able to buy from the network, and it was possible for many to buy in different environments, even if at home.
When mobileization is more low, growth can be restored."
A black family from America is a phenomenon that is considered one reason for slowing down growth.
According to the experts, the day of the last Friday of November may allow consumers to break the purchase decision before the black holidays.
In the last year, the number of network users compared to normal has been lost in many trading sites.
Experts believe that a black family that gets consumers to be affected by offers can stop shopping during other times.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, every five points were consumed online.
Some products, such as television and swimming pools, are purchased from online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and dress from the network instead of bought-in forms.
In Mekas, the victims are buried under the responsibility of the Bin Laden family
The Muslims placed 29 corpses on the streets when the first funerals were held in Mexico.
According to Saudi Arabia, the expansion of the Saudi Binladin Group is partly a result of accidents.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were injured after losing their livelihood.
The bodies were held in high air when the Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims of the attack on the Great Mekka.
A group of white-headed people were gathered on the streets to leave their best victims on their last trip to the burial site of Al-Moaissem.
On the way to the sanctuary, where the lost structure was only a day when the mosque’s roof fell over the Muslims.
The king of Saudi Arabia demanded that Bin Laden’s family be removed from the responsibility for an accident, which also cost 394 people.
In the absence of an invasion of the Great Mekka, 29 victims were transported on the streets.
There was Qasim Akram, a native of the Grand-Manchester Bolton, who had traveled to the first shrine in Mecca.
Akram had been in Great Britain with his parents, who had started their annual pilgrimage.
The authorities of Saudi Arabia have promised that the hahj-sanction will be organized when thousands of people arrive at the best for the city's sacred rejection.
According to King Salman, the Binladin Group would not have been able to leave the nostrile tree on the ground when no no nostril was used.
According to the Arabic press report, Binladin Group is involved in an accident.
However, according to the English press report, the management of the group has been prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what led to the destruction of the nostril at the site of the Great Mosquito.
The Binladin Group has not published a report on non-posting deficiencies, nor have representatives of the Group been targeted for the opinion.
The king also accused the Group of failing to comply with the modern security rules and working with meteorologists.
The two visitors surrounded the Mekka Great Lakes as part of the remaining building project of Binladin Group.
The Bin Laden family has been closely associated with the Saudi Arabia family for decades, and the Bin Ladens have responded to many important construction projects.
The former leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a loopio boy whose family had abandoned in the 1990s.
The lack of innovation in the marketplace and in severe wind occurred just a few days before the repression of Mecca, which is the duty of every able Muslim to do at least once during life.
According to the authorities, 158 people are still in hospital care.
The authorities decided to pay a million rent (EUR 250 000) to victims' owners and permanent displaced persons.
Other victims of an accident will receive half of the compensation.
According to B&Q, there is a poor job in Eastern Europe
Brits pay house officials more than ever before, says Veronique Lauriy.
The recommendations have increased the skills available from Eastern Europe, professional workers.
More than 200 new, designed for workers, the Screwfix store will be opened.
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q miles across the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, Editor, Daily Mail
Britain is said to move home-to-home and land-to-peer routes to producers arriving from Eastern Europe.
The leftovers and landings seem to be very rare.
Brits are still paying more and more home officials to care for household nestings, says the manager of the company based on B&Q.
Veronique Lauri is a new delivery director in Kingsfisher, who owns the sale of household repairs. According to Lauren, there are professional workers from Eastern Europe who offer services at a price.
As a result of the discovery, Kingfisher is going to open 200 new, dedicated Screwfix store for business operators. The same 60 B&Q store is closed.
Laurie needs more female farmers in the B&Q mines, since she is a woman with eight ten purchase decisions on the sale.
At present, most of the staff are men.
According to Lauren, there is a need to pay attention to public events, as today there is also a growing number of single women who are doing their homework.
"Our personality is still the largest part of men," says Laurie.
"We must balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80 percent of the product purchase decisions are made by a woman.
Women have a significant role to play in the decision-making process."
Laurie is one of five women who are behind the company's FTSE 100 index, and she has also reorganised the company's leadership group so that both men and women are equal.
Kingfisher is almost the only quality because 50 per cent of its staff are women, including the delivery director and the financial director.
"This was a known decision, and the majority is important to us," said Lauri.
"It has not been difficult to find good women in the leadership group."
In the course of the year, the kingfisher's business and sales volumes have been calculated, although the company has done more hard work after the sales stopped.
Kingfisher responds to current trends: the company owns Screwfix and B&Q cookies and intends to open 200 new stores.
The three governments soon decided to secure the proposed legislation in order to save the economy of the country.
The effects that we've seen have also been achieved soon.
The decision taken by the SAK and other employers' organisations began to impose the same way and therefore the country stands at noon because of the broad opinion of the workers.
There is also reason for many of them to think.
Let's ask you if you'll be able to support the bill when it's going to be bad.
It's even built counterattacks.
More than 50,000 people on the Internet have already reported that they are not going to participate in the media, but they are going to work.
That would have been impossible in the old age of consensus.
Of course, there was no net where to protest, but openly declaring a criminal would have been a small person's political suicide.
Millions of professional organizations have little interest in the protest of a few tens of thousands of people, but it is a matter of thought.
The position of the trade union is no longer as clear as it was a year ago.
Not all are aware of the mobility goals, values have changed
The solutions to the government's interest in the operation of the Ay can also be seen as a direct gift to the sky.
When things have been going on for years, it is now late in the alliances that the rights of workers are protected, visible and well.
In this way, the government may wish to take over the role of the ay movement when the membership of the professional community is seen to be more important than earlier.
There are organisations doing whatever they like, so it is necessary that the opinion of Finland will be something to stop in the past.
Yes, Finland's stopped for a while ago.
For example, industrial production has been estimated 31 months ago.
Gross income continues to decrease, and unemployment is rising.
You think these things will force everyone's head.
Heavy stock exchange at the University of Lepidenska: 8.5 million savings, personnel reduced by 130
The Technical University of the Children's Bank shall start the life cycle with a total cost of €8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will launch the total staff consultation of 6.5 million each year.
In practice, it means reducing about 130 workers.
Another operation is to save two million more.
At the end of the YT negotiations, the 2016 budget is expected to fall by 8.5 million under way.
This will also affect the government's settlement procedures.
In this account, the university is making about 2.6 million underscoring.
The costs will increase slightly for the first year, but the same amount from the ministry will be reduced by 2 million and another budget by 3.2 million euros.
The total university budget is about EUR 85 million, so the target is 10% of the total budget.
The impact of cuts in mass education and research and the reduced impact of corporate funding on our university level is very important, says Dr. Anneli Pauli in his report.
Before long, the effects of cuts were even more marginal, but now the reduction in supplementary funding appears in new dimensions.
Negotiations with trustees shall be initiated in the first week of the week and shall continue in the law within six weeks.
More: Onnibus wants to ride to Finland
The Dutch bus company Onnibus's owner, British Sir Brian Souter tells Yle that the company is also referring to rail transport in Finland.
I'm very interested in going to the Finnish railway transport.
My Stageceach company is one of Britain's largest railway companies, Souter tells us.
The transport of bicycles shall be open to competition from time to time.
The first is the traffic of the capital city in the year 2017-2018.
After the traffic, you've got your truck on the hill.
Souter tells you he's already approached the Ministry of Transport.
The Ministry of Transport considers the plans of Onnibus to be welcome, according to Ylen.
Other international companies have reported their interest in rail transport, at least in Transdev (formerly Veolia), which has an age of bus transport in Finland and rail transport in other European countries.
In the United States, the Central Bank has taken over the time of the infringement.
The entire world follows the United States Central Bank meeting on Wednesday and Thursday, where it is decided that the peaks could be raised for the first time in almost ten years.
In the last week, half of the economics that believed in the central bank's peaks are now declining by 0 to 0.25 per cent in the current central bank's current high level. This is shown by Reuters's 80 economic analysts.
"This is a historic situation, because the Central Bank has been holding the crown for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a significant central bank can rise from zero to zero and thus start a normalization of peak levels," said researcher Angel Ubide, Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The economic situation in the United States has been relatively good, and survival has brought to a level of billions of additional dollars and has accelerated only a small amount of inflation.
However, the Central Bank cannot ignore the global situation, which is not the same as that of the Russians.
It has called on markets to save for change, but also references to the opposite are obvious.
The decision is to be published in Torston at 20.00 a.m. in Central Europe.
Delta State University shooter left the application card
After his girlfriend was shot in Mississippi on Monday morning — before a colleague shot at the same day — Shannon Lamb wrote a message that he apologized for his first murder and hoped that he could recover it, the authorities told him frankly.
At the University of Delta State, Mississipp called the emergency number about 10 o'clock in the morning
And she told him about her shooting man.
Lamb asked the police to come home in the morning.
He also said that there was a friendly dog in the house, which is not sad for anyone but which is probably scared.
The police asked for the name of the caller, but the man didn't tell me.
The Lamb also did not tell the motive for shooting.
The police arrived at the scene and found Amy Prentiss, 41, in the body and Lambi's hand, a message that read: "I'm very sorry and I hope I can undo my actions.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After I wrote a letter, Lamb walked 500 miles to Delta State University, where he killed his historian Professor Ethan Schmidt before he killed himself the following day when the police tried to kill him.
Director of the University, William LaForge, said there was no information about the differences between Lambi and Schmidt, but he realized that Lambia was clearly in trouble.
On Monday it was reported that Lamb was likely to believe that the Prentiss was also in a romantic relationship with Schmidt, but the authorities said that there was no information or evidence from the three-year-olds.
In the seven-year marriage with Prentiss, Shawn O'Stepe was created to be a good man for his wife.
The Parisian community had separated 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who had a stroke.
According to the man, the daughter and mother were best friends.
According to Sun Herald, a close friend of Prentissy, Lindsay Knowles, told him that Prentiss was working online at all.
Knowles admitted that Prentiss had been dating Lambi for three years, and she also told me about a woman's dog named Lighting.
"He always wanted to help others," said Knowles.
According to the police, Lamb had called his relatives during the day and told them he wasn't going to go to jail.
When the police aimed at Lambin Highway 1: near Greenville the same night, Lamb stopped the car, packed the train, went to the forest, and poured himself into the air.
According to the university's mailing list, Lamb received a doctorate's degree in growth data at Delta State University in May 2015.
Hemmentic timers
In recent years, there have been heavy samples (on the left side of his son Redmond).
In 2001 he fought a leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett lost his appetite.
The sampler has also competed with drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for the use of drugs.
Everything's happened has really required their tax.
Manchester United Luke Shaw's page for two months because of a divorce
Luke Shaw's right foot was crushed by Manchester United Masters in an act against PSV Eindhoven.
The defendant has to stay on the site for at least half a year, but Louis van Gaal is still desperate and believes that Shaw will return to the countryside this far.
Twenty-year-old Shaw was shot at the PSV defense area at Héctor Moren's bad castle when he was in play for five minutes.
Shaw got an espresso in the field for nine minutes and needed diabetes before she could move to the hospital.
"Shaw's got two broken legs, and he's in the hospital," Van Gaal said.
Shaw's moving to Manchester tomorrow or tomorrow.
A 18-year-old young man associated with the Manchester United River has experienced severe and is now hit after great games.
They gave Shaw a glass in their pockets.
A man waits.
I'm not a doctor, but when the foot breaks off from two points, she's on the side for half a month and she's not playing at a reading stage anymore.
I hope he can play this far.
Moreno was able to get down a little when he didn't follow a red card of punishment.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli is not a famous Mexican player.
Van Gaal says the Italian Chamber made a mistake.
"You can decide for yourself, but I think the situation was worth the punishment and the red card.
There was a two-way maintenance office."
Shaw tweeted: "Thanks to all of your messages. I can't describe how confused I am. I'm going to start with this, and I'm going to be stronger."

The defence of England has a special reason to take action to be called in France at the European Championships to be held in June.
"This is very bad gossip," said the PSV manufacturer.
"In such cases, all parties are always very sorry.
The aim of the players is never to harm the opponent."
Moreno broke his leg while playing in the Gulf of Mexico in the Van Gaal, the Netherlands, against the 2014 World War I contest.
"He's very sorry, because his purpose was not to harm the opponent. It's bad to hear that you're pregnant," Cocu said.
"I didn't see the situation.
I saw only a ball that was going to the other direction, so it seemed that he (Moreno) was about the ball, but I didn't see Luke's office."
"I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be," Moreno said to the SBS6 channel.
"I'm so sorry."
Andrés Guardado was also transferred to the hospital after an accident involving Chris Smalling.
David Cameron should know Lorax better.
Every parent will notice before the child learns his favorite book outside the door.
Except you saw David Cameron.
When the child welfare organization asked Cameron to name the children’s books, Prime Minister Lorax, published in 1971 by Dr. Seuss, was elected to teach the environment.
In a text published on the SuperCamp website, Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. "The story is fun, fun and creative, and it has a powerful message. I like to read it to my children, because there is always a picture or message that we have never seen before."
It sounds good, except that the following point, where Cameron is meant to draw the book again, is the 2012 film version title system, which will add new characters and details to complement the short start text.
"In Tarville City, where the right trees and plants have been destroyed and even the weather is commercial, there is a boy named Ted who wants to escape his dream in the heart of Audrey by performing this greatest dream: to see the right tree," the text tells us. In 1991, Dr. Seussin, or Theodor Seuss Geesel, was not the subject of the admiration.
If this is not yet necessary, Cameron's text is part of the original system of Lorax on the website of the Internet Movie Database. It begins as follows: "In the city of Tarville, where everything is practical and even without the need for trade, a boy named Ted who wants to get his daughter out of Audrey's heart."
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that a book would have been so close to him. Without Kerskane would destroy the trees and make them necessary despite Lorax's opposition. Lorax is small and weak, a weekly creature that protects the forest.
Likely like this, a small p-temperature is believed to be an assistant, evidently for someone who has not read Loraxia 20 times in the bottle.
The representative of the Prime Minister said that the text was probably from Cameroon's election office.
SuperCamps did not comment on this more accurately but confirmed that the text was the manual of Cameron's staff.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being out of England's army, but it's still rare.
Meeting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a challenge, but we will see that the final 3-0 series of tests will not be expected to be repeated.
I wouldn't close the possibility of a guest party.
The Netherlands Cook may be less experienced than a three-year team, but the team has good players and the team's position is strong – they have no bad experiences since 2012, only a young position.
As a ball player, Moeen Ali develops as a spinster, and Adil Rashid, although he has no test level experience, represents an attack option.
Subject: Adam Lyth missing from the English Test Group and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth away is obviously difficult for me to understand as his prime minister in Yorkshire.
His seven Tests have been two good attacks in challenging circumstances, and the simple and bold fact is that the Greek players are evaluated according to results.
For example, Joe Root is not a matter of choice because – as I said before – players are the best choices.
A few 50-point action should have been taken in Lythin's group, but his fate was in his own hands.
Hopefully, he'll get a new chance when he hits Yorkshire for more courses.
The English Prime Minister Trevor Bayliss called for his installation also when he didn't do as well as he could, which doesn't surprise me, he's first of all a team player.
The question of how long the tests will have an opportunity to affect them is difficult.
Lyth received seven landslides – like his predecessor Sam Robson – when Nick Compton was nine again.
Only Compton got a chance at home and a visit.
The only cause of the complaint may have been that England used Jonathan Trottia first in the Caribbean — when Lyth was in the summit — but this last opportunity is now history.
Alex Halles comes to the team, and he's the cuts I value at the top.
He's an unknown performer's cricket player, which we saw in Yorkshire earlier this time when he made 236 points against us at Trent Bridge.
He is pleased to have at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but of course this depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates.
The idea is that Moe will start with Cook in the winter year, where you will get an extra round game when you hold four long-distance players, and I'm not against that idea.
I don't see a ban on the fact that the jumper could be in the middle of this, and this left player has already shown himself to be a great cricket player.
Many may not have had much in the local team in Worcestershire, but he has been a threesome player in the team, and it's not a big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played the first 38 test career as the first substitute player before he got started in 2001.
He just made three hundred points, and he didn't come back.
Zafar Ansari is in the group as a stock exchanger, and on the basis of what I have seen from him, he has proved to be a very influential young man.
People can see his statistics – at average 31 points as short and as 35 points – and this can be a search engine, but too many drivers have not shown themselves ready, and voters have decided to take the young player.
He learned a lot during this adventure.
With the team outside the game, England is influenced by a couple of smart choices made by its preparatory staff.
The appointment of Sri Lankar Mahela Jayawarden, as the consultant for the Tests may be a transitional.
This is one of the most powerful men who have had a lot of experience because he has played in all kinds of circumstances and all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood will come to the part of the pillar of the white ball and will include both energy and lovelessness.
I think he has always been influenced by an appropriate international cricket, whether he is a player or a producer, and in the way of Mahela, he has the advantage of intelligence.
Sometimes a new voice in the living room, even if it said the same as before, can be a hilarious voice.
Collyn's teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has been released one day, Root has been given the same opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Although not all agree, manufacturers and voters do not determine the reception schedule.
And it must be borne in mind that the way players do their jobs depends on the results.
These decisions will never be ignored.
Brexit’s sword can win if the economy is in bad condition in 2017
David Cameron's party left a renegotiation strategy for the continuation of the British negotiations in the EU, there is a day in the heart of the day, even without Jeremy's consent "yes or not" Corbynia's choice of the working party or of the TUC in the fight against Europe.
Other countries have their own Corbins and Nigel Faragens.
The European diplomat recently explained how many of the EU's crises have come to an end – although not all of them are their own. Some of the Member States have failed to adopt the British agenda, which includes the amendments to the Treaty which they do not even wish to make.
At the annual TUC conference in Brighton, it was concluded that they would not interfere in the EU if they were concerned about social security.
We could call it even Dave and George's suicide agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Deputy Secretary of State will welcome meetings and bilateral negotiations in the capital cities of various countries, take pictures of themselves in front of a famous monument, with or without high-value personnel, return home and repeat their purchases for joint reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to be in the EU, is in the UK. "Don't leave us alone with France," Berlin says, and proposes that the more shortcoming minister and official in various capital cities has come to the point that we are no longer concerned, whether we are staying or leaving.
Angela Merkel, a German-considered expert, has been active for ten years, and wants to leave the office before it breaks up, as happened to those who went too far: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
In France François Holland, France has a re-election or a subsequent election in 2017.
He's also in power.
On the other hand, there may soon be a nationalist administration, a left-hand administration in Spain.
It is difficult to imagine them in the struggle to help self-sustainers who could use their energy better to try to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom. They do not want it either, because most of them have separatist events.
Some of these ministers may wish to draw up useful comments on the type of national part of Scotland at the 2017 United Kingdom National Election Campaign, which is intended to involve Brexit's processes, to propose my friend.
"The renegotiation negotiations were organized." "The British had nothing to do with the renegotiation negotiations."
The Europeans know how the British Federation will be united and how the EU's oligarck union will be, just as Tony Benn's national vote in 1975, resulting in the accession of 2:1 to the EU in 1973.
One of the points reminds us of Boris Johnson, an influential Europorter who came to be known as the "our direct exchange of letters from the European Union" in Brussels at the beginning of the 90th century.
Ed Miliband knew at least his enemies.
They include taxes, mobile hackers and visual-days, which are mainly owned by our dictionary.
In fact, Tony Blair thought a lot of the same thing about them, but he realized that when he's in trouble with the mountain gorilla, he's got to turn bananas into a mess so that the gorilla wouldn't eat you both for lunch and daily.
Miliband was the most liberal of Blair's opposition to the national vote, and Blair gave it to the EU institutions that were then rejected, when France and the Netherlands rejected the agreement in 2005 as a national vote, Blair arrived at a very high level.
I've never given it to him for forgiveness.
But nice Jeremy Corbyn, who's lying to me in a friendly way in the Westminster country. I told him he doesn't have time to hurt me anymore. It could be dangerous that he's taking the use of Neil Kinnock's 80-year-old media boot strategy.
Time can be spent, but Corbyn needs to develop a coherent strategy for matching the media, not with me, but with Andrew Marrin, who sat on the BBC table for the sun.
The official position of Corbyin on Europe is what we call the implementation process.
He says he wants to keep us reformed in the EU.
Most people outside Ukip and Tory are likely to respond positively to this.
That's when Hillary "Benn but Benniitt" told Ben on radio and on television this week, when his inner party boy tried to be reluctant to admit that Corbin had a bad reputation for calling Karske John McDonnell as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
It reminded me of the 70th century, when her old father was having difficulties in being on TV with an unintelligent labour fellows who went too far and lost their place in the basement.
Hillary's difficulties were more interesting.
Benn said he was responsible for leaving the EU under "all conditions." McDonnel didn't say so, nor did he speak to Corby's colleagues and members on Monday morning.
I would like Corby to take care of how beautiful any image he has to remember that he even touched me. The message box is important at 24/7, especially in social media theft, where paranoia and fraud are involved.
Cameron does not need to give the EU a free passport, which he might consider to be the support of Labour in his own national vote, as McDonnell has said.
Simon Jenkins has at least this opinion.
McDonnelly and Corbyn's equality of EU membership was agreed to be linked to the anti-capitalisation of the island economy and capitalism.
There has also been an evictation of Naton. Tom Watson is not reasonable that Corby has not campaigned for his departure. Foreign diplomats must try to explain the matter to their families.
Why should Paris or Berlin be deprived of political capital?
The United States has already broken nearly the laws of the British military service in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in the early stages of the Tory administration. I was reminded of this on the ground of the British Influence Security Forum.
The experts criticised British opinions on electricity generation
According to researchers, the State-funded institution’s claim that the burning of electricity is 95 per cent less dangerous than traditional smoking was created at a meeting involving 12 participants in the tobacco industry.
The experts criticized the evidence presented in the report of public health services in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and Lancet Medical Journal.
PHE described the last month's report as "for conversion and comprehensive review of results".
However, many researchers have questioned the safety of the data and have raised the links of some experts to the tobacco industry.
Lancet Medical Journal wrote that last month the teeth were taken with a "smartly cheap foundation", which is the most important conclusion of the PHE.
In addition, two researchers have argued in the BMJ whether the claims are based on "square or low".
Professors Martin McKee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine of the European Public Health Care, and Professor Simon Capewell of Liverpool University of Clinical Epidemiology, have testified: "The fundamental principle of public health care is that the principles of action are based on their impact on a clear example."
According to McKeen and Capewell, a large public opinion is that the PHE’s claim that "the best estimate of energy savings is about 95% less harmful than traditional savings" should be based on a detailed analysis and sampling of research results.
The power of a 12-person meeting, which was invited to work for the development of a model based on multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), was intended to bring together the views of participants on the diseases of nicotine products. The results were compiled for research.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the supporters of the meeting included EuroSwiss Health, which was funded by British American Tobacco (BAT) through the previous independent study of the supplier's research.
In addition, the Executive Director has shown its support for the activities of the BAT in its sustainable activity report.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting, however, had not been granted by Philip Morris International, the former co-financed tobacco company.
However, there are a number of known sponsors of the panel's selection criteria, which are part of their participation as a financial provider of industry.
However, some participants are not aware of their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting was also attended by the PHE smoking programme.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the Group's research report shows that it is not surprising that there is a wide range of products and compliance with their criteria.
However, shortcomings or deficiencies are not mentioned in the PHE report.
According to the report of the PHE, there has been no indication that electronic devices can promote the smoking of children or non-smoking. McKee and Capewell are considered to be early.
According to Professor Kevin Fenton, the answer was given earlier on the health and well-being of the PHE.
According to Fentonin, electrical shocks are significantly less harmful than traditional smoking.
Any other people who smoke through life will die because of smoking addiction.
All the evidence indicates that the health risks of electronic devices are lower than the risks of conventional smoking. However, the long-term effects need to be examined more closely.
PHE is responsible for informing citizens what the appearance shows and what it does not show, especially in a situation where the relative risks to traditional tobacco are comparable.
In the United Kingdom, there are about 80,000 deaths per year associated with smoking, and smoking causes two billion deaths per year to the public health care.
The responsible action requires that we clearly present a current phenomenon, which does not provide an alternative to the risk, but its causes are part of the disease of traditional smoking.
BBC should be released from East Enders, says Channel 4
According to the East Enders and The Voice, according to Johnson, commercial competitors would give their right hand of emergency restrictions, such as Albert Square, from the BBC.
According to Johnson, licence payments should be used only for programs that other television stations do not.
He was likely critical of the fact that the BBC is less likely to present programmes that are available to the public at the same time with large-scale programme of competitors, as well as with the BBC4 channel.
When BBC president Tony Hall had announced that the company wanted to cooperate with other organisations, Johnson said that he had been trying to get Channel 4 to work with BBC for six years.
"I don't think it is the same idea that BBC buys formats and sends programs that were clearly part of a competitive channel program," Johnson told Parliament's high-level communications committee, which explained the future of the BBC.
If BBC wants to maintain a general radio tax which I do not think is necessary for a medium or long-term good idea, it should be accompanied by at least programmes that are not other producers and purchasers.
BBC will send The Voice at the best time because it wants as wide as possible support for the future as possible.
If no other channel cares about the program, it's obviously a funnel.
"I don't understand why a regressive tax should finance programs that could be financed without support," Johnson said.
The Voice is one of these, EastEnders one, even though it's its own production.
A lot of channels would give you the right hand of it.
I don't understand how this serves the services of the general radio company.
I don't think these would be a loss to BBC."
Johnson is a serialist who was led by Channel 4: 2004–2010. He believes that BBC is losing good eyesight because it works in a company with respectable people and because they believe it is the best way to secure long-term support.
Johnson's comments on the BBC's most popular series are similar to the previous Sky-Pomon Tony Ballin, who proposed MacTaggart in 2003, that BBC sells out of such ranges as East Enders.
According to Johnson, the programmes for the BBC network are shown in the BBC4 channel, where viewers can't usually measure, but the programs fulfill their purpose. "BBC can say in defense of the tekopy with its mission by making four billion-billion-dollar radios for special programs that no one has ever seen."
"BBC will present them at a time when no one will ever see them."
Johnson said: "I would ask you to look for another old system in the view of who will benefit the best.
Of course, everyone thinks 150 points a year is a good one, but the people for whom it's a big sum, especially if the BBC doesn't just look at it."
Former Sky and Channel 5 Canadian leader David Elstein, who also shared his views on the Committee's papers, noted that BBC should change its old mission to new "information, learning and delay".
According to Elstein, the current BBC offer includes educational programs – 1 percent on television and 0.1 percent on radio. He adds that BBC should learn about Australian and Canadian public radio companies and pray to the new faith: "Information, light and late".
Elstein suggests that BBC could add copies of events, such as the Proms Festival, which was sent to concerts only last year. "The BBC should also be connected to the subsidized commercial channels so that the entire supply is also available on the network," he continues.
The brain cells can be controlled by sound signals using sonic genetics
The video shows how non-interruptible changes in their direction when they are placed on the surface.
The researchers have raised tumors that are genetically modified by the nervous system, which can be controlled by ultrasound.
The small angles change their direction when they are placed above the surface of the human ear.
The complainants were active in commercial movements that are genetically modified by the fact that they have a transport curve that reacts to their ultrasounds.
More on: Researchers are following brain activity by means of light
According to researchers, a new method of sound genetics (dubbes sonogenetics) was used to demonstrate the activity of the brain, the heart and the body.
Salk Institute researcher Sreekanth Chalasani, located in California, La Jolla, told Guardian that one day the method can be replaced by brain stimulation (DBS). DBS treatment is an invasive method to be used in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, where brains are stimulated by electrical impulses.
The mussels don't normally react to their ultrasound. I notice, however, that the bees are beginning to react when they are placed in a nest with a microscopic little hole.
According to Chalasan, the cubes force ultrasounds that advance into the eyes.
The confirmed ultrasounds affect TRP4 ionicaves, which are part of the cell cells of the muscles.
According to the article published in Nature Communications, the speakers will be able to open and activate the cells in which they are attached.
In order to guide the inconsistencies through the outer layer of Chalasa mutated the eyes genetically by the presence of TRP4 ionicaans from their traffic-leading hermites.
When turned over the surface, the microscopes strengthened the sound waves and moved to the muscles, where the signal passed through the brain.
The procedure reminds us of a bit of optogenetics, which is a remarkable tool that researchers can activate by means of light.
According to Chalasan, however, there are certain advantages compared to the optogenetics.
The light is directed to the brains of the research. The ultrasounds, rather than passing through the cell easily, can guide the ultrasound through the brains.
"We believe that with the help of gene therapy and virus treatment, human hermoses can be temporarily elevated to ultrasound signals in certain neurological treatments in the clinical environment," said Chalasana.
According to the study, the method could also be used in muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Non-smokers — Your Home Member!
The commercials are ashamed of the British arms trade
Look at Amnesty International's armed mess video.
The cruel killers!
There's no fucking bikes!
We're going to fire!
Avoidances that cause unsatisfied pain but do not leave behind!
The video is Amnesty International produced by Amnesty International, and its aim is to highlight the British administration's attempt to sell weapons to the security and defence agencies of the DSEI (Defence Security and Equipment International), which is organized at the ExCel department in London Dockland.

The bus stops and the subways are also blocked by newspapers that require a different look.
"Good notification: is it moving on the subway 15-18.9?" The announcement reminds you of London Metro announcements. On the other side of the subway there is also a picture of tankers.
"In September, a group of armed men arrive at Docklands. Customers are asked for help so that the seats can be stopped."
Three-thirds of the newspapers have been made by artists whose work was being carried out at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Design.
A group called Special Patrol Group assisted in the distribution of newspapers around London with a six-point value of "affiliation hacker package", which, according to the claim, has six-cool times reached the third world bus station list.
Transport for London is not commercial.
One of the Special Patrol Group's collections.
According to the curator of Cruel Designs and Professor Gavin Grindon of the University of Essex, artists have begun to question matters and want to bring political work to the public to see the gallery outside.
Artists have noted that the social impact of art requires that art be brought to the top of the world, and many move to work with protest movement activists.
Another of the advertising against arms is welcomed by users of public transport in the subway.
Amnesty's video has been viewed through Facebook more than 100,000 times a month. It has been designed without compensation by VCCP, as well as graphic designers and stories have also done their work without compensation.
VCCP's artistic director Matt Lever drew away from the exhibition hall and emptyed the location in the ExCeL's event calendar. He thought, "I'm going to give them campaigns that they're trying to avoid."
They tried to reduce the reality of a cheap business video, but church colors and animation raise their attention better."
"They have done a great job and have helped us to raise the weeds in which the plant is being used for commercial purposes," says Amnesty Tom Davies.
"Now the government must take action and ensure that the equipment is not sold illegally in our own country."
However, in ExCeLis, the setting-up of the positioning fields is shown in the sample tables where the sample holders use empty circuits for commercial purposes.
In its press release, the United States reported on the situation of an army with regard to the "favourable AT4CS RS".
The product consists of a "specially-designed battle line that is effectively aligned to the target."
It doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Students in Students' Housing
11 years ago, I was a 19-year-old boy and still believed in barrets and moral relativism. Now I remember the violent smiles I felt, and endless, long complaints from others.
The most important lessons can be clarified by eight simple rules.
The change in the dwelling area must be the most difficult experience and the most relaxing.
In the situation, it's easy to start with the years: you tell everyone you are, do you like the middle year and why you like Corbyni and why not "it's really angry or loving Marmite, because it's just snowy, wet, I'm in my room".
Take your life between you and me.
And help others to breathe: show your interest and ask for other things.
Asking questions leads to discussion and helps you to find people you like and people you wouldn't even talk to when you were in a miracle, and these people would share the puzzles.
Let me give you some more room.
Their rooms often operate as a semi-trailer, movie theater and a general living room, but their own room is also a place where they are painted from materials.
More on the subject: Don't even imagine your partner’s follow-up and university education
The University of Introverts is a difficult place
However, in many residential areas there is a social culture that prevents the room from falling apart and creates lifelong friendships.
Such a culture can be a stressist to a person who needs a place of return.
In this environment, there is no way to say, "I want to keep on with you and our friendship, but I want you to lose, so that I can get back to the energy I used to monitor with you."
Try to find out if any of your students have gone back to socializing with you. Kentes would be happy to be free to go to the door and send the texter instead.
I mean, I'm going to get it. I'm going to get it.
In my own student residence there was a type, which, from the point of view, did not mean that he was healthy inside.
He saw all kinds of things.
Get your friends with the tape.
You start the teaching properly when smoking is in, so if you have a brownie and you dig into a door to influence the 50th-century, a little strange in case: "Come to the neighborhood, I'll find you something small.
Housekeepers are a great way to get new friends.
Your student blood is required to talk to you, and because of your surprise, they may be able to have a positive picture of you.
This, of course, requires you to have reasonable explanations.
If you offer unsatisfied sugar, sugar, and fat-sparing pastries, others probably make their sleep when you go to the door.
Feeding is also a common problem in student housing.
Of course, taking another way out is stealing, but is it possible to hide a treasure from someone else in the country?
Always make sure of the owner of the farm.
You'll probably get a license, even if the loan of the country is the owner of the job.
However, try to handle your situation as maturely as possible — unlike your own study class, which has produced your pet food as a punishment for dairy products.
She's in jail now.
Don't be mad when others try to sleep or touch.
Not only because it's reasonable, but also because it's encouraging to remember that anyone who's dying...
In my own apartment, one girl asked a neighbor’s room to set up music for a smaller volume, since it was three in the morning, and she had a tent in the morning.
You're only about to add volume.
When I was late in the neighboring room, the girl gave a neighbor's bed two hours, and she walked three hours into the tent, left music in her room, and closed the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future partner was forced to move to the same apartment?
And wouldn't it be strange if you first thought that your student blood was your future partner, you would start dating, you'd be different, and you'd have to see him every day and lose your common friendship with him?
I mean, your heart wants what you want, but if the study book isn't really the only one right, I'd like to stop.
If you notice as a decisive moment that someone has forgotten his opening to a room that has not been closed, the boundary of the race and temptation is more noticeable than you might think.
A good game is fun, but it's the one that's going to happen right now.
To hide something may be valuable and enjoyable teaching, but no one in the room likes to fight with a toothpaste and a serpent.
The door of the second room can read and tap the doors into the water that puts the packaging, but don't care about any of the items on the roof of the oven a couple more times.
The house of a Nazi village of foreign students in China - The house designed as a reception center was demolished in Salo
In the mornings, a racist scene was held at the homes of foreign students in the Northern Karjala.
In other words, as the police said earlier, there is no housing arrangements for temporary asylum seekers, but more than ever the pensions of foreign schoolchildren in Finland, says Heidi Luukkainen, professor of the National University of China.
The windows and the walls of the National Library's accommodation style were decorated with racist marks, such as the hackers, and one of the hotel's windows had a metal display, says the East Suomen police.
According to Luukkas, the responsibility teacher of social education for young people in the National Library was estimated at ten people during the construction.
"It was a weekend and adults were free to move, so the part could be different," Loukainen says.
The National Court has hosted people from 12 different nationalities.
They are already in Finland for some time former students and newly arrived asylum seekers.
There are a-stations in all the buildings in the fighting building.
Part studies in adult education, part in professional studies and part studies in Finnish", the Finnish story.
The status A has been so stated as to grant a continuing residence permit that can be granted for four years once in Finland for a time before being abroad.
The East Suomen police were investigating the case as a crime of rape and domestic violence.
According to the article, the information provided for students on the ground was maintained, where there was also a need for translation.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We've had twelve years of foreign students, and this is the first time something like this happens," says Luukianen.
According to the legend, the battle has already been ripped off the wall.
In fact, there were at least three men who were suspected of moving in a car.
I think this is the main point of the youth weekend when this topic has now been on the surface.
It's nothing more serious," Loukain says.
There is also a hospital in Salo, where a reception centre is planned.
Killed last week.
It was reported on the MTV website on Tuesday morning.
The hospital wall was limited to a hacker and written in English "You are not welcome".
The case has been reported to the police.
Revision 15.9. at 16.02. Corrected policy information on the age and status of the people in the building.
The state stops Y-Jonna Karjaal - tourists near, "Idiotting"
The Y-Junna going to Raasepor Karjaal will stop going in March.
The news highlighted the passengers rising to the beginning of the journey through the Helsinki border.
In particular, the bottom line is on the sandy ground, says Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the village.
Idiots, because living standards are growing all the time and work they need to contact Helsinki quickly and conveniently.
This can't be anything other than a political will or a lack of it.
Bengtström tells HSTV's challenge video even if it comes to the main city of tractor.
In addition, New Zealand also has some side effects.
The H- and R-units will be re-united as R-line.
The position of the powder in Järvene and Nuppulna Nuusulna will be removed from use.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications and the VR have published, as a matter of fact, information on how the Ministry of Transport purchases a joint transport under the following contract.
The scope of the contract varies between the year and the routes to be stopped are throughout the country.
A new four-year agreement to be concluded will be adopted later by the Monetary Committee.
Bengtström considers that the State border is short-lived.
We will make the same mistakes as we did before and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then there'll be a fall.
Y-turns also use other than racepolitical and sensitivists, because it is fast and ends many positions.
The Espoola of Anna Pöyry was devastated by the city’s long-distance of travel.
"It's a bad name for those who have to plan their trip again," he said in the rush of Y-Y.
It's a little easier.
There is a new link to the border, which will be replaced by the road to the Church of England (HSL) in the area of the Helsing Seadu Transport (HSL).
This will increase the costs for HSL, in practice for the king of the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now able to identify different options and their impact on service and lip price," HSL deliverer Suvi Richtniemi said.
It is still impossible to assess costs accurately.
According to the Board of Directors, the HSL based on the number of passengers has paid from the Y-turn for a million years, the ministry has much more to do with this.
The next R line will leave two positions between them.
Instead, the number of uniforms is doubled in Ainolas and Saunakallio.
There are 28 small positions and numerous corridors all over the country.
The Ministry no longer buys a train from Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keurau and Jyväskylä-Haapämäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensu is to be reduced to the resort of the Pieksääki-Warkaus.
The young people are reduced by trains in Rihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Katka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
There will be more than half a million trips per year, when there will be about nine million travel in the transport of the ministry as a whole.
The new agreement is intended to provide 12.3 million annual stocks to the State.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixth Korkman wrote in the book The Age of Päoma: "Marx's support for family"
The global economic crises have taken place on the surface of Karl Marxin (1818-1883) and, in 1867-1894, published in his opinion, wrote by the former president of the SKP, Yrjö Hakane in today's publication on the date of Marxin Päoman.
"They are now taken more seriously than for a long time," writes Hakan in his president's office.
Marx's assessments of capitalist economic development, internationalisation and convergence have increasingly shown the growing role of capital in all areas of life, focusing on capital, and the growing role of capital and mental capital have been an amazing feature.
The author of the book based on the Master Seminars is also a professor of the Aalto University, a respected economic operator, Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes that Marx is a temporary "now and forever".
However, is not the former director of the Ellkein Life Research Institute and the Ellkein Life Administration a Marxist?
I'm not.
On the phone, Korkma says that she does not consider Marx as a temporary economic operator, but rather as an interesting community theory.
Social data have been distinguished and specialized today, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political seeker, and literary clocks.
"The usual idea is that the history of the past tells us the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
It's true that Marx's prophecies went crazy.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew conclusions from the capitalist beginnings too far, on the ground of Korkman.
But Korkman sees value in the radicalization of Marx.
"The most important thing in Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now again, we are discussing Marxin's interests, such as the sharing of wealth.
"Marx may give inspiration to those who want to understand a great picture, a world that is changing as a result of technical reflection," Korkman analyzes.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is no help from Marx.
In his view, capitalism was an unexpected case, which should only end.
However, Marx is supporting Korkman's view of marriage.
"In '70s Marxia couldn't read," Korkman says.
"Maalas and Trotslings and others hated all capitalism, but more to each other."
Today's debate is more diverse, and Marxia can also be approached without the age of ideology and political stress.
"Every sociologist should get to know Marx's thinking world - like other classics," Korkman says.
The UN requires military courts in Sri Lanka
The UN requires the establishment of a Special Court of Justice to investigate military actions carried out in the Sri Lankan internal group, the AFP reports.
The United Nations report on the use of the internal war between 1983 and 2009 was published in the medium term after a long break.
The report accuses the military of both the Sri Lankan army and the Taliban forces.
In Sri Lanka, at least 100,000 people are estimated dead.
There is no accurate information on the number of victims.
In particular, the large number of armed forces in the last few months of the war should be examined carefully, as required by the UN report.
Sri Lanka’s military forces were reported to be responsible for torture, rape, and systematic sexual violence, which was probably the same as that of men and women.
According to the report, the capinals have been accused of impeaching the public and children as warriors.
Both parties have been charged with the murder, according to the report.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it was going to conduct its own investigation, but it is not going to allow for the establishment of the UN Court of Justice, as foreign judges.
In England's y-axis, social media has been targeted
There was a long foreign language, which was English in the main language, on Wednesday afternoon.
The English sciences tested more than 16,000 coke.
In the trial, it was possible to write the material on social media.
On the basis of their own experience, we had to determine whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
On the other hand, the English 150-250 text could show a web page to the viewer.
The search was Dear Agony Anunt.
Agony Aunt is responsible for the Finnish Leelian beauty.
He was asked how the parents should look at things for young people as well.
All the subjects of the substance were four, one of which was to be selected.
"It was hard of them," considered the third theme of the English edition of Parvoo in Swedish, Mia Lybeck.
In the third issue, only the President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barrosol, was appointed.
The four things were very nice for Lybeck again.
It was supposed to write about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school we have been trained to write books," Lybeck says and evaluates the whole test "as normal".
In the English or Swedish trial, questions were answered about texts, such as adaptation to climate change and the treatment of large computers.
The average week was also written by some large Russians (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spain (27).
Syksyn's letters continue as a spring, where there is a second house, a Swedish or Finnish bath.
The tests are organised normally, which is not affected by the attitude of employees.
The University of Applied Sciences will invite experts to seek suitable travel connections in time so that they can be tested.
Additional time can be obtained if it can show that delay has not been caused by its own indifference.
In the valley, trade was stolen by gun
In the village, trade was stolen on Wednesday morning in the city centre of Kello.
According to the police, the thief had been dragged into dark clothes and raised to hide the command belt.
He's a normal guy, and he's about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff and received a small sum of money.
Let's look at this as a bunch of thefts.
Police are dedicated to reaching tens of thousands of commentators in Helsinki - support parties other than Finland
In response to the government's interruption decisions, the opinion will be to support the Helsinki debate on Friday, predicting the police.
According to preliminary data, there are even tens of thousands of people in the area.
The members of the SAK, Akavan and STTK associations will meet at 11 a.m.
The police are also believed to be involved in an opinion.
In addition to providing warnings and other police services, it is the duty of the working police to ensure that the waste is disposed of.
Roads leading to railway stations are closed from motor vehicles for about 9.30 a.m. to 14 hours.
Only alerts will be delivered to the area.
From the direction of the route of the journey to the direction of the route of the route of the route of the river, from the direction of the west to the Mannerheim.
Do you have enough people on the Helsinki police station, Lieutenant Seppo Kujala?
Second, at least it looks like it's enough.
I don't take a position on the police's job interview.
According to Helsinki, because of the opinion of the parties from Finland, the result is that the parties are in favour of an opinion.
I don't want to tell the police the exact number of the party.
"Some kind of blood is coming, but we're usually going to end up with our own," Kujala says.
The police are asking us to avoid a private car in central Helsinki on Friday.
The figure estimates that the bad traffic contract is going from Hakanei's level to the nuclear center.
Fixed transport is expected from the beginning of the morning.
On the other hand, there are a lot of busy buses in Helsinki from other Finnish viewpoints.
They're not going to be delivered to the Railways.
The buses will be on the way to the end of the day.
The finals will then go to the point of opinion," Kujala tells us.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
From the policy point of view, there's a positive side.
The question of mobility of transport, which is normally addressed at these large gatherings, is now being addressed in part.
The authorities have announced to the police that Helsinki may become ten thousand economic policy opponents of the government.
The police are waiting to calm down.
It's either normal employees or unemployed people. It's normal citizens.
The Finnish intelligent and peaceful people of the island are "The fact is that.
In different parts of Finland, local opinions are also organised on Fridays.
In many ways, it's exceptional in the past. Do you remember these laws and opinions?
In many ways it is interesting and exceptional to organize a great deal of thought during the summer of the trade unions.
For example, it does not find a very good comparison of Finnish political history, says the professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskyl, Emertus Martti Siisiäinen.
It's not surprising you're protesting.
If it hadn't done so, it would have raised my hands in front of the government, Siseiheinen would have said.
The very legitimate government has been involved in the traditional aspects of Finnish corporateism - as well as in areas that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The authorities have no right to a contract.
There's a lot of evidence here that ay-mates are really trying to get a gun.
At the same time, the ay movement has a place to look at the cover.
For example, gambling is needed because the ay movement does not necessarily have support for every employee in the past.
The new is now the division of the church which will receive an opinion in the group which the ay would like to participate in the opinion statement.
The unemployed from different sides of Finland expressed their opinion at the press conference in November 1993.
If the Member States were looking for a comparison point, it could be a reference to unemployment, as Murrostorst said in 1993.
Between the heart of the country, Murrostorsta, organized in the middle of a total of 20,000 jobs.
Esko Ahon (center) government corrupts labour market crises to another.
It was said that the interest of the Finnish Government and the employers' organizations had never been as bad as during Aho's tax administration.
Now the government and the ay movement may be even worse than Murrostorsta's times.
In addition, there is now a very high level of security in Finland, Sisienen says.
The current Government College is still interested in the fact that it is so well justified in spite of fundamentals.
There were some elements of the old trade movement in the winter.
The site is expected to be visited by several thousand commentators on Friday.
The media also stop public transport and possibly closes daily and schools.
Even if the pensioner’s pensioner’s income is not shared, it can last for many years.
There have been some 300 opinions in Helsinki last year.
They're on display.
Naturally, in Finnish ay movement opinions have been very peaceful - even though they have been tested in recent years.
Naturally, in the Finnish opinion, conflict is avoided, being legal.
Opinionmakers are trying to avoid damage or destruction of property, Sisianian says.
The end of the 1990s, however, brought new winds.
A culture of thought changed.
The EU membership forced farmers to throw their cannons off and the police managed to get on top of it.
In 1998, the palace collapsed for three months.
There were also visible flights, including flights and pilots.
Do you remember these laws and opinions?
Metal and electricity from the 1970s
The most significant lakes in the 1970s were metal lakes in 1971 and power and electricity in 1977.
There were 70,000 metals involved in the metallic rock.
The Act was suspended by seven weeks after the presentation of the Board of Appeal.
The metal fields were 16 percent of the payroll.
In the summer of 1977, the electricity supply lasted 49 days, causing electricity to rise across the country.
Murrostorsta in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20,000 people, many of whom were unemployed, met to show their appreciation for the work.
Palo people were living for three months in 1998
The palace was one of the tallest in the 1990s if I did not have a royal law.
Vulnerables against the EU 1994 and 1999
In 1994 the police were protesting farmers against the EU.
"Syperia teaches, the EU stops," said one of the schools.
The farmers in Spain had to climb to the south.
The 1999 Helsinki EU summit also gave farmers protest and fuel to the European Union in front of the summit.
In 1983 and 1995
The hospital staff lived for about a month in 1995.
For the first time, they were in law in 1983.
In 1995, several deaths occurred during the law.
I'm threatening you at the law and at the recruiting of caregivers in 2007.
The threat of mobilisation was finally accelerated by negotiations.
Doctors were lactating in 2001
"Doctors in law - demand," said a doctor in the school year 2001.
The number of public health centres and hospitals has lasted for five months and has been discussed in the past for some time on how the courts can threaten the safety of the patient.
After the act, the public sector received doctors' wages.
Students moving in 2013
About 5,000 students from the Senate in Helsinki for the March study in 2013.
The Central Police will find the refugees filled with Finnish refugees to the Italian police.
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police for help in resolving the floods of the registered refugee regime in Finland.
On Sunday, the Italian police stopped at Aisterheim near the German border, which had 42 blocks.
The file doesn't exist, if there was a river on the way to Finland.
They were all right on the ice cream line.
We've had an exchange of information with the Italian police.
The study and responsibility are in an event-by-case place in Italy, told the Central Police Commissioner Tero Haapala.
At the end of August, it became more and more critical to the refugees who were travelling on the aid of a freight car in Italy.
By then all 71 passengers in the area were apparently killed by aid.
In cooperation with the Italian police, according to the first report, the river belongs to the Finnish subsidiary.
The company operates, inter alia, the food industry and its delivery director is an outsider, about 40-year-old man.
Two Iraqis have been arrested in the Eastern Hemisphere.
Hungry captain, former drug dealer and former trafficker - the story of the five secret transporter
A king of secretaries, a violent Russian, a typographical courier, and a taxi to remain good for himself.
For example, such people practice human trafficking in the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, who works at the University of Trent, and the supplier Giampaolo Musumec, have met and challenged ten secretaries and these "clients" and, by writing their letter, the Death Travel Office will show its face this week.
In the book, they present the keys to human trafficking, present solutions, and present secretaries from various ports of business.
HS will present five of them.
I'll get rid of them right away.
The mountain ranges of the Tunisian coast are not attracting foreign tourists, but many Tunisians are heading there to the Mediterranean.
For the sake of their settlement, the islands are also particularly suitable for transport, since the island of Lampedusa, Italy, is only 120 kilometres.
Because of comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in El Attayan's village, lives in Emir, in the kitchen, my captain and the father of six children.
The sharks are famous for their catch, but the fisherman is more productive to drive people.
It's been done by Emir in a blue, ten-metre tree with hundreds of stories.
If the Russian seal is full, it's 40 people.
On one trip, Emir will travel some 8 000 euros after costs.
Emily has five of her clients looking for her clients around Tunisia.
Customers will get from many countries, but during the time of the Arab era, a large number of Tunisians wanted to give up their lives.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis resurfaced.
Customers will be able to get from Manter to Kerkenna-Sarar in small groups.
Emir will accommodate them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is given so that customers just stay alive.
The housing will pay about 75 euros per night, and if the customer ends up in the middle, it is their problem.
We're going to the water in the middle of a short walk.
On the first night, we are taken out of the islands, then we are stopped, waiting for the day and going to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes it's hard to sail, and on the lowlands 20 meters, passengers are crying and jumping.
On arrival, the human body has been evacuated for an hour and Emir is heading back to the airport.
Emir wants her to be scared.
As a result, he is slowing down and at least claiming to be a beginner of the spirit.
He says in the book that once the police chased him, he threw all his passengers across the street and ordered them to the nearest island.
"I found customers in private and threw them overboard," says Emir in the book.
The most peaceful passengers will come from southern Sahara.
He's got to hear about this.
I'll get rid of them right away.
They need to see who's counting here right now.
I don't know. I don't know.
Goran is a very regular taxi in Bogovada, Serbia.
His taxi isn't very good. It's a start engine that's been running the last time, and it's probably seen the best day of her life.
However, it is important for Goran customers to move over the taxi and move towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovavavava is a small village some 60 kilometers from Belgrade on the coast.
The centre for asylum seekers is located next door to the street, where families are mainly saved.
In the middle of the desert, without family family, men travel to live in tents, in squares and in abandoned cars, which everyone has now managed to find or build.
There are also families in the desert who have not left a asylum application in Serbia for reason or another reason.
Some people also live in private homes, but it's a public secret.
Goran's team found most of their customers.
These are often recently renewed - through the Balkans, the journey requires a large number of crossings and weekly journeys in a difficult country, often in mountain areas and in the dark.
When we finally reach the Bogovád region, the great point of human trafficking, people are dying.
Goran's natives are mainly Syrian, Afghan, Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurdish.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their thing once and it's enough," Goran complains.
He says the Africans are trying to be strong.
Goran doesn't like it.
You can hear the whole trip.
First, the price will be adjusted for example EUR 300, then they will calculate it by 200 and offer it at the end of 150.
Goran highlights being a nice man and welcoming him.
I don't care about money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran will tell his work to be done worse than others and to calculate his request to the Hungarian border for only EUR 50.
The trip is three hundred kilometers, most of which is comfortable with the engine.
The colleagues will ask for a three or four price.
Goran owes about EUR 50 000 per year.
It's not a large amount for the consignor, but it's a very pleasant anniversary in Serbia.
Serbia has determined that the taxis are not allowed to travel 12 kilometres closer to the border of Hungary.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and the schools and takes him to the border of his village's capital of a mile.
Then he shows the customers the right direction and withdraws.
On board work
From 35 years of age, Congolese is called a Messenger, and it is not just a pet name.
In fact, he has a Protestant church in the capital of Uganda in Kampala, where there is a great deal of religious pressure from Congo, as well as a small center to help Congolese children.
In addition to the message, the Messenger is driving around a secret bus where people are moving from Congo to Europe.
He's looking to do the job of cutting.
It's important to make the record look good.
He has a number of times a day to cool his neck, and I have to be careful that white cataracts are gently circling through the dark night of the rats.
It is a success of the new Mercedes, of its agricultural car and of its three motorcycles.
When the Messenger does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and ahead of Europe.
The client starts calling from a number five of the Messenger's phone number.
He recommends that the border be on foot in the morning, hide the money visually, and cross the border with traders.
In order to obtain a asylum seeker or a refugee status, the Ugandan authorities should be informed that there is domestic violence in North Kivun, for example, in the war areas of North Kivun, and that there has been a need to remove domestic violence.
Often it's true, but if it isn't, a Messenger will arrange a new identity for the client.
Old personality certificates will be destroyed and another will be acquired.
This will help the Messenger's contacts in Uganda police.
Thereafter, the client will be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: the asylum application procedure, the establishment of civil organisations, at the end of UNHCR.
A messenger is aware of bureaucracy because he has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He will consider each step separately: leaving an application to Ugandan police will pay about a hundred euros, processing documents to humanitarian organisations, and changing processes, for example, to some European countries, for example, EUR 4,500-7 000.
Follies and ice creams
Tom's a beginner, a former drug dealer.
A four-year-old Irish daily on the French coast in Calais, where his work is to have people on the streets on his way to Britain.
He has an Afghanian, French taxi and ten bicycles in London, who do not even know that he is in the passenger bus.
At night Tom and the taxi reached their client, usually from 2-3 people, something from Calais' discussion.
They're driving the A26 engine and they're trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped by the car, Tom and the driver would have to arrange for illegal immigration.
Tom doesn't want it. He's been sitting for seven years for drugs.
To stop, Tom runs a customer's engine over to a quiet place where the girls sleep before they go on to the canal boy to Brittany.
Tom's choosing a suitable team - he must make sure it's on his way to England and not even to the Netherlands, and he's gonna cut off a security guard.
It's gotta be quiet so they can wake up.
Sometimes something's involved, but then it's more expensive.
When the trip is clear, Tom hits his client with aluminium foil, the same as that which is wrapped in the kitchen around the kitchen or around the kitchen.
It should prevent the police's heat from detecting hiding agents.
Some use the same currency for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client on the river and leaves the place hoping that no one will stop the peacekeepers at any time before Britain.
King of the Salaculators
Muammer Little is one of the world's most famous human artists.
Of the Turkish people, it has been called the master of the market and the king of illegal trade in the Mediterranean, which governs the Mediterranean from Turkey to the EU, mainly Greece and Italy.
The small has worked since the 1990s and has continuously developed new secret transport methods.
He also has a competitive view of other entrepreneurs: he demands money from the bank.
One of the new methods is to rent Turkish ports for a few days to tourists in the United States or European families.
In fact, ships are loaded directly with Syrian, Iraqi, Kurds and Afghans, which are transported against the payment of EUR 5 000-7 000 for the first time in Istanbul to land and sea to Europe.
Customers are kept in human stocks, for example in old industrial departments, until the time comes.
People are being forced into minibuses, and they're going somewhere on the beach.
They are secretly commanded in the group of growth and are expected to be marked.
When it is given, the ship must rise quickly.
Travelers must stay all the way under cover.
The seafarer can only observe how deep the ship is, because other signs of the human race are not visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less the passengers grow and grow, the better.
The small will receive a total of EUR 53 000 after cost-free.
He does not care for practical things himself but hires captains, colours, guards, tenants and other smaller actors to care for the work on their behalf.
In the Middle East, transport is organized by at least hundreds and Küczk is estimated to be worth millions.
He takes into account the purchase of land by secret companies, the medical industry, and over a hundred homes he rents.
Muammer Küczyk was arrested in 2011 at the same time with a representative of the Democratic Party of Turkey and a medical firm.
After that, he's obviously gone.
Recital 16.9.2015 at 15.10 a.m.: The death certificate is published here, not in the first week.
The American Olympics say in their book about their disease and their behavior as prostitutes
Three times in the Olympics, a 500 - foot - [500 m] jurist, Suzy Favor Hamilton’s new book has aroused interest in the United States.
In his book Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton describes the end of his career as a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated page would publish a series of books on diamonds.
Favor Hamilton decided to take his urn to Sydney's Olympics.
He came to the casinos in the middle of the day and went to the casinos for the second time.
But in the finals, he had to panic.
He immediately began to climb up the hill and defends his place of leadership in the country.
However, 150 meters before the ground, his power disappeared.
He broke down on the street, and other competitors stopped him after each other.
I felt like I was an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
However, I took myself over the painting line, Favor Hamilton tells me in his book.
Later it was revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from two months of mental disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before Sydney had committed suicide, and he himself experienced great hardships.
Favor Hamilton was 43 when he ran into a prostitute in Las Vegas.
There were no economic problems in Paris, but he refused to get money from having sex with his neighbors.
She also spoke to her husband to accept his action.
Favor Hamilton's tax was 450 euros per hour.
He's telling me he's using the money to fly.
One explanation of Favor Hamilton’s prostitution in his career was that he had acquired the same adrenal trades as he had been in a public security competition.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he had a two-hundred brain disorder.
The first two-year anniversary of the event appeared at the end of 2012 when Smoking Gun published its article.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympics of Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was 1,500 feet [3,57,40 m] long in the world's statistics, but he stayed in Sydney for the last time.
When I joined the Norwegian Hygiene Group, I said, "Surorian"
King Petter Northug of Norway has exceeded the limits of compatibility by at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and Norway's Hygiene League have been calling for the last year's time and effort in the way of the sports contract.
Although the association has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been announced to many world masters and Olympic champions.
As a result of the Treaty, the Norwegian Federation decided to close Northhug’s future World Cup.
The decision was given thanks to the two-fold World Master Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he'd be happy to join me in the show.
"Thank you for showing kindness," Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
"We can't afford that one activist can avoid working for the Union sponsor," he continued.
There is a financial gap between the Norwegian Federation and Northug.
Northug would obviously want to be part of a long rural group so that he could report his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent an association that also takes care of future generations and does not give one of the players.
At the same time, he recalled that the association has given Northug both economic and other rights for many years.
I know it because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb doesn't agree that one athlete has exactly different rules than just because it's the best.
Northug would certainly publish his own report, which assured him that he wanted to play in the colors of Norway for the first time in the world as well as then in the MM-kiss and Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won all six MM medals, of which two gold.
He was in the last winter in Falun in the winning team.
Expiry date is also issued in Northern Ireland
On Thursday, 25.9., there will be a series of riots in various restaurants and shops to which the passenger race is awarded.
The aim of the day is to raise Finland's high level of food production and lower the level of departure from the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of rock as a high quality.
At the same time, we would like to remind you that not all high-level restaurants have been focused on the capital city, but the checks and classifications of the independent operator are located around Finland.
The international attention given to the event is an indication of the importance of the event as part of increasing awareness of competition and of the organisation.
In the northern part of the day, there will be a restaurant in the Vasa in the Fund and in the Cantarelli.
The day of the contest at the school is part of the restaurant in Old Town.
The event has also received significant international attention.
The event has also been decided to make one of the most important international events organized by the organization during the same day across the world.
Finland will continue to experience the event on its own.
Letter of appeal: Establishment of the reception centre for criminal proceedings
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are currently owned by the LSK Business Park Oy, in cooperation with the reception centre for refugees.
According to the claim, the region continues to have a sustainable crisis of critical infrastructure, which is a defence force and its partner, Finland's Special Network Oy.
The complainant's letter tells us that the establishment of the reception centre would constitute a significant safety risk, which is not taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the Chancellor, the defence authorities may have the interests associated with the former Air Force School and the airport, which have not been so affected by the preparation of the reception centre.
The case shows that in the case of the Gaza Strip, negotiations have been held over the past two years on the organisation of flight training and on the outcome of a possible external operator to the airport.
This has been discussed, among other things, with Mr Jussi Ninistung (p.) and Mr Arto Rädy, the National Commissioner for Defence.
A private person shall ensure that there is no objection to the reception centre in the proceedings, but that the intended location in the previous reserve area is wrong.
In the past few days, the city administration has dealt with reception centres.
Nationality: The situation in Syria reflects Ukraine and the East Sea region
The Government means that there are essential conditions for farmers and the present, as well as for the rapporteurs of all the representatives of the representatives of the Republic of Montenegro.
According to the President, all participants were concerned about the management of the refugee camp.
He considers it valuable that the government and opposition parties in Finland are able to discuss the most credible issues.
Especially during this time when we have great challenges ahead of us
According to the report, the situation in Syria, as well as in Russia and the United States, can also have an impact on Ukraine and beyond the situation in the East Sea region.
It is a source of hope for the development of dialogue.
If that situation develops in a positive direction, namely the United States and Russia, it has an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the future of the East Sea.
According to the report, the question of Nato was also addressed in the discussions.
In the labour market situation, the president did not take the position.
Finnair spent 16 hours flying home, Alkot held a couple of hours
One flight is already set up as a tortoise and 15 minutes.
The list of abandoned flights is available on Finnair's website.
In Finland, it is said that the operations of airports are aimed at addressing the pre-primary authority during the labour situation.
However, courage and delay are expected for security checks and other services.
The message of opinion closes the doors of the Helsinki Centre
In the spring, the opinion will close the doors of Helsinki's debate.
The police tell the Railways to be closed by car at 9.30 a.m.-14.
Cars are not rescued from the direction of manners, Postikata and not from the direction of the railway station.
From the direction of the Union of Hakanei, transport is directed to the Union road in the direction of the Kaisani railway station.
According to the policy, the time of closure depends on the amount of violence involved in the opinion statement.
Only alerts are delivered to the area.
Metro- and ratites throughout the day in the country of thought
Operators of the Metro and Railway Vehicles participate in the afternoon at the start of the sub-modal transport at the end of the night.
The association of the railway and metro personnel reported on the matter to the STT at night.
The majority of Sources will be closed for two hours, including posts closed
In the past, mental confusion also causes disturbances to the postal services.
Significant delays are expected, inter alia, for day-to-day distribution.
Part of the mail service is closed.
The blood circulation of the Finnish Red Cross is treated without charge.
It is also intended to treat hospital shipments and laboratory procedures.
You can get information about the services from the Mail website.
Most of Finland's Alkos are closed on Friday for two hours.
Pam has instructed his employees to suspend work between 11:00 and 13:00.
Pam has also invited the staff of the retail trade to participate in the opinion of professional organisations.
The representatives of the SOK and of the Central Bank point to Helsinki Sanom to try to keep the sellers open when necessary.
According to the Commission, there is still no information on the possible closure of individual trades.
Helsing's daily house is partially closed
Helsing's daily homes do not work full-time on Fridays, reports the Helsinki Bureau of Early Ageing.
As a result of the opinion of professional organisations, day-care may be focused on certain dates and not on the organisation of day-to-day and sporting activities.
Environmental requirements for day-to-day housing and groups of developing and multiple children remain open.
In addition, day-to-day activities of the most developed and audiovisual schools are organised normally.
The Agency shall be authorised to inform the Agency of any changes in its activities tomorrow.
Median researchers: Sipila takes a real risk
According to Silip, there is a need for multiple channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio talks are one channel in the other group.
We also need to continue this direct speech channel.
This won't be the last time, Sipile told the publishers in the community.
The pillar did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister's television and radio talks are coming.
According to Silip, we don't always have to keep talking on the Ylen channel.
If other channels appear to be a channel, we'll see it then.
Now we're using this channel tonight, Sipil said.
According to the Spanish authorities, the economic situation in Finland is so serious that it requires citizens to be kept on television and radio.
This fact, which we are now talking about, is time complex and requires a longer basis.
That's why we decided on this channel, Sipila found out.
The call will be sent at 21.05-21.20 both on TV1 and Radio Finland.
It can also be seen in Yle Arena.
Sip takes a great risk.
The media researcher hopes that Sipil's TV interview will not tell you more about turning into the government.
Is it an attempt to adopt the definition of public debate more precisely in its own hands and to reject the issues of public debate? Professor Anu Koivunen of the University of Stockholm.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Timo) is pleased to note that he does not follow the media agenda and does not give it a definition of himself.
On behalf of the democratic debate and the public, I hope that these things do not relate to each other.
I understand that the commercial media has been made aware of Sipil's announcement.
It would be weird if the media girl didn't respond.
The political decision-makers' communications requirements are not a matter of democracy.
The role of media representatives is definitely to strive to avoid the adoption of political agendas.
According to my experience, the TV interview is a great risk to Sipilje.
In order to meet the high expectations set by the speaker, a new and specific procedure should be introduced.
Are we offering more today than we've ever heard?
Or can he speak in a different way, in a different way, or in a different way, or say something new?
I wish to say that if the promise is just the same old one, I must wonder why such a great gift was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
In general, this risk will be taken into account if there is no special situation in this area but a routine conversation among others.
The danger is that the Supreme will become a message of politicians or representatives and government, which is certainly not in line with the interest of the Supreme or the general line.
Slippered door water
In the future, it is also important to highlight what the Prime Minister has to say.
In the evening, we will look at what is missing and what is not, says University of Jyväskyl's research coordinator Heikki Kuutti.
I heard a TV call is an invitation from Sipil, because this will make it possible to bring his own view to the front without any noises.
This message is given to a large audience without the consent of journalists, but rather than in the media, where suppliers can raise critical questions.
The sword ends the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, it is dangerous that the media interpret something wrong, since there are no specific issues to be asked.
I've heard it's very important how Sipil is shown on TV - the pain in the chest, the release of his hands.
He'll be like Shiphrah, who's now telling the people what to do.
If Sipila is able to present her case well, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government were to know something about it, because this person's age is like talking directly to another person.
This (United States President Barack) Obama and the partners regularly celebrate.
A real exception
Policy researcher Erka Railo thinks the Prime Minister's speech to citizens is truly exceptional.
He said that it has not happened until decades ago that the Prime Minister is speaking directly to the nation.
An exceptional time requires exceptional means, Railo says.
The researcher considers that the Prime Minister would therefore like to have the Finnishs present in favour.
In the afternoon, employers organise opinions and bills against government action.
Mr Arhimäki, President of the Left Group, says on Twitter that Sipila could keep her speech on the nation's status in the Presidency as a statement by the Prime Minister, where the speech would also be discussed.
The President of the SDP, Antti Rinne (sd.), once again, will report his challenge to the Sipil dialogue.
There's no time for monologists now.
Half a year from the election.
The finals can't be hidden, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy with a necktie has been found in Tampere
The boy was in good shape at the time of his discovery.
The boy was born on Facebook by his father.
The police station in Finland will also confirm the matter for the Night.
The boy went out for four o'clock in the evening.
Later that night, he's lost contact with her.
My father thanks all the people who helped him find him.
Thank you for the ten connections and findings during these hours.
The update was distributed nearly 15 000 times, which is an incredible balance in this short time
The Finnish UFC hit the youth into a violent fight: You get angry
A Kurdish volunteer, Makwan Amirkhan, would publish a video on Facebook, which is particularly inviting immigrants to young people.
Makwan Amirkhani was under pressure to speak against young men's beatings.
Amirkhana, born in Iran and with her family in Finland at five years of age, has won both of his professional training in the UFC's most valued UFC range.
Amirkhani tells her that she received a message asking to see one of the Instagram methods.
They have videos that kill young people with extreme violence.
Amirkhani tells me she's been deceived by young people.
The 26-year-old Amirkhan has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The rest of the country is hit, sit on the other side, and suddenly you will not think of any of the consequences of this when you do dark videos, the day of the American day.
Harder defenses
Some of the young people who see the video are immigrants.
According to the Helsinki Police Commissioner, Jarmo Heinosen has posted video on social media on both immigrants and immigrant youths.
Name's that you're killing your superiors on the way.
You make so many other immigrants' lives more difficult here in Finland, the Turkish American remembers.
Amirkhana recalls that there are sites in Finland that are looking for immigrants' crimes.
These individuals have become very numerous.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you.
You should remember that you're still on your way to the country and that you're going to be here for a long time.
That's a little different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhan says.
Amirkhan is inviting young people to remember their neighbors.
If they sometimes have a subject of racism, you can blame yourself.
Now, think about it a couple times before you go along with that, you'll stay.
Amirkhan says violent action is contributing to racism.
You'll get a black time of hate I don't like myself.
You have a bad time, however, and you're not going to do anything better, Amirkhan's decision.
SAK put its position on the storage package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
SAK's president, Lauri Lyly, tells on Twitter that the employer's organization is on the ground of its position to submit an optional inventory to STTK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on the proposal by STTK on Twitter.
The STTK service organisation told the government that it had submitted its own proposal last Wednesday, which the Prime Minister called for the five-percent rate of productivity to be achieved by the Ruha Sipil (meaning).
The President of the Akavana, Mr Fjader, believes that the Government will accept the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the biggest payer organization SAK should strengthen its position earlier.
On behalf of the President of the SAK, Mr Lyly, he made a frank comment on the issue on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK's work committee is dealing with this matter on Monday.
According to Lylyn, SAK sought solutions to "opening the labour market" and that contracts made by active parties were needed for the position of demand.
Lyly recalls that the proposal of the Prime Minister of the Government of Cyprus as a social agreement did not apply to SAK.
The previous negotiations on the Community Agreement would be closed when SAK did not agree to undertake a five-percent increase in the productivity objective.
Comment: The big message is dangerous to come up - "I feel it's a little bit boring about the trees"
I feel like it's a little bit boring to keep a woodwork if it's already in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The sensors vary in the payee's order on the display.
Does it mean to shout at a government or even agree with it?
On Monday, SAK's allies cleared the sacred anger against the government of the Republic.
All of Finland was threatened.
This publication is not for sale.
The teacher's professional organization of the OAJ threatened to shut down schools and day-to-day homes.
As a smoker, OAJ retired: no school or day is completely closed.
On Wednesday, the chairman of the STTKK, Antti Palola (sd), presented the meeting in agreement.
He told his Government that he was in contact with the government and that the Prime Minister of Juha Sipil (meaning) would consider the option of presentation of five per cent in terms of productivity.
The President of the Akhavaan, Mr Fjäder (Kk), urged immediately to state that his agreement is ready.
The SAK's office did not begin to belong at all.
President Lauri Lyly (sd) is difficult to deal with when the allies ordered the country to stand on Friday afternoon.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that the SAK's Labour Committee will meet on Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK will seek solutions to "open the labour market" .
In order to create a common representation of employers, the SAK should also adopt a five-percent production phase for the objective.
No wonder Palola's STTK has a good relationship with Sipil's government.
Mr Juka Ihanus, Head of Social Action of the STTK, has previously served as the Special Representative of the Central Prime Ministers, Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kivinie.
In addition to the fact that the government's ay-partment has improved all the time.
Whether to hurt or not, but Palola's exit took a little clean away from Finland's residents, whose music was played by Akt's Marko Piraien (sd).
I feel like it's kind of a bit of a mess if it's already in your pocket.
Modified at 6.00 p.m.: More information on Lyly's comments.
The Russians called Finland a bad father: "This can't be repeated"
The Russian Prime Minister Sergei Naryshkin criticized the Helsinki Etyj meeting.
In the opinion of the Russian Prime Minister Sergei Naryshkin, Mongolia is better than Estonia than Finland.
In the capital city of Mongolia, Ulan Bator has begun the hearing of the Etyin Parliamentary Assembly, in which Naryshkin gave wide comments on the Jewish meeting in Helsinki.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian policies, such as Naryshkin, to be brought to the attention of the European Union's opposition to the meeting - a matter which the President was discussing to remind the rapporteurs.
In our view, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This can't be repeated, Naryshkin stressed the press office with Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, the Naryshkin’s criticism was addressed to the United States, where he had also been denied access.
The Sanctions are political suicides from the EU, Naryshkin's newspaper.
The delegation of Mongolia of Russia came to the fore, so Naryshki continued to reside in Finland by body and by thanking Mongolia for the "extraordinary organisation".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will work constructively and positively - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue does not have to be a barrier.
Naryshkin has met at Ulan Bator, the leader of the meeting, Ilkka Kanervan (kok), who has already discussed with the Russian media with the Russian delegation.
Closes the real playoff game: "The Earths in the Dark"
Matpara and Luke are going on Sundays, when they are both coming on the second day of departure.
Janne Lachti predicted that there would be no foreign land leaders in the House today.
The killer went to Kuopios last night to the 3-2-hour plan on KalPas.
The rise was a man, as the skipper group was at least two days away.
Well, I guess the number was even more molluscs.
The Romanian island of Tactical Blues, which began, was the zero-point bikes, and the fatalities were 2-3 years old.
The hard game, the worlds in the dark, if any play the same game as last year, the Lukko attacker Janne Lahti predicted the settings on the follow-up pages.
The killer has been formed for the peaceful, pretty playoff-pressure.
The Tappara is named in the two preceding stages just below Luko's financial line.
In both cases, the solution is required by the seven solutions.
Last time, Luke took the cross to the castle in the fourth game, but Tappara rose to the next three steps and ended.
There are no major changes in groups except for the number of groups.
Both of them were killed last night, and today they're going to be dead.
At the battleground, Mika Noronen makes a position for Tom Karhus, and Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski between the Lukko clubs.
View: During the course of the journey, the event is difficult
President Doivola wrote a letter from the Prime Minister to the Rautakaloli, who was unable to continue, writing from Santtu Silvennoine Tampere.
It's classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone signed a Rocky photo where he himself showed his head.
The leader deliberately put the champions in the camps for Apollo Creed, the world's master of gravity.
Rocky got a big sympathy, even though he finally lost his title training.
Three and a half years after Rocky's first daughter, Mika Doivola, wrote her hand-writing to Pori.
The name-and-favoured package has led to a surprise for all SM terminals in 2006.
The group was full of names such as Rocky, but weak attackers.
He was from the White Indians, Porin Mattia and Pele.
In the boxing games, players colored their heads red and cut their throats.
I hope it's blond.
The shop TV operator JP Jalo called the manufacturer Neamanni.
These guys took a win-win hope.
The hope was one of the saints.
The writer of the magazine, Mr Wivola, believes that the reform of this period is working the same way as ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports director of his own business has built an old house for bad boys.
Samir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been stuck in the distance like Rocky's sarcoids.
The causes of Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholman and Matti Cuparsen are somewhere else than in the play.
The hope has been forgotten that Rocky VI is the head of Pekka Routakallio.
Karri Kiv has been described as Sean Connery.
The railway station in Toivola is one of the main players in Rocky's manual, as Connery would have been in the beginning of 1976.
There's nothing else like Rocky's name in the railroad.
There is no connection between the play of the Red Cross and the playoff and the playoffs.
He appreciates heavy game, but it's different things to play harder than gambling.
The last time I saw Garret Stafford, Tapparan Jere Karjala's head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the courts, but Routakallio put a man in the bathroom.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play those who deserve it.
I don't approve of such games, and it doesn't belong to the short-distance game that came to Routakallio after the game to the Satakun Nation.
In this way, the team is well built.
It's June, veterans, police officers and constables.
There are no key players in the best game.
It's no surprise that the prime minister has chosen art.
How much have you been able to influence the players' contests, Pekka Routakaloli?
The recent developments have affected procurement and unfortunately the situation on the market has been slow, with a diplomatic response to the Red Sea.
I'm going to put a knife down.
In 1953, Rautakallio has obviously been interested in moving to Doivola's place as a sports event.
Men's contracts end in the morning.
There are a number of losses on the ground floor between 1 and 6.
The hope would not have been supported by continuing the manuscript.
Olga Temonen shows Sipe Santabuck's mother
Olga Temone reveals that if she had met her husband in Tuuka's teen years, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temone is the first time in her husband's direction.
Yes, I'm going to introduce my husband to my mom.
Usually it feels crazy, like an actor and producer of Olga Temon's joke.
He has been married to the Apulan ex-bist and leader Tuukka Temos since 2008.
The Parisian society has done a lot of work together before, but now Olga is the first time in Tuuka's leadership.
Olga's role in the early years of Apulan is in the beautiful picture of us is a drum of Sipe Santapukin's mother, Sirka.
Circa smacks and supports her son, even though this father, Risto (who presents Lorenz Backmann), is trying to be my voice.
The more I know about my real first visit to the Church, the easier it becomes to present the role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuku that he trusted me.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but after that, the two of them were much closer.
They've met, they've spoken on the phone, they've been texting.
The circus has really helped a lot.
We've been through a lot of different ages through their history.
Happily, the circus also understands that the drama is a drama and that the truth may have a little to do with color.
Olga points out that Sirka was in Heinola almost the only one who sincerely believed that Apulanna would come from Finland's largest band.
At the age of 90, there were tears and real pain.
There was a little chance that someone was really successful, but Sirka had something intuition, and he was right.
Olga says that she had heard a lot of about this youth before filming plans.
However, the history of the parents has been somewhat different.
So, if you're 15 years old, how many parents really know what you're talking about.
Olga reveals that his youth was completely different from the wicked traitor of Heinola, known as Tuuka.
Olga was an ark and a nice girl who had never had a movie with Tuuka to do anything about it.
He could've been hiding in the top.
According to Olga, for ten years she has worked so much with Tuuka that a large joint project is not afraid.
Everything's always been so cool.
Now the whole producer group goes to Heinola for months.
In fact, the elderly couple are going to spend time with their little children, often at home, because the interval is not too long.
We're calling the whole moon of the Spirit.
They've taken us really warmly against us, they've just asked us what to throw and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 rose to Finland as the most famous exhibition feature
Timo Vuerensolan leader Iron Sky: The Coming Race budget is EUR 17 million.
Pictures begin in October in Belgium.
Captain Timo Vorensola begins painting Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
Iron Sky's scaffolding section, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will raise Finland's biggest example of all times to a budget of EUR 17 million.
Earlier the title of Finland’s most famous film had been at Jalmar Helander Big Gamel.
The Angry Birds animation will also rise after the completion of Iron Sky 2: as the film budget is over EUR 100 million.
Timo Vuorensola's director and Tero Kakoma's film production begins in October near Antwerp in the AED Studios rooms and lasts for eight weeks.
Commander Timo Vuorensola is leaving Belgium for the first week.
The budget is not afraid.
I've been in a very sick mood!
I'm so glad I've got a file on the manuscript, because I know exactly what the ceiling should be.
Everyone in the working group feels that they're going to do something unexpected.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Although it's time hard, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to see that I'm going to show up to the general of this leff, he's telling the Nights.
The original film budget was estimated at 8-10 million, but the budget was also growing in the development of the manuscript.
It's a big budget, but it's a big store.
The film, however, would be worth 100 million because each picture and performance is so expensive.
Now it's all so tight that there's nothing to find.
The film production company Iron Sky Universe launched a group-care campaign and a team workshop on Wednesday, which will pay 4-8 per cent a year.
The final height is determined by the demand and supply during the campaign.
In the last two years, the company will pay back.
The performance shows, among other things, Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Jewelry or coolie?
You're going back to the places where the logos are.
The trends in trends have recently been cleared by isolated logos.
Still another time, a well-formed dresser avoided clear and large logos such as Crocsey's consagna.
The mention of the Huppar or T-pad mark was seen in any joint.
It's just time's changing.
Sports has come in the right form of megathren, as well as the old, familiar sports car brands like Adidas and Nike have risen to the cooler subcarrier.
And as often as before, the limit of noise and trend is noticeable: if something is already a proper band, it begins to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. a pattern in which the trends were surprised by the best possible weak basics of age than by a way of contrasting with the mass.
Now, instead of the hard core college, it is already covered by the cable-based networks that come in front of the manufacturer's logo.
The bigger and the better, the better.
In addition to the logos, such as the Adidas' famous bicycle networks, the team’s favorite games and the New York Yankees’ tickets have made a return to the castle building.
From the beginning of the falsifiers' trails, the Calvin Klein logos are now cool details.
The trend also appears to be in the transfer of sports brands to the luxury brands.
For example, Versacen's causation is clear as to what is significant about clothing.
Would you be willing to present your logos to you?
The Russian policy would have published the evidence: I didn't belong to the German class!
According to the figures, a special event would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held to represent the products of the Russian military industry.
In recent days, Russia's media has published negative allegations that the Russian Ministry of Emergency had to expel large villages of Bolivia's tanks for a period of five hours.
In the meantime, Dzirov has done everything he can to argue.
He would even publish a photo on his Facebook page, where he seems to see the image of the circling pansary in almost good senses, and at least on the basis of their images there is nothing about judicious or hurtfulness.
It's full of shells.
Let's start by saying that I didn't go into the battleship, but it was the BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier, Lieutenant Colonel. I've served in Ural.
I went in there, looked around, and came out peacefully, Sozov told the Communist Pravda.
I didn't get Jewish, and I didn't really spend five hours in that apartment, he said.
To the Russian army TV channel, Diovo explained his admiration for Russia’s new technology because he himself is a former professional.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the guns, and I loved our technology.
And I came out through the backyard, he said.
I went through all the tanks.
And also in the next exhibition, I'm going to make it possible to go to all tanks and all the border crossings, you promised.
Diovo also complained about writing as a typical supplier.
One fool wrote and everyone else returned.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside, and I came out.
I'm long and ugly, but nothing like I've ever been in a tank has happened, he told Russia's luzhba novoste radio.
Zodov’s words support that no photograph of the accusation has been published, even though it took 50 000 people a few days.
From the incident of Zodov, the incident began at the beginning of the Bloknot.ru site, where Zodov was told about the shootings outside of the tank while he was trying and eventually threatened to shoot everyone around, unless he got out of the area.
Later, the Blocnot website would be published, where the exhibition organizers told about their own views.

Denmark Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against breaking too much
The IMF report published today in Finland follows closely the views of the Government and the Ministry of State of Finance.
The order was devoted to the structural reforms covered by Finland in order to address the economic problem.
According to the IMF, reducing overcrowding and wage-free days would support Finland's competitiveness.
Amendments should be made to the whole contractual system and to the safety of unemployment.
According to the Danish Bank's lead economist Pasi Kuoppamä, the structural reforms are the same, but there are small differences.
The IMF’s assessment contains a lot of useful messages from the government’s action, but on the other hand, there is also a warning message about what should not be too difficult.
These are, for example, infrastructure investments, Kuoppamek tells Talosannam.
Growth projects would also support the IMF's view to implement as soon as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF predicted a 0.4% growth for Finland this year, which will increase first in the year to 0.9%.
Today, Denmark predicts that in its new relationship, growth will remain for zeros this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic than this year.
They may have had the latest findings.
This morning the Statistics Centre told the total production to be in the summer in small growth, Kuoppamäki is real.
The weak confidence of industry or other softer measurements so said has been able to raise less attention.
However, the issue is only a small percentage of decimals.
Nintendo was named after the new leader of the death
In July, at the bottom of Satouru Iwata, who worked under Tatsumi Kimishima, began his work on Wednesday, Nintendo told me on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo from 2002 and had been recommended and charismatic growth in the field.
Iwata, for example, successfully responded to the Wii console's launch.
At 65 years of age, Kimishman's choice is not surprising.
He was one of the names that was identified as possible followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata's lead, an analysis of Ace Research to Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
The task of Kimishima is to see the removal of Nintendo by means of mobile games, but so that it does not feed the company on traditional pelicans.
Finland will be able to reach more and more substandard asylum seekers alone
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Agency recognised that even hundreds of children who have come to the country are missing annually.
This has been reported, including SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, on their website, according to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of minor applicants are lost annually.
The Director of the Agency for Migration will tell the Republic of Finland what the situation in Finland is and how it has changed.
Do you have the same situation in Finland?
How many applicants lose "under" in the year?- A total of 156 applications were made in Finland in 2013 alone.
You lost 9 of them.
In 2014, 196 applications were made and 11 of them were lost.
The conclusion of the investigation may be that in dealing with the matter, the applicant is already registered in a country other than the Dublin Regulation and may have been found there in full time.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive than continuing to deal with the matter in Finland and returning to the country responsible for the processing of the application.
Similarly, some of the missing will be found later when they seek asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, the asylum seekers in Finland were all 3651, of whom 134 were granted an infringement decision because the applicant was likely to have changed from Finland, so the adult asylum applicants disappeared during the last 123 years, he says.
Is there an increase in the number?
By 6.9 this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for temporary asylum alone.
The total number of missing minor asylum seekers this year is not yet available, but the number of minor applicants is then known and it has increased clearly, which is likely also affecting the number of missing persons, and it stresses.
How's the conversion decision going?
Are they also lost, for example, to the black labour market?
This is difficult to assess by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, because the implementation of the translated decisions is in response to the police, which stresses the cannelland.
Minister of Interior Petter Orpo (kk) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered attemptors in the country.
He's been running out of action.
Orpo, who was in the EU Deputy Ministerial Meeting on asylum issues, told on Monday about practical actions to manage the debt of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see pictures of devices
The sales of the missing media sector operator Timo T.A. to Mikkosen's TV and radio productions are now on sale.
Mikkos' side Nina Mikkonen sells Huuta.net devices that were currently the most advanced of professional instruments.
My first website was on the Internet.
Most of the equipment is now left on the feet of technological development.
In the digital media world, television programs for Betacam diseases are no longer described.
However, Nina Mikkonen is confident that interested ones will be found.
Of course, equipment is no longer modern, but these are also needed for as long as there is a substance of an old generation that needs to be digitalized.
On the other hand, there's a lot of fans - construction workers and their studios, Nina Mikkone's base for the IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkos are trying to change their current home in Myrskylän.
We can't take everything with us.
I've started an inventory and I've started to see where the goods are created.
I'm starting with this, Nina Mikkone says.
There's no use for TV or radio devices anymore.
It is clear from the survivors of brain cancer that a long time ago, a man has not returned to work.
Nina Mikkone notes that now we're only selling goods and equipment.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen's early life was already archived in the summer of the National Audiovisual Institute, which representatives went to follow through on film and other material from Myrskylä.
The risk of traffic being threatened is higher: Metro and trainers can stop as a whole family
The drivers of the Metro and Railways decide today whether they are expanding their activities by means of a series of opinions.
The original plan was to establish a time-limit for the establishment of the transport of metro and bicycles only on Fridays.
During the day you decide whether to stop your traffic all day.
The voter Pekka Hirvonen says the damage is great in the field.
Night and day cuts harm the drivers, so the government's plans to cut down the sheets raise the challenge.
Hervonen argues, however, that the establishment of transport throughout the day is a sort of dilemma.
If the metro and the railways are on their way home, the public transport is in practice almost completely stopped.
According to VR, johns do not travel by Friday between morning and evening.
They don't move around on Fridays, they don't move near or far away.
Before morning, the young ones will be assigned to the deadlines.
According to the HSL data, most buses remain on the edge.
The members of the ACP shall be away from work on Friday morning at three o'clock in the afternoon.
Probably a small number of buses can be delayed, they will be sent to the top authority, the HSL reporter Pirkko Repo calculates.
Repo says that HSL cannot say exactly what bus fares are going on Friday.
The employers' organizations will organise a large-scale conference at Helsinki Railway Center on Friday 11-13.
Aftonbladet: The Hungarian police used gas to attack the refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees in front of the gas station.
The event took place at the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to reach Europe, according to the news agency AP.

The Muslim boy was held in school in Texas - a teacher thought his own time was a bomb
In the United States, 14 - year - old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after the teacher had his own school bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he wanted to just present his e-mail address.
One of the teachers, however, had a time just like the bomb.
The police were invited to the scene, and eventually the situation ended when the boy was taken out of custody in the custody of the youth.
Mohamed has not been found at any stage, claiming otherwise than he had done in the past.
Nevertheless, it is still possible for the boy to be accused of making a lie.
According to Mohamed, the police had proved to be a "stupid bomb".
The clock is in police custody, but it was made up of obviously border crossings and digital exhibitions between the leaders.
The killing took place in the last few days, and Mohamedia was sentenced to three days in prison.
His father is based on the case at his borders and the Islamic Council of the country is based on whether the case is yet another evidence of Islamophobia in the United States.
British Kohisee - Director of Labour refused to vote for the National Assembly
The song asks God to protect the royal throne, but Corby is an opponent of the monarchy.
The assessment of the right-of-the-law paper has also brought together the national rapporteurs of Corby's own lab.
This has created a nation, counting the lab representative Kate Green's general radio company in the BBC radio station.
Green thinks Corby's gonna have to join the song.
In the evenings, British airplanes were honored to fight against Germany’s Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Working Party shall, in its official opinion, defend Corbynia and stress its respect for the possibility of participating in the flight.
We are all in great gratitude for the dignity of the royal air carriers.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully during the national elections, and the opinion was stressed.
Corby's election as vice president has divided the lab's lines.
In particular, there are those who fear that he will be angry with malicious speakers on radical views.
Corby's support is for the individual concentration, the cessation of savings and the growth of public expenditure.
The number of Corbyins is today the first time the vice-president's properties appear in Parliament at the Prime Minister's hour of question.
Corbyn has asked the general proposals on what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
Cameron's frame last week on Twitter, Corbyn will be elected Vice-President.
The working side threatens our national security, our economic security and our family security, the Prime Minister has called for it.
I guess the reason for my family's death is still unclear... the father of the family was waiting for the sentence.
The South Lake Minnesota police have recently investigated the murder of a family member in Minnesota in Greenwood.
The family of five was found dead on September 10th, and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family Brian Scott Short, 45.
When he first shot his wife and three of his children were killed by Brian Short in a car car.
I've been dead for days.
The family was found after the school was cared for for by the children.
On the basis of this announcement, the police went to the hall for inspection and found a large house on the part of the Short family as a result of their death.
According to StarTribinen, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Millions of businesses and successful businesses
The investigation of the case of the South Lake Minnesota police officer Michael Sitar is still under way.
The motive for blood transfusions is still unclear.
Shooting Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property on the social media site AllNurses.com.
In 2014 in StarTribunen’s questionnaire Short reported four million different visitors on the site every week.
I've been given 50 purchases from the company over the last ten years.
I've abandoned them all.
But I still have a lot of ideas that I want to make.
Kents sometimes sells a company, but not yet.
The event was seen, among other things, by the purchase of the Short family in 2011 from Greenwood to the house with two million dollars.
The building is famous for its construction site in Zillowi: there are only 12 rooms in the house, and there are also eight cars available.
Lawyers
According to StarTribin, however, the father was expected to be legal.
Achiev Test Prep, which offers various prep courses, had challenged him because of comments on the AllNurses.com page.
According to Achieve Test Prep, Short’s website did not remove misleading comments from prep courses and thus lost customers to competitors.
According to StarTribinen, however, it is very unclear whether the legal procedure would have a significant impact on Short's business.
Vesku Loiri offered two coffees
In addition, the owner was rewarded for the meal with the Finnish hypnotic horseman in the month of the month of Finland.
It's a great thing, Mr. Loir's comment is good for the kingdom.
The party, Fabrice Duo, won Derby on the first Saturday of September and deserved to win 100 000 euros.
The artist's novelist Loir was still surprised by the success of Fabrice Duon in the big contest.
I still don't think it's happened.
The manufacturer of the memestyshevos Corpi, according to Loir, will get full-time work with the horse in his work.
Pick up and decide which horse you're going to compete with.
And I like my turf, Lori's voice.

The Montreal Canadiens supermarket P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (about EUR 6.7 million) to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the hospital's report, there is a single gift for the greatest athlete of all time in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban has committed to helping a hospital in another reserve facility for the next seven years.
Subban made an agreement with Canadiens eight years ago and 72 million dollars a year ago.
Subban's gift rate is therefore significantly higher than his nine million dollars annually.
In his gift, Subban is given a hospital named after the hospital.
Canadian players have previously helped significantly local hospitals.
Last year, the long-term captain Jean Beleveau collected millions of dollars for the same hospital, including the same hospital for children, and Saku Koivu collected the amount of money left for the other city's large office, where the hospital received a PET scanner needed for food research.

We can and we need to improve the safety of cars, Intel Security Manager Chris Young says.
With ASRB, Intel can ensure the best practices related to safety and support the view that cybersecurity is important in the design of each network-related vehicle.
Few things are more personal than our safety on the road, which makes the ASRB government the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovations in data processing.

The real-tv beautiful Kim Kardashian gives talks one after the other.
She presents her pregnancy and breast-feeding in sexual clothes, last night at an American time when she and her sister, Kourtney Kardashian, had been away from the corner of Kanye West.
The Black Mother's mother's place is through the walls.
It exposes the finely-coloured roots under the wall of the sandy valleys.
Finally, Kardashian became an amazing motherhood when he visited his friend at nightfall in New York just a few days later.

He made his documentary Talking Dolls, where Leloup and his colleagues talk about cleaning the furniture.
Harpeer's Bazaar saw Leloup's six hard truths on the back of his class.
Every season starts with empty.
Even if you had been posing in the eyes of the pilots in the past, the new period would begin again in the Castinge.
And every long time there comes new, young adults who compete with their peers.
The models rarely have a place they can call your home.

It's not just one kind of disaster.
An agent in New York may ask for a drop of pounds, but in Paris it is said that you're too weak.
Getting a job is a full-time risk game.
In design areas, models and designers are together at the same time and work on the same support network.
When the furniture is finished, the difference is painful.
The models want this area because of the opportunities it offers, but they claim that everyone thinks that the job is just a presentation of clothes.
They also want to be their own person.
The work will make the models realize that they are models who have a role to play.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
I'll model you yesterday at the Tory Burch exhibition.
In New York the best design shows where designers reveal their first year of painting.
Changing its style Roope Salminen presents an unknown Applanta music in the film
Roope Salminen presents Antti Lautala, the founder of the band based on the Apulanta-unity at the beginning of the year.
The train started with Toni Wirtasen in 1991 but broke out in 1994.
This is a big challenge for me because I am 26 years old to be a rap artist, and in this film I am a 16-year-old kairist, Salminen narahta.
I didn't want to see the real Auntie before the pictures, because I want to make my own interpretation of him.
Antti is clearly unknown to people of that message, so I think it's very good that I'm teaching her voice style only from video.
I don't want to emulate a person.
The very empty Roope Salminen and Koirat's trusted man doesn't play.
The Punkmans come from nature.
The stars, the stars, probably many in the punk period of the program, have seen the espresso, even if they've ever been on our heels.
Our performance has never been a little bit short, but it's always going to be perfect.
In the afternoon of 1993-2004 the base called Tuukka Temos's guide made of us the main exhibitors of the beautiful picture were published today.

Psychology Advice: So tell children about refugees
Many parents have had to consider how to tell a child about the refugee situation in Europe.
Or will you ever say anything about it?
This does not need to be taken into account as a member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff's advice.
Fewer children support protection, and for example, they don't see the news alone.
Little children can't always understand what they see, and it can stay around and worry, he says.
However, if your child has been distracted by television news photos or heard about something else, it will encourage him to talk.
The discussion is good to take the child’s starting point and listen carefully to what he is asking.
The fear of the child may be surprising.
They're not necessarily the ones whose parents think they're afraid of him.
The child doesn't have to be afraid of harm, even if he's worried and scared.
The younger the child closely follows his parents ’ conduct.
If parents themselves remain calm during the discussion, the child will try to be safe.
Most children probably get involved in the discussion with refugees in school, with friends or online.
Parents do well to talk to them about the matter if they are thinking about the child.
The fact is, not everyone in the world is good.
Parents can discuss with their children how to deal with this in our family.
However, does the world think that the end is a safe or safe place?
Parents may also have different forms of growth - some may want to protect their children from the risk of depression.
On the other hand, if you are also discussing difficult issues in your family, your child will learn how to deal with the challenges ahead in life.
This could be good for him in the future.
Social Psychology Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weak"
You're out of your power?
Still, you can be a good parent to your child.
Vermion-like Palosalam hard hills
Perttu North got lost at Apila Pallosalama in the middle of the middle of the day.
It only cured the winners and doubles until the end of July at Tampere's border was hit by a storm.
Because of the origin of the product, the manufacturer doubted that something was wrong and tried to protect him from animal doctors for a time.
The explanation for the step-by-step would be significant.
The horse had a prison sentence.
The patient was not more comfortable to get through, but it took two medications.
Since Apila Pallosalama had to be on a slow move, the North tells her that she has been warmly surprised about the last flight of the horse.
It was in Turkey in the preamble to the second SE and the second post-Tournut.
Apila Palosalama was heavily under stress when it had been normal for only a few weeks.
Since the things of little attention at the end of the day were understandable, the North says.
The manufacturer assumes that the good competition has made the gold.
The horse’s rage must have moved ahead, and hopefully it would have been restored.
This has been so said about the use of drugs.
When it's not interesting, it could've been thrown out without any disease.
On a good day, however, the origins of the wild beast have been shattered by such a list of enemies that they have been in human form.
During the march, the passengers will not pass to Palosalama, from which even the warm, warm beds will come out.
In the North, Vermosa's dream is to be buried.
However, there is a difference as to how it relates to Apilian Pallosalama.
It's a difficult time at the start, and even if a beautiful car is under the tree and it's like that.
Hopefully, the oil would have been more peaceful than it would have been at the start of the market.
Apilan Pallosulama is well able to come from the lake as well, and we will be able to enjoy the victory, the manufacturer's permission.
For this reason, you're not getting away from the remote iPhone program.
I'm the CEO of the app. Tim Cook.
At least I share in the future programs with the Apple iPhone calls, but not all of them.
Apple is likely to remove some of its own programs from the iPhone, reports the company’s delivery director Tim Cook Buzzfeed’s questionnaire.
There are a number of programs that can be used relatively rarely, such as Facebook calls, Latvians, Health, Press, Podcasts and Vinkit.
The most recent addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which became an update to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple's smart owners.
According to Cook, removing the App program is more complex than it seems.
Some applications have been linked to another iPhone.
If they're removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook's gonna make Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention what the Apple iPhone applications work closely with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user get rid of them, Cook plus you.
According to Cook, Apple then investigates the matter, because the company does not want to cancel a reminder from the users' iPhone.
Euro area inflation decreased by 0.1% in August
The euro area consumer prices rose slightly in August, i.e. 0.1 per cent per annum, the EU Statistical Office of Eurostat said today.
The rise in prices was below the drop in energy.
Eurostat checked for a return of 0.2 per cent in this couple of weeks, a little below.
In July the inflation rate was 0.2%.
Thus, in August, the so-called primary inflation decreased by 0.9 per cent from July to July by 1.0 per cent.
Eurostat's baseline inflation was 1.0 per cent.
In the euro area last month, the energy was 7.2% worse than a year ago.
In all 28 EU countries, the average inflation rate was zero in August.
In June, the increase was 0.1%.
Most of Europe's prices rose by 1.4% in Malta in August.
Cyproxic inflation was at a lower rate of 1.9%.
In Finland inflation was 0.2 per cent of the minimum mark according to the EU harmonised price index.
Inflation in the euro area is still far from the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is a two-percent increase in prices in the medium term.
The ECB predicts a average inflation rate of 0.1 per cent for the euro area this year.
In the first year of growth, 1.1 per cent, the Central Bank predicted its publication in new inflation services early in September.
In the United States, Fed is trying to break money policy.
In the United States, the next battle will begin at the latest less than a year, but probably within three years after the country’s central bank Fed is moving back to its peaks for a long time.
And the financial markets will start to defend themselves before the next attack.
Fed has been ignoring its initial trends this week and by the end of the year.
Thus, the next shift can be put at the top of the sex scene as quickly as possible and before the financial market collapse.
Or at least so if the world's largest economy and financial market operate as they have done, and if they react to the collapse of Fed's funds as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been adopted by the German Bank Deutsche Bank in London's market research strategies for Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in the long-term market and economic cycles.
The Bank distributed over 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to international majors last week.
The research and reporting strategies do not believe that they know exactly when Fed will start to climb its peaks or what is happening in the economy and in the market after that.
Instead, they present the facts and calculations of the various economic statistics, using the facts and calculations of how the economy and the market have been used in the past and in the past during and after generations of Fed.
In addition to historical findings, they examine what the key economic and financial market changes are now at the same time or in another model than in the course of further developments - and what may follow.
Of course, both the economy and the financial market are now in a better position to sustain peaks than ever before in the 1950s.
At the beginning of the year, it may not be a year.
The leaders of Fed's monetary policy and its all-in-Office are quite a long-term, starting with the time to be able to climb mountains.
The first seizure over nine years can be experienced this week.
The matter shall be settled by Wednesday and Thursday at the time of the meeting of the Open Market Committee so stated by the board of the Fed.
The last time Fed did so said Fed Funds in June 2006.
This led to a two-year period of relatively regular but once again a series of 0.25 per cent corrosion units, which Fed reached from 1.25 per cent to 5.25 per cent.
The financial market crisis began in 2007 in the United States of America on the most risk-weighted housing funding difficulties, and a year later the financial crisis was relapsed as a global day of judgment.
The great earthquake occurred in 2009.
In the last few years, severe opposition to the financial markets and the real economy has begun to worsen after more recent attacks by Fed.
Accordingly, the trials were more severe and worse than ever before in the 1930 ’ s.
Deutschen's strategies have led to the rise and fall of the world's largest economies, as well as the changes in financial markets since 1950 and always since the early 1800s.
From the 1950 ’ s, they have been making clear the economic and financial implications of Fedin.
The start of the first cycle has taken the fastest time for less than a year, usually less than three and a half years and less than three and a half years.
The financial market rate has ended within two years of the start of the mergers of Fedin.
Fed has risen to the top and dropped to the top after the early 1950s a different cycle.
Each time it has been removed from some of the others, and reports are being examined relatively narrow, so on the basis of them, it is unlikely that there will be any certain effects on the following trends.
The strategies also remind us that many things are different this time.
And it's not just better.
Overcrowding too long
The root causes of the financial crisis have been found to be not necessarily to be found immediately even in research for decades.
But the three main causes of the crisis and its devastating causes are some undisputed finding out:
1) Fed, the ECB and other world's largest central banks were too late in the 2000s.
They were following a technical plan, and they also grew the following.
2) In the various parts of the financial and real economy, the level of debt increased over and above the previous decade, with a higher impact on the monetary policy of the Central Bank.
The greatest debt in the economic history of the country was born.
3) In particular, as far as the financial sector was concerned, the gross debt-based financing provided by most of the financial market's share areas was the largest share of the economic history of the financial sector in which it was allocated to the buildings, debts and benefits.
Also, it is very difficult to argue that the financial market, which is still high on the basis of stronger debt rates, was rare and uncertain when Fed and the other central banks were finally able to rise above the peaks.
The financial structures entrusted to the debtor were not maintained until after the maturitys had begun and the cost of the debt treatment had been increased.
The risks were a financial crisis, and that led to a big confrontation.
Bigger cup and more debt
The Deutschen strategies do not consider what is going on, but give the theme of the wind by mentioning, for example, the following steps:
1) Fed and other large central banks have now considered their monetary policy to be even easier than before the financial crisis.
If the peaks were too long before the crisis, they have now been even worse.
2) The debt has not been as bad as ten years ago, but now the debt is worse in writing than in air.
Thus, the debt of the financial and real economy has not been eased but now the debt burden in different parts of the economy is much more heavy than before the financial crisis or at any time before it.
3) The liquidity resulting from the earlier and worse-off movements of central banks has remained largely on the financial market and has been lost to the most expensive securities and property types since then or at any time before the financial crisis.
They also note that not only do the strategies of the financial markets sound low, but also that even the US economy has not yet responded to the most serious financial crisis and for decades to the model it has taken.
The euro area economy must have taken action at all.
In other words, the real economy is inconsistencies in the ordinary but correspondingly the pressures and risks of the financial markets are much higher than before the financial crisis, when Fed next starts to distort its cash flow.
Perhaps the future picture of the French bank of the Society's General Strategy Albert Edwards' future is not as strange as it can immediately affect.
He has already prepared the Bank's international investor customers in good time for the following provisions:
First, Fed climbs up hills, then the financial planes relax, and soon it's time for Fed to break down the financial space in even greater QEs.
The Hewlett-Packard (HP) that manufactures computers and results is intended to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are due to the business service of the HP, the company tells.
HP is distributed in November to the Hewlett Packard Enterprise and the consumer-oriented HP Inc Inc. company.
HP was the largest staff in 2011, with 350000 employees.
In October the last year, the staff was suspended by 302000.
The company is writing on a regular cost of $2.7 billion (about €2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise is reduced by 25000-30000 employees.
The decreases in the consumer share will remain within 3300 years.
HP intends to transfer its activities to low cost countries so that 60 per cent of its employees would be in low cost countries in 2018.
The company will tell its balance sheet business so that none of its clients will respond more than ten per cent of its business results.
In the second year, its three major customers brought 65 percent of the business output.

More: Minister Berner has acted as a tax agent in the government of the tax companies
Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner (Central) has acted as a member of the tax administration of the company.
According to the above, the company's activities relate to so-called tax planning.
This is from the Luxembourg-based Saltri II LuxCo company, which was appointed a member of the government of Berner in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg trade register, Berner is still an official member of the government.
Berner himself says that he has left a notice of separation in May this year.
I checked the matter, and it's enough that I've left a different report.
It is almost impossible to manage and verify that registration tickets occur during the agreed period, Berner says in the Ylen questionnaire.
Membership after merger
The property of the Swedish Kährs is managed by the Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a park promoter who founded the Finnish park promoter with Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner works in the government of Karelia-Upoflor in 2010-2013 and after the merger in the government of Kärs and in the Luxembourgian company.
According to the above, Kährs' properties are going to Luxembourg through a multi-port property structure.
Berner tells Yle that he took up the request of the highest owner of Kährs in the Luxembourg government company.
This owner is Hartwell Capital.
I've been in the government of Karelia-Upoflor, the capital of Hartwell.
The company was asked for a partner who was found from Sweden.
This company is owned by the owner of the company which holds the company in Luxembourg.
I found that my job was to take care of the success of the Finnish family's capital.
It is important that we ensure that the production of the capital of our Finnish companies is taxed in Finland and that the source is secure in this connection, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwell Capital's assets are not related to tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex property structure that could be taxed is due to the fact that the largest owner of the capital fund in the Triton was already a Luxembourg holding company for the property.
The ESPO’s Supervision Reception Centre
In Espoo, Otania, the first maintenance centre of the company is open to adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first hundred homes from tonight.
The number of seats can be increased within the week by at least 300 to 400 people.
The Agency for Migration shall be established at the headquarters of the reception centre of the former Rescue Centre.
The operation is maintained by Luona Oy, which is in particular the production of health and health services.
The City of Espoo, the Immigration Office and Luona Oy agree together on the security arrangements of the Centre.
STTK prepares a package of options for working life
The STTK will prepare an alternative package for government work coverage.
The company also hopes for other employers' organisations.
According to President Antti Palola, there is now an opinion in the last half of the world.
The alternative means of reducing the price of work are then returned.
Everyone understands that after lunch, Palola took note of the organization’s management meeting with the suppliers.
Palola considered that the Central European Union (EC) is not prepared for discussions instead.
The economicists of the STTK have calculated that the company's competitiveness package contains a variable security of EUR 30 million for the employer when the other side of the package is EUR 2,700 million.
I don't know if the party has the great intention of having a discussion if the party has one hundred relations.
Palola: The negotiating connection has been to be built
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (meaning) has been hoping for alternative proposals by Wednesday, since then the government is going to give its own package of information to the press and start preparing the reforms.
I don't know if the schedule is realistic.
The discussion with the government is based on Palola's existence, and it has been for her to be built all the time.
According to Palola, the area of the STTK's solar system is the main area of the solar system.
The order requires that the government withdraws from the proposed legislation which would have been implementing some of the infringements.
According to the STTK, Palola does not welcome the preparation of an alternative package with a pending SDP.
The employers will meet on Friday in Helsinki to protest against the government's offer of a working life-saving package last week.
Part of the package, i.e. the first sick days' wages are paid, overloads are broken, sunglasses are reduced to 75%, and tears are reduced.
The STTK stresses that the central organisations have called employers into the opinion country and that the purpose of the scheme has not been legal.
Akavan Fjäder thank you
The President of the Board, Mr Fjäder, welcomes the announcement made by the STTK on the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fäder, the STTK will now come to the same line with Akava, as Akava has more than a long-standing alternative model for government presentations.
Fäder hopes that SAK will also be provided with an alternative package, since without SAK, the package will not be sufficient.
The President of the Akhavas, Mr Fjäder, hoped that, according to the future of the SAK, Lauri Lylyn, he would prepare the presentation as an alternative to the cuts.
Antti Palolan STTK told me last Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and time banks.
On Wednesday, Akava announced that it has already prepared its own presentation, which is ready to negotiate on the goal of the government of the country as a five-percent competitive option for cuts.
Akava has been ready for consultation all the time, and we have already written a long list of options for government presentations.
We are ready to consider the terms of service as part of the contract.
On the contrary, we want change security and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fäder hopes that SAK will also come to Akava's lines, as STTK has done last Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We're now preparing together a model that goes to the government and employees of the country, Fäder says.
The Committee of the Regions shall meet on Thursday 15 a.m. to make a decision on the possible content of the Agreement.
"The same wine, the common oil, the tent" - play bingo in Sipil's speech at night
Green Left of Tampere University
The last night of Viva's Bingocupank, the Green Left of Tampere University.
The prime ministers have previously held separate talks during the Cape of Mentsla and the war.
Prime Minister Ruha Sipilä speaks very differently to the nation about the state of Finland's economy at the Ylen Canal on Wednesday, 21.05 p.m.
When asked by the Prime Minister to speak in 1932, Pehr Évind Svinhufvud was the prime minister in holding the famous radio speech that marked the beginning of the end of the Mantslä's Capina.
After that, the president and the ministers held several radio talks during the winter and the follow-up.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho took President Mauno Koiviston instead of the New Year's speech, but it was more ceremony.
In 1976, President Urho Kekkone stopped on television with the law of law enforcement officers.
A single call from a monarchist.
The Spanish speech has raised criticisms and criticisms throughout the day about what I should be doing.
The president of the left-wing party, Mr Arrhimäki, said on Twitter that "Sipila could keep her speech on the nation's status in the presidency as a statement by the Prime Minister, in which the speech would also be held to be discussed".
According to the Green Ville Niinstunt, "a single call has already been seen.
The leadership is part of a dialogue, listening to people.
The SDP's Erkki Court of Justice ruled on Facebook that "Monarchist: Prime Minister tells the people what's best for it".
SDP president Antti Rinne called on Sipil's dialogue: "I'm half a year from election.
Not only did the Prime Minister appear on the media with opposition.
It's been tried.
What are you afraid of?
Public service
According to the Government Council, the Sipilian speech has been pre-filled and will last for about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it was commented in a direct letter by SAK President Lauri Lyly and EC delivery director Jyri Häkämies.
The majority have been assessed for the presentation of the Sipel speech.
We considered the matter and agreed that it is part of the public service task to promote the wide audience throughout Finland, on the line of the Head of Public Publications, Ismo Silvo Ylen in the news.
As in the Time of the End
The speech has also raised controversy.
In the evening, you will enjoy the evenings in good times, the children will be hungry, and the best will be served.
Mother put on a fine shirt and the father adjusts his neck.
At 9:00 a.m., we are late on television than before we remember,” writes a blogger, Saku Timonen.
"When Prime Minister Sipila also spoke about why the Finnish government is sitting in a tax-arranged capital with millions of money hidden from other tax-trafficking companies, and at the same time say to the people that it is necessary to cut money when the government is done?" asked Pia Lohikoski.
As far as Sipile is concerned, one opinion is presented by the Green Left of the University of Tampere, Viva.
It's been published on Facebook by an early band.
Do we hear of the same Russian, the common cold, the wildness of life and the team life?
Coupons and chains ready, at 21.05 a.m. it starts and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Arena.
At Ahtisaari Guardian: The Westerners opposed Russia's proposal for the elimination of al-Assad
Last year, President Bashar al-Assad told President Mattti Ahtisaari Guardian of the offer of Russia.
According to Ahtisa, Russia's UN website proposed a plan to which al-Assad would have been able to speak out in a pleasant manner after some time.
However, the latter did not object to the proposal because they believed that al-Assad was missing within a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaer, Vetali Tshurki, a Russian envoy, listed in the two main discussion three points: the opposition did not receive weapons, opposition and al-Assad had to be contacted immediately, and the promise against al-Assad had to be carried out gradually.
I know Tshurkin.
We do not have to agree on all the same things, but we can openly discuss them.
I told him what I did there, and he said that sit down with Alas, Martti, so I'll tell him what we have to do, Ahtisaari reminds you of Guardian's challenge.
Diplomats do not comment
Ahtisaar tells his message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing has happened.
Tshurki did not confirm the content of the debate to the press, but Ahtisaera said that there are no two words.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaera's claim, but said that al-Assad's troops had already made numerous mob attacks at that time and that the main opposition groups had rejected all the agreements he had left behind.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the British Foreign Ministry's Middle East Party, is in a position to address the issues raised by Ahtisaer, because, according to his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss the case of al-Assad at any time.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assadia throughout the war.
On the weakest point in Ahtisaera's claim is that Tshurki spoke with Moscow's authority.
If he had told me about Tshurkin, I would have answered that I want to hear from President Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, in that case, he would have doubted whether Putin's debt would have been maintained by some al-Assad's support.
Our own actions are a warning to us
During the negotiations on the Ahtisa, the Syrian crisis killed about 7,500 people.
According to the UN estimates, the death tolls exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the year.
Over 11 million people have had to leave their homes because of war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
Turning refugees into Europe is our own business.
I don't see any other options like taking good care of these ugly people.
Now we're paying the bill that we made ourselves, Ahtisaari tells the press.
Location of asylum seekers in Turkish Tornion
The plan of the Government to plan for the North Finland for asylum seekers is likely to be based on Tornion.
The centre would be based at the centre of the city on the construction of the nearby Tower Community.
The Ministry of the Interior has sought a place where it is necessary to improve the management of refugees from the Soviet Union.
Helsingin Sanomat, of course, stated that the Authority would have decided to present a report on the school building to the Ministry.
According to Saul Hyeppisen, the vice president of the city administration of Turin, it does not take his place.
When the whole authority was not in school and part of the message wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the Committee to decide on the matter first country, he referred to the STT.
On the ground during the debate, 36 were authorized from 43.
In response to 13 orders from the Consequences Centre.
On that basis, it could be expected that the decision would be a positive, beautiful statement.
According to Mayor Timo Nouise, the city received no contact on the subject on Monday, and the matter was responded rapidly.
The joint venture would allow 500 asylum seekers to be evaluated several times.
The applicant has examined that it could apply to such use.
Sitting is a pairing of meters on the wall, so it would also be in the mind of the young man.
Sipi still hopes for a job market option for coverts
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipil (Central) in the public, the allocation of pensions would only cover part of the government's goal of calculating the cost of work.
However, the Government considers it to be against the alternative package if labour market organisations succeed in making such a deal.
Sipile told the rapporteurs in his delegation that he had not been in contact with the labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously the organizations were looking for alternative means of informing the government of job abusers.
If such an agreement arises, we will take it without any pleasure against it as part of the complete package.
The sharing of loans would be effective, as it would be appropriate for almost all employers, for example, to plan for a government's solar eclipse.
The labour market organisations could agree on the cut-off of wages because they have been registered instead of the labour market agreements.
The Government shall report these findings to the public in the first half of the week on the closures of the working life as a public communication from the Council of State.
According to the Spanish authorities, the proposals of the organizations should be known before this.
There's no final counter at all.
The legislative process will then begin to move, that is, the lion is moving, and it will become more difficult all the time.
It's a good time.
I won't go long in such things if you want to.
The last week of publication of the management list includes, inter alia, the amendment of the deadline and the deadlines for the free-of-occupancy period.
In addition, wages for the first days of illness will be paid, overcrowds will be broken, sundial rates will be reduced to 75% and the rent will be reduced.
The amendments will be carried out as a compulsory legislative end for professional associations, which has raised a strong appreciation.
In addition, through the action of the Employment and Economic Development Committee, the organisation is organizing a large-scale communication, which has also been published by many professional bodies.
The Customs Authority approved the extension of the property of the country of origin
The authorities of the Dominican Republic unanimously accepted the extension of the property of a small minority of Nordic Koivu Oy's government.
The assessment led to the fact that the project was bigger and more expensive than the original one had been mentioned.
The fast schedule is also very close.
It was little wonder, however, that the need for statistics was not known the year when the previous enlargement was completed.
At this stage, the expansion of the stock by 400 to 450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the fund was decided to increase its contribution to the annual report.
The presentation also discussed the investment of EUR 150 000-200 000, but at the meeting, Technical Director Erkki Iconen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
Investment was supported on the basis that it brings work and taxes to the local community.
There is no risk, as the company pays the investment rent, the Water Pollution (p.) basis.
Instead of the language of Karjalan in Joensus
The city administration was pleased to move its position to the centre of Joensuu in order to bring Roman Catholic Catholics to the center of the city.
The new decision is important and right to think about the choice of military tradition throughout the country.
Joensuu will not be published as the capital of the karja language, because it has no historical basis and the language of the karja is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken at the end of this century has become more and more common in the former Soviet Union.
After the new decision, the city centre will not become a caralytic cataclysm.
However, the town of Joensuu is, in a case-by-case manner, also prepared for the introduction of the language of karate, for example in the infotaulu and on the travel market.
The same approach is recommended by the city to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a single country, he also supports the use of the language of the karaoke now that diversity lives and changes powerfully in the North Caribbean.
The Karjala language is still unique in the country, as is the ideal Yoenusta as a forest town throughout Finland.
Both can be used well in a wide variety of markets in the country.
Derogations of association reduce the animal health of the country
The cuts in the relationship will allow the country to live with a strong hand.
Business relations directly affect the country's business life and competitiveness.
And it's going to affect whether we can stay here and do things, the mayor of Joensuu is surprised by Karijalanen.
It also highlights the transport that has been carried on several times in the report.
It is important for the whole country not to be able to reduce our opportunities by State measures, as it is now in place.
The effects of these traffic connections should be considered, for example, on employment, by emphasising Karjalinen.
The deterioration of relations will lead to increased attractiveness to the University of East Finland.
Of course, the best services here, such as traffic connections and your apartment, is easier to get students and workers, director of the University of East Finland Jukka Mönkönönönen.
He notes that bad travel connections also affect the research community, which is very moving and travel much for research.
Recruitment officer Marko Junkkarinen says that it is already difficult at present to market the university in West Finland because travel connections are lacking in childhood.
About half of the students from the University of East Finland will now come from outside East Finland.
Again, about 10-20 percent of them are re-examined, which is explained in part by direct contact.
You've got one of my cousins in your army.
The vision of the city management of Joensuu is apparently unique, but there is one group of sorajas.
At the monthly meeting of the Government, Mr Pentti Kessikalo, a member of the City Management Board, presented a full commitment to the entire project, but his presentation was inconsistency.
The Authority adopted the Kari Karjala Decision, which was revised in early October before the City Authority meeting, which provides a final opinion at the same time with all other citizens.
One anniversary of Kotkasa Kouvola will end in the first year
Your personal transfer from Kotka Kouvola to the future remains, even though it is more rare for the European Union.
Changes to personal transport between Kotka and Kouvola will take place in March first.
One of the Europeans will be gone, but on Friday, he will come from Kotka to Kouvolo and on the contrary.
The mergers are the result of State rescue operations.
For the next four years, the transport costs of the Ministry of Transport and Communications will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest tracks are to be stopped completely.
VR developed new timetables by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27.3.2016.
The boys jumped into the hole, one didn't get down, the guys moved out.
The rescue plant delivered a stone to a cave by the age of 12, which was not able to escape from the castle itself.
The situation was born in the Tower of Turin in Ketotia in six o'clock in the morning.
There's an old two-pound tree that doesn't have any stars for the cat.
It did not prevent a group of boys who decided to rock the room to the roof of the next room.
Some of the other boys went down the same road, but none of them.
As a result, the other survivors and the survivors warned the rescue facility instead of helping the final cat to safely return to the earth.
FedExin exchange exchange exchange, weaker views for the 2016 balance sheet
FedEx announced its latest annual report's decline. The transport sector has been weakened throughout the year by reducing demand for railway services and increased costs of transport.
The company's going to hire 55,000 waiters for a loan.
Last year, FedEx announced that it had paid 50,000 workers in debt for a period of time.
The company's share dropped by about 2.5 per cent 45 minutes before the opening of domestic trade in the middle of the week.
FedEx's forecast is $10,40–10.90 for the final account in May. The advance is 20 cents compared to the previous forecast.
According to the FactSet study, analysts predicted $10.84.
The benefits have decreased by 4.9 per cent in the average course despite price fluctuations. The increases will take effect on 4 January. The additional payments will take effect on major or large shipments of land in November.
The company is still looking forward to the growth of the previous year due to the increase in costs, increased trade and network trade.
President and CEO Fred Smith said that the company has done well in a much weaker economic situation, which has been particularly affected by production and world-wide trade.
A day after the date on which the investor announced its plan to pay the same amount of debt workers over the past year, or 90 000 to 95 000 persons, was notified.
By the end of 31 August, FedEx's annual turnover was $692 million, which means a six-percent increase.
The partial result was $2.42. Zacks Investment Research Company estimated $2.44 for the 12th analysis.
Business exchanges rose by five percent to $112.3 billion.
According to a six-year analysis by the Zacks Investment Research firm, the turnover was expected to be 12.23 billion.
FedEx has tried to reduce the transmissions of the international team in recent years, so the operation of the Express unit has been broken down in place.
The strong growth in the network trade has been confirmed by the result of FedEx Ground.
In the last decade, the turnover of land transport increased by 29 per cent, but the cost of large-scale shipments and insurance was seen in the business force.
The express unit produced better due to higher basic charges, while the production of the textile industry decreased due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before the opening of the ordinary course, FedEx's partial course was estimated at $3.85 or $2.5 per cent at $15.15.
As a percentage, the average of 11 per cent of the year's average and 17 per cent of the above mentioned below was recorded on 11 June.
This week, the U.S. Central Bank's decision-makers meet for the most expected meeting in the year. The group will sit on the left side of an eight-six-square wooden tree to decide whether it is time to raise the mountains for the first time until almost ten years.
On the wall of a two-terrestrial meeting room of the Central Bank, the United States has a wall area to offer.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, must put the state's financial interests ahead of all other interests.
The Central Bank has a double rate at Congress: maximum employment in the United States and maintain prices here.
However, after the Great Lakes, the Central Bank’s leadership has taken note of the third unwritten mandate: economic stability.
This mandate may be lacking in the case of a return penalty decision. As a result, the Central Bank will be able to state whether the US economy is ready to start a visit from the unforeseen drought that has been causing short increases by the end of 2008 by the end of the year.
Although most of the data show a steady growth in the economy, the recent fall in the financial market can already be made ready for the increase in the volume of liquidity by raising the reference rate of the State's taxes, even by a quarter of the unit.
"Employment and inflation are naturally the first and most important in monitoring their practice," says the banking company Stifel Nicolaus & Co, the lead economist Lindsey M. Piegza.
"I believe, however, that if the central bank seeks to make it impossible to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty of global markets has to give enough reason to wait," Piegza continues.
The underlying issue is not the same as what the central bank intends to do, which is already causing trouble in itself.
About half of the economics in Bloomberg's research have re-increased the rise of peaks this week.
However, in the financial market, the central bank is expected to increase by only 30%, according to the most important indicator.
If the central bank rises to its governing level, the shareholders may count, unless the decision-makers agree to make a second rise.
As the Dow Jones industrial average index, your score is 228.89 points or 1.4 percent units 16 599.85.
"In the wake of the crisis, there were expectations that the Central Bank will keep its leadership steady this week," said Moody's Capital Markets Research Group chief economist John Lonski.
"I'd be surprised if the central bank would rise high at this stage," he said.
"If this has happened, the Central Bank should consider carefully how to keep the hands on the financial markets without being more important."
On the other hand, the experts found that raising the ceilings could calm the financial markets and remove uncertainty about when the central bank operates.
Only a month later, the Central Bank had a high rate of 0.25 percentage units this month. This would be the first small step in strengthening the financial situation and thereby strengthening the United States' contribution.
Yellen has proved to be a long time of calmness and a beginning to wait for the rise of the peaks this year – despite the fact that liberally, economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate was 5.1 per cent last month. It is now the lowest rate of seven years and close to the level that the Central Bank will consider to be full employment.
The results of the attacks appear to be overwhelming.
Although inflation continued to fall below the 2 per cent annual targets of the Central Bank, the Central Bank's decision-makers found that the main reason for this was a temporary impact on the price of oil.
"The economy can reach even higher peaks, and it needs them as long as they take into account the serious situation of the labour market," said Pantheon Macroeconomics, chief economist Ian Shepherdson.
However , through the financial market , the world did not have an emergency in the last month when China took control of its currency .
The Dow Jones industry has already released 16 percent of the expected peaks in May, and investors were afraid that China's economy would also be affected by global growth.
Markets have been suspended this month, and Dow Jones has now estimated nearly 10 percent of the fraud in May.
The fall in the market means to the central bank's decision-makers that the basis for the rise of the steering band is constantly changing.
"The work of the Central Bank will be strengthened despite what has happened on the financial market and what has happened to the new deterioration of the Chinese economy in recent weeks," said UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, and former central bank official Stephen D. Oliner.
Now he believes that the Central Bank is waiting for at least a month to be able to deal with the effects.
"I have great uncertainty about what will have an impact on the economy of the United States. There is no reliable information about the recent developments in China's economy," Oliner said.
The improvement of the world economy is not a major concern of the Central Bank, so in principle it should not affect the decision-making of the Central Bank.
In practice, however, the central bank is the most influential currency in the world’s financial system.
The impact of the Central Bank has been great in recent years.
In 2013, only the guidance of then President Ben S. Bernanken was that the Central Bank could slow down its activities, and that it was time to be informed about the world.
In today’s world, markets and economies are strongly mutually reinforcing. In addition to monitoring the world’s development trends, the Central Bank is also required to contact other central banks and experts in order to have a good overall picture of the world economy.
"The Central Bank's decision-making process is more art than knowledge," said the director of the Global Strategy for Investnet Inc. Karabell.
Speaking of the Regional Central Bank, President Jeffrey Laker Richmond stated this month that the Central Bank has previously reacted to the movements of financial markets that do not have a link with the fundamental players of the economy.
Mr Lacker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee (Federal Committee) who voted in favour of the establishment of the Steering Committee, took, for example, decisions made in 1998 and 1999.
"The economic crisis in Asia led to the decision by the Central Bank at its three meetings to calculate a leadership rate of 0.75 per cent, although only marginally recognised sanctions were available for economic growth in the United States," Lacker said.
A year later, the Central Bank gave each other a decision.
"The Central Bank should put the financial stability of the first person only in a significant crisis, such as in the collapse of the financial year 2008," said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Conciliation Committee of England.
The last death is not even approaching those situations," he said.
"The rise of the churches in the name of any reason to fear market failure," Peterson Institute for International Economics Posen added.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate, and there is no mention of the stability of the financial system. Before this change comes, I don't have to go on."

Brazilian Rio Granden Doctors' Association to Promote a Good Food Choice
The Brazilian Rio Grande Children’s Association SRS has developed a sugary habit to teach pregnant women the importance of a good diet.
The human breast is made up of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates. This is how the baby gets all the food he needs and can develop a strong immune system.
Due to excessive energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calorie levels by about 500 kilograms.
In addition to increasing calorie levels, the new study suggests that other changes should be made to the diet.
A recent study of the Texas Baylor College of Medicine, Robert Waterland, revealed that a pregnant woman’s healthy diet can affect the genes of the baby and protect the baby from developing plants.
Unfortunately, the adverse diet was found to have a negative effect on the immune system of the child.
Seven's Sunrisella's best viewers, even though Nine's trying to get a lead on Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson wanted to make Canberra a morning programme on the follow-up of the leaders of the Liberal Party, which, however, has not even updated Toda's views.
The Nine Cana morning program was sent from the capital city of Malcolm Turnbull to Tony Abbott.
David Kochin and Samantha Armytagen were sent from London for a competitive channel morning program. A number of special messages will also be sent from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
At least it was not apparent that it was important for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise looked at 397 000 viewers in the five capital cities of the country, and today's programme was 339,000 viewers.
The peaks rose slightly to the last months (317,000) and then to the second (283,000) but remained to the last Thursday (343,000).
Today's been stuck in the middle of Sunrise's last month.
In August Todayl had an average attendance of 318,000, Sunrisella 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
In September, Sunrise, on the other hand, has reached an average of 349 000 viewers and Today 314,000 viewers.
This is what I'm interested in.
The changes in the winds affect Parliament more this morning.
Karl and Lisa are all right, thanks for asking!
Sender TODAY, sent on Monday, 14 September 2015
Noteworthy news for Seven had 800 Words, which included the former Packed to the Rafters, Dr. Erik Thomson.
The new drama will soon tell you about a father who decides to move to New Zealand’s coast with his two children. The new series has reached a total of 1,219 000 viewers.
Critics are doubtful whether Thomson would be sufficient for the hit-and-run alone, without Rafters, Rebecca Gibney.
According to the preliminary observations, the answer is clearly welcome.
Sevenins The X Factor maintained its position with a view of 1,136,000. The series appeared in church The Block (838 000) and the TBL Family series (726,000).
Sevenins The Chase Australia has been imprisoned for various reasons.

On Monday morning, The Chase Australia's first half had a average of 520,000 viewers, and the second half had a total of 720,000 viewers.
Hot Seat's watch number was 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second night watch lists showed the Nine Canal that Hot Seat is still going to be 17.30.

From the point of view of the finals, Sam Wood is actually a son of the Dreams – but who is the man who chooses?
Is the secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have revealed the choice of the son of Unelmi.
The final choice of the dream boy Sam Wood has been a very secret.
The three remaining women are not ashamed to say who's got the last move from the boy's body.
We asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows about the feelings before they were taken out of the three. The women could hardly hate who would be the winner.
Sam Woodin's voices are definitely signed up until the end of the cake.
All three women failed to see that Wood is a perfect man. Women called a man's charm, honor, family values, and positive qualities and made him an ideal partner.
When women were asked who would have my best friend Wood, if the last Russian didn't belong to him, they could give their answer to the one who took the boy's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Marcoski quickly named Mackay themselves the most suitable partner for your partner Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been in touch ever since.
"I immediately noticed that Sarah and Sam fit well together. This feeling has remained throughout the program," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah has legs on the ground, and she's really happy to follow," Markowski added.
"I've seen them together, and I have to admit that there's a chemistry between them.
They're affected by a couple of things.
Sarah Mackay likes herself and Sam Woody as a good couple.
Mackay told me that he'd win last week at a home town meeting that Wood might be the right one.
"When I saw him and my friends and family following him, I realized that this is not just cheese. I now put our relationship in perfect," Mackay said.
When Mackayl was asked who Wood should be chosen if the man didn't choose him, the woman replied respectfully:
"I can't say," he said.
"I have a lot of other girls, Sneza and Lana are equal."
The dream boy from Ten-Canavald's midweek at 7:30 p.m.

Jarryd Haynell has multiple options for starting the NFL
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayne, who had changed this to the United States, and many other followers were interested in a man after the last year's opening day.
Hayne chose San Francisco 49er and producer Jim Tomsul, and the choice appears to be the key.
Some manufacturers would have kept on Haynen's side, as a man had traveled to the Australian rupture camp on the shores.
However, Tomsula showed her trust in Haiti and gave him a new chance to return to the airport. The manufacturer was in Hainen after Reggie Bush hit.
Tomsula also continued her line after the game.
He didn't steal the results in front of the other team, but he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly defended Hayne after the game in the long press.
Specialist Cam Inman reported that Hayne also received encouragement from Specialists coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget the failure and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne's internship, Minnesota against Vikings on the first quarter of the game.
Hayne and her Australian fans were waiting for another man from the NFL-debyy.
After the failure, Hayne removed from the field and later told Hamish and Andy 2DayFM 104.1.
"They're under attack and must move forward," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the error to its debut in the State of Origin in 2007, when her land was opened to Queensland in her own territory.
Nevertheless, the experience of a 27-year-old was incredible.
Hayne would publish in Instagram a picture where she would sit together with the fans and the Australian league.
Elton John and President Vladimir Putin discuss the rights of gays

Four dead men shot by the police in various categories in Nepal
Four people died in South Nepal, the authorities told them on Wednesday.
The forces arrived on Tuesday morning in Rupande region, about 30 miles [3 km] from Katmandu, the capital.
According to the border officer Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, more than 1,000 constables were gathered outside the police station, some of which were destroyed by stones and bombs.
Dhakal told me that the police used gas and came out of the air before a quarter of a year ago.
He said twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It is not fully clear why the species that can kill but which are generally considered less destructive were so lethal.
This was a recent joint week in ongoing protests in southern Nepal, where new countries, based on the new Constitution, would undermine their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in Western Nepal, where Tharus-heim requires its own state.
At least 40 people, 11 of whom are police officers, have died in violent camps since 10 August,
where four large political parties signed a treaty on the distribution of land to communities. This is an important step towards a new constitution, but the issue is very difficult in Nepal, where governance has been concentrated for centuries.
The new Constitution has been working since 2008, but the legislative process has accelerated since the end of April when thousands of people died.
The legislators have voted in favour of the Constitution in Katmandu this week, and according to the authorities, new constitutions could be adopted until Sundays.
NHC root centre: 60% probability for the cyclone on the south side of Cape Verde
About 560 km from the southernmost part of the area of the Great Lake Cape Verde, 60 per cent of the risk is likely to develop over the next 48 hours of my cycle, reported by the National Hurricane Center.
According to the Miami Air Station, Cape Verde and the Small Antilleans also have a clear low pressure centre. It can also develop as a troupic cycle by 60 percent over the next two months.
Google is going to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced its launch of a campaign aimed at collecting 11 million dollars for humanitarian aid to organisations that help the various sides of Europe fight and put thousands of people in poverty.
Google announced the award campaign in a special personal way in its blogs.
Instead of taking the lead campaign, Google’s employee Rita Masoud began telling her own experiences. She was only seven years old at the funeral with her family in Kabul.
"We loved in the dark jungle and bus and experienced hunger, thirst, thirst and fear," Masoud wrote.
I was happy.
In a similar situation, the family facing the crisis in Europe and the transition is desperately in need of help.
The exemptions are addressed to non-target organisations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save Children ry and the United Nations Refugee Organization.
When donations have been collected to google.com/refugeereef via $5.5 million, Google allows to provide the corresponding amount, with a total amount exceeding 11 million.
The European refugee crisis is at the worst of the second world war, and the situation is particularly worsening in the Syrian quarter, which is why over four million people have been forced to leave their homes this year.
The war must also be removed from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Hypersensitivity diabetes may be associated with
According to the new study, overweight type 2 diabetes may benefit from at least five years of exercise.
However, it is too early to say whether the excess type 2 diabetess survive longer than those who receive treatment without treatment.
"Take time to get the mortality data," said Dr. Robert Blackstone, an expert in the exercise of the immune system, who discussed a new study in the JAMA Surgery.
In a meat-staining cycle, the baritarian surgery is reduced by a variety of methods.
The surgical methods reduce hunger and limit food poisoning in the body.
Over the years, barriers to treatment have been found to be effective in type 2 diabetes. However, most of the studies have involved patients with at least 35.
The weight index indicates the weight and duration of the normal value of 18.5 to 24.9.
When the weight index is more than 25, the person is overweight and over 30 is reporting significant mobility.
You can count your own weight index on 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In a new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng Hospital used data collected from 2007 in a study comparing two leanness-to-fat treatment methods, end-of-life and breast-feeding, type 2 diabetes treatments in healthy subjects.
The average weighting rate after the meat circulation decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of study.
The weight index of patients treated without interruption was maintained in recognition of 29.
Diabetes treatment improved by 36% and by 28%.
When treated in the diabetes group, only 1 percent and only 2 percent improved.
The study also found that blood pressure, triglycerides and bad LDL cholesterol were better in the treatment group.
Researchers also followed the levels of haemoglobin-A1c in patients representing the development of blood sugar levels.
According to researchers, the haemoglobin-A1c recommended levels are below 7%.
After administration, the haemoglobin-A1c was calculated at a mean level of 9% to 6%.
In the treatment group, the value remained at about 8%.
The haemoglobin-A1c value tells us about the management of blood sugar levels. However, the study group of Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsun noted that this did not reduce mortality in five years.
The study group also compared the effects of two different methods of separation.
In the fifth year, the weight loss in the end-of-life group was higher than in the end-of-life group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), the decrease in the weight index was greater (7.4 and 5.1), as well as the haemoglobin-A1c levels (3.1% and 2.1%). In the end-life group, diabetes was also significantly improved (46.9% and 16.7%).
The new study did not show a lower mortality after five years. However, according to a study by the University of Phoenix of Arizona College of Medicine, the Blackstone Swedish study was conducted in the flesh.
In a Swedish study, those who were subjected to an end-of-life arrest were at least 29 per cent of those who were treated with traditional treatment in the 15-year period compared with the group.
Although no lower mortality was found in the new study, Blackstone found that persons under 35 could benefit from measures.
"This is the most important finding of the study, as it suggests that the reduction is safe in the lower weight index group, and it does not increase the risk of bleeding or kidney disease," Blackstone wrote.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should be treated with severe stress when the weight index is 27-30.
"We expect too long that people will start to face the situation seriously," the researcher said.
"When the human body has undergone genetic changes that lead to body disease and diabetes, turning the situation into a very difficult one."
"All can't come to Europe" Dalai Lama – RT News
Europe is unable to accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama has said, and the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leadership of Tibetan Buddhistism has called for the end of violence in the homes of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the refugee crisis during a visit to the United Kingdom. Dalai Lama spoke at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion, in Oxford, which focuses on ethical research.
According to the Dalai Lama, in the present situation, humanity must continue to exist in individual countries or countries.
He also stressed that while the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis must be surprising, it must not be enough in this situation.
"It is impossible to imagine that everyone could come to Europe," Dalai said in his speech.
Although Dalai-Lama thanked Germany and Italy for their actions in the crisis situation, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
"The care of thousands of refugees is a great job, but at the same time it is worth considering long-term solutions and how we get the time to find true peace and real development in these Islamic countries, almost through education," Dalai Lama insisted.
"We must finally explain how we can reduce killing in these countries.
The use of power must be reduced.
Power machines have never solved problems," he added.
In addition to the comments made by Dalai Lama on 11 September, George Bush, in connection with terrorist attacks, said that the United States had an uncontrollable outcome when it was secured in response to the terrorist attacks.
"After the 11th of September, I expressed my concern to President Bush and told him that the solution was due to non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he protected the forces that had unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
I've been dealing with quadrupled cases in children in four years
According to the Georgian Anti-Fraud Centre, the pollutant centres in various parts of the United States are engaged in a strong alcohol consumption of nearly four-year-olds in children under 12 years of age from 2010.
According to Georg’s director, Gaylord Lopezi, the number of complaints reported to the polling centres increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014 in children under 12 years of age.
"These products are increasingly growing in children, and unfortunately some of the children have to breast-feed," Lopez told CNN.
In the end, children play handcuffs, share their influence on their friends, and part of social media.
YouTube videos contain teen-ages that drink desinfio content because of bad breath.
Others are told that a combination of desinfinated alcohols can be obtained with a taste greater than before.
Smaller children may be affected by the wear of their hands.
"Children don't think the substance is bad," said Lopez.
"Most of the attractive handicraft products have just been destroyed.
The offer contains soft handicraft products for mansica, wine and oranges that attract children."
The alcohol content of desinfiendants is 45 to 95 %.
A small number of children can cause alcohol business.
"The alcohol content of my hands is very high," the medical director of the National Hospital for Disease Control, Stephen Thornton, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
"No one would leave children’s wide-ranging whiskeys, but if the disinfection products are often left to children, they will soon get a higher amount of alcohol."
Six - year - old Nhaijah Russell enjoyed almost four years of living accommodations at school, and the girl was offered to care for the orphanage.
"The alcoholic strength of the blood was 179, which is twice as high as the adult gunman," said Dr. Chris Ritchey from the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
And he fell asleep and couldn't walk when he was brought back to bed.
Doctors followed the girl’s condition last night for brain damage at a different hospital, as the girl had lost her head and had drunk alcohol," Ritchey said.
"Your daughter was really scared," Nhaijah's mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Finally, it is recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products and disinfectants in addition to that your hands should be transferred to children’s non-cool.
In addition to the alcohol business, some of the disinfectants have been combined into fatalities.
In 2013, two Antaroisans died of handguns containing a toxic substance that had not been reported.
The health authorities considered the product’s metabolites to be lethal instead of ethyl alcohol, even though the latter has been reported to be an active substance in the product label.
According to the police report, three fourth-class students in the northern part of New York State planned to kill a "old" teacher by setting antibacterial products around the classroom in January.
The teacher is very allergic to the hands and refused to bring it into the classroom.
The police considered that the wrong plan was important and urged the school to commit adultery.
Huhumylly: do not interfere with the Celtic River
Griffith reduces the inconsistencies of the Celtic group, while Deila admits that there is no good in the group but believes in the situation she is in.
Hearts beat against SFA's punishment of Neilson, and Warburton stockings in January, so that the unity of the team doesn't suffer
Aberdeen's neck Celtici's five points
The first half of ADAM Rooney's punishment brought Aberdeen a victory from Hamilton at Pittody Stadium. He could have sent Aberdeen five points to the castle in Celtici.
Griffiths reduces speech loss
Griffiths has been involved in threats of inaction on the Celtic River. According to their own words, Griffiths and his team are not in charge when they are preparing to meet the Head of the Netherlands.
"I don't think we have any pressure. I think the players are waiting to meet.
The Dutch want an old Scottish warship – de Boer
Former Rangers' central player and Dutch national player Ronald de Boer have said that the Dutch footballers' interest in Celtici has ceased because they are no longer able to follow the two games of Celtic and Rangers.
De Boer, who works as the team leader of Ajaxi, said: "In the Netherlands, there is no place for Celtic games anymore.
Because Rangers is no longer involved."
"You're not just talking about Rangers' request.
We're talking about Old Company here.
Dutchs need two rounds between groups.
There's a lot of enthusiasm in the company's game, and they're also interesting outside Scotland's borders."
I'm going to be okay, Deila's safe.
RONNY Deila admits that Celtic has difficulty, but the Nordic team ensures that the situation will change.
Malmole lost track of over the Masters and lost ten players to Aberdeen, who now has five points of lead on the table.
"Celtic has had difficult sections before, and we will rise again," Deila said.
"We want our situation to adapt as quickly as possible.
The situation has to be very destructive, and it wakes up in many anger or rage.
So do we, but we have to keep going.
We urgently need the support of Celtic supporters, as it strengthens players significantly.
The association is very important now."
Warburton alert in January's game series
Although only a few weeks later, the Rangers-Pomo Mark Warburton ran out of players' positions in January, he is cautiously referring to the transitions and says that he wants to threaten the unity of the team.
"The events of January differ significantly from those of the summer," said Brentford ex-valminator.
"The players involved in the group are able to move into the group before the start of the course, which has been successful in this time of our assembly.
The group's going to be really good.
Sometimes unnecessary players can cause more trouble than benefits to the team."
Based on the stay at Celtic's target, Michu
Swansena attacker Michu has joined the Celtic player's talks, and on behalf of Michu, he has refused to retire after the end of the Swans agreement.
When Michun was 29 years old, he had been a vicious liar, and he did not succeed in getting a move from Wales in the summer.
Hearts prepared for the SFA presentation of Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Patterson was removed from the field. The group lost from the end 3-2. The defendant's red card was subsequently broken. There is already three Collum's red card within eight months.
However, Neilson remains behind her words. "I did not question the truth, I did not comment on what was done.
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle
Griffiths was quoted as saying that the man gave his parents the famous songs from the former Hearts player Rudi Skace.
The event took place in the pub in Edinburgh, Roseburn, before the localisation of Edinburgh in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"The result was localization, and the feeling was mild," said the attacker. "I can guarantee that I will not go back to Tynecastle except on the Celtic River."

McInnes satisfied with Hamilton's fight for fear
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen had to be brought in in an infamous manner against Hamilton in front of his seven-and-a-half curse. In order to get Aberdee hit five points in the direction of the Celtici series. It is thanks to Adam Rooney's sentence in the first half.
"There is no group of Cup or Skipper Teams that would not have won such games," McInnes said.
Unemployment in Scotland, growing in Britain
The unemployment rate remained unchanged in Scotland from May to August. The unemployment rate in the United Kingdom was 164,000.
According to the Office for National Statistics, unemployment was 5.9 per cent in Scotland when it was 5.5 per cent throughout the United Kingdom.
There are 12 000 fewer workers in Scotland than three months earlier.
The average employment rate in Scotland was 74.0 per cent per annum. The average employment rate in the United Kingdom is 73.5 per cent.
The Scottish Minister of Affairs, David Mundell, made a brief comment: "In the long-term plan of the Government, the foundation for a strong economy is established."
Almost a year ago, Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Scotland's labour market situation has improved over the past year: and unemployment has decreased.
Why are we following the attack in Oklahoma?
Later today, in order to find a legal basis for the withdrawal, we shall follow up on the resignation.
If the execution is carried out what I do not expect, I will be sitting in the detention room of the State of Oklahoma when Richard Glossip is held in the dark language.
Glossip has asked me one of the four official witnesses.
In January, I received a phone call from a man’s best friend, and despite my frustration, I responded favorably.
As the day draws closer, I'm in trouble.
Then why did I agree?
I was surprised because I thought I could tell you this about the death penalty.
The view would be unique.
Operators will be able to follow operations in the United States, and as applications are more than locations, participants will be selected at the fair value of macaber.
Oklahoma has reduced the supplier's location by 12:00.
The choice will be accompanied by the next sentence in the form of a bill.
I can't do that.
I'm sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've created a personal relationship with a man, because we've been talking on the phone for months, and one of my visits has been for two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We laugh often while we're talking.
According to the prison staff, I cannot be present both as a witness and as a supplier, so I can't take my memory and can do my memory exercises.
I just have to try to force my personal opinions.
I was accused by a Ukrainian supplier on Twitter of the threat of non-participation.
"The idea is this:
When you tell him the story in a pleasant way, you get close to him."
I gave the supplier a different point of view.
The executive acknowledged that his words could have been more careful, but still considered my actions to be wrong.
Richard Glossip has been different from some of the things I've said and written.
He doesn't know what I'm writing, and even if he's trying to figure out, I wouldn't.
I've told him that he can remove me from the witness list at any time.
However, he wants to replace an international supplier who can write about what happened.
If Glossip dies, he believes that the public is promoting the death penalty.
Huffington Poster Kim Bellware will be sitting next to me.
If you want more information on the subject, you can listen to my podcast.
I'm not going to repeat details in this connection.
I can't say Richard Glossip is guilty.
After Barry Van Trees' murder, they would have done him a favor after the crime.
I believe, however, that it is very likely that Mr. Glossip has not committed murder.
I am absolutely convinced that the evidence on the basis of the death penalty was not sufficient.
I think his performance is wrong.
From this point of view, we will follow his performance.
I can't claim to be completely independent.
The description of the non-participated can be read from other suppliers' stories.
I'll tell you what it feels like to see a man die in hell.
A man was kidnapped from Canningjo after a police officer.
Canning Valen's constituencies remained in the dark when he caught a man up from Canningjo.
The man of Perthiman's crew in your pocket, in other waters, and a few meters away, the police were able to land a man back to a dry land.
The Canning Valen police, however, received a call from an unauthorized resident in Beckenham.
When the police arrived, they found a suspect trying to punish the police by turning to Canningjoke.
But the man didn't get away.
"The man standing in the river announced that he would not come out of the water and invite the police to ask him for water," said former high-ranking officer Sragl Castledine.
Constapell Lachlan Perhavecia did not appeal to the appeal, so he chose a safer tactics – negotiation.
"In other words, the pressure can protect a person from the things that are of interest," said Colonel Castledine.
Mr. Ben Coussin's case is an interesting example.
In 2006, Cousins turned his car off to avoid police interrogation and tried to get to Swanjo on the other side.
The man's company was doomed to ruin, but the storm was eager to design the local Ben Cousins biothlon.
According to Peter Moody, the authorities were trying to get away, and he threatened to stop the competition.
Peter Moody accuses the Racing Victors of the insurance company last year. The man threatened to stop the competition immediately.
Moody claims that the authorities and the Racing Victorian charity group have attacked him personally, and the rejection of Lady Tatay due to the treatment recently given on Friday was the last one in the middle week.
Moody told Fairfax Mediale to always try to work for the sake of competition. Moody has had a difficult situation when a Cobalt was found at Lidar's show, and the man was unable to explain the finding.
Moody has kept his language in which he has been charged for years, and did not want to get involved in the activities of the guilty man.
"I didn't mean to raise the matter in front of me. I put this in a long way, but sometimes it's out of control," Moody said.
"They know what really happened."
"Somewhere has to react and accept the consequences. I must now accept the situation after I opened my mouth.
I'm going home and I'm having a good night.
I want to go anywhere, and I want horses owners to believe that I'm doing my best.
If the owners don't believe it, I won't continue as a horseman.
I would like to look at my future as a licensed supplier."
Moody dropped a bomb earlier on the Racing.com challenge, where he told the charity about the frauds of his collection.
"Five years ago Terry Baley, Dayle Brown and Brian Stewart were sitting in the same room and offering a job to a certain man for the purpose of carrying out my work. I told the man's name on request," Moody said to Racing.com.
"They clearly believe I'm a hero.
If that is the case, they'd be asked to present evidence, because I'm not allowed to hold on to anything beyond promise.
RVL's former president, Robert Roulston, RVL's current president David Moodie and RVL's current delivery director Bernard Saundry were aware of the action then and now.
Should I have the situation as a personal guide?
Should the RVL go to the facts and maintain responsibility for the situation in the area to others than the manufacturers?
Am I in trouble?
Am I really in trouble with the area?
Maybe a lot of people think so.
Maybe I should still have your license and work out of my duties, and no doubt I can think of many of my calls.
But I'm at the point that I don't care anymore.
It's really painful.
I'm going to force them to make their decision.
My family supports me, and I can get out of here."
In the long run, the study of Lidar’s cobalt values and your short-term rejection of it eventually led to the destruction of the manufacturer so that the man threatened to release his license.
Moody is known as the best-fashioned Master Black Caviar. The man described the day-to-day treatment rules to be performed after the horse's legs were set against the rules.
"The treatment is contrary to the rules.
I take full responsibility for it," Moody said.
"The person who belonged to my personality was wrong on the horse's leg.
We'd have been able to take care of them last night.
It could have been done yesterday, and so it happened.
But it happened on Friday."
Moodya may expect a three-month competition ban on the anti-hazard treatment that the organizers have started to solve.
"This is a joke.
The rules have been made by someone who doesn't know horses at all.
Everyone understands the need for rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Cobramin's coral reefs
The police have been holding the driver's license for a week, and I've been taking him out of the corridor.
The driver was taken by a helicopter to the Royal Melbourne hospital, where he got a heavy truck crashing into his Murray Valley Highway last night.
According to the police, the man who was driving my car away from my place and didn't help the driver with the irony.
On Monday, at the age of 50, a man from Nathalia called the Shepparton police.
It is likely that men are expected to be responsible for the suspension and assistance obligations in the absence of traffic accidents and other traffic accidents.
The 40-year-old driver in Cobrami's home is still in hospital care, and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm manufacturer Craig Bellamy refers to Chinese opponents' press
Melbourne Storm manufacturer Craig Bellamy considers his team to be critical of the game of the NRL as a two-year-old goal.
According to Dr. Trent Robinson, Sydney Rooster's author, the judges gave Storm's uncle to the lord of Melbourne to fight in a prison camp in Sydney on his family's birthday.
Brisbane Broncos, writer Wayne Bennett, was very concerned about the reference to Stormin Broncos to the prison office in Queensland Cowboys on Saturday morning. He called the game a fraud and said that there was no special pressure in Queensland.
Bellamy defended his team's tactics and told them only to get in touch with him.
Bellamy added that his trust in his own team added that the two teammates criticized him for his team. Bellamy considers this evidence to be a sign that the manufacturers are concerned about destroying Storm.
"This is always going to happen. I remember Trent Robinson didn't say anything when his team won us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
We have not changed in our defence system or in our technograms in any year, and we've only been put in contact papers for the last six weeks, which has made us grow.
Trent's been in charge for three years.
It is interesting that the same thing is always going to happen at the same time of the year.
Bellamy did not agree with Bennet, which is an interesting football game. He reminded the mentor that Bennet St George-Illawarra Dragons won over 2010 playing soft football.
"Wayne's talking about interesting football.
He compared his team's games to our medieval games and made them interesting," Bellamy said.
"In 2010 St. George got a lot of criticism about the play in part. Wayne admitted that the rating doesn't stop him.
Now he has a team that can play so-called football, especially his young, fast-paced.
He wants to play that football when he's a player-arsenal like that.
He insisted this year in 2010. Now he wants everyone to play his style. All teams have no central players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
I am given more self-confidence when other manufacturers are so concerned about meeting my team that they are safe like this.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think they'd meet us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that the games of Storm and Roosters made more land than in the Broncos and Cowboys.
Broncos's game was probably a good game. I haven't seen it, but what was the end? 16-12?
The end of our game was 20–18. There were more situations in our game, but is it an interesting football?
Or are toys and minors interested in football?
I think my goals are interesting.
If they mention us, we'll probably meet them."
Storm has a free weekend, as the team will be allowed to visit some North Queensland Cowboys Cronulla Sharks in the AAMI Park. The tickets will be sold on Tuesday morning.
Serbian man free of $200,000 against drug abuse
A man who looks forward to a life sentence for a total of 40 kilograms of cocaine in Queensland has been released free of charge against 200 000 dollars.
Marco Maximovic, 29, was one of five men who was arrested for the last month by the police on a hundred-hundred-dollar Solay ship that had come through the elderly from South America and arrived at Coomera in August.
The police watched the meeting of Maximovic and the criminal in the morning and surprised the two of them later from Coomera Roadhouse. At the parking lot, 40 kilos of drugs were found from Toyota Echo's car.
Although Maximovicia may expect a life-threatening drug to be controlled for commercial purposes, a man's lawyer says there is no evidence that his boss would have tried to get his full control of his son, but he could have been in a coffee shop for no apparent purpose.
According to Judge Peter Flanagan, there is a risk that Maximovic will try to escape the country.
"Maximummovic is clearly connected to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia several times," the judge said on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police at his place of residence."
Maximovic's mother and father paid together 200,000 dollars against which man was released.
"After I have seen the obvious evidence of both persons, it is clear that $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," Dr. Flanagan said.
"It is not, however, alone enough to stop a man's getting away," the judge warned.
Maximovic was released on condition that he leaves Australia and Serbia's passport, informs the police daily and stays at home from morning to morning.
Stefan Hogg used the girl's phone to send pictures of pedophiles
Pedofil used a 11-year-old girl’s phone to obtain photos of her management in which the children are being used.
Stefan Hogg took the phone to the girl's bed and wrote to the online mail service where he got another user to send himself inappropriate pictures of children.
Later, the girl wakes up to see your phone missing, and you see it sleeping in Hoggin's hands.
When she said the contents of her phone, the girl found a texting message and immediately told her mother about it.
Five of these photos were reported to the police. After examining the evidence, the computers found that the police found disturbing Internet requests that have been used to search for unaccompanied children.
Hogg told the police that they were trying to lead the pedophiles on the Internet and that the police who presented them were trying to scare the pedophiles.
Prosecutor Eilid Robertson said in the local court at Dundee Sheriff Court: "The man claimed to be dependent on the fear of people.
He admitted his injuries on the computer, but he claimed that he was acting so as to introduce the police and thus be afraid of pedophiles.
Hoggil was asked about discussions with an unknown person who had sent pictures to him and who had asked for more pictures.
Hogg claimed that his purpose was to lead the pedophiles to their fate.
He told me that he was getting disturbing thoughts in his hair and that he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: "When you found messages on the phone, the girl cried to her mother with tears and tears."
The girl saw inappropriate images on the phone, after Hoggia was heard.
The girl told the accused computer and Playstation to talk to herself very much with the girls who appeared younger.
23-year-old Hogg Dundeen Ward Road acknowledged charges for the detention of unaccompanied children on 14 June last year. Hogg broke his release on 25 January this year and left it unreachable to hear the case on 24 March this year.
Defence assistant Gregor Sim asked Hoggia not to look at the sexual record, as it could be seen that there were no significant sexual features involved in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael appealed to the Court on the basis of social work reports in October.
Hoggy was granted freedom to learn against this matter, but he was held responsible for other reasons in the course of his investigation.
Hogg was added to the register of sexual offenders before the date of publication of the judgment.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe has the wrong voice in Parliament
The former head of state of Africa, Mugabe, died in a traffic jam this year.
Mugabe didn't get upset, but the video was spread quickly on social media.
Parliament's openings also protected the claims of the opposition legislators that they have received no mention of the killings in which they are warned to defeat Mugabel during his speech.
In the last month, the representatives of the People's Republic of the Republic of the United States were standing up and suspended by mid-morning in the Parliament on the situation of the President's State.
The MDC movement for Democratic Change (Innocent Gonesse) identified the texts of the seven opposition policies, which call for them to be without disturbance to Mugaben's speakers.
"The message has been sent to an unknown number, but the message's search is "to die," Gonese told the publishers after Mugaben spoke.
The message warns the recipients that representatives outside Parliament are no longer within the scope of immunity.
According to the Polish summit, the side of Morgan Tsvangira is concerned about the threats posed by politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces even 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard intends to reduce 25 000-30 000 jobs as part of the reorganisation and rescue activities of the company.
HP will be distributed to the two companies later this year and will distinguish between the faster growth of the computer and the resulting business.
According to the HP report, the company is writing on the regular cost of $2.7 billion since the fourth anniversary.
"Renewable arrangements allow for a more competitive and sustainable cost-effective new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said HP delivery director Meg Whitman, who leads the company after distribution.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more focused HP company, and we have large and heavy portfolio businesses that help companies move into a new type of business." Whitman said.
"Our own company is better than ever and we are better able to respond to the needs of our customers around the world."
The Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover is over $50 billion and the company concentrates on providing unique integrated technology solutions to companies according to its mission.
Stanford University grew up in Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in the 1930s. Both founded electronic rentals in Palo Alto, now known as Piilaakson.
HP has made massive reorganizations when moving mobile devices from traditional mode of communication.
Second, the world's largest computer manufacturer and the largest technology companies in the United States are new changes in the field of transition, which believe that focusing on success is a success.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta: The team must support the dedication of Jack Wilsher before meeting Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed to Wilsher that it's September, and if it's all working out, there's no reason why he can't go back to the field in December.
The best possible scenario means that Willshere must certainly leave between at least four of the following English field games. The man's history of his involvement in European cross-border competitions is clearly unclear.
The biggest problem of the problem is that Wilsher decided strongly after the last move and seemed to return to his previous career under the new road.
"That's not a threat to you," Wenger said.
"The moon didn't improve well.
That's not a serious mistake.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't connected to his jokes or his most important jokes."
Medically, this may be the case, but as Wengerki said, more than enough can come when the player tries to get back to the field in the middle.
This is also an obvious lack of regularity.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different problems since Wilsher started six years ago.
He also played in the Arsenal River only at 65, 157 passengers in the last five years.
The broader picture of Arsenal is that from 2007 to 2008, from six to eight years ago, the group was the second of the groups that lost money because of the cut-offs.
Wenger accepts the possibility of an accident, but Arsenal believes that the recently improved divorce rate will continue to develop in a better direction.
"Sometime after the divorce, a period of time that may be affected can be associated with a period where the body is to be established and competition authorities are to be sought," Wenger said.
"Jack's young, so he can figure this out.
I hope he gets his body balanced. I believe it, and after that, his urine continues to be the one he deserves."
Arsenal begins his tour of the Mestres by midweek against Dinamo Zagreb. After that, the team will meet in Chelsea on Saturday and in Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday. Wenger prepares small changes to the assembly.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely starting.
Wenger can also hold an initial meeting at Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroudin Nacho Montreal and Theo Waldo.
"I try to take care of the team's balance and allow time for it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal has a clear approval for the continuation of the F group, Maximir Zagreb has the most feariest stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has also been unbeatable for a team of 41 games.
Stadonia was treated on Tuesday morning, when she cried out at 3.2 Richter's asterisk.
The sequence was ten in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned about the last time he went to visit Monaco, and he continues to encourage him to hope the team for Europe's masterhood.
"We have a great amount of energy," Wenger said.
"Arsenal has not yet read this title.
We were very close in 2006. On the other hand, I am also realistic with the experience.
We're proud, but we're not dreamers."
FriendsFest: a comedian who taught us the truth about friendship between men
The same description is remarkable in other areas, especially when it is noted that men need to open up is greater than ever and that suicides among young men are higher than 15 years of age.
In 2013, suicide was the most significant murder of men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom. The suicide is three times more common among men than among women.
Campain Again Living Miserably (CALM) is faced with the problem of advertising for men in 2015. The campaign seeks to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help.
Friendship is the basic idea of challenges.
In a recent study, 2,000 students were challenged. According to the study, there are better possibilities for improvement in the immune system if there are enough healthy people around them.
In addition, the probability of disease of people with no symptoms was defended if there were people who do not have mental health problems near them.
However, they are all fundamentally friendly.
The current message dominates social media, and the message style is often more important. Fast reaction is often considered more important than important contacts.
As a result of the digitalisation of life, it is necessary to have a strong, healthy and successful double impact, even though separation is real.
The values, money, image and social status that will be associated with the wonderful success of the world, all of which will take into account internal values and natural personal growth and friendship in our lives. Internal values will affect our mental health.
One million of the video games recently claimed that money can't really buy happiness.
Freddie's beauty was that the line turned to the top of the point.
No one in the series was defined as a professional, but according to personality, this was seen in friendly relationships.
In the series, Joey and Chandler were humorously presented on TV watching or watching football on TV. We also saw Ross often in love with Rachel. It was clear that men were able to do this even though they didn't like to be fully aware of it.
One volunteer explained this to me: "When I hear tired and self-sustained people have come to me to see how many of the least of my friends' reactions can be significant.
The men who communicate with us are often unable to talk to their friends.
The natural idea that men belong to the body is strong, and a man is easily regarded as weak if he is talking about his problems."
"Frend is one of the series of long-term solutions.
A few moments of friendship between men was emphasized in the series.
Through the phone, I can offer help from outside the disabled moment, but long-term support is obtained from the close-up of friends and family."
Comedy Central FriendsFest in honor of the series has been resurrected to life. If you participate in this weekend, you will be encouraged to take your friends to Central Perki.
Or do something better... for smiles and health if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks.
I never know how important a friendship relationship can be.
Comedy Central sends the entire series of Friends – all 236 sections – #FriendsFest
Di Marian's uncle helped the PSG cook Malmön
Angel Di Maria celebrates Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan for the day against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria succeeded in painting the Mesterian over-debity and helped the PSG to find the Malmö Red Cross team.
Read the file report and the evaluation.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were in the memory when Paris Saint Germain began his work on the Maternal Cross in the Malmö Parc des Princes Stadium.
Di Maria made a day when the debut game was played less than four minutes ago. She confirmed the position of the French meteors immediately at the time of their arrival. However, PSG was able to save several landscapes before they finally were able to increase their influence: Cavani's landscape when the game was played 60 minutes.
In section A, there are also Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so PSG needed a strong base against Sweden's Master. PSG not only aims to continue in the box games, but also wants to improve its positions in the remaining three rounds.
Although SPG hit points, the appointment was not a perfect demonstration of Laurent Blanc's trusted team. Zlatan Ibrahimovic broke down the landing site and the man had to change when he was in his previous home, where the man started empty urine in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or in the neighborhoods, so 2 to 0 will give us a good foundation, even if we still have lost the treasure of the way," Blanc said.
"This knows well.
We were able to win, and we were able to do so, but unfortunately we couldn't go to one or two extra countries."
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after the strike. The group had to meet with Ligue 2-2 in the line of Bordeaux. However, she left Ibrahimovic in the shadow for four minutes.
In the last month of the Manchester United States, the ANGRA was appointed as a PSG decision-makers, which will lead the team to a new level in Europe. He proved to be a valuable reputation in thanks to the Palon Marco Verratt of Malmö's diet, and then he set up an accurate country to return to the end of Johann Wiland.
However, those waiting for PSG's threat had to be disappointed.
Malmö painted Celtic in the boxing games, marched to the field nine international level players from the start. Five men's defense and two attackers' tactical team had to be hard to overcome.
Nikola Djurdjizic's victory went unhindered by Kevin Trapp in 34 minutes from the back of the game. The group didn't attack very actively.
Instead, the PSG created a broken and failed finalization, and not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five lands in only the first half of the world. Right at the beginning of the second half, Ibrahimovic broke down the ground to the ruins of Cavani.
However, Ibrahimovic showed his knees in the firefights. From the food of Ibrahimovic Di Maria, he shot a roundabout of Wildan's end in 52 minutes.
The second country was born in Cavan's time because of Cavan. Six years later, a game of routing shot a perfect shot when Ibrahimovic hit him on the left side of Maxwell's gun.
The Malmö bridge ended up on another land, and only after the nearby Wiland of Wiland, David Luiz, had to be shot in the battle, and the Ezequiel Lavez was rejected by the very end of the tunnel.
Malmö created Åge Hareide after acknowledging that PSG was his own class. "We played over the previous Masters' game last December.
Since then, we've only played in the street of Sweden, where the level is not the same.
I don't know. The anger isn't enough.
I'm sorry about the Parisians.
This was a kidnapping of them."
Glencore collects $2.5 billion in share
The Swiss mining company Glencore, which tested the prices of raw materials, collected $2.5 billion in mid-week share as part of its debt reduction strategy in the United States.
According to Glencore, listed in London's stock, the new shares were sold at about 1.6 billion dollars to reduce debt.
The market value of the company decreased by 57 per cent this year. The company weighed with the price reduction of raw materials when China's economy was affected by demand and market difficulties.
By the end of the session, Glencore's part of the conference had taken place in London in the middle of the week as the beginning of the week.
The share increased by 2.77% to 131.60 pens in the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 percent.
Last week, Glencore announced a return of $2.5 billion as part of a strategy to reduce its debt of $30 billion.
The company sold new shares of 125 pounds at a price of 2.4 per cent of the total closing price.
The company has set up 1.3 billion shares, with a common value of up to 9.99 per cent of the total group.
Concerned about the continued decline in China's economy, it is more likely that the price would be reduced to half, while the drop in coal, copper and other benefits would have been 20 to 40 per cent.
The white house strengthens Xi Jinping's Washington tour
The White House, in its published Communication, states that President Xi Jinping is travelling to the U.S. state office at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping will arrive at the first official visit to Washington on 25 September. This is in response to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November.
Following the two international discussions of Heads of State, United States President and Vice-President Michelle Obama arranges Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan, to attend the public service at night.
"The visit of President Xi Jinping to the United States and China to extend cooperation in the global, regional and bilateral areas of interest to both sides of the United States and China. Similarly, President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping have an opportunity to discuss the issues that are of special importance," says the White House Communication.
Xi Jinping's visit was announced for the first time in February, and he is expected to meet several U.S. technical leaders in Seattle.
Obaman and Xin are expected to address many critical issues, such as the claim by Washington to China on cybercrime and the increasing activity of the country in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon reduces diversity in the film
Matt Damon had a pleasant conversation with an African-American Effie Brown, and he realized that there was no need for diversity behind the camera.
In the HBO Project Greenlight series on Sunday morning, the sampler stopped Brown when this explained how important it is to take into account the different views of the project's selected manual for dark head.
"The majority is taken into account in the role of the film, not the role of the programme," Damon said.
Brown had been shot as a tyrant and a liar. "Wow, clear," the woman said after Damon's comment.
Damon and Brown were together with the other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers to discuss the finals of the pie.
"Whoever is a leader, I would like to encourage you to think about how the Harmony myth is presented," Brown said on board.
"The only dark-fashioned joke is a prostitute who has sex with her white partner."
The producer of the Dear White People supported Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancuccita as film director. Damon firmly replied that the two choices could lead to an unmanaged conclusion.
When the debate was presented on television, the social media released Damon’s negative comments.
The Twitter user Mr.Pooni, expressing his conviction at the meeting, said, "The fact that Matt Damon speaks only of a dark person to explain what diversity is is is is so important that he makes hair."
The two were divided over 5,000 times, and that was worth 4,000 times.
Damon's comments are at a time when a balanced representative of human beings in the media has a common theme.

"The amount of the war is unbelievable, as I have never known more than $10,000 in a year," he said in his E! questionnaire.
"At last, I can't even imagine what the future will be like."
The producer in question, Kent Weed, spoke to The Hollywood Reporter in a fine way and why Britain does not pay, even though he was the first competitor who has solved all the tasks.
According to the rules, the payrolls will soon be won.
If more competitors find out all the tasks, weed will soon win," explained.
"The church is indeed wonderful and enriches life, but Britten also finds satisfaction in doing so.
I don't think he's gonna get hurt more.
He's just happy to do it.
He's got a lot of over-the-fashioned overboard.
Britten is a great guy whose family is important.
His children and his wife think of him as a saint.
Geoff told me that because he didn't win himself, he just wanted Isaac to win.
He also believes that Isaac would have thought of him the same if your situation had been different."
America Ninja Warrior was renewed to eight times, where the pictures begin in the spring of 2016.
