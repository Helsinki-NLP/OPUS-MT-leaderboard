Prussian bursa at the end of trade has fallen to a minimum
After the early fall, the Pursian burs had been stricken with losses.
Transactions with ČEZ shares reached almost half of the ordinary daily trade.
The Prague bursa was right from the start of yesterday's trade on its Sunday break when it was about six percent.
This time, there's a drop in stock on Wall Street.
We have also seen market reactions as a result of the vote of the US High Representative, who refused to support the stabilization plan of the foreign financial sector.
Share rate in Asia
The dramatic fall in the afternoon hit the stock market in Asia, even though the indexes were lost in part of the day.
In Hong Kong, the index of Hong Seng burzys gave up almost four percent during the trading period, but later lost part and reduced the decrease to 2.5 percent.
The index Hong Seng China Enterprises, which monitors the movement of Chinese shares in Hong Kong, was estimated to be 3.8 per cent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The shares in Sydney were lost more than five per cent, but the losses were finally reduced to 4.3 per cent.
The storm on the Thaj-wan according to the dark index is 3.6 per cent.
"The timing of the rescue action in the United States is uncertain and affects the financial market all over the world," noted the head of the Hong Kong Trade Authority, Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although it is part of China, the change policy is determined independently, without any dependence on the Chinese Central Bank.
The Hong Kong annual rates are at the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudda, the US legislators should quickly return to the meeting and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise, it's too dangerous that the consequences will be felt by other countries.
U.S.A.'s blood vessels
The U.S. Snémovna rejected the financial system's support plan on Monday, which was expected to cost up to $700 billion (about 12 billion Kč).
The legislators therefore ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the underlying causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the whole economy.
The American shares in the afternoon survived a blood transfusion and the main stock indexes reported the largest fall for more than 20 years.
Down Jones's index was about seven percent and the same rate of loss was recorded last year in 1987.
The index was already in motion before the vote, but as soon as it was shown that the proposal did not go smoothly, the index appeared in a free fall.
Congress: The U.S. government can pump 700 billion dollars to the bank
The largest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed to a broader form of financial assistance agreement for the American financial system.
He'll be voted for in the beginning of next week.
The U.S. legislators conducted half-life discussions on the approval of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance for the US financial system of $700 billion (about $12 billion).
But it's not yet won.
Congressmen must conclude some details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The financial system's support plan will be implemented under the shadow of the representatives in the afternoon.
On Sunday, the Reuters agency said this to the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, Barney Frank.
According to sources, the Senate could vote on the plan first in the middle.
According to the economies, it should be noted that the adoption of a rescue plan is the first major psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
Then, however, it comes to "disturbing" thanks to the complexity of the mechanisms that help markets achieve even in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have resolved our different views on how to look like a package to stabilize the market," said the Bloomberg Democrat Nancy Pelosie.
According to her, the final vote could take place on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met with the US finance minister Henry Paulson on Sunday to provide the government fund with a definitive basis.
This should buy from financial companies non-producing mortgage assets that result in serious losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are on the ground of a definitive plan agreement that will work and must also be effective on the market.
It's still supposed to be in a healthy plan, but I think we're there," said Paulson.
Asian trade signal
The global financial crisis has a strong impact on the stock markets that break the gap.
According to Russian Democratic Senator Harry Reida, legislators are trying to reach a final agreement on Sunday in Congress.
They therefore want to calm down investors before trading in Asian financial markets, which are in the first instance in time, where the decision of the Congress could have a bearing on the southern trade.
However, it is not yet clear when the two chambers of the U.S. Congress will vote on the law, nor will they be able to vote on any problem at the latest.
Lawyers hope he'll be approved in the next few days.
However, the law is still subject to a series of changes.
The total amount assigned to the aid system shall be divided into two parts.
The original $350 billion should be available as soon as possible as President George Bush requested.
But Congress can block the release of remaining shares if it has the idea that the program does not complete its function, followed by another $100 billion and later $350 billion.
Bush assessed progress in meetings
The President of the Network may take this decision, but Congress may vote in favour of it.
In spite of these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme, which was to obtain funding for the recovery of bad mortgage securities, was lost because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages.
"We've done everything.
The shadow representatives should be able to vote on the law Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The US President Bush is also pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto stated that Bush is calm with Saturday's progress and appreciates "the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of gold floods
The President of the Banking Committee of Senate Christopher Dodd, the co-ordinator, said that the legislators agreed to take responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers from loss, the closure of profits, the timing of financing of the plan.
The new law also has to limit so-called gold fines for directors of the company's participants to the programme and shall set up a committee that will have oversight over the fund.
This should lead the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this and have made great progress towards the agreement that will work and be useful for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan is also calculated with the help of house owners who have problems with payment.
The government should make new payments to mortgages that it purchases with a view to reducing monthly payments for creditors and allowing them to leave their homes.
Marek: Psychological Assistance
The proposed plan is based on the main economy of Patria Finance David Mark with a good idea, very difficult but will be carried out.
"And that's because you don't know what mechanism and what price the problem assets will buy.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and government will divide losses between themselves," said this week for the iHNed.cz Marek server.
If the plan is approved now, or at the beginning of the next week, it is not so essential in Mark's opinion.
"It is much more important that the conventioners now agree that this plan is supported and that its mission will be the first to do so.
This psychological significance of the agreement to come to approval is now the most important thing," Marek stressed.
Shot on sharp knife: MP3 player against mobiles.
We'll find out how to choose.
While almost every cell is able to play MP3 files, no MP3 player is able to call.
It seems clear that it's better to buy just a phone.
Still, there are enough reasons for man to organize himself as a private player.
The choice depends entirely on how to use and how to control the future owner.
You'll probably find it hard to manage a fancy gramophone to listen to the latest album Maxim Turbulenc.
However, such music products on LP boards do not exist and there is no objective reason for this.
However, if your rules involve art rock, iron or blues, you are likely to eat at least on such a gramphone.
It's the same with music on the streets, so the music is complicated, simple - the music in MP3.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For someone, it can be unacceptable to lose for the player eight thousand crowns, just like the Pink Floyd fan, it's probably hard to test the audience for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It also decides to maintain the battery.
Some Spike Music Players will manage much more than just playing music, but what most mobiles don't find.
No current device is as universal as a phone.
According to primary functions, telephone and entertainment, he can play music and videos, both play, he has better photos, and he can navigate here.
And if we take in the power of smartphones and comms, you'll have a cap and a small computer.
It's a little surprise, because no refrigerator can watch and no TV can photograph anything.
The universality of the cell is also the result.
The more mobile functions you use, the sooner your display indicator will be sent to the offerer.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy shouts.
The small cell phone can play music longer than ten hours, most of which is much less.
In this direction, musical players (especially the simplest) are much more efficient.
In left cell phones, therefore, count on them not to play for a few hours.
If you're still calling here and there, go to work for security, another offer - it pays for expensive equipment.
You won't have this problem with MP3 players, and the tops will hold at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation at one time.
Another problem arises when recording music to the cell.
Unfortunately only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connection, and not all of them can directly connect to computers without special software.
Of course, music can be stored directly on a memory card, but only a small card reader will be able to provide advice with minimal memory cards that are used in mobile phones.
You do not need any special software in Players until the exception (iPod).
It's enough to fill in the music via USB from the computer.
Most mobiles and players are already creating a musical library based on the name of the interpreter, the name of the album, the genre or the user rating.
Some devices display only a tree structure of the addressees as well as a Windows Explorer and some are both capable of using both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with the operating system).
Players can work, mobiles can do more
In selecting a specific device, include the maintenance of the battery, memory capacity, quality and sound output type and, of course, the control comfort.
If your music is first played and if you will listen to it every day just a short time in the tramway, you will have any cell phone that plays MP3.
Which can actually do almost any cell phone.
You don't have to watch too much what music formats your cell phone or player is capable of.
The MP3 will manage all and the simple majority of the music that will be delivered to you will be in this format.
It belongs to the most widespread and, besides it, most of the equipment is in possession and music in the WMA format.
Less AAC is available (formerly used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobiles also enable, for example, to buy online music.
It is enough to visit the operator’s (or other provider’s) website via the mobile internet and buy a song or album.
This service could already be an argument for the control of the singing cell itself.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is poor and limited to most of the fast-paced radio.
The prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally assumed that this method of selling music (whether via GSM, the Internet or wireless internet) will lead to the future of the music industry.
Most people still carry their cell phone.
Whenever you get to listen to something, your cell phone is in your pocket, while the MP3 player is lying in the house.
Still, it depends on whether you also wear an earphone or at least a wire handle.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has almost every cell, but only a minimum MP3 player.
Probably the greatest benefit of music mobiles will be for many prices.
The lowest is usually less than three thousand.
For three and four thousand crowns, you'll already have a very good walkman.
Most of the time, however, you will be limited by the absence of an output to a regular audience.
The best and most affordable telephones on the technical site and with 3.5 mm front cover for the ordinary audience are up to fifteen thousand.
The outcome of the players is also an easy service.
You're the easiest - no matter what it takes (see our choice) - the player has the power to really control everyone.
At least the function, the sort of control with the old regular recorder or the need for a gramphone is visible.
There is no threat of collisions in the form of an error on the mobile Internet and then a bad account for data transfer.
Which device to use
And the most cheap mobiles (e.g. Vadaphone 527) have slots on alternate memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
And with the purchase of the appropriate cards, you're going to get to two thousand crowns.
But take care.
Only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported in basic models.
Except for the most expensive ones with 8 GB memories.
If you already have your cell phone and you want to buy a low-level MP3 player, you can download Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
According to capacity (max. 2 GB) you must not lose more than 1,100 kroner.
If you are looking for more advanced audiences, you would prefer to use specialized mobile phones - walkmanes (Sony Ericsson, some Nokie and Samsungy).
These devices have self-control button for MP3 and the service comfort is so close to the private MP3 player.
It is not far from the area of Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles from a variety of walkman have a definite user range as a self-sustained MP3 player.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand kroner, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a battery (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), will lead you to MP3 players from the above characters.
The first virtual operator comes to Česka already in the year.
Maybe
The mobile market in Czech is relatively successful and our operators offer practically all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Still, there's something missing here - a virtual operator that would make the classics fall apart.
Maybe it won't be long.
We have written on Mobile.cz several times about the fact that the common operators are the most expensive in Europe.
Finally, he confirmed this too, which warned us that the price of SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission on the field of roaming fees regulation, it may come to a paradox situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, text messages from abroad will be cheaper than home.
How is it possible to maintain prices in Czech compared with Europe so high?
The answer is simple, missing competition, which would really want to go to war.
Maybe it sounds paradoxically, we have three mobile networks and pentrations higher than 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, are glad to see that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this way, they are often called by the President of the Czech Telecommunications Office (CHT), Paul Dvorák, who in the past has repeatedly stated that there is no place for another operator in Czech.
It's probably true that a classic operator with its own network is no longer likely to have too much chance (lastly, he's probably just looking for frequency).
But there is another possibility - a virtual operator.
The entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has resulted in a significant reduction in prices, which have to be responded to by classical operators.
Immediately before the entry of a ticket such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, there were similar voices on the market in Great Britain as we do.
But it turned out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
Finally, we don't have to walk too far for examples.
During the year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual Mobilking operator in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator was allowed to acquire more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator in the country.
In addition to Mobilking, there is the Penta financial group, which is located in Czech with its own outside the U:fonna.
The outcome of virtual operators is an opportunity to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, they still have a lot less customers than a classic operator.
They also bring relatively high costs to the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators are usually profiled as low-costs - offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often assessed by the offer of services.
So Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS at least half the cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, there can be quite a good place and a seat on an undisputed target group.
This operator is also referring to men's specifics.
"Right-wing guys like Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It's hard to say if a concept like that could be taken from us in Poland.
The Czech market is relatively small for the segment approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, the service offers are relatively contented."
In Czech without a chance, mobile operators call it.
But it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in Czech, it won't be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in Czech it does not seem too promising.
It is more likely to land Mobilking in other countries of our region," said Jana Studničkė, a press spokesman of the Penta financial group.
She did not just confirm that the existing mobile operators in Czech society are not strongly influenced by this opinion.
On the other hand, he's trying to do everything to prevent any potential competitor.
I am interested in launching a virtual mobile operator for a longer time by the GTS Novera group, which would therefore like to take another step towards becoming a real O2 telephone competitor on the company customer field.
"We have great interest in offering our customers not only strong but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner it gets, the better it gets.
We have repeatedly discussed this opportunity with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have already been able to proceed in meetings," says the press group Paul Kaidl.
So maybe it's getting closer to better times.
It seems from informal information that we should wait for the first virtual operator at the end of the year.
In time, however, his appearance carries out an endless series of silences.
"At this moment we are not sure that there is a place on the Czech market for the creation of a fully-qualified virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific to the other markets.
After all, no entity has spoken to us with a complex and serial project in this area," he said in his statement for Mobile.cz Vlastimil Sršýn from the Press Committee Phone O2.
Other operators are also calling for the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile Martin Kemrova provides in a very familiar way with O2: "We have not yet recorded any viable and extremely useful business project, which could be further created."
And he adds: "In the T-Mobile network, some virtual operator appears hard at the end of the year.
At this point, we should already have a specific agreement on the table so that it can be considered in this brief horizon."
Vodafone is more attentive to the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepicý says: "We are open to potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
That's exactly what we're looking at as customers as the most important.
Vodafon's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for quick mobile internet."
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The process of mobile operators can easily be understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, leading to a decrease in prices and even a decrease in their profits.
Why, then, facilitate access to such competitors?
The fact that when it comes to something, the operators will be able to draw up a single process, witness and seal around the U:phone.
Almost the biggest pressure towards ČTU went in time to U:phone from T-Mobile company.
The information on this is publicly available on the CTU websites.
But now the U:fon is acting as an argument why not allow a virtual operator.
Martin Kemrov said to this effect: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been strengthened by the entry of a fourth mobile operator into the market.
Given the character of the mobile market in the PRC, it is clear that the entry of another player to it and, above all, to his service, would meet high requirements."
In view of this access by mobile operators, however, it is quite disturbing that the Czech regulatory authorities are not interested.
It is not just about the position of the Czech Republic - unlike the Great Britain and other developed countries - that does not have the power to intervene in economic competition.
They belong exclusively to the Authority for the Protection of Economic Competition (OECD).
But this guy took his typical position on the whole problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the contract between a mobile operator and a virtual operator for the purchase of the necessary infrastructure has been concluded.
No such contract was recently concluded, as the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not of sufficient interest to classical operators," Kristian Chalupa of the Committee of Foreign Relations of the UOHS pointed out in answer to our question.
It is likely that such a formal statement will not be interrupted by the representatives of operators.
The Authority that is to represent consumer interests and, above all, to ensure that no one abuses their position on the market is more than considered.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In a foreign country where virtual operators usually operate, we can note that their entry into the market has contributed to a reduction in prices for mobile telephone services."
Of course, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the decrease in prices does not apply to the interests of the EAFRD.
In fact, shockingly, it is up to three mobile operators to discover their reaction.
The question, if it's really just an accident, it's all about itself.
Just like the exact same price of petrol in pump stations, it is certainly only part of the accident and a strong competitive fight.
"The Authority has not looked for signs of anti-competitive conduct on this matter and therefore has no reason to do so in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position, so they do not have an increased responsibility for their market management.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market for virtual operators are most likely also available to the telecommunications regulator," said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Understandably, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the PRC, according to which telecommunications from the point of view of economic competition is the only market.
Of course, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position on this market.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - that a virtual operator will always need a network operator's consent.
And the mobile operator - he has all logic - on his network monopol.
So in a particular segment it must be dominant.
Even if we do not agree with this argument, the EESC should be at least cautioning that three mobile operators act in a similar manner.
In addition to the difficulties of a number of stakeholders (including those mentioned by GTS Novera) it is shown that all operators are exposed to very similar obstacles.
The recognition of responsibility to the ČTU is then in telecoms relatively normal trick which the EAGGF grants from the full attention of the hands away.
We've met him in a few similar cases.
Unfortunately, the newly adopted new telecoms law did not allow the extension of the power of the TEC in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, even though a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
This must be more than good to the representatives of the Commission, but they are obviously interested in each other.
That's when no one's watching.
The operation of any pseudo-virtual operators currently exists in Czech mobile networks without any attention.
These are companies that issue their own prices of mobile telephone services, but are only partially public.
Usually it's about a multilevel marketing company.
Your own mobile phone services so offer Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others.
The prices of these companies will usually only be made available to the eligible company.
Kouzlo is counting on the company against the operator to act as a classic company customer who orders a large amount of SIM card.
The customer will then receive special prices (and other) offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar transfer.
"If the cases you're talking about were to arise, we could talk about breaking the terms of the contract that we'd like to have, and we could end up working with that company," Martin Kemrov answered our question on this issue.
It is unlikely, however, that a similar activity would not be carried out to responsible people from mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three mentioned companies, thousands of customers may be involved.
None of the operators will be protected by such a procedure.
As a result of the activities of these companies, they have the inevitable profits, and therefore, unlike actual virtual operators, they are not at any risk to their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepicý cautions on possible problems: "The law allows similar speculation, however, only the services of these companies are used by the customers.
They must also accept that SIM cards on their phone are not named, therefore they cannot be fully available as regular customers of mobile operators."
That's right, but it should be at least weird.
In addition, further questions will be raised for the EAGGF.
If mobile operators rely on a similar procedure, why are they blocking the output of a virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that the EAGGF has a relatively strong power to detect similar activities, and if it does not wish, it must not be satisfied with the explanation of operators that they have no such thoughts and their trading conditions prohibit it.
When we're not the most expensive
As the text has fallen several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a significant decrease in service prices.
At the same time, in all countries where virtual operators have emerged, classical operators have tried to protect their performance more or less.
The arguments used by Jimi were practically correct - too small, possibly too complicated a market, problems with quality of service, etc.
In successful countries, however, the regulatory authorities, who have never raised the interests of mobile operators, but their customers, have come to power right now.
Whether formal measures or non-formal pressures have already resulted in the emergence of the first virtual operator and other charges.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities are taking over the whole case as a hot brake.
From our experience, we cannot escape the idea that incompetence in these cases is more than an hour.
But let's not get a flint into the ice.
If the back-up information is correct and the virtual operator is really soon to show up, the Czech mobile market may re-exist.
If one of the operators has allowed the presence of a virtual mobile operator, it will only be difficult to maintain the power of the EAFRD to reject (discrimination) other stakeholders.
And we need to stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
A new Czech nymna has four new versions.
Choose the best here
Listen to four new versions of Czech state himms.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek, on the occasion of the Czech state Day, presented the new recordings of state himny Kde at my home.
Hymnu re-played the orchestra of the National Festival under the direction of Jiří Bélohlävka.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo music, in the congregational presentation and instrumentation.
The song was taken by Catherine the Queen and Adam the Plachetka.
Authors for the repair of the hems are Father Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
The white man considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
In the Czech Republic, he had previously said that he had chosen to choose to sing the solo variants of songs with young representative voices that are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried both, and then I also tried to force the congregation to have a clear Dictionnaire, so that the text could be well understood to be understood," he said.
In the next year, the Czech state gym celebrates the 175th anniversary.
The song Where my house first appeared in 1834 on the steps of the Stavovské divatla in the original Czech game Fidlovačka Joseph Kajetán Tila added by Františka Škroupa.
She's got a popularity, and people took her for themselves.
The first song was then sung after the birth of Československa in 1918, which became a natural part of the state gymnasium.
One of the seven symbols remained after the birth of the independent Czech Republic.
What's New Hymn's like?
Prague MHD in the middle of the first link and on the chip
Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be recorded in the event of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the subway, tram and buses arrive at the first passenger passenger, who will have the place of the paper train in an electronic coupon.
At this point, he can arrange a funeral for hundreds of thousands of people who own the Opencard card.
Travellers can buy 30 days and 90 days and annual coupons (which will be paid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time allow you to play on your chip card in the info centres and workshops of the Transport Company in the Metro station Museum, Museum, Museum, Nádazií Holešovice, Angel, Roztyly, Latvia, Kobylis, Rajská garden, Kacherov and Luka.
Purchases can also be bought from yesterday through the Internet at www.dpp.cz.
In the afternoon service was used by four customers.
Those who start using the Internet trade can definitely forget the exit window in the subway stations where they have to be in the long fronts on paper trains.
The buyer buys it over the Internet and they play it on the Opencard map in one of the thirty districts of the City Library.
"In these places, there is a barrier with a trained service that helps stakeholders to buy the Internet and also plays a purchased coupon on their card," said project speaker Martin Opatrný.
According to the book, you will also be able to play electronic shopping on Opencard in self-service cars that are mounted in several swivel meters.
How do these machines look?
They are red, they remember the landmarks of the train and may already be seen in the stations Roztyly, Budéjovicá, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"They are not in the city five, but by the end of the year they should be 80," added the Watchman.
The coupon controls the driver's position automatically
The service of machines that start working tomorrow is simple.
It's enough for them to insert an OpenCard chip card and the previously paid coupon will be played on it itself.
Electronic purchases from the morning are paid not only in the main city but also in its surroundings.
Thus, in urban trains and bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, the city's main inhabitants of the Middle East.
"In the trains included in the Prague Integrated Transport, the coaches are equipped with read-only carts, which enable them to detect the time and payout of the coupons," Filip Drapal explained the control of the train from the Ropid organisation, which consists of the railway lines of the Prague group transport.
Local buses have a card set in accordance with the driver.
It is therefore necessary to show not only the driver's chip card at login, but also to add OpenCard to a given position on the side of the trailer.
The driver controls the value of the coupons.
"If it is necessary to verify the value of the purchased coupons, it is nothing more than a request by the driver for this information," Drapal added.
Travellers who do not travel by direct buses and will not remember when they end up paying the coupon can return to self-employed cars where the purchases are stored on the card.
Here they will see information about the availability of their documents on the display of the device.
The Courts wanted the United States referendum
The German Court of Justice in 1945 asked for the inclusion of the Shumava to the United States.
This is from a letter that is placed in the congregations of the Yihoče Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Rakouska, at least we want to live under the United States' patronage.
With such a wish, in 1945, some groups of the Germans of the Soviet Union joined the president of the United States.
It appears in addition to a letter that was kept in one private archive and is now placed in the collection of the Yihoče scientific library.
The Germans of Czech Krumlov ask in a letter from the American president not to allow the return of the "shum-jump" - banned by Hitler on the basis of the minority agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have correctly understood the situation and we want to be sure that the American units are never coming to the German territory as a bully and an enemy, even as a freer," says the letter, signed with the words "People who are at the heart of the Shumavi judgment".
The fact that the accession to Czechoslovakia gives the Germans a certain fate - with the knowledge of the Czech national attitudes - hope only for brutality, indifference, misunderstanding, persecution and childlessness, please the author of the American president's letter to take over Shumava protection for more and more time.
"We cannot believe that regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million citizens, you would have admitted this territory to a foreign country that is oppressing and destroying minorities and nothing, but has nothing to do with the victory of the United Nations," says the paper.
The reason why the authors can't sign is that there's some concern about the substantiation of the "Czech attackers".
If the President of the United States had any doubts about the idea of the Germans, it would be sufficient to arrange a referendum on whether its citizens want to be part of the United States or to live under the auspices of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naive in today’s known holiday events, some think it is appropriate to point out that the expectations of the so-called Germans can be met.
Even though the Czech Germans had to at least dream that they would be repatriated from the republic, only a few of them would have admitted that opportunity at all.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to unite the Soviets with certain types of autonomy.
Others believed that they would just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Russian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in Czech Buddhists.
This was for war as a German bodéjjevík, bound for the Baltic Sea.
When the British captured him at the end of the war and placed him in a concentration camp in the Netherlands, dozens of other Germans followed him to teach him Czech.
"They believed that when they get home, they'd be honored," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners living before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, did not count it to be the basis of the Beneze Decrees to withdraw from the Republic.
You don't think you're paying!
The emotional campaign attacks on the driver
The most expensive action aimed at safety on roads in Czech history.
However, it would be possible to characterize the emotional media campaign, which aims to launch the Ministry of Transport.
The office of Minister Alese Репебика promises that he will hire the driver from dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The 150 million campaign is on TV, radio, cinema, on the Internet, and even on planes.
The driver should make a quick ride and alcohol after the Voltant.
And remind them that before they go out, they will be ready.
He wants to get to know the young drivers, the motorists, the passengers, and the professional drivers in the final order.
And what happens at times?
Especially human stories that affect emotions.
And that's what the "blood" team of the entire campaign says:
You don't think you're paying!
The word "unthinkable" is written with great letters on the spy.
And in the blood box, the word "you'll pay."
It's a symbol that a person can pay for his own life for a moment without paying attention.
The monsters will "fear" until 2010.
The ministry was able to inspire similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxian countries, where images with dramatic images of the victims are often seen.
It promises to reduce inconsistencies and the number of dead on Czech roads.
Spotty prepared the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and biscuits on the driver
"The driver pays for the sugar system and drinks.
The sugar for them is that, for example, when they go to red, they save time.
Beck's a threat to trial or accident.
The driver must be at risk," says a transport psychologist at the Homelce Martin Korıán Hospital.
And that's why there's a need for an information campaign in the press and especially negative ads, it's a psychologist.
They are already less effective, according to the table, warning drivers of danger.
"If a static board is installed to protect against danger, it is likely that soon the environment will collapse and drivers will not be able to blame it," Koran warned.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories by exchange for peace
The President of the Interim Israeli Government, Ehud Olmert, spoke for the return of practically all the territories occupied in 1967, as well as before Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Mountains, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He did so in a conversation that the day after Monday went to Jediot Achronot.
"We have to get to the agreement with Palestine, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (acquired) territories, if not all," Olmert said the lawyer.
"We will leave a certain percentage of these lands, but we will have to add a similar percentage (the land of Israel) to the Palestinians, because without it there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that the necessary restoration would also include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem, and especially does not want tractors or bulldozers to cross his legs, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to surrender to Jerusalem," observed Olmert in an attack on two Russian attacks in the city where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Temple Mountain, Sacred and Historical Places", which lies within the Old City.
"The one who wants to maintain Israel's sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work," he emphasized further.
Out of the Golan Highs
Olmert also spoke of Israel's departure from the Golan heights, which he said is an inexhaustible condition for the conclusion of the peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require certain efforts from Damascus.
"I do not intend to make peace with Syria only on the basis of departure from Golan," he warned.
"The heart knows well what they will have to give to get the Golans.
They will have to surrender their current relationship to Iran; they will have to surrender their relationship to (Sythian invasion) Hizballah; they will have to give permanent support to terrorism (Syrian invasion) Hamas, Al-Qaedy and Jihad (holy war) in Iraq," the Prime Minister stressed.
Questions after accident: Are the drivers illegal in the bus?
The law is unknown, walking in a remote bus doesn't make sense.
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency near the Italian Paddy, the question arose whether drivers and passengers could move on the bus.
"If we would like to strictly and formally comply with the law, the work of stability is in conflict with the road transport law," says the transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident that took the 20-year-old sticker last week, apparently caused the driver of the cost vehicle, who crossed the bus.
The girl at the time of the accident sat next to the driver, at least in the safest place in the car, even though she has won two more places.
However, a bus can be dangerous, or it can be dirty, even at a time when a driver spreads coffee or news.
The role plays in whether the bus is equipped with a position according to a technical guide.
If not approved in the bus, the passenger must sit.
Remote buses Student Agencys do not have seats; what is currently confirmed by the director of the company Radim Jançura.
"We decided this with the ministry and did not allow the first movement of passengers.
Later we called it and made it clear that the passengers should walk to the toilet if they have their seat," he said.
The law of a country doesn't know
"There is no single legal explanation of the role of Stevarda - no legal provisions will address this role.
However, there is no legal provision, nor does it prohibit the delivery of services to the transporters.
The road transport law knows only the terms of the driving vehicle; its rights and obligations are not defined," provides less precisely language Hanselka.
On the contrary, the director of the Transport Transport Transport Committee Josef Pokorní says that the problem is sufficiently covered by the law.
"It depends on whether the bus has a permit for a position.
It's over," she says.
Buses are divided into urban areas where there are seats and limited maximum speed, bordering with seats at higher speeds and on the distance without standing at the highest speed and seating with safety belts equipped.
As in the plane, says the expert
The expert BESSIP on transport safety Jaroslav Horín in the movement of drivers on the bus cannot see a major problem.
"There is no danger of flying when it is dangerous, the situation can be likened to service in airports.
Even here it's not sure when turbulence comes and the plane can fit into the head."
"If, however, the bus driver had stolen, he would certainly pay for physical laws.
Just like in a city bus or tram.
The safety of drivers needs to be resolved by internal regulations," he says, too, because of the law the problem is not solved.
Jancura is willing to give up services
The student agency offers the services of drivers as the only bus carrier.
He employs two hundred of them.
The director does not consider their call to be a risk, even after the accident.
"But as soon as I find out that the call of the guards is risky, I'm going to cancel it.
Coffee and newspapers can get on the way.
It would save the costs," she says.
As an interest in security has caused the absence of drivers in their cars, Asia's director Alexei Litvin, who carries out a break of line compared with SA.
"We don't have any shoes, we've been standing against that since the beginning.
Before or later it ends at some deadly rate," said a few years ago for Tiden.cz.
An Unwarranted Tragedy
In the fall of the link to Naples, a young nephew from Plzeńska who worked for the company for two years died.
The Slovenian truck probably broke off without using the guides from the distance and blocked the bus.
His driver tried to avoid the foolish manoeuvre, but he took the right front part.
To sell two seats awarded for the rest of the stay, Jancura refuses.
"This place is not possible to book remote connections, they are blocked."
The company's gonna complain about the truck driver.
With the victim's family, the agency won't wait for a court hearing, but the financial reward is also expected by the prosecutor.
- The law? - Yeah.
Invisible
The clarification of the movement of passengers on the bus could bring about a revision of the law on which the thirty-third expert group of the Ministry of Transport works over the year.
"No specific conclusion has yet been reached.
Autobusy doesn't solve much, rather the bottom system, maximum speed at the distance and use of the mobile when driving," says expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of drivers to be a major threat to the safety of passengers," Hanzelka concludes, saying that the control of bus safety is in the power of the police and work safety authorities.
Hope Düsseldorf is Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the letter of the WestLB delegation to the employees of this bank.
The merger of this Diesseldorf money institution with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank will result in a "mean financial group institution united for the sale of capital markets", we will read in a letter received on Monday to the public.
WestLB, according to the letter to this transaction, introduces "compliant seed" providing long-term results.
And in fact, such a connection can be a decisive incentive for further associations in the banking sector.
Such texts arise when the representative wishes to demonstrate the ability to act in a difficult period.
The unstable WestLB is still under significant pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Board of Directors of the Financial Services Authority, whose statement by the Government of the North Prussian-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still pure.
The connection between the Deka-Bank, which customers share with their investment funds, and WestLB, whatever it may be, is still longer - even on the Frankfurt side.
Chief Deka-Bank Franz Waas, when presenting the six-year management results at the end of August, heard that in his bank house at Mainzer Landstraße with some of the banks, such as the Helaba bank or WestLB, there is no sense.
The Deka-Bank Governing Council, which consists of one half of the banks of the country and one half of the partners, has, however, entrusted the Presidency with conducting talks with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be about the sale on the capital market or their share.
However, the discussions began first, with financial support.
Deka-Bank, which belongs to its 3000 employees, is not the first to talk about consolidation in the business sector.
In 2003, it seemed that it would be possible to come to the Deka-Bank merger with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba Bank.
There was nothing at all about this triangle.
Shortly after the merger plans were made public, the Hessen Country Government spoke against the participation of the Helaba Bank.
Neither of the remaining banks agreed.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz will instead acquire Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart.
Despite repeated speculations about the Deka-Bank connection with the country banks.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, President of the Helaba Bank, expressed negative concern about the speculation about the connection of his financial home with others.
It seems, however, that it does not depend on this assurance that the approach of the various banking houses of the public sector is necessary.
Now, after the elections to the country's snow in Bavaria, BayernLB could start to explore the connection with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg as the first one.
It's not exactly good news for Helab.
If he should be forced to grow up, he will gradually come up with potential partners for such a connection.
Only second houses in the south would be played, although the financial crisis is far better off than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The proposal with WestLB also banned Svaz's friendly and iron banks Hessen-Thüringen, which has a 50-percent share in Helabė.
In the light of this, it would seem to be the most recent Nord LB.
The geostrategic views of this type are only one external problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how the trade models of individual institutions work together.
In June Merl stated that the decisive question of which a commercial model should be to ensure the future competitiveness of the Land Banks, Germany's competitor and iron banks did not answer at all.
It could also end with the distribution of WestLB, which no one in this institution of course faces.
It is therefore also mentioned in the letter of the Foreign Office that it is seeking a "complex solution" for the entire banking house.
Yeah, and how it's possible to connect to a combination of individual components with Deka-Bank, it'll show time.
The second weekend of October is known as "the week with Italy"
For Ellen it's the first one, for Luke the first one or the fourth.
But this time Elena will be his friend, and then everything will be different, she says.
After them, in the Kaiser five-litre court, there is a stronger candle and two-foot tourists on October testify to how deep tone can make his throat out.
Elena Lucu first dances and then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bolon.
From the bus park next to the port of Porta Nuova, four buses will go out this evening at 23.45 a.m. with the designation "destinazione Monaco, festa della Birra", scheduled arrival 6.30.
Three buses consist mainly of Italy, one of which runs exclusively in Brazil.
In one corner of the park, these Jiho-Americans are already singing with their train, they're celebrating the night.
And so loud, says Marco Guard, it's nothing for Italy.
Mark, who has a long coat with a leather-like face and glasses with wide stripes, belongs to the three buses.
He's been traveling with them for five years on Octoberfest, only three repairs a year.
At night there, during the day between the walls with a beer, at 22.30 a.m.
Nightings would mean only extra costs, says Marco.
The road consists of 75 euros, including a welcome invitation to beer Kaiser, which was directly violated by the law on beer hygiene, health insurance and German-speaking interpreter Marco went to Frankfurt for a language course.
The buses are on their way to the Brenner Road by night.
The beer doesn't give up. Not yet.
The bus is fast shut, traveling to sleep.
They're doing well, they're still gonna need their strength.
It is located in Brixena and Holzkirchen, where the number 8 points ahead of Minichov makes another stop and a lot of other buses with an Italian identification mark.
When Mark's group finally arrives at the park near Theresienwiese in the middle of the seventh morning, there are about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gathered, Marco has the last show, explains the attack plan.
First: Set up a yellow cap.
It is written on the left is "Oktoberfest", by the internet address of Marco's travel office: "conoscersiggiado.it".
The other one says, "When they open the door to the bathroom, run!" Marco calls in the morning air.
"Run!" run and have seats in the last part of the apartment.
"Not before you don't stop, not all the yellow caps on the same labyrinth, move around the space!"
The bridge is EUR 8, 25 cents.
And don't forget the loss.
"Show the securists that we're being obedient.
As soon as you leave your places, they are gone."
He says, "You're right here tonight in half a dozen again."
And up on Wiesn, the room with the bathrooms.
On the way one member of the group lifts the yellow caps as signs on trees, cedars and even on a volleyball beach one large bavor side.
We need to get ready for departure.
As "the week with Italy" I know the second weekend of October.
The exact details of the number of visitors are not available; they are talking about tens of thousands of people who travel across the Alps and fall into the bus stations, ten percent of all visitors this week came from Italy.
The order of the minority police strengthens seven police officers from south Tyrol, the Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which conducts national statistics in which the Italian front of Britain (cca 60 grounds) and the Rakushani (cca 80) with about 200 medical treatments are the first place.
Especially the favorite is Hofbra's apartment in Italy.
Frequent Nights for believers in Hippo Real Estate
Last week, the Federal Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system is relatively stable.
It is good that this policy used the word "relatively" and also included the fact that the German banking sector will not remain in crisis development.
'Cause it's about last weekend.
The indexem Dax followed by a financial house specializing in the financing of the property of Hippo Real Estate (HRE) will be awarded by the German bank's pool of credit at several billion in the protection of turbulence in the markets.
The person concerned in the situation on Monday told Reuters that the said credit aid would go up to EUR 35 billion.
The rates will only have to be paid from the actual amount of the Hippo Real Estate (HRE).
Money comes first from private and public banks.
In the background, there's the loss of Depfa's daughter company.
According to a newspaper report on long-term projects on which he had borrowed money, this national financier has been extremely short-term refinanced, which is now impossible because of lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank reserve rose by 95 % to EUR 2.37 million and the share of its own capital decreased by 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
The normal and net profit from the financial transactions of the last year was zero, the profit from the increased value of the survey and from certain securities and the reduction of the reserves for credit trading amounted to more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Only because of the higher costs of the subsequent accounting costs for restructuring of the existing Depfa group and the interest rate refund according to the tax regime and for the mediation of trade for the group companies, the interest on the profit side was still moderate.
Following its privatisation in 1990, the former state financer burned on mortgages for biologists who were then excluded from the services portfolio and also called the Aareal Bank.
Since the classical state funding was too small, Depta became more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of private and state-owned projects (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and was increasingly diversified.
From the value of their subsidiaries, Hippo Real Estate must now have something to write down and these reviews will have a "primary weight effect" to calculate the profit and loss of the entire group, as some have let themselves be unscathed.
In fact, there's no division.
Two-thirds were completed for 2007.
Hippo Real Estate is an important financial asset for state and infrastructure projects from the Depfa.
Stronger than other institutions, it depends on refinancing on the interbank market because there are no customer inputs.
After the fall of the American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers, almost two weeks ago, the bank had a cash flow of interbank loans.
The Hippo Real Estate needs an annual loan portfolio of Depfa - about 50 billion euros - short-term refinancing funds.
According to the Hippo Real Estate report, the financial needs of this group for the period under review of its coverage and the company is protected "in the face of the impact of international monetary markets at the moment on significant levels of non-compliant functions".
Other sources have been allowed to hear that these funds have been refinancing by the end of 2009.
The president of the HRE Georg Funke, however, stated that the Hippo Real Estate Group will not have to use the money markets at the time.
The Bank and the Financial Services Supervisory Board (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hippo Real Estate group is now ensured.
That's what shareholders and banks trust.
But in view of the dynamics and incompatibility of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even excluded that the loan should not be exhausted entirely.
However, it cannot be excluded or dismissed.
After the bank's late Sunday afternoon, according to all the circumstances before the insolvency, it can't be pre-empted, it's safe to calm down.
The share rate dropped by 75 per cent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, they were well held by compulsory courses.
While priority debt has not been reduced in practice, there is a loss of mutual bonds.
This applies in particular to the existing subsidiaries of Württemberg Hippo and to the logical bonding period after 2009.
The obligations of Hippo-Real-States initially seemed to be an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability needs to be fully offset by the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself that brought it into the company by taking Depfa, depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the issuing banks, governments and less-exploited trading banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to calculate the cost-effectiveness of securities in their time of payment.
However, it can also come to what no one is currently expecting - a financial crisis will be overrun in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the report coming at the same time with this partial statement, the likelihood of bordering with certainty has now become the only valid hope.
This is especially likely to prepare a number of busy nights for long - term believers when they decide whether to give up their commitments.
Short-term investors may at least make use of the threshold to create a transfer of losses from the previous accounting periods to the profit of the past years for the purpose of future payment of the tax from the capital.
Sylvana and secrets of krabik bento
When the sixteen-year-old Sylvan Hiltropa's first day at high school in Taciban, girls start to smile: this German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from a man. On her new blog about the exchange of residence, she reports about Japan.
"The first day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I had to get out of my way to school.
I live in Tokyo on the way to Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to the middle of Taciban.
I had to find my way alone, I didn't lose my fortune.
It seems that the beginning of the tuition on Taciban is not as precise as our home in Lower Saxony.
Students start meeting after eight hours and twenty minutes before the ninth starts a short meeting with the teacher, i.e. 'home room'.
But before the study started, I had to introduce myself.
I'm not even the kind of person who likes to talk to people and then before 40 students.
Because I didn't have a school uniform yet, I took on an old dress of my host moms, to that blouse, blue sweaters, and black shoes.
So I put this equipment in front of the battle and tried to express everything correctly: 'Sajónar Wo still Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany, and I'm born in a week.
At that point, I was very glad that I had started to learn the language two years ago.
All 31 holoes in the class were sucked, chichotola and mavala, and I still heard the word 'kawaii'.
I already knew that from my mom's.
She belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls needed for survival and means 'stolen, sweet'.
Then I'm quick to jump into my place.
The girl sat next to me all too wide, considered it a privilege to sit next to her as a foreign student.
The rest of the hour was relatively quiet, but when he called me gong, I was completely asleep.
They talked to each other and chichotalized and asked me about possible and impossible -- and then it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
Then all of them threw their bets off.
My host mother also made me such a cake for lunch - and that's something else than a nice German wedding.
I had rice with bees, little apples, salads and rice, fruit and like fish in a tofu bag.
Most of the time, I don't know exactly what I'm doing here in Japan.
These things look special and taste quite new.
I'm sure everything's really good.
Well, maybe up to the slanted candles, br!
Benta in Japanese schools are not just lunches.
Sometimes it happens that a girl will give the boys a specially prepared Bent, which is in this case specially managed by the artist, and hopes that the boy will know more about the switch.
That's what I read in my comic book.
I'm curious if I can see it here too.
'Why does Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said,
'Cause he's just fascinating me.
By the end of the last few years, I've never enjoyed reading manga.
And to understand these comics and their culture better, I started learning Japanese a little.
So it was very clear to me that I would have to come here once.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and customs.
And they're highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is the most advanced technology and trends, on the other it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
And the wings have feelings
If they run away from danger, does it mean that they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
But how can they make sure that they feel the same way we do?
In the Internet magazine "Edge" has been published for several years by well-known scientists.
Spiegel Online in his series presents the selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without proving it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other aspects of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove it, if we can't even prove that knowledge has other people.
But in this case we can at least hope because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we begin to hire another type and open up issues of opinion or knowledge in general, we enter into an inconsistencies, because hardware does not agree.
When it reaches danger, it will do the same to many other animals: it will pretend that it is dead, deaf, or paralyzed.
People behave similarly, some scientists take advantage of similar subjective experience.
I don't believe in it at all.
Two aspects of the brain structure facilitate the transfer of our subjective life to animal life.
However, it is because human knowledge-related processes are almost always included in the pre-frontal cortex (because of its short-term memory and performance or management functions).
This vast area is developed in humans far more clearly than in other primates, and it seems to be entirely lacking in other creatures.
At least in these aspects of our knowledge, which depend on the pre-frontal cortex, among them the knowledge of who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from other primers.
Another dramatic feature could hide the language of a person: because it is so much of his opinion connected with language, it is often said that knowledge depends on him.
In this case, we could expel animals.
But even if science did not matter, the language would surely influence it, so that animal knowledge, whatever it is already constructed, would probably differ from most of our knowledge.
So it's difficult to find out how it seems to be known in other animals.
If, like something inside and subjective, we can't even measure, because of a particular hardware, analyze on the basis of our own experience, we're facing serious problems.
Most of my outputs relate to the content of scientific experience, but there is yet another aspect of knowledge that should be scientificly accessible.
It would be possible to study animals in science regardless of their content, and that is precisely what happens in short-term memory studies in primates, especially for the example of visualization.
But this approach, called Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses more on the neural correlation of knowledge than on causal mechanisms: both can be identical, but they should not be either.
It is interesting that this approach also highlights the importance of the non-frontal cortex for the implementation of visualisation.
What's the result of this feeling?
I'm exporting them from the fact that the emotional system, like the fear system, is activated in the brain by knowing its own activities.
What we call "fear", then, is the mental condition in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences as a physical reaction) uses the operational memory.
From this point of view, the emotions of the jury are carried out with the cortex areas that are designated to be accepted, especially people.
In harmony with the language nature, it creates a pleasant reflection of thought, because with words and grammar we can distinguish and categorizate attitudes so that we can apply them to ourselves and to others.
On the contrary, for example, Antonio Damasio believes that emotions arise from the more primitive activities in the areas of cortex and brain rhythms associated with body senses, such as Jaak Pankseep, which is more focused on the brain.
Because this network has not changed much during human evolution, it could be able to share freely in the feelings of many biological families.
I just can't argue theoretically, but I don't think it's proofable.
Pankzeep argues that what we do in cross and people feel like fear, probably both bodies feel the same: How can it be verified, says Pankzeep, do cross and people feel the same when they behave similarly?
Does he feel afraid before danger?
From my point of view, it is not only the similarity of conduct that proves the harmony of life.
It's true that neural comparison is going on: cross and people have similar brains, on the other hand, even brains.
But is the brain responsible for feelings?
And even if it was possible to show it in person, how would we want to show it in the cross?
I'm guessing that the cross and other councillors, maybe even the swabs (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are probably quite different from ours (because human knowledge is based on special aids and language), I try more emotional behavior than emotional perception.
In any case, we can expect progress at the neurological level if we measure the same in the cross and in the people.
Like I don't study language or knowledge, I don't try any feelings, because I don't even know if they exist.
It's possible to make it short, but I'd rather do it before I turn against the wall again.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
President UEFA Platini: The Source of Mercy for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said that the preparations will soon be directed directly by the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA decision in Bordeaux as evidence of trust in Ukraine and its ability to coordinate ME with Poland," Vasjunyk said.
"It's not amnesty for our country.
The work started first and there's still much to do in both countries."
In time of filling the time plan, the buildings or buildings of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports are being rented by both guests.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work as fast as possible," said Ukrainian president Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will continue to follow us."
A more radical step has been taken in Poland.
The conduct of the Polish PZPN was dismissed and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlock, after a number of scandals by the National Olympic Committee.
The Committee met at the request of Minister of Sport Mirosława Trewiecke.
First there is "a serious danger that PZPN will not be able to act according to rules," said the Polish press agency PAP.
"We have written to UEFA President Michel Platinio that this step does not interfere with the preparation in May 2012. "
Several teams from the first league had only been assessed in the past season because of the manipulation due to the proposed composition, and it had to be finally immediately moved to the beginning of the league.
Destroyed Dennis Quaid return officer
She wanted to make a new movie, talk about private things - and now she has problems with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan spoke about her former Dennis Quaid as a divorcer.
That's hot and back-up.
The late war rages in the ex-wife couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaida: seven years after the divorce of these two Hollywood kings, they have a rough dispute - before the public air.
Meg Ryan's speech to the American magazine InStyle last week was first expressed for reasons of his short marriage: "Today I was a long time unfaithful, and that was very painful."
She learned about the extent of the causation until after divorce.
The subject of this mental strip was the PR work of Ryan for her new film "The Women" - the story of a divorced marriage.
The reaction of Dennise Quaida to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was clear: "It's crazy," said a 14-year-old herec of New York Daily News that "Meg repeatedly repeats the history of our relationship and manages it."
In addition, it's "political" that Jack's six-year-old son is again "publicly reminded of the pain and radical changes that are for every child's divorce."
While Ryan lives on his own from divorce, Quaid is again married and recently became a father to two.
He concludes his view of withdrawal: "My life goes on anyway.
I think I'm happy to have a wonderful family that's doing great."
Flight prices and hotel deals
In the first half of 2008 the years and residence in Europe were lower than in the previous year.
According to one current study, in Germany, flights were even lower than 50 percent.
Flights and accommodation in hotels have decreased again - this is the result of the study of travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analysed its data on the reservations made in the first half of 2008 and found a significant decrease in the second quarter after the price fell in the first quarter.
After several years of growth in hotel prices, accommodation in many places has already been reduced.
Prices increased from January to March in 41 of the 48 followed-up European cities still below 6.9% compared to 2007.
However, prices have been 3.6 per cent lower than in the previous year.
The most common was this trend in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
As a result of this trend, the American Express considers a poor dollar course, which has caused "the taste of American tourists to travel".
The hotel prices were also significantly lower than the industrial centre, such as Hannover, Kolín over Rhine or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian town, the price of hotels rose by 26.3 per cent even by a European record.
In the first quarter, the prices of the aeroplane also showed an emerging trend:
As a result of the decline in kerosin, passengers in the economy had to pay an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, up to 29.2 per cent for annual long-term fuel.
From April to June, the prices of the plane in the Economics class ranged by 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, in the Business and First-Class classes, however, the recognition changes were less evident.
In Germany, prices have dropped even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, 11.9 percent grew, in the second quarter, 23.6 percent.
In the German national years, according to the quoted study, even the price of half dropped.
One of the reasons for this price decline is decreasing economic growth, explains the company.
The demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is an increased competitive pressure on the basis of the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalised the air traffic between the United States and Europe.
The high number of airlines that declared their competition in the first half of 2008 was only 24 airlines in Europe.
HSV Persian Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to one branch and simple methods, Hamburger SV gets to the top of the table.
In Belarus, Luhukaka is still unable to establish a functional unit.
Kristoffer Klein wrote - to increase Unfavourable accession for representative Marco Marina.
This player from Gladbach joined the game until it was too late and he failed with a ball in his pocket.
His message was accurately expressed and expressed with conviction.
He just knew he was right.
"We need a second head," said Hermann Rieger on his way to the cabins of the Hamburg arena.
It wasn't much done in catacombs, the break between periods ended, and most people sat in their places again.
Rieger was a HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades and used more respect than many minutes of actor.
And that's how his request was heard at the place responsible.
Cornelius Jol's coach's assistant touched and raised a bullet on the signs of the match.
Cornelius is the brother of the Chief Coach Hambour of Martin Jola.
His command must have sounded the same way: I am with the other fool!
There's no way out.
"It didn't work out here today for anything nice," said Marcell Jansen later.
And Bastian Reinhardt would've been "more relaxed."
At 1:0 (1:0) Hamburgese thank-yous Mladen Petrice (11) and the circumstances that very weak Gladbazaneans could not hurt the poor Hamburcians.
"It was a spinal victory," whispered Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV this afternoon celebrates 121 years of its existence.
On Saturday afternoon, the performers celebrated themselves, blue sky above the air and living an updated videotape table, in which their team was identified as a prime minister.
They'll be born without proper parties.
"We know how to evaluate it," said Marcell Jansen.
It suggests that the current table result symbolizes the inadmissibility of the league rather than its dominant HSV.
The late arrival of new players - Brazilians Nevese and Silvy, the Petriče branches and the FC Bayern won Jansen - is still slow, but it is not possible to close.
"We need more quote and more dribling," said Joel frankly.
After the vote
The Wall Street is spreading fear.
The first reports of the collapse of the rescue package caused a decrease in the Dow Jones index to 700 points.
It was the biggest point loss in one day in his history.
Later, Dow picked up something else.
By 20.30, this world's most important bourgeois barometer indicated a 5-percent decline of 10,579 units.
The technological bursa Nasdaq was with more than seven percent in a minimum of 1548 points.
The worst was in Dowu at this time, the American Express, who lost almost 14 per cent, and the Bank of America was losing about 12 per cent.
None of the titles could have been strengthened.
The Goldman Sachs banks lost almost ten percent.
A few days ago, he had a large investor Warren Buffett in this company.
In the framework of the rescue plan, funds should be made available for the purchase of so-called hypothetical paper.
However, the total amount should not be reimbursed, but in several stages.
The payment is to be made by the State to obtain public public lists of financial companies which could be distributed in the course of the recognition of the course, which would reduce the burden on the public budget.
Share rates in Europe fall sharply
Billions of aid to banks in Europe and USA investors are not mistaken.
The course of action of the large German banks Hippo Real Estate is highly consistent and stands with its index Dax.
The U.S. Down Jones index is losing and over the planned saving of the state's financial market.
Spectacular course losses Hippo Real Estate and Commercial Bank threw the index of German shares (Dax) deep down.
The share of the mentioned minority financier has also lost property through the saved shares of the government and private banks up to three quarters of its value, the Commerzbank has reached more than 20 per cent.
Dax clearly understood the psychologically important limit of 6000 points and with a minimum of 3.7 per cent recorded 5,839 points.
All over the world, stock markets went down to the knees.
In New York, he started a business day at Wall Street with outstanding losses.
Investors are afraid that the US government's savings package of $700 billion would not be sufficient for recovery of debt on the financial markets.
During the first hours of trade, 334 points were lost by 3.3 per cent, which is equal to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. Snow Representative has to vote on a rescue plan, the Senate could vote on 1 October.
The other European storms were selected by one direction: the first failed FTSE index in London was 3.2 per cent, the CAC-40 in Paris lost 2.9 per cent.

The darkness affects the seasons of space probes
For years scientists have been unaware of the advice of one Western phenomenon: the darkness affects the speed of space probes during the so-called manoeuvre swing-by (gravitational practice).
Experts fear that the general theory of relativeity of Albert Einstein should not be entirely correct.
Almost 18 years ago, the Ulysses space probe flew into the universe.
The wine of the burning water, which will soon freeze, is now threatened by cold death.
Among scientists over the years, one of the most fascinating phenomena is the anomaly of gravitational work.
Gravitational practice is the aircraft manager of space probes, where they get extra hypnotism in the gravity field of some space body, such as Earth.
Because of that, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical trick as well as Ulysses' solar probe.
But what scientists have been saying for years in this case is that flying bodies do not act as a percentage as a person would expect under the old gravitational law.
On the other hand, it's going to be an irregularity at a speed.
Sondy's unexpectedly slowing down or slowing down.
In time, physics could not explain this effect.
They've covered him with anomaly of gravitational practice.
Some experts fear that almost almost the general theory of relativeity of Albert Einstein, which describes the volume of the covering space, should not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton is still convinced that Einstein did not fail, and is trying to explain the anomaly of gravity’s work with the so-called dark mass whose presence in the universe has found astronomers.
"The answer to this anomaly could be a dark cloud which could also be found very close to Earth," he writes.
The existence of dark clouds is known by space researchers for about ten years.
Obviously, it comes from gravitational force, whose effect on the other universe is likely to be observed.
However, she is completely invisible, which means that she does not emit or emit any electromagnetic radiation, even visible light.
According to scientists, from this dark mass is a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
In Egypt tourists are free
Ten days later, in the hands of their refugees, it was reported that the foreign Minister of Italy in Egypt had reunification of tourists for freedom.
Imports from the Sudan requested a sum of several million euros.
Six fugitives were killed in the shooting before the release.
Five Germans were defeated in the south of Egypt.
Meeting on the ransom is already running.
The Germans are again becoming the target of aliens.
WELT Online brings you the most important cases.
European tourist attractions in Sahara are all free.
They reported on it in accordance with Egyptian state TV, Al-Arab TV station and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini, according to the report of the Italian TV station Sky TG 24, confirmed: "Our common and other hands have been released.
We're just checking their health status," Frattini said.
According to the Egyptian State TV report, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian and also eight Egyptian leaders in order and in security.
All 19 participants of the expedition to the desert are already on their way to Cairo.
The unclear remains behind the shootings before the release of arms: according to the Egyptian security officer, the fugitives were prepared to finish the strike before the Sudanese army killed six of them miraculously.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with the executive," said the cited worker.
It's just "it's all about to be taken over" when this surprise came to us.
The Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt shot six fugitives and two of them.
The loans claimed a total of EUR 6 million in Germany; the money was to be handed over to the German wife of one of the hands.
The newspaper El Masri El Jom, calling on one of the German mediators, pointed out that the release of arms is coming because the prisoners are afraid of their safety.
According to this report, the defendants wanted to leave the hand of a woman after payment of the ransom.
Men should be kept until the aliens have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to make a statement on this report.
The abuse of my father led to suicide.
Several abuses by a father led a woman to commit suicide before the court.
After he admitted to eight cases of sexual harassment, seven-year-old Michael Trerise from Stithianus in Cornwall was sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court in Truro heard that his own daughter, Stephanie Randle, was regularly getting married when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," Trerise wrote in a confession.
It was also said that Ms. Randle died in her home in Mutley in Plymouth on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived as a child in Conventry, Trerise would hug her and kiss her eyes and then abuse her sexually while her mother worked at home.
Trerise broke up with his wife in the '80s and returned to Cornwall.
His own daughter went to Plymouth.
However, before the trial, Ms. Randle, who spent a substantial part of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust organization, was following a pattern of abuse, which was doubled to a week-old.
The complainant Ramsey Quaife said in 2006 that Miss Randle's friends, who also committed a lot of surfing and cyclistism, said she was "emotionally dead" and that "life was spent".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It's decided she's married to an impeccable bitch.
Randle stood face-to-face with his own father, who wrote his daughter a confession that ended with the words: "I took her and bound her eyes.
"I didn't abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen Treris said to her: "You are an extremely curious fetisher and it must have been hard for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim's taking life.
Even more dangerous is the fact that if she didn't do that, the thing would probably never have happened to the court."
"In particular, I would like to highlight the consequences of your crime on their daughter in those years," he added.
"It would probably be the most promising, successful and happy young woman."
An officer who has lost the data will be charged
The BBC was informed that the official who left the exact secret documents in the train in June would be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man concerned left two very secret documents in the train on Waterloo when he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
Before the police were transferred, the documents were delivered to the BBC.
This is at least a serious violation of that law and does not mean a criminal purpose.
The BBC writer Frank Gardner said such a silence would be amazing for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought that the matter would be settled between the ministry and the government office," he said.
An employee who must not be appointed shall be accused under section 8.1 of the relevant law, which is clauses which are reserved for protection of information.
The plaintiff recommended that the Metropolitical Police report on the basis of the very sensitive attitude of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents that he forgot included the confidential analysis of Al-Qaida and the possibilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from home to an unknown place.
Duty B & B corporate base face
The British social foundations may have to handle with more than 80 million pounds after saving Bradford & Bingley banks.
The government has provided 2.6 million customers in Bradford & Bingley 14 billion pounds.
The rates of this loan will be paid to all companies taking customer deposits, including 59 corporate banks.
The Director-General of the Association Foundations (BSA) Adrian Coles said that he is "responsive", that the Foundation and its members must pay.
The fourteenth billionth debt will finally be paid by saving Bradford & Bingley mortgages.
However, the rate that is to be fixed is to be paid every year by all 700 financial companies that make customer contributions.
The Bank has confirmed the Bank's compensation plan for the BBC that all 59 corporate funds are set up in this number.
It's unfortunate that these institutions that have acted in a way that... now have to pay some of the accounts of those institutions that have not been so sensitive.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay in proportion to the savings it held and that the underlyings should pay about 18 % of the prices.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the debt rate rose to 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that the basics will have to find 81 million pounds to pay for the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Association of Societies, told BBC that he is convinced that this is not fair.
"It is humiliating that those institutions that have kept their balance during the collapse of the housing market must now pay some of the accounts of those institutions which have been far from being so sensitive."
According to BSA, there has been no ground since 1945, when it appeared, it didn't fall.
"We will have to examine all aspects of this in the next few weeks to see what opportunities are available to protect social foundations and their members from the account that could be essential," Cole added.
The period paid in 2009 shall cover seven months from the end of the annual session to the end of March.
In 2010, the rate will be paid for the entire year and this could be almost twice as much.
In view of the fact that the social foundations are the participating organisations without shareholders, this account will eventually pay their members by higher payments or lower rates on their accounts.
Milk produces five pens per litre
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
Dr. Jersey announced that from Monday, he would increase the high price of his milk by five pounds per litre.
This year, it is the second growth of prices, after two-pence auctions, and comes after the research carried out by the consulting company.
The retailers must decide on their own whether they want to reflect on the customer prices.
Before the autumn growth, the wholesale price of milk from Jersey last changed in 2002.
Banladesh expresser's case is dismissed
The Bangladeshi court denied the application of former Prime Minister Shajch Hasiny Vazid's request for release to prison, which means that if he returns to power, he can be arrested.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to release her in connection with the charge that she had received from a certain businessman over $10 million (729,700) when she was a prime minister.
The case is one of several accusations of corruption that have been raised against it.
Chalida Zijá, a long-term political rival of Shajch Hasiny, was released this month on bail.
Shajch Hasin has to return to Bangladesh within the next few weeks, but her side, the League of Nations (Awami League), requested that the local army first grant her complete freedom.
The authors say that while she was released in a dignified manner so that she could enter a foreign medical prescription, it is not clear whether she will remain free when she comes back to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say that the Supreme Court is now called against the regulation of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court denied the request of Šajch Hasiny for a bail with the fact that he does not need a bail once an investigation has been filed abroad for a fair declaration," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We're calling against the Supreme Court's regulation."
Her lawyers said she needed a bullet to get back from abroad because of preparations for Sunday elections.
The High Representative of the League of People said Shaikh Hasina is to return home after 17 October.
She was detained for a past year after the military was arrested by the interim government, but she was released from prison in June so that she could go abroad for medical reasons.
Shajch Hasina and Chalda Zija both reject all charges against each other.
Fear of expecting back in Afghanistan
According to the UN, nearly 200,000 children did not participate in a recent flat-rate survey against the back because of the violence associated with Taliban.
The UN was expecting in six provinces last week.
However, she says that for safety reasons she could not have access to children in the southern parts of Helmand and Kandahar.
The UN stated that this was the case despite the Taliban's promise that it will not attack or protect thousands of desperate workers.
BSkyB lost court dispute on ITV
BSkyB lost court dispute on the review of the Commission's decision on economic competition, which the company ordered to reduce its share in the ITV competition.
The BSkyB Court of Appeal indicated that it would reduce its share in ITV from 17.9% below 7,5%.
In the past, the Commission announced that BSkyB had been involved in a competitive war and that it had a negative impact on IT.
BSkyB bought part in 2006 in a trade that, as a result, banned the company NTL, is now renamed to Virgin Media, an ITV purchase.
In April 2007, the Court of Justice announced that the acquisition of the share in ITV BSkyB caused doubts about the independence of ITV and called on the Commission for an economic competition to initiate an investigation.
The director of the Virgin Consortium Sir Richard Branson, consumer organisation and regulator Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the alleged reduction of its share in ICT was pointless and as a disproportionate solution - in particular because BSkyB said earlier that it was willing to issue its voting rights.
A new investigation of U.S. lawyers' case
The U.S. Secretary-General appointed a special applicant to investigate the release of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
This occurred when the report on the case prepared by the High Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticised the activities of the government officials.
The report criticized the officials of the White House, the lawyer and former minister of justice Albert Gonzalez.
The investigation was raised by concerns that lawyers were removed for political reasons.
The special appeal of Nora Danneh will now be examined whether the officials of the hearing were lying to the investigators in order to ensure justice.
General Inspector Glenn Fine stated in the report: "The serious charge, including potential criminal proceedings, was not fully examined or explained."
The appointment of a special applicant with the right to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The party began when the US Ministry of Justice released nine American lawyers in December 2006.
The Ministry then indicated that lawyers were released because of poor performances.
However, it was later shown that the exemptions of lawyers were not considered to be anything worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to conclude that the exemption was politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in the high-ranking of the Republican MPs and senators, others refused to investigate the accusations of voters against Democrats.
U.S. lawyers investigate and file complaints in court cases.
They may be released at any time, but they must not be removed for political reasons.
The former head of the Ministry of Justice, Mr Alberto Gonzales, was released on bail and finally rejected.
The number of other representatives of the Ministry of Justice has also declined.
The General Inspector's report expressed very critically on the role of Gonzalez in the case, saying that he did not send "primary responsibility" for his failure to "abduce" from his lead position and in the act "dissembling".
Other officials, including former High Bush adviser Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loafov will be evaluated
The Rock Star Meat Loaf will receive one of the Q Awards for its epic Himmny Bat Out Of Hell.
A song that will come at the ceremony next weekend in London for its special golden price, said it was "behind" with recognition.
The writer, who lasted nine minutes and fifteen seconds, was a titled Meat Loaf's driver's album from 1977.
The nominations for the annual year lead the Coldplay group, which has received in the previous election in four categories.
Paul Rees, chief editor of the Q Magazine, said: "There are some songs that stand for such things as time and energy, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The writer, by Jim Steinman, needed the great vocals he gave Meat Loaf.
She started an instrument part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was published in Britain in 1979 as a single and reached the top of the fifteenth place.
But Meat Loafov's album Bat Out Of Hell was held in the library for about nine years and sold it around the world more than forty million copies.
Meat Loaf - a real name, Marvin Lee Aday - suffered from health problems in recent years, was also affected by an irregular heart rate after which he was sick.
In 2007, the acute laryngitis forced him to cancel the concert.
Later, it turned out he had a voice-circuit.
Scattering streets, often forgotten and possible soon to be sold
New York City has thousands of roads, streets, distances and other underground communications, some famous, others just useful.
But even many veterans and long-term locals have trouble finding Extra Place, mostly because they never heard of him.
This small street is in the fourth East Village and leads north from First Street - without reaching the Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
In a wide range of about ten and a half feet [40 m], it is more likely to remember a cursed passage than a transport bridge.
There's no sign of street names there.
It's practically invisible in the ordinary atlas.
Still, he's got street admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay company, the developer recently built luxury buildings on the First Street.
He wants to redraw and create a clean way to shops and shops that need to be opened in new buildings.
Other surprises are the long-term neighbors who say that they were trapped in the street just because it was one of the last remaining days before the block was closed.
However, the City Agency for the Protection and Development of the Constitution, which has the streets in its power, has no minimum interest in maintaining it.
At the meeting of the Land Committee of the current Community, the representatives of the City Authority and the Avalon Bay company planned to buy a street developer.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, the Executive Director of the General Community 3, the Committee prioritises the option when the streets remain in the city and requested a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The city already owns only a very small area, and we would like Extra Place to remain in its possession," she said.
"There may be proposals for correction and management, which may be done by Avalon, but we also want to guarantee public access."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that she wanted to re-examine the streets and set up places for the meeting, some of which she would use a coffee shop whose interest in renting the developer area is expected.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that even if the company wants to use the street, she doesn't want to own it.
"The main purpose of Avalon Bay is to make this abandoned street and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said and added that the sale proposed a city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Conservative Authority, said that the city wanted to sell the ticket to the street, and he insisted that his office's property was more developed than repair.
Compared with his more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a soft step in history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when the great farm Philip Minthorna was divided among several of his children and on that narrow hill, no one made a mistake.
To Extra Place, the back door of the CBGB, a punctured monument, which was closed in 2006, and the street may be the most famous as the background photo on the side of the Ramones Alba band "Rocket to Russia".
"This place was wonderful," says Danny Fields, manager Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
"There were lots of wastes, broken clothes and bags of barrels, posters, letters and exercises."
Some local bloggers, including bloggers who write about the landing of the fourth East Village, object to the idea of selling Extra Place and claim that he is a public property, so he should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place to be a rare - almost unchanged city castle, which should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog called Jeremiahášov between New York and New York (with the title "The Book of Woes: Hot Nostalgic View of the City in the Measuring Process"), added part of the story of Extra Place from the book The City Talk that appeared in The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow dark street, dark and, in the days and restricted by narrow railway doors and closed windows, where the old news week passes through the rivers."
Until a few exceptions, the street of one recent night seemed completely the same.
The cross passed through the dark end of the street near the door, which sometimes led to the CBGB, where today's trade with expensive clothing stands.
On the wall there were graffiti, and next to the pure doses of dried news, there was an empty bed of beer.
A couple of co-founders said they were thinking of Extra Place, but they suggested that he could get married.
On the contrary, Fields said he thinks that some people underestimate the mobility of the streets in her current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in dark, tired and disoriented places."
Bilingualism debate: confusion in English
In this issue, Bruce Fuller and Lance T will discuss the existence of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Isumi, a californic academic worker and director of the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a partner of the book "More Than You Think: Why the middle class needs to choose schools".
An effective explanation of the Spanish Volcano is a huge deal.
The educational agenda of Barack Obama is only proving it.
The campaign of both states that "Afro-American and Spanish students are essentially less likely to study than white tears," which is true.
In order to fight with such effective differences, Obama is implementing the educational agenda particularly, among other things, "previous bilingual education" for those who are first educated in English.
The question at Baracka Obama remains whether his commitment to bilingual education, which is based on the use of languages other than English in class, is not stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
We'll take the 6th Street Prep, the charter base school in the Los Angeles era of the east.
The joys of this school are in most cases Spanish families.
More than a third of the students who have recently received a lot of it learn English.
Nevertheless, in the 2008 state math tests, it reached the highest level of unliquidated percentage of fourth-class claims.
At the same time, 19 percent of the fourth grade's claims were reached at the highest level in the national tests in English and literature.
This incredible success was achieved by another method that Obama prefers.
Sixth Street highlights control and development, continuous awareness of capacity and access without speech.
Next, and Obama should take this into account, according to Lindy Michaels, director of Six Street, the educational approach of the school for those who learn English first, "full frustration".
The confusion in English increases the almost essential use of English in education.
Ms. Michaels, who is against bilingual education, said to me, "We had a huge success with a whole new jacket from Mexico - after twelve months you'd come to class and don't know what it is."
"It works," she declared, "it works for us."
Would Obama take the school as Sixth Street Prep for example, how should other schools look with large sections of Spanish and English students?
The results achieved by the school should be made clear from the answer to this question, but the educational agenda of its own party (the National Association for Education is a long-term bilateral education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education undermines Obama's claim.
While Obama agrees that the immigrants should learn English, he has recently tried to criminalize the fact that people should stop taking care of "only English" laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really prefers to reduce the performance differences, he should think more about the educational models that are working, more carefully than to laugh and triviate them.
Red hair is cut because of renewed economic concern
The prices of roses on Monday mornings have fallen because I am concerned that even the US plan to save financial markets would not have to relive the economy.
Terminated sales prices with oil stopped in the early morning trading at the New York Commodity Exchange up to 7 per cent for $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, the price's been worth more than $220 per barrel.
In the past two weeks, markets with comedians have been devastated by financial disturbances at Wall Street and also by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell almost to $90 per barrel this month, which also increased to huge financial market uncertainty.
The increase has again closed the investors in the afternoon, and after the Congress president announced that on the weekend agreement was reached with regard to the largest rescue plan in history.
This report was interrupted by fresh concerns that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the most recent episode of the settlement, the government announced that the Citigroup was buying the Banking Division of the Wachovia Corporation.
Among the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments, the European financial conglomerate Fortis was partly involved.
The analysts of the Barclays Capital said that the saved weekend movement, which led to the economic recovery plan, "shows themselves unable to revive the market's demand".
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for comedians, including wolves, is expected to decline.
"The prospects for markets with global shares, rates and exchange rates have been strongly established," wrote analysts from Deutsche Bank in the report to investors.
"We believe that comedians will not be able to avoid prohibitions.
From a comedy perspective, our greatest age is to what extent the American virus spreads around the world, especially in China."
The analysis of this bank failed to meet its expectations for the next year, as the consumption of oil fell due to lower economic growth and reduced its prices by about 20% in 2009.
The wild ride in the second quarter exceeded the team record
After he spent the last eight season in Jets' dress more than anyone else, defense player Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then on Sunday he watched the development of the second quarter where Jets changed the free game in Spanish driving.
"I've never seen anything like this," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after Jets and cardinals made their dirty game with nightmares over them.
Then the quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranue Colese to a 12-year-old touchdown sprint, which he successfully predicted the afternoon, in which their gradual development of cooperation took place about a mile ahead.
Favre sent Colese in this quarter after the next two touchdowns, including the one he hit the cornerback, and the next 10 seconds before half of the attack.
"It was nothing extraordinary," said Favre about all his Coles' toys.
"It's a fucking good player.
We've been able to communicate well, so people can think of anything."
While Favre and Coles are housed, they have been attacked by Cardinals Kurta Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught the wrong walk and brought it back to 32 yards on touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith printed another puzzle and caught it.
Linebacker David Bowens donated Warner to smoke.
The last loss of the sword, the fumble that Bowens took out was probably the best.
The Cardinals got to the sword 10 seconds before the end, and after Jets got the sword back, the bag of Jay Feely's twenty-two-year-old head out of the field, which he got to drive 34-0.
That's the most when Jets got in one quarter.
Listen, Jets Eric Mangini, when he was called to describe this madness, said, "The second quarter, or the third quarter?"
When he was told that both of them - Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without answering - Mangini said, "I can tell you that the second quarter I enjoyed much more than that third.
A lot of points fell in a short time."
Gebreselassie has improved his world record
Haile Gebresselassie from Ethiopia once again showed why many consider him the best distance race ever when he crossed his own world record on Sunday in Berlin and became the first person to run 26.2 miles long race in two hours and four minutes.
Winning a pleasant flat track in time 2:03:59 moved in 27 seconds his previous time 2:04:26, which ran last year in Berlin.
Gebreselassie, who is 35, has created the 26th world record of his career, which is really incredibly wide - overcome the world record or at least is the world's master at all distances from the metric mile to the marathon.
The last month of Gebreselassie left the Olympic marathon in Beijing because fear - from the background may be too alarmed - that the polluted air will expose its problems with asthma.
Instead, he promised to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - the sun and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the target - he won on Sunday Gebreselassie with a light average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
What is happening to runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya focused on a long track, heard a marathon record in the past decade over two minutes, from the time Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselassie told reporters that he had two weeks of running in the air and left the train for a week.
The stop apparently woke him up more than she kept.
"I'm so happy," said Gebreselassie to the reporters.
"It was all perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I was a little confused today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticised - mainly in Kenya, the East African Rival of Ethiopia - because he planned his race first, generally avoided the world marathons, relied on a guide as if it were a race on the road, and made world records about the meaning of competition.
But this criticism can make it difficult to reduce Gabriel's enormous running quality.
Held in time four of Kenya reached the Gebreselassie half of the time at 1:02:04.
After the leaders disappeared, the remaining Gebreselass were chased by two elite runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
About something before three months before the goal of Gebreselassie finally took and fled to Kambai, who then got to second place at 2:05:36 and thus improved his personal maximum for about five minutes.
Kamathi finished the third time at 2:07:48.
In the race, the woman finished the wonderful sevenst year of history 2:19:19 Irina Mikitínková, a native of Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen.
Record time 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
Six-year-old Mikitínka miraculously won the race for the London marathon at 2:24:14.
Peking games left out for something that was described as a wound in the back, but got stuck and won in Berlin, and in the third marathon, which when she ran, improved her personal maximum for about five minutes.
She ran a smart and thinking race: she let four of the Ethiopian and Kenyan runners run into the big race and then she got about 18 1⁄2 miles [18 1⁄2 km].
Ashkele Tafa Magrasa from Ethiopia won the second at 2:21:31 and Helen Kiprop from Kenya ended the third time at 2:25:01.
Harrows and obstacles to the lives of the blacks in a divided city
A few miles away from the vast entertainment parks of Greater Orlando lies a quiet city, where it revives the pride and generosity of African life.
Eatonville, the first completely black city to be included in the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "The city of five lakes, three crochets, three hundred brown skin, three hundred good blues, supply of coffee, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a quiet place.
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee came to Zora's annual Eatonville Festival! to make a gift from Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains foreign, even though she has made a stopover for tourists by including it to the Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project during the economic crisis.
He's still as independent, honest and private as he was in the three-years, when Hurston wrote that black people in Florida often dropped off and did not share their real feelings with a white man who "we know so little that he doesn't even know what's going on."
Even today, in the year when the Montenegrin president, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion of the races, many more citizens remain cautious about the views of foreigners.
"We pay great attention to how our story is told," says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lives here from birth and is a member of the city's oldest farm.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been described as paradox triumfu and namahy.
It's like a historic model of the Montenegrin rise, so the community is almost 2400 people, where the measure of poverty is bilaterally distributed to the national average.
It is a medium literature, but it is also deeply rooted in the example of South American foreign black culture - sometimes reminiscent, sometimes praised - which has resulted from American childhood.
It's not too surprising that more people are as tough as shelters.
And the anxiety about Eatonville really began to get to Zoro, which is the only way that Hurston's name is here.
She presented to the world her hometown through the heart books full of speeches such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes We Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Floridian tourist guide changed the city of Koussik to Road No. 17, which leads through the often mentioned center Florida, in the bottom of the Black History and Human Drama.
With the exception of a big drum in life and literature, Hurston's reader entered the business of the first Eatonville old Joe Clark, and then turned to personal places.
"Left to the road," she wrote, "is a white-headed modern national school with well-kept courts and shelters that are always Howard Miller's age, even though he can't read or write."
She also mentioned the new husband of Dash's widow and wrote that Lee Glenn "produces all kinds of drinks and even anything related to the hour hotel."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston Eatonville spoke with self-control, but also with indigestion, rejuvenation of dreams and sex.
This was obviously not the typical load load of Fodor's.
In fact, it wasn't a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Now she said it as it was," says Nineteen-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson's girls' congregation that Hurston had made immortals by quoting men who sang loud songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
In Hurston, it is still referred to as the Cyprus metropolis, which often returned after her family moved to Florida Jacksonville.
Seventeen-year-old Augustus Franklin recalls that when she joined the city, she had an accident without a report in the vast Chevrolet, burned and carried the suitcases in the city, which is still proud of proper clothing.
Most of the citizens were fascinated, Franklin said, but many were confused.
"The people of Zoru always liked to see," Franklin said.
But, in addition, he's looking forward to sitting on the back terrace looking at the island of Sabelia, where Hurston's most likely got baptized, "it's never been too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were printed.
It seemed that Eatonville, together with the rest of the world, forgot about it.
Although she was once a literary star, contemporary Langston Hughes and the only black man at the Barnard College in the 20th century, she was buried in an unmarked grave in the Florida Fort Pierce, where she had lived before.
In Eatonville, there were no larger scandals or large public readings.
"I think they didn't understand its meaning for the world or its reference," said Valerie Boyd, author of the book of life of Hurston's "Wrapped and Rainbows" published in 2003.
The change came in the 1980s in the 20th century.
The representatives of the Orange County period wanted to take over the city's five-way road instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is a local double main road.
The solution of the Netherlands has already been challenged by the National Distance No. 4 through the western part of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still receiving from the complex historical period.
The forced integration, together with other things, has brought about a relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 20th century, the struggle against racism led to hatred for the rights of the community.
"At that time, a party of white boys, they came and picked up the moving and stuff on the people who sat on the side," Franklin said.
"We actually had a woman here who killed it.
They walked out of the car with melon."
In a letter from The Orlando Sentinel in 1955, Hurston's highest court's claim for the forced integration and his decision in Brown v. Education Chamber stated that "for my race it's more exciting than celebrating."
The population now claims that the dropout of school, although in some areas it was positive, has reduced the sustainability of Eatonville and subjugated the behaviour of younger people.
"Kernoš children were used to objects - I remember it - you beat your teacher in the morning, you beat your teacher at night," said N. Y. Nathiriova, daughter Elly Dinkins and executive director of the non-profit group Preserve the Eatonville Community (Zachranjte Eatonville Community).
It lasted until teachers and lawyers left the same place, added it.
"You don't care about your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean there's a cultural barrier," said Mrs. Nathiri.
However, civil law has helped to create space for many other Zory Neale Hurstons - black writers, priests and artists who as she was raised above the premises with simple self-consciousness and quotes such as "How can anyone dare to shake my presence!
I don't understand."
In 1975 Alice Walker went to the unknown grave of Hurston and began to fight for her life.
Five years later, he came to the police in the bookstores, where his life was celebrated by Robert E. Hemenwaye, who re-entered him into the American Canon.
The project with the distance reached the moment when the most famous daughter of Eatonville again found a flashlight.
Her former cousins, Hurston, now considered her a savior.
To show what could happen to destroy its distance, the community began planning the Hurston festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural action two years later, and every winter they come back to celebrate.
The state withdrew after a few years from a remote proposal.
"These five crossings of the distance rose up, you would say that the real civil pride was just gone," Nathiri said.
Boyd's just said, "It's time to save Eatonville."
The victory over the remote project helped change the city's image.
Unlike Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started to go to a higher church in 1993, began to appear in a larger number, and citizens began to overestimate the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
The new single-party library (also called after Hurston) was opened in 2006 to re-opened and enriched Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a floral anomalies: only six miles from the centre of Orlando can sometimes be treated as a lost street in the summer rain as small as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 18th century.
(Today is 90% black.)
With foreigners who come looking for the story and the meaning of Eatonville, it is still very often observed.
The permission for most conversations is necessary to have certain things in front and certain things - such as wrapped furniture in the oldest Eatonville church, which have painted whites and painted blacks in the fields - should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Jones, a brave, self - sacrificing teacher who likes the blue net, still fear that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And even as Hurston's festival grew, domestic pride grew.
In particular, young people hesitate to see Eatonville as Hurston saw his entire race: beautiful, with problems and so on, but not better, not worse and worse, creative, employed, traveling and diverse as other American races and ethnics.
From the voice of Franklin's son, Edwin Harvey, who is eight years old, expresses sincere love for the village when he plans to return to Eatonville after high school to work in the local government or in the police who say she would benefit from some help.
And even younger ones, such as the one-to-one couple from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kenonov seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they're just here, think, 'Well, this city is nothing against the others,' said Alondra Kenon recently Sunday after church.
"But if you really stop and look for a moment in history, it's a very nice place."
Here in New York, we're all talking in full financial terms.
Nothing has changed in the first place.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the news stations and TV screens on Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were standing in the middle of the storm.
They would never agree that, in the exploding lead of the offices, they have every day bankers and investment fund managers who monopolize New York, the worst "good day in the office" since the 1929 crisis.
The passengers are still counting on truck cars on the way and transport muffin packs to breakfast meetings.
The Spaniards continue to move between the bees and wear, like human beads, dozens of scissors that rise from the whales on their backs.
The office crossings are still waiting in front of their morning luggage in street dining rooms, and it is still not possible to meet every day of the yellow taxi between Thursday and Saturday.
It didn't look like a crisis, until I decided to put myself in the next afternoon's account with all the things about pessimism.
Even though I've been working on this task to cover up with my afternoon seat on my local JP Morgan Chase, there's been about twenty people waiting at the front.
Not before the shopping windows to get up or put in order, but before the delay where the elderly customers order checkbooks, tourists ask themselves on their way to trade with Macy's mixed product and new customers are charging accounts.
Most of the people in front of me, as I learned from Star, my "licensed personal banker," came for the same reason as me.
However, my opponents have already chosen their savings from smaller banks in places, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They have chosen money from so-called trophys (a little like a construction company), money companies, and from these types of companies that operate only in one state and who claim to care about their customers as family.
In the last year, 15 such banks have collapsed.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with assets of $327 billion, went to the competition, and when New York's homes returned on Friday evening, another bank, Wachavia, with assets of $440 billion, tried to catch a rescue buyer.
The office staff and the shops that stood before me and feared another collapse moved their readiness to the bank, which is considered a safe haven and which makes most of the storage on Wall Street.
In the last week, ordinary New Yorkers have learned a lot of financial skills.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket spoke on the phone and spoke to Lehman Borthers, the corrupt bank, and to her lost high-performance employee Dick Full with family ties, as if she were lying about her colleague's line.
And Lyn, a uniformed bunch of pancakes, changed the subject of our usual conversation - Brad, Angelina, or my food supplies.
After my visit to the bank, she told me, "I now have my savings in the money market.
I moved it, I won't risk it."
Muslims' graves are torn apart after the Raquel's legal breach
Heinz-Christian Strache, left of the Russian legal party Freedoms and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian legal party Vlaams Belang, presented in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008, the "City Against Islam".
Cedillas are not the same as transport marks, which reflect the mixtures of the red cross-section.
The police accuses the legal extremists of bringing the Muslim funeral to Moscow on the same weekend, where extreme legal parties have achieved huge profits in general elections.
Over 90 graveyards in the town of Traun near Linze were once between Friday evenings and this heavy morning, and the police were convinced that an organized action was taking.
Critics supported certain grave Jewish symbols, such as David’s star, but detectives are convinced that this could be an attempt to mask the motives of extremists who hated Muslim immigrants.
It's not clear whether this incident was proposed with the votes.
The speakers from the Islamic communities said that they are "deeply shocked" reports of the massacre that will occur at the time of the end of the Muslim post-Muslim month of Ramadan.
In the meantime, Rakousko enters the car looking for his own soul after the transport in the previous parliamentary elections.
Both national legal parties, which received more than 30 per cent votes in favour of the People's Party and the People's Party for the Future of Rakouska, launched a campaign against immigration, and some of its members were criticized as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, president of the Free Party, who won over 18 per cent of the votes, protested against the jokes and the buffs in the campaign and even expressed his opposition to the food in which he was concerned with Islam.
At the last meeting with the voters in Vienna, he spoke about "European brotherhood", which should prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties are trying to ban the construction of mixed and mineral structures and argue that these are political symbols of the Islamicization of Rakouska and Europe.
Studies and analyses conducted immediately after elections, which have placed extreme rights in the country's most powerful political block, indicate that these changes have been caused by young voters, especially those who care about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter can't travel by borders
Gary Glitter, a glamorous star who was sentenced to sexual abuse of children, ordered the court to travel to France and Spain.
The officials violated this six-month ban on Glitter after informing the monitoring authorities that it intends to travel through France to Spain.
The Kentska police had agreed on this travel ban on last Thursday after giving evidence of Gliter's previous sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, by his own name, Paul Gadd, did not participate in the hearing of the Ashford smallest criminal court in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
The oral court said: "On Thursday 25 September at Ashford's lowest criminal court, the Canadian police asked for a regulation that would prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the border to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd did not participate personally."
64-year-old Glitter told the authorities that he was going to travel to a foreign country, as it would put him in a register of sexual assaults.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also forward the planned date of departure to the police week before.
If the duty to inform the authorities he has mentioned, he may be sentenced to five years.
The Kent police announced that they would not be conducting individual cases of Gliter's possible roads over the period.
"Kentsk police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it's easier to follow someone who stays in Britain because we have extensive systems that control potential dangers more effectively.
Protecting Kent's citizens is the highest priority for the Kent police and we work hard to monitor the conduct of registered sexual attackers, thus reducing any danger to the public at least."
Glitter returned to Britain last month, which he spent 27 months in the Vietnamese prison for using two girls 10 and 11 years of age.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he had to fly to London.
But he said he didn't feel well, and he refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities let him pass his passport and finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials continued on his return to Britain.
On 22 August, he finally reached Heathrow Terminal 3 and stayed there while his legal representative David Corker went to Uxbridge's lowest criminal court in western London and, at the same time, Scotland Yard successfully requested an order to register as a sexual attacker.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in the United Kingdom for the possession of child pornography for four months.
A source from the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Ministry of the Interior, is calm and pleased that Glitter was banned on his journey to France and Spain.
"To capture the real character, the photo of the master outside the scene." Günther Bauer - photographer
No Undergrounds, no bells, no costumes.
Except for the essence of the great mysteries of flamenca, which are responsible for focusing on interpretation - I only aim at the free expression of man or woman.
On one side of the artist.
To the second person.
Indiscriminately, if we mention individuals, in those moments away from the audience - then you can watch a reliable gesture, the depth of a year's experience, or a generous gesture with your hands that are without age, because they do not appear to appear on stage.
German Günther Bauer plays in the "Flamenco-people" theatre performance with songs, dancers and guitarists with that less known face of masters.
To this end, the photographer is composed of the unique iconography of the flamenca from different environments.
The exhibition that takes place within the month of the flamenca photo (Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca), "responses the growing international significance of flamenca", says the author and explains that "Flamenco-people" "can be any people, but when you look at the photograph, you will find that these are not typical images of artists on the scene.
These people's portraits "on the street" are the artists who are able to pass your smile, smile, joy... and totally capture the surprises.
There is no need to take photos of these artists.
She wears her personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a free atmosphere that allows me to capture the personality of the huge flamenca.
At the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer started a long way of filming flamenco songs, guitars and dancers on the board camera in 1997.
These are portraits that remind you of classic photos by choosing camera and material.
The payment of different stylistic means is in conflict with the classic basis of the picture and provides it with a contemporary spirit, which is the idea that according to Bauer's own vision and flamenco: "The idea of a very traditional root which does not cease to surprise and develop."
What's funny is not the movement of the dance itself, the song or the game, but the personality and the character of the artist.
The search for the moment when we meet with the most important, the spirit that appears in the way of thinking, being and living, was and is the constant work presented during these days in the El Photota gallery.
This selection of almost seventy photographed artists creates famous flamenco positions, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales or Vicente Amigo.
The project became like a flamenca anthology and soon a book publication will be printed, which will contain the portraits displayed.
In the past two years, your portraits have brought Bauer to mind repeating the idea of "Portrétech sports veterans" ("SportARTproject").
Although their concept is different from the "Flamenco-people", the photographer will assume that "photo people, know them and have the opportunity at the moment, whether longer or just short, to enter into their lives - that's my wish.
I think the portrait is the most difficult scene in the picture.
A person meets or interacts with people, personalities that never know, or they will give him a few minutes to focus.
Despite similar circumstances as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
The collection of the portraits of the current flamenca with the name "Flamenco-people" is presented in the El Photomat Gallery in the street de la Mata 20, equivalent to Alamedo de Hércules, and it is possible to visit it until 16 October.
Vargas Llos admitted that the novel he writes is "trephasis"
He plays in an environment he doesn't know yet, and reports about events for unknowns, yet Mario Vargas Llosa is able to successfully implement his new project - he's just working on a novel whose main hero is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived for twenty years in the Congo and traveled to Amazon.
An eternal favour of Nobel's price for literature was admitted at the Hay Festival Segovia festival yesterday that the project he's actually working on is "trophy", and that "all testify that I shouldn't write" this novel.
"If I had any reason, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and I believe it will be done once," he concluded his contribution to the festival of exchanges of ideas, ideas and words, which he watched in the city for four days around hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of others.
The author of the Roman "City and Psi" was one of the main features of the third anniversary of the celebration of the word and fulfilled the expectation.
Vargas Llosa, who earned the price of Hay Festival for the most popular writer - the old Dickens edition "Our mutual friend", filled the Juan Bravo theatre to the last place.
With Félix Rome, who introduced him, had before him a publication taken from him who spent time as a water - Peruan with amazing accuracy and a remarkable dose of humour, he recalled how it came to him from the original "unbelievable friendship" from the "satisfying of the reader" and from the "power to live more than I have lived" of a literary message; how he admits "the lack of inspiration" by writing "disciplinated", literally distorts and prescribes, or how his writings, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas are influenced by the original "faulkner" and what the "memor image" of it is called "my" and what the "remony" are called the nose.
The Spanish novelist admitted that "there is no way" to find out whether and to what extent books can change their lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is just fun, fun experience" - Vargas Llos stressed that according to him "to people" and "to try to get out of order", he called the writers to "do not surrender" and "take responsibility" for themselves.
Because of climate technologies losing fame in Pozoblanca - missing copies
The meeting with the copies of the festival in Pozoblanca was cancelled yesterday after a notice confirmed that the site's surface is not in good condition.
Therefore, the company, along with Fermín Bohorquez, Pablo Hermosou de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to delete the existing games.
Inconsistencies in weather conditions result in a long period of time that two of the three festivals could not be realized.
On Saturday, he was unable to catch the rain through the other planned summer sports.
During their training, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were supposed to set up a flight in the arena in Castileblanca.
But it was only Friday.
The winner became Daniel Luque, who mounted three ears and rewarded for dynamic and aesthetic quality performance was brought to the front.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante replaced two early copies of the greeting and one ear that brought him a rather uncovered seat in the arena than in Toreador art.
It was even worse on El Juli, who went through the Los Llanos aren't sent anonymously.
In the second round of the door without a single breath, he served the island of criticism from most of the provinces.
Checks were carried out in Álva in the supplier with two thousand kilograms of cough
Ten minutes, five minutes.
Ertzaintza Railway Control in Arminüón City (Álva).
The officials stop two people running into the supplier and they're driving them away.
The cost, more than two tons of gas, is not to be stopped.
According to the report of the Committee of the Interior of the Basque Government, the officials pursued and detained one of the suppliers, a 38-year-old man who was identified as A. A. J.
He was charged with drug trafficking and fraud in state documents.
The incident occurred when several of the officials of the Transport Unit carried out road control at N-1 in the areas where the border of the city of Arminüón was crossing.
They wanted to stop the supply for control, but the driver didn't listen to the instructions, rushed and caught.
The car crew began to slow down as the vehicle stopped at the border a few miles away, and at this moment two passengers jumped up and ran into the woods.
At the end of one of them, the members of Ertzaintzy finally caught up with 2,178 kilograms of hackers, who suspected that they had carried out a survey of Iveco Daily’s delivery.
The rear part of the vehicle was fitted with a case-by-case kit, which was subsequently transferred to other police departments for detailed expertise and drug testing.
In addition, the police found that the identification mark was "barred" and did not agree with the data contained in the supply documents, which was therefore also accused of falsification of state documents.
Ertzaintza continues to look after the second suspect, which, as mentioned above, has been able to cover up in order to finally determine the origin of the drugs involved.
A. A. J., held 28 years ago, was transferred to the police department to establish appropriate formalities before further investigation took place.
Heather Locklearo’s helicopter is kept for driving under the influence of medications
Herečka Heather Locklearo, a beloved Amanda from the Melrose Place series, was held this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of drugs.
The Witness saw her perform unusual manoeuvres when she tried to get out of the park in Montecito, delivering a magazine to the people of California’s speaking railways.
The witness confirmed that about 16.30 o'clock, Locklearo's "the priest went to the floor, ran ahead and back and tried to get out of the parking lot - several times he passed the sunglasses."
A witness she didn't know, first of all, saw Lockleair's moment after she stopped on the remote side and left the vehicle.
This person also warned the rescue service because "she was afraid of Locklearo's life."
When the police guard hit the spot, she found a helicopter inside the vehicle, which partly blocked the vehicle.
"It seemed disorientated" and therefore its staff took it to a specialized drug and alcohol centre to complete the test.
According to the police spokesman, the heretic worked together and excessive amounts of alcohol were eliminated, although "we believe Locklearo was under the influence of some drugs that were common to the guards at first sight".
Locklearo was kept for suspected adverse effects treatment close to the specified substance and approximately 1900 was taken into custody even though it was already released for several hours later.
Two months ago Locklearo returned from the treatment clinic, where she was recovering from poor conditions and depression.
Llamzares insists on the Andalus IU to exercise its powers in the Silva case
The General Head of the IU and the Ambassador for the Joint Left Gaspar Llamazares said today that the final decision in the case of the former Youth and Sports Committee of the Youth Council in Seville Francisco Manuela Silvy, who left the office last week after being accused of acting in the interests of his family, will depend on the national association of the party.
"I am too a federalist, it is an Andalusian organization to exercise its power," Llamazares said, adding that the party will have to make progress in relation to the former member of the municipal council.
However, the Head of the IU continued that in the case of an illegal conduct investigation that Silva had allowed, it was absolutely necessary to "transparency": "IU has always struggled to make similar issues extremely transparent."
He also stressed that the party has a "strict code of ethics for all public functions".
"Blood blood" ('Sangre de Mayo'), eppic seed of Garci
José Luis Garci in the film "Churt's Blood" (Sangre de Mayo), to whom he was inspired by the Episodes of the National past Benita Pérez Galdós, relives the famous Spanish revolt against the French - one of the most ambitious films in his film with the beginning of about 15 million euros.
In this way he wanted to "increase the accuracy of the position and analysis of the society", which was always amazed by the famous novelist, explaining today with Quim Gutiérrez and Paul Echevarría during the presentation of the picture before the extensive team of interpreters.
The flower blood with a metering over two and a half hours will be presented to the kitchen this Friday and will be more than four-year TV series for Telemadrid.
As a great fan of the literary works of Galdós José Luis Garci, he claimed that by filming this film he had fulfilled "the child's dream", thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, which he believed three years ago for the Autonomic province of Madrid to be filmed on the second anniversary of Madrid on 2 May, he accepted the offer with a view that the event will take place from the National past.
The number of 15 million, to which the Madrid province has fully contributed, means Garci's "one chance" to create environments with bullets and costumes corresponding to the image of "the Christian Spain who failed to fight for whom it was going to fight - the fight for independence led by the Government of Ferdinand VII. to the fall and the rest of the country," he said.
However, the director regrets that he could not count on the financial support that came to the films Smurfé (Ala sade) or Goy's performances - almost double the Flower Blood - he was unable to capture some scenes from the scene of a film signed by Horacia Valcárcel, with which he works almost all over his film drive.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver and empezar) works as usual - on a stage with a priest who usually tries and does not get casting himself into castinje, because it seems to him "slower" and also thinks that "the director's invitation is to go to the theater and kin and find out what's going on in the room where he lives".
Many priests he chose for the White Blood are already present before his camera several times, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga, or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, with four nominations on Oscar from one of them, is of the view that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the sole Flower Blood, the seven chairs of the French bill and the last elected blind Sunday, does not represent a young generation of Spanish film scenes, but claims that "this is the first revelation".
For this film, Garci doesn't expect any evaluation.
"At first you think you're working for what's going to happen then, but then you realize you're just working for a profit, and then you're gonna be able to make another movie more," explains Garci with a career for more than 30 years.
Isabel Bayon is reviving the spiritual reference of the city dancer Tortoly Valencia
Sevilll dancers flamenca give birth to other Sevilll dancers.
Carmen Törtola Valencia, father of Catalan (Florenç Törtola Ferrer) and mother of Andalusanky (Georgia Valencia Valencia Valencia), was born in the fourth triana, and when she was three years old, they moved with their family to London.
She was dancing modern dance and focused on Oriental dance.
She lived a full life, she was the leading female emancipation such as Isador Duncan, Virginia Wolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian, and she was fighting to destroy a corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman was influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution by the interlinear Europe of Isabel Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this position to me -- it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer "he's not about saving her life, but about getting her soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of flamenca rhythms.
So "the dance of the motley" called me a gaair or "the dance of the hada" some kind of tang.
Her dance was meaningful and they told me that my dance of this aesthetic is also the answer," she says.
The presentation is composed of two outstanding characters: Miguel Povedi, who will sing in one exhibition as in the "Open Doors" (La doorta abierta), and with the teacher of the dance Matilda Coralov, who made an exception and joined in cooperation with his former joke.
"Matilde represents the oldest Tortoum, a mature position.
I'm glad she accepted an offer to share in my project, and it's a great honor for me."
The performance also includes music and guitars by Jesúse Torres and Paca Ariagy, by Miguel Ortega, el Pulgy and Moi de Morón; bubunny El Pájara, violinist Rafa El Violy and co-operational priest Juanfry Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal leader of this kind of artist who are primadonized by all and who are always loved by them".
It also takes into account the life of this woman who played at her own time in places such as India, the United States or Russia, as well as throughout Europe because she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think she was one of those women who had a tremendous influence at some point, but today no one knows her and yet less appreciates her creation," said Bayón.
The show begins today at 20.30 in the Lope de Vegy theatre.
The book "Breath Women's Trees" concludes and triennials
The introduction of the first illustrated edition of "Denika of the Virgin of Women" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), at a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez closed the funeral with Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the programme coordinated by the Cultural Council of Independent Andalusian Governments at the celebration of "Thirnále Zenobia and Juana Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of the Nobel Prize for Literature and their death.
"Thirnále Zenobie and Juana Ramona" refers to the end of the new edition of this work, the international convention to be held in New York, the construction of the Nobel museum house and the travel exhibition "Joan Ramón Jiménez: Onen paprsk sun", which was opened in May of this year, and after which the various Andalusian province would have to move to New York according to plans at the time of the convention.
The cultural council of the autonomous Andalusian government also ordered eight hundred prints from the "Deny of the Pure Women" by Pedrem Taberem and illustrated Jacob Pérez-Encise to continue to spread information about the personality and parts of one of the world's largest Andalusian poets.
America no longer likes Paul Newman.
"Sometimes God creates perfect humans.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of the heretic Sally Field, who worked with him on the "No Wrong Thinking" and under the knowledge that Newman left, he withdraws his unsatisfied vision of American cinematography and all of America.
Look how long they had been before Oskar got it.
And that he's been in debt since 2007.
And that he knew he was very sick.
Still he was for all the boys.
"Sometimes what a man feels can't express in any way, and now I've lost a big friend," said Robert Redford in tears, "my life and my country were better thanks to him."
No one's afraid he's gonna be funny or he's going to get over it.
The father of the film and the authorities died in particular a dark period of fear from terrorists and financial markets, at a time when the American consciousness is on the ground when hopes are looking for reasons for cruelty.
When the time is harsh and people without dignity, and only those who stand in awe of you - there's no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he had almost a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official envoy of Richard Nixon and a soldier for the victims of the destruction and the defeat of the drug addiction, based on the honour of the first-born son who died on overdose until after his own label of food and bio food.
A complete loan for a country that has continued to make a great effort to break free from a self-sustaining entertainment culture.
The bourgeois walnut wonder of Hollywood's flood regardless of nationality or nationality.
Last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, found that one man didn't die, but one whole summer.
Another Englishman, the Oskar holder of the Sam Mendes regime, said working with Newman was without too much of his career.
A bad mountain from Australia, Russell Crowe, has tried to mark Newman as his greatest source of inspiration.
"This lipstick has set us all up a pretty high lattice," observes George Clooney, perhaps one of the little ones who has a tendency today to try to live like Paul Newman's life - is based on honesty and leads a serious private life away from the camera.
It's not always easy in today's media jungle, sometimes even possible.
But the luck is that people are, and Paul Newman is their model.
He was divorced once, and since then he's been married for fifteen years with Joanne Woodward, who was faithful, although he had more than enough opportunity to be.
"Why would I go out to the hamburger when I have a file at home?" he liked to joke.
Let him in heaven be proud to have a government relationship between his daughters and his admirers - it's not too common in America.
It is said that "of all the great roles that he has committed, he was the most vulnerable to the role of a dedicated husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather and a victim's finantre."
Unperfect Olympic Games in Madrid
Yes, many of us complain that the Olympics will take place in Madrid, and in 2012 it will be possible to do so in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we're going to run a race tomorrow, I'm saying no!
He was talking about him as a perfect race, and I think he was the worst I've ever been on.
Such a dream doesn't make sense that if it came to the evaluation and I was testing, it would be obvious that it was not enough.
But let's look at it from the beginning, nice one at a time.
Misunderstandings begin with an increase in the number of drivers for which a person has to express himself first.
I don't think that's bad, but when a man goes there, he'll be given everything (including a chip that's got to pass through the wire.)
But no.
Here the person had to pick up the number first (first thought, only to go there because of it) and (after the formation of the matching fronts) - what a surprise! - they had only three S sizes (second thought, because I need the size XL).
Where do we live?
Because of the crisis, they decided to buy just a little trick, because it's less of a substance and they're cheaper?
All right, these are still small compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to having to go very soon for the chip and the front on it lasted more than 15 minutes, he had to take the bags back there.
Over 35 minutes was waiting, which is on the race, where 11,000 people are expected to be, something impossible.
So, as it was expected, the race started and we didn't give up yet, and when it happened, it was much worse.
The waiting extended for 40 minutes of rain, resulting in general heating and attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have breakfast tomorrow, and some like me, will not have the right time to assess the results of the chip that they gave me and which, as I guess, did not indicate the right time to start.
Of course, if someone asked me about a perfect race, this wouldn't happen to me.
And so I think we're going to have to get ready for the Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for reception (virtual)
At the MIT conference on new technologies, Microsoft presented further developments in the new system of visual recognition and human interaction in an intelligent way - not too intelligent but capable of carrying out basic tasks such as calling taxis (or in the case of Microsoft, the result that would move across the company area) and taking into account what is being heard in the conversation.
Thanks to the camera and system that recognises the shapes and faces, these "receiving" can determine how many people are in the room who are - even remember what they have on themselves - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
It can also divide the available according to the conversion groups.
In a demonstration video, the receptionist notes the third person and understands that he does not belong to the group he is talking to, and that he is not a company employee.
She's wondering if she's going after someone and she's telling her she's going to marry her right now.
That's all without a blue screen of death.
That's funny.
But, of course, it's the song of the future.
Now the company has the most important things to do, for example a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week talked a lot about changing Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be easy and will not have so many compatible programs.
Steve Ballmer came to the point that if the computers had only the most necessary, without the competition of commercial interests, they would be five times more efficient - man, Steve, they would still be cheaper.
Show as a game when we consider that Microsoft version of the version adds a new feature to Windows and another "extra".
The change of direction would be appropriate.
Microsoft has the truth, the operating system slowly loses meaning and is similar to this software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who adhered to the theory that it was the first step in Googlu's competition with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is a necessary kind of interface between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to the Chinese.
That's true.
It never disappears, but we need to think about the "death" of the operating system, not like absolute truth, but relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week, this idea confirms.
People pay less attention to the operating system and, however, to more Internet browsers.
The computer stops to download Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time on the Internet than on the outside of the window.
What do half of the applications running the system deserve?
It's less.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less difficult, less complicated, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Googlu.
Hope they need it, and I have a little example here.
I did this photo in one restroom for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
On the connected car was a poster, which is requested to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, independent studies showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google’s online search.
Last week, a new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It's not coming at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let's start by 2010.
In Microsoft they will certainly try to bring into the Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 market together.
The phone's going to become the more computer.
Given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay for the delay.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried him on the Azour coast, Leonardo di Caprio in one of the "Creed Diamonds" of Edward Zwicka, as well as Al Pacino in "Kmotrovi" Francis Ford Coppoly, and is also part of the uniforms of the rich gay communities.
And if we want to go to the reading of his life roles, we can climb up to the image of a typical sculptor with a scenic book that doubles the facts in the rock circus.
It's basically nothing more than a typical French undercrowd, accessible and without gloves.
The English languages call him 'tank', but only Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels turns out to be all the others.
For the first time for his fragile name - even though the people call him 'Marcel' - which is related to sport, because, as he relates to legend, was named after the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lovers of Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' is the result of the other quality of the dance, unisex arrow, soluble shield and (about unknown) Belgian train, which has models of the most impeccable tires as detail in the church.
And be careful, because the Belgian company does not specialize only on tank tops.
It also makes kitchen colleges, retro boxers, casserole candles, bathrobes, swimming pools, seams, children's clothes, mini terraces...
Thoughtful kisses for comfortable underwear.
Even though it's a shame they're just undercover.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother.
She was not distracted by her sister’s romantic interest in the development of her own personality.
Monique Cruz, although small, is a woman who is full of life.
Their new moves in fashion are now taking the sisters of Cruz very seriously.
For Monique, it means much more than that some beautiful, famous girls earn their name.
In Paris, a promotional action was undertaken by Mango in its new seat, and a declaration of the less significant modal prices that this Spanish company sponsors.
He's warm and unbridled, and he'll get you closer.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I've come to introduce a new collection that we proposed with Sister Penelope for Mango for the year-long south-west season, and I have also participated in the announcement of the second anniversary of Mango Fashion Awards and dinner in the Opera at the honor of Valentina.
Well, it was a wonderful day, but at the same time, it was a exciting day.
What's your new collection for Mango, as you're already working for the fourth season?
My sister and I love films from the '50s and '60s, and we've had a lot of excitement.
I also like to go around the city, and I watch women walk dressed, combine and sort of dress, and I do so very often.
You're a dancer, a hero, a designer, so a very strange woman, right?
I think it's true, but it's all over, and it's got a lot of connections.
I should have given up my favorite clothes, I've always wanted to go to my grandmother's, check in my aunt's clothes and watch her dress.
It was a sensation, almost better than going to bed.
Then when I became a dancer, I always tried to get my clothes dressed.
You know, however, that we dancers rely on how we are managed to feel good in our watch hours and tests.
And as a hero, when they give you your costumes, you're really going to break into the building.
So it's all connected, along with great respect for designers and professionals.
You've been 30 lately, you've had a crisis?
Oh, my God.
I feel better than ever before. I'm a triangular.
I find that the woman is ready, her experience and life is getting better with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of biological clocks.
I gave up doing what I wanted, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking of being a mother, aren't you?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body demands it, and I want to be a young mother, and I don't want to miss it.
If it's about my father, I don't care about it.
But one thing I know is I'll give my child a sense of happiness and I'll raise him with great love.
If it's about the movie, he's waiting for you now a couple of movie premiums you've been running for.
That's right, and I'm glad they're coming to the kitchen.
I'm coming out of the wild world, so I'm very impatient and unsatisfied, I want everything right now and it's not going to happen.
I'm happy for the "La Last Hour" and "En busca de la Tumba de Christ".
I'm glad you're gonna like...
A few days ago, you had your prime minister on a preview prayer next to Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going to step on the ground like a model.
She just called me Naomi Campbell, which I have known for a long time, and invited me to London to participate in the beneficial reviews for her "Women for a better life" organization, and the clothes we presented - I also chose two models from our collection for Mango, and the auction was presented to Naomi's non-governmental organization.
People don't know Naomi has such a good heart.
She's talking about a lot of things and I, since I know her, can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'm going to stick to the good thing he's engaged in.
She asked me to introduce myself for charity purposes, but if she asks me to make a stand, I will do it too.
I'll do what the women of the third world need.
Drivers re-enacting with alcohol in blood will have to install "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that the driver have to install in his car a system that will prevent him from driving in a truck or if he does not breathe.
The proposal was known already in June of this year and is now included in the annual report of the Supreme State Representative, according to which it relates to a pilot project that takes place one year.
Its aim is to return the driver as a volunteer, so drivers will also have to complete the course of transport survival.
In addition to this experience, the National Transport Safety Authority (DGT) and the Technical Safety Authority (FITSA) will be involved in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 % of the car drivers charged more than once for the re-initiation of the vehicle in this state shall be held by the volunteer.
Alcolock should avoid this because it is a system connected to a vehicle that measures the fuel of alcohol in the air and prohibits the start of a car if the driver is not breathing before the week or if it is marked higher than the permitted concentration of alcohol.
His price exceeds 1,000 euros and he'd have to pay it himself.
A study carried out in this regard in the United States in 2007 showed that during the first year of the introduction, 65 % of the emissions of vehicles equipped with this device were reduced.
In Spain, it is calculated that each year 115 people could be saved.
The measure is limited to the administrative sanctions for two reasons: to resolve this behaviour before it comes into force in criminal proceedings.
In order to assist in its implementation, as legal correction can be carried out in an ordinary manner, it is necessary to amend the criminal provisions, however, to amend the law.
The facility is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although it has been successfully installed in some industrial vehicles and public service vehicles.
The Congress will vote tomorrow on the proposal of the PSOE (Spain Socialist Party) in which it is recommended to install this system in school buses, such as in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British accuracy, at 17.40 hours, as in the program, it arrived at the Presidential Hungary at the airport of Benita Juárez, Mexico D. F., a Spanish Air Force aircraft in which the prince and princess arrived from Asturia.
The sun just fell, however, his papillas had to close their eyes so that they could watch the next couple coming out of the plane.
A Spanish ambassador and other officials were present at the meeting.
A few hours ago, I asked the taxi driver if he knew that the Spanish prince was coming to the state visit.
- Yeah, that's great.
No, no, sir, she's a Spaniard, but she's lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, so...
The Mexican press, however, well knows who are prince and princess from Asturia and how important their visits are.
A lot of people are waiting in a hangar on a plane close to the red deck and a military cordon, which makes 27 marine soldiers ready to shoot a noble saloon.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in dark blue and a princess, very suddenly dressed and with loose hair, does not have his usual "peeptoes", obviously reported to her that in D.F., the storm is threatening.
Before they go to the hall, where the official delegation is waiting, they laugh at the photographs and they don't pay attention.
In the doors, where they will be accommodated, one of the four biggest hotels in the city is waiting for the Mexican TV reporter.
Best adjustable modular price
There is probably no more suitable place in the world to declare fashion prices than Paris and probably no more prominent designer and bonus than Valentino.
Mango's company just announced the second anniversary of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to allow the international presentation of new talent in fashion.
The price shall be added to the amount of EUR 300 000.
Belgian Sandrina Fasoli, the winner of the first anniversary, looked at his proposals yesterday at the Manga exhibition on Paris Boulevard Haussmann number 54 and almost cried out.
Of course, it is the second largest trade in this company in Europe and was just opened at a square foot of 1,335 metres.
The biggest one is in London.
Many events, together with the encouragement of Valentino's sponsors to thank the presidency of the Competition Court for its appointment, enabled us to finally make an in-depth increase in the Paris Opera Garnier.
With the company Mango, the well-known presidential table appeared to be something even more wonderful in the eyes of the most prominent Chagal works.
Nate, whose heart was broken because of the recent death of her brother, dressed in the clothing of this sign and the ELAH hat, over which the breath was sealed, and wrapped in his son Luise - almost two meters of elegance - brought Valentina to the table at the table at night to his honor.
Andindi, the chief and owner of Mango's company, took the prize, and as the real gentleman, he stayed with Baron Rothschild without a sassa, because they both offered her to two ladies.
Monique Cruz, who came into trade in - own-handly designed - pants and shirts and moved into long black hats at dinner, made a night walk after the opera for the pass of Goy Toledov, showed us a ball test room and, at other times, caught one of the boots and marked "big file".
Inés Sastreov didn't keep up on a visit to the next building hall, but before we left, she showed us pictures of her son on the mobile phone.
The next morning, we could love the presence of Olivier Martínez - another young man who rides on the bike - and John Travolty, who came to the Paris Intercontinental hotel with his own clothes and handshake and in front of asking that no candles be used in his rooms.
The stars under the star Paris sky.
Oh, that's life.
1001 - Counterstrike Number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget about Chaotitic and life-threatening everyday life.
And so that's not a little bit of it, they're all buried in one book that comes to the bookstore of relax on September 30th.
The building calls every morning at 7 o'clock as a punishment, but it's even worse to imagine yourself trapped in a successful pace that brings a modern life.
The office is called burn and the computer's pain behind.
Stress is a 21st century disease.
There are, however, not one or two ways to fight daily exhaustion and problems to get rid of the world of work.
No, it's not about anything bigger and less than 1001.
Susannah Marriott’s beside the joginal position, classic massages and "spa" therapy on the pages of his books collected all the "menu" options, adjusted according to the experience and time options of each individual.
The protest book is called "1001 way of relaxation" and thanks to the loading of Pearson Alhambra and DK, it brings you to the bookstore.
If anyone has the ability to achieve peace in such areas as work or personal relationships, this opinion is rejected by the "hand".
In addition, it offers other procedures such as contacting nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you are no longer exposed to adrenalin, which restores balance in your body, and stress becomes a problem, it is time to sit on the floor, relax and focus on reading.
Speaking in Spanish
Some kids talk at night.
I don't think those who wake up and who tell us something that happened the day before, but the kids who talk while they're asleep.
When this happens first, it may cure you, but in fact it's meaningless.
It's a harmless message of sleep called somnilova.
It's quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure not one of you told me he was talking from sleep at night.
This egg can be very sporadic (e.g. once for a lifetime in high temperatures), or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a few months...), the second day the child does not remember anything.
There's not just one reason to explain her attitude.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as night shifts, night shifts, night shifts (night assistance) or sleepiness, but it must not be.
As mentioned earlier, it can sometimes cause very high fevers, stress, or a tense situation.
In any case, it's a little bit of a joke.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak in a calm voice, say a different word, sneezing, or right away (screams, tears, long words...).
In cases where a child is very strong, it would be appropriate to observe and consult with the expert to find out if there is no problem that causes him great distress and thus to appear.
We said that it is a harmless disease, so it is not treated unless it is associated with another disorder that can be treated (e.g. if it is associated with apnea syndrome or permanent stress).
However, we can do this to remember several very simple preventive measures, such as:
Try not to get too upset before you go to bed.
So find quiet games and avoid scary or some violent TV programs or series.
In very nervous children and those who are allowed to work, it is possible to use relaxation techniques that help them find a certain inner calm.
It's a child's quieter sleep.
When dreams come out, try to stay calm.
Remember that it is harmless for a child and that the next day he will not remember anything from what he did.
Advantages
Don't be him.
It's essential because he's not in the knowledge and you're breaking his sleep.
Even if he's talking, he's asleep, and then he's resting.
Remember, if you seem to be very upset several times, it would be appropriate to talk about the advice or to find out what causes such pain in your child.
If you understand what he says (which is not so common), avoid trying to listen to him and learn from him.
It won't do anything because when he's asleep, he's not in the mood to get his thoughts fixed.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you don't know what he thinks about, and then why he says it, so take a great look at how you interpret information and what conclusions you come to.
Never tell your child that you can ask him about his secret at night.
Not from the game.
That's a great deal of trouble.
Don't worry for a moment, it's nothing wrong, it's just an episode that lasts just a few minutes.
Illhaeussern... finally.
Illhaeusern finally found his way back to victory after a long period of chaos.
Before the great game could be collected, the zultokers would create more opportunities and be able to make one of them a victory.
The game didn't have a fast pace during this encounter, in which the attackers just had a hard time.
After the first attempt by Captain Kauffmannna, who shot from a distance just about the train past the connection, Illhaeusern began to have a plan and first Funderflick from the distance, then Hirne air, Romain on a long foot or also Diebold gradually came to defend Dannemarie.
On the contrary, the opponent set up half the wall of defense and left only the Agile Riahi on the scene.
The beginning of the second half showed itself as decisive, first thanks to the two chances Dannemarie named Rihai and Temporal, then after the opening of the skin for Illhaeusern, which took place in Marais, well established for the treatment of the sword reflected after the previous trial of Diebold (53').
However, Golman Illhaeusern did not enjoy long joy, about twelve minutes later he was forced to return to the castle and leave his teammates so weak.
Dannemarie, however, was unable to do this and the eleven of Illhaeusern, who had just happened to "shake" the defense, which had not caused any greater difficulties, with the exception of the last seconds of the attack, when the sword flew very close after the great disaster.
Sarkozy is going to attack the scattered fishermen.
Before leaving the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy is making a trip across Britain.
In order to stem the demonstration of the strength of fishermen who had severely violated the availability of several Breton and Normund ports on Monday, the French President decided to go out to Guilvinec in Finistère to meet their representatives there on Tuesday morning.
Finally, the nominations promised to be adopted "in a constructive spirit", hoping to "come with concrete proposals".
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the final meeting of the "Crescent Committee" of the Breton fishermen, with a view to obtaining measures against the sudden increase in the price of oil that reached the ceiling of EUR 1,14 per litre.
According to the speaker of the Elysian Palace of David Martina, the president "will talk about solutions that can be presented in an effort to help their companies regain competitiveness and improve the conditions of employment and the payment of seafarers".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to be a fisherman with disabilities.
On Tuesday morning, the operation of the "Holiday" (a small operation of motor vehicles) was carried out in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, which resulted in a 10 km drive away.
The resort in Quiberon was also blocked, but the connection to Belle-il was not cancelled.
A filter award was made on the coast of Quiberon.
The sailors showed their determination already on Monday, when, immediately before the storage of the remains of the ports in Bresto and Lorento, they burned pneumatics and pallets while in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc were conducting demonstrations.
Hunti was extended to other ports along the Atlantic and the Canal of La Manche, such as the Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where the trawls remained in the port, or to Le Havru, where about twenty ships blocked the operation of commercial ships.
The fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique area stopped the block during the evenings of the important total refinery in Donges.
Those of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until they decide to attend the mid-term meeting in the ministry themselves.
In Guilvinec, however, the "Crescent Committee" should decide on how to proceed on the road ahead and on its participation in the preparatory meeting of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the representatives of the State Fisheries Committee who did not support their hunting.
"The stage will continue" because "fishers from nothing" and "will not be able to get to Paris," reported, for example, Liliane Cariou, the president of the Committee of Fisheries in Lorento.
At present, however, fishermen who do not pay oil tax pay around 50 cents per litre, it is considered that the true value of the ship is achieved only if oil is below 0,30 EUR per litre.
Paul Newman's great
The unforgettable representative "Butche Cassidy and Kida" died as a result of cancer at 83 years of age in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, or Sam Mendes, gave a legend of the film and politically committed priest Paul Newman who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its assumptions of supply for 2008
Brazil's aircraft manufacturer is dependent on the supply of 215 aircraft in the year, and this is due to the risk of recession, which is affecting the world economy.
The fourth world aircraft designer, Embraer, maintains its assumptions of supply for 2008 with 215 additional devices, confirmed by President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer added 97 aircraft.
Brazil's designer has a lot of commitments from the Chinese market, especially on the scale of his planes from 30 to 120 seats.
To this day, Embraer added 41 devices to Chinese customers within eight years.
The AIG considers that 15 % of its assets will fall
Assurers of the American International Group, to which the U.S. money institutions have received over water, considers that he would raise more than 15% of his assets to pay $85 billion, which was given as a deposit, writes the Financial Times issue.
The AIG is ready to examine the sale of most of its activities outside of the international field and income activities in the United States, clarifys the fact that it is a source of close contact.
According to the FT, the AIG Board met on Sunday during the evening to investigate any interference.
No confirmatory statement could be obtained from the AIG.
The assets to which AIG is willing to deliver include its branch of the International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% share in the insurance insurance of Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its portfolio of property and investment in private equity, provides FT.
No final decision on these developments has been taken yet, the FT continues.
The AIG must quickly be prepared to be able to pay a loan of 85 billion, which has been granted to it by the Federal Reserve Bank with a risk that the US authorities will have 80 % of its capital, which will at the same time divide the sharer's share.
Paris. Analysis of the historic meeting Morning Meeting
New York's borough reported a historic decline on Monday after the Snímovn representatives rejected Paulson's savings plan: Dow Jones lost 6,98%, which is an invisible loss of 800 points, and Nasdaq 9,14%.
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is published on 777.68 points at 10,365.45 points.
The largest peak drop in its history (point 684.81) occurred on 17 September 2001, on the day of the resale after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The index Nasdaq with the transfer of technology lost, according to the definitive data after the conclusion of the marketing period, 199.61 and set at 1,983,73 and the expanded standard & Poor's 500 index was lost by 8,81 % (i.e. 106.85) at 1, 106.55.
As mentioned at the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street had recently lost its plans to save the Snömovno bank, a plan that had to be re-founded on the markets for a little stability.
228 votes against and 205 for representatives refused to provide the secret State escort Henry Paulson with the means he requested.
Without two Republicans from the three left his plan.
"It's a bad signal sent by the market that sees Congress not capable of adopting a certain plan," Lindsey Piegza from the FTN Financial is thought to be.
"It shows how much this market plan depended on it," added and expressed concern that the project adopted for a few days did not "be too late".
"If this project is really condemned to the fund (...), the staff will be constantly transferred to Fed (the Central Bank, Mr. Red.) and to the other central banks in order to guarantee the crisis, which would increase the credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, leading the Global Insight economy.
And based on the urgency of Piegza's situation, the United States "every new day brings a single financial institution."
After the Washington Mutual, the banks of Wachov's bank were organised by its rival Citigroup after the invasion of Washington Mutual.
In Europe, the crisis has collected feedback and has called for unprecedented banking intervention in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which indicates that the markets are not "only with the US crisis, rather than with the global crisis", adds an analysis from the FTN Financial.
The deal with the bonds has gone very far.
The result of the 10-year contract was 3,632 % sales 3,827 % on Friday evening, 30 % on 4,161 % sales 4,357 % on the previous day.
Obama won at the top of the first TV show.
After the first Friday debate between the two candidates in the White House, a second debate followed, with the task of finding out who of both John McCain and Barack Obama won.
The majority of the Republicans and Democrats' campaigns did not go unnoticed when both declared their victory in the TV doodle that followed the third American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCaina's performance, however obedient, was not "brillant" enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential elections, the decline in the investigations.
The Gallup’s Constitution, which, by studying the public opinion published on Saturday, entitles Obama to a five-year strike (49% against 44% for McCain), argues that democracy is the one who won in due time.
Among the unsolved voters directly concerned, Obama won 39 % of the questioned, while, according to CBS study, 25% of McCain's win.
Both should have the opportunity to confirm their leadership on Thursday with the help of the expected good performance of their populace Joseph Biden, during the first and at the same time the only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
It's supposed to be," he warned, however, about the weekend Bill Clinton.
Seventeen-year-old McCain has consistently voiced his irrefutable experience in the field of foreign policy, while at the same time emphasising his "neighbour" competition in issues that created the core of the first survey.
"It seems that Senator Obama didn't understand that..." sounded repeated accusations.
"I don't think Senator Obama would have enough experience and knowledge to become president," he also assured.
In such an attackive spirit, the Republican TV shows did not take place yesterday.
On the contrary, both stressed that it represents the future.
He didn't lose his head and showed himself to be professional and precise.
He developed his ability to make the right decisions and restore the good news of the United States in the world.
"McCain has not yet understood, while Obama yes," replied on the weekend of a democratic summit, which tells the Republican that he does not take enough to the impact of the crisis on the "normal American".
"During the ninety-minute debate John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama announced yesterday to 20,000 people gathered at a preliminary meeting in North Carolina for the spring rain.
He did not even say words as "meaning class" or "working class". The financial statement makes it clear that Obama, whom the Americans consider to be more capable of saving the economy at the end of the disaster.
"The next week could be a decisive return," said a influential democratic senator, Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, former member of Clinton's administration, compared Obama's "economic transparency" to the one Bill Clinton had during the financial crisis in 1998.
For the candidate for democracy, the group is currently "the final winner of eight years of poor economic policy, how George Bush conducted it and how Senator McCain supported it".
The Senator of Illinois reiterated that, through unexpected Wall Street jumps, he should be able to reduce taxes by 95% of Americans, and also warned that the realization of the potential energy independence of the country through the transfer of renewable energy resources is his priority number one, together with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build the park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates carefully avoided issues related to the financial assistance plan of $700 billion (470 billion) which were adopted last night by Congress and which was highly unpopular.
"What have you noticed that some elections have taken place in Minsk?"
Young people and supporters of the regime demonstrated on Sunday evenings in the capital of the capital, Belarus, to reject the results of parliamentary elections.
Several hundreds of Belarusians gathered on Sunday evenings immediately after the closing of the polling rooms in the capital city of Minsk to protest against the irregularity of elections to parliament.
Although no results have been reported yet, many young people have come to protest against President Lukaschenka's regime: "dictator, demos".
Some admit that they didn't even go to the elections: "What would it be if they did what they wanted with my voice?" says one youth.
It does not believe that this regime, which has been based primarily on foreign observers with the aim of renewing contact with the European Union, would be prepared to carry out the work on the road to democracy.
Sanctions between the prohibition of visas for 40 Belarusian refugees and the freezing of certain assets may be abolished if the elections are considered clean.
It wasn't the way it was, according to the opposition.
"We were kept from the voluntary commissions and our observers were not allowed to take part in counting the votes," said Juri Potémkin, a spokesman of the Union of democratic forces, of the various groups of twelve sides.
"It's a cosmetic change," points out Alexandr Milinkievic, former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections and leads the character of the European spring," because it's essential who's counting the votes, and we have the power to do so.
If any opposition MPs get to Parliament, it will be named and will never be elected.
However, their entry into Parliament may mean a space in television, meetings in regions and legislative proposals."
The opposition must therefore be involved in political functioning, because dialogue with the European Union needs to be started.
It's all about our economy, our deep debt in Russia, the current crisis, and we're not reforming, it's threatening us to become a protector of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is afraid that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed through the elections, will not announce the elections in vain.
It underlines that participation appears to be too high and that the general introduction of the preliminary vote (26% of the vote in Minsk) opened the way to all possible manipulations.
"What have you noticed that some elections have taken place?" said social-democratic leader Alexandr Kosulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
"There was no foot in the volleyballs.
And there will be at least five opposition MPs in Parliament, those who are most in favour of the regime."
The night's silence has again taken place in the old place.
On television, President Lukašenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission welcome success.
Talk - Blood that's sure again
Hema-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of the establishment yesterday and his president, Dr. Francine Décary, was rightly pleased because hema-Québec became one of the most reliable and most effective blood donors in the world.
First of all, he regained public confidence, which was severely damaged after scandal with contaminant blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is generally known, the national blood reserve directed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Committee was contaminated by the immune deficiency (HIV) and the hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and of the fact that the Government of Canada had launched a public investigation in February 1994, to which Judge Horace Krever was asked to explain the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a group could no longer recover.
While Judge Krever was away from the report, some provinces pointed to the Committee’s intention to plan for a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, Gélinea's committee took this role.
Following the Gélineau and Krever's report, two suppliers were set up in Canada: Hema-Québec, who was to finance Quebec, and the Canadian blood company for the maintenance of all provinces and both territories.
"When Hema-Québec began his activities in 1998, nearly 38% of people still had confidence in the Quebec blood system," said Dr. Décaryov.
"The situation was shocking.
In an effort to increase the safety of blood products and to continue to work in this area during the coming years, we have again gained confidence in the public," hema-Quebek adds that at the beginning of 2008 there was no more than 94% of Quebec's population.
Dr. Décary, however, is not missing from the point of view that "faith is a very Greek thing."
Hema-Québec has already applied the principle of caution since its establishment on 28 September 1998.
"At the time we witnessed in Europe the outbreak of many cases of human beings of the inability of mad cow, a new variant of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease," reports a woman who has been run by the company since its establishment in 1998.
"And we didn't know if this disease could spread blood.
We have therefore discussed one of the basic recommendations of Krever and Gélineau, which, if we do not know this, and when there is a serious weakness in spreading, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob's weakness, which is marked by degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, should be taken exceptional measures.
So in April 1999, we refused blood from people who had remained in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safe to see that this disease is transfused.
So this episode showed us that keeping the principle of reasonableness meant something."
In 1999, many more accurate HIV detection techniques appeared on the market: nuclear oxygen (NAT) tests, which enable the presence of the virus directly in the donor blood, and never the presence of antibodies on which the tests were previously used.
NAT tests have allowed a short period of time that occurs between the patient's time of administration and the moment when our techniques can be found in the blood of the first virus, the specialist explains.
We've been able to steal this period for less than a week.
Basically, we reduced the risk that some donors could be charged without knowing about it and without being able to handle it.
This improvement has made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of AIDS through blood transfusions.
The risk of getting contaminated HIV blood is today one of 12 million people.
"In other words, it means that before someone contracted HIV, 12 million blood products will have to be distributed.
Therefore, Héma-Québec distributes 400 000 to 500,000 blood products annually, 24 years before the first case of HIV transmission is revealed through the blood product.
I believe that today we can obtain or prescribe blood transfusions as necessary for healing," says the Head of Management Héma-Québek.
"The next decade's increase is the preservation of the safety of our products.
We never know what kind of pathogen can be found in the system.
Just last year on the island of Réunion discovered the virus chikungunya, which is similar to the virus West Nile that carries to the blood by boiling moisture.
Hema-Québec has to be constantly cautious," Dr. Décary continues and stresses that in addition to safe storage, hema-Québec must also be counted with sufficient supplies.
"The needs are growing because the population is old.
As a result of more aggressive treatment of cancer, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The survival of the population also has consequences for the blood donors network, which consists of only 3% of Quebecans eligible for donations."
Each healthy person is at least 18 years old, meeting the criteria of admissibility, but can only donate blood once in 56 days, which means six times a year.
14 % of the people offering blood are not admitted to the average because they have been carrying AIDS or malaria, and if they have visited the country in which they live, they have been expelled for a year.
"With this 3% we can maintain a condition that meets the needs of the patient.
The shortcomings are very rare.
However, the members of the donor’s network should be complemented by the donor, who can no longer donate his or her own blood.
However, to convince people to give blood is difficult, especially if it is to maintain and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so uncomfortable today that we'll only find an hour so that we can donate blood," wrote Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Quebec provides not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart transplants, eye pumps and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before they are stored in Hema-Québek, which is also responsible for the sole public blood bank of the pumpkin in Quebec.
The lung gland, previously considered to be biomedical waste, causes rich blood on the bone marrow, which can serve to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"Several weeks ago, we celebrated our thousands of samples of blood from the pumpkin tube into the bank and we assumed we would pick them up over a thousand years ago.
At the beginning of next year we should start offering them for transplantation," explains Dr. Décary, whose blood collection program describes them as very popular.
"Some mothers are accused of having no access to him," because Hema-Quebec does not have enough resources to offer this complex and expensive program to all patients in Quebec.
Fotbal - Impact in semi-finals
The impact of Montréal yesterday at the Saputo Stadium during the second and equally decisive fourth-final game of the total number of champions qualified for the semi-final car series of the first USL division, thanks to victory 3:1 (4:3 is the total balance of both stocks) over the Sounders from Seattle.
Lieutenant Antonio Ribeiro gave the decisive head in the 90th minute of the game.
The first half of the completely blanks were visited by the depositor David Testo and Rocco Plantentino, who remained two angles of visual formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who was able to work with Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that on Friday, during the first of the two rounds, the impact on Starfire Complex in Tukula on the site of Seattl's 2nd floor.
The impact is measured in semi-finals with Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening in Minnesota, Thunder made a home run of deficit 3:1 and finally won 4:3, however, Whitecaps went into a semi-final car with a total number of Q54.
The impact should be dealt with with Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, however, details of the series of games will be confirmed until today.
Short - Kovalov’s victory goal
The first three Canadian attackers are ready to launch the season.
A unit composed of Alexe Kovaleva, Tomáše Plekace and Andreje Kosticin last night at Center Bell raised an attack on the victory of Canada's 3:2 on a private train.
Kosticin, the largest star in the universe, shot his head, Plekenec gathered two assistants, and Kovalev closed one game in this fourth victory of the six ready-made games.
Kovalev won the victory by giving himself a single goal during his own voyages.
"I'm not ready yet," warned Rus.
"I need another game to feel good."
"In the first third, he tried to control it too much," observed Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he's estimating the end of the tape.
He's had a good match."
Charest sits in the north
The Prime Minister does not conclude that by the end of the year, early elections will take place
Immediately after the Liberal Party's meeting (Parti liberal) Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where today's supplementary elections are the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left).
"Remove between our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visual manner at the conclusion of the Liberal Party of Québec in Lévis, without giving details.
During his speech, the images were displayed behind him in any image of milk.
On three layers of flats, the shirt ran with remarkable photos of hydroelectric ceilings, down, Québec from the look of Google Maps, maps, etc.
Great resources, like in the pre-war period.
At the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to declare that he would vote in favour of the preliminary elections, even though he warned that he had a very busy programme.
"Sever Plan" creates the fourth "vise", which the prime minister thinks of for Quebec, the "new economic space" vision, which includes an agreement with France on labour force, a contract between Canada and Europe and an agreement with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - Northern Territory on the 49th anniversary - the prime minister has recently mentioned in his statements, there has never been a subject of presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, was limited to explaining why the North represents a "cluster with vast potential", did not indicate the term, higher investment, or a clear priority in future projects.
Recently, he mentioned several approaches to points that could be further developed: in particular water electricity, forest, particularly the subsector, driven by drought growth in developing countries and the restoration of public infrastructure.
North, according to Charest's account, contains "next, sine, honey, platinum, gold, silver, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "land twice greater than France is with us", "is in Quebec.
And it's not just us, but it's in us," he stressed, as he wanted to show that he's allowed a certain national depository myth.
Québec was built to a great degree in relation to the North, the prime minister raised: goldhonba in Abitib, Quebec engineering, James's flag.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added after he had been theologically blinded to look at the vast map behind his back.
North, 70 % of Quebec's territory, including the part of Labrador, which was always requested by Québec, was confirmed by the prime minister during the press conference.
"It's about the traditional position that restored all supply governments.
There is a border sign that has not been in the contract for a long time, and if there is a suitable opportunity, on behalf of the government this position will be taken again," he said.
Otherwise, "it is also necessary to rethink our view of the North," he said when he spoke about the transition of the north-west, which is due to the darkness of icebreakers throughout the year.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that the take-up of the territory becomes a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the land, the original nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful and that the project would be successful, especially for young people.
Two former ministers from two different sides, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (the former Pequistic Ambassador from Hungary), have already begun to associate with about thirty communities.
The Inter-Ministerial Committee, chaired by Benoît Pelletier, has an important position of Julie Boulett (Decision and Natural Resources).
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large meeting, "not necessarily summit", but the time when "a joint visa will be issued".
The development of the North should last in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Sever plan will be "co-designed, structured and strict to the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "visi" as a flood referring to the vision of liberal primers who preceded him.
"Like the liberals who preceded us, we have changed our minds to change challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was one of the last of the ongoing issues of the weekend, which was launched on Friday by a great cococt of the 50th anniversary of Jeana Lesage's approach to the top of the page.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to turn Beauharnois's centre into the Adélard-Godbout Rehabilitation.
"From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, through Lesage, who carried out the Cold Revolution and the birth of water electricity, until after Bourassu, who created James's arrest, proved our side to create the future," Jean Charest said.
At the press conference, he called on another authority, this time conservative, and on the "Roads to the North" program, John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
When it came to the Eastmain1a-Ruper superpower supply line, Charest stressed that its launch was planned for 2012.
"I'm just saying it between us, but I'm going to be at it," he believed on the basis of which he called for a significant meeting.
The prime minister, who said in depth that in 2008 there will be no elections and no doubt even in 2009, did not make it possible for him to make elections under the annual year, which allows him to read the law.
However, he stressed that his program was busy, particularly the federal councils in China and the Québec-New York Summit.
The weekly session provided the leaders of the liberal platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular certain "schoices to change the constitution", which have been very cold: PLQ (Liberal Party of Quebec) requires in particular the recognition of "Quebek Specificities" in the Constitution.
It was also intended to designate Québec as a member of the Canadian Council for the broadcasting and television broadcasting that would have the right to vote in the case of decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, Plan Sever was to accept sceptics in his main Russians.
PQ Head (Part of Québecois) Pauline Marois re-examined North Quebec's Development Policy, which was launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to it, when the liberal government came to power in 2003, the completion of this policy was announced.
If she'd kept on, "we'd be going on today," Marois's candidate in Jean-Talon (where the elections take place today) Françoise Mercure.
ADQ said he supported the adoption of the North Plan in the government.
"We agree, however, that this is not just a feast," explained Sébastien Proulx, the leader representing Maria Dumont, who is returning from the holiday.
Letters - Destroyed countries
It was Vic Toews, Minister of Justice (on the irony) at Harper's office, who allowed last year to say about Louise Arbour that he represents Canada's Hanbu.
This is how to defeat a woman who has experienced an ongoing struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration, it tells many about the prime minister’s environment and about Stephen Harper himself.
We have before us a government that as one of all the Western countries involved, has not brought back to the possession of its national official locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
The government that doesn't even take into account that during the time of the act that was to be taken out of him, Omar Khadr was a young teenager.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing the Women's Convention, signs its word and lets go under the conditions of the child soldier.
The only one who depends on the family of justice to condemn the guilt of the accused.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty international and especially Canadian lawyers' Associations are defending Omar Khadra's repatriation so that justice can be expected in Canada.
The government also closes its eyes to torture: little depends on the fact that this young man is largely psychologically destroyed, and that has undoubtedly continued after so many years of persecution.
We don't realize it, but we're just witnesses of serious violations of our rights, of our freedom and of our "democracy", words that harper so much stirs and that sound so empty from his mouth.
The time has come when there is no more morale: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to deal badly with him, to arrest him according to the wishes of the chief of the minority government (as will be after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation on the side that announces the dignity, law and order: they do not see this government say what has created our country's reputation and importance.
Hanba, Mr. Toews, it's a mess, not another one.
Názory - Orwelovský discourses company Barrick Gold
In the 17th edition of September, Le Devor published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of Canadian subsidiary Barrick Gold.
The Orwelovian logic confirms that the world's largest gold producer has begun to attract three authors and the poor little burden on the article with a view to creating a "transparent public debate" and requires six million of them.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, there is no justice, especially in the case of a violation of law, but the law.
It's not surprising that Garver fully understands this fundamental solution.
Or is it perhaps the best way for Barrick Gold to get a public debate, to get to the table of anyone who would dare to cover up the wrong position?
Regardless of the process, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to lose appropriate amounts in order to be prepared to defend and fight in a very uneven war with the army of lawyers supported by almost empty labor companies.
The tactics in these inequitable wars are most often due to the destruction of those who have been charged with carrying out the peace of mind, which will shut the mouth against the enemy, and will also frighten anyone who dares to commit this thing.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she should have looked at the whole thing to present a public opinion.
In contrast with what is happening in a number of countries where Barrick Gold is operating, Canada has a debate about normal circumstances in exchange for thought, and never in the early dawn.
Thus, the business community did not have enough to open its books, documents, and create a real debate through news, media, publications and funding of independent scientific teams that could bring light to the whole.
However, Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion, and he rejects petitions and letters in support of the authors of the book Noir Canada.
Maybe Garver could explain how he could demand "public debate", and at the same time reject public views?
It appears that this word in the Vice-President's world refers only to the contested lawyers, not to all Canadians; it is quite a pleasure to eat this idea.
In democracy, they have the right to speak and to encourage.
Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or he doesn't want to understand - that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so primarily because it rejects the brutal ways of business.
The public is prepared to listen and to judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, never in the context of what many consider to be a suffocation, where they have to be sued by a closed mouth (in the context of their "public debate" association, Barrick immediately called the authors of Noir Canada to officially notify them that they should stop using this term...).
If we mention Garver's surreal appearance, the launch of the Barrick Gold is a direct attack on university freedom of worship and truth, which are essential for every democratic society.
It fully endorses the right to quote reliable sources and to debate facts and interpretations that represent the basis of intellectual activity itself.
If it's in a country like Canada, it's impossible to study and discuss subjects that don't like the rich companies of this world without us being exposed to repeated trends, who else will be able to do this?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could create it if she was guided by the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
He has the right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong is already able to direct debates and disputes and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's alleged complaint clearly shows that despite what he claims, he does not want to carry out a transparent debate.
For the university world, it is a loss, just as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to take measures that would limit this type of wrong-doing.
Operation on the Wall Street Rescue - Democrats and Republicans understand
Bush's administration and the transfer of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest saved economic plan since the three-year crisis.
A new version of the plan, such as by helping 700 billion US dollars to eradicate the financial crisis that has been Cloaming Wall Street for months, has yet to be approved by both Congress Chambers.
In particular, it proposes: better control of the elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms to ensure payment of saved public funds, new measures to capture the number of households to be paid for non-payments and also the right to monitor higher rates of payments to the leading companies.
US Finance Minister Henry Paulson, the shadow representative of Nancy Pelosi and representative of the Republicans at the ruling table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news several minutes after midnight, after the end of the two-week resolution marathon.
"We have made great progress and have reached an agreement that will be effective on the markets," said Bush's administrative representative, Henry Paulson.
"Everything was done to make the real economy and the ordinary Americans safe before the crisis just going on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"This is the basic point: if we don't do it, trauma, chaos and ruin the daily lives of the Americans will be huge," said Republican Judd Gregg.
During the last few hours, the merger has spread to maximum returns from fear of the effect which would have to be further downgraded by investors.
The time limit fixed was the opening of the market this morning.
Both candidates to the American President were invited later to the meeting and both expressed themselves more to the agreement, without noting their disagreement with the need to withdraw to such a national solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has signed an agreement on certain measures, in particular those aimed at enabling residents to live in the area and measures on the borders of the leading labor States saved by the company.
"When we ask taxpayers to take special measures because of the incompetence of some people, there is nothing to be congratulated on.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on television.
His Republican opponent John McCain, who was asked to vote for a proposed plan, said, "I would like to see details, but I hope that."
"The rough lines I've read show that it's about something that we're all going to have to spend and help us to move on.
Allowing disability is short-term hostile," he said.
The goal of the 700 billion plan is to buy back money for taxpayers, miscellaneous searches and risk and non-sale assets of the US financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of the crisis, which has been resolved by bublining on the property market, which first led to the collapse of risk mortgage loans (subpresses) and then to another, broader forms of credit (PCAA) and has resulted in the deterioration of the cash flow and the savings of banks and financial institutions.
The first proposal for an agreement from last week shall be communicated by the Republican delegation.
Since the democracies have agreed that for some "toxic" activities of companies with problems, the government will just hand it over but not buy it, it is convinced that the situation in the East is blessed.
In an effort to draw closer to the counter-proposals at Congress, measures have been taken to enable the government to make new payments that would help it to get back, if the programme would have to reimburse the losses over five years.
The new plan shall be calculated by adding the first amount of 250 billion, which may be added to another 100 billion if the president considers it necessary.
The additional 350 billion would be approved by Congress in a new vote.
Instead, Washington will receive shares in the saved companies that will pay dividends in the event of profit and will be able to resale once it is over.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to delay the procedures for the entertainment of property related to the loans concerned, as well as to set limits for the high assessment and compensation paid to the executives of the companies.
The rapporteurs would like to make a vote in the shadow of representatives already today and in the Senate in the middle.
Despite all the efforts made, it is not yet certain that their plan will be green.
yesterday, however, votes were raised against this project both in the Republican and in the Democratic Party.
"It is quite obvious that Washington does not listen to you," said journalist Scott Garrett, member of the Financial Commission of Snow.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yeah, there's a solution.
However, it's not the solution to make payments."
The democratic representative Brad Sherman, the moderator of the group of congressmen who are referred to as a "sceptics committee", presents the whole thing differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"There are four respected professors of the economy, including three Nobel Prizes, writing to us: we ask Congress not to rush too fast and carefully examine the way out," he said yesterday.
At the same time, Europe has again confirmed that this crisis is a global crisis.
After the closing of the extraordinary meeting, three countries announced the participation of the Fortis Banking Group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion USD).
The intervention of the Government of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would withdraw from the purchase of its competitors, which has been on the decline since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) as a result of the crisis of risk loans for the purchase of property in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, which is between the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurance companies.
"We won't come here about this money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wooter Bos yesterday.
"We get voluntary rights in the bank and influence.
And it's just thieves and houses today that can't be evaluated."
On the other side of the La Manche channel, it seems, the British government has begun the internationalisation of other banks in the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government had to take over all existing bank loans to Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion dollars (75.5 billion dollars) were created for the purchase of property.
According to his previous notice, he buys customers' shares and accounts from the British Bank of Spain's Santander bank.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank on Northern Rock, which the British government has to be born from the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of social engagement icons
His beauty with the blue eyes long represented his tomb, according to other weaknesses.
Did this American hero come up with a funny smile from Narcissism?
Yes and no.
Steadyness, sensitivity, and unsatisfied talent, which were his own, were also removed from his violent category, which produces true stars.
But what a long race it was!
Paul Newman died on Friday at 83 years of age in his joint in Connecticut due to lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of American cinematography for the last few years.
Less than Brando, who had been like and long as his rival on the film board, Newman was more careful than a priest, certainly a Greek, but also an apostle of freedom and a violation of the dramatic conventions.
The mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and a mother of Hungary.
From these European roots, one of the famous forms of the American dream was born.
No transmissible ega, which is the last sign of quality.
Because in it, this entire country was looking at itself made man, a warrior in the war in the Pacific, wounded in a battle that he had studied here in Yale in early 50s, then visited the New York actor's Studio and celebrated triumph in the theatre, in television and in the movies.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a car racer who set himself up as another 24-hour Le Mans race in 1979, as well as a sexual symbol, although since 1958 he has created an exemplary couple with the hero Joanne Woodward.
It also removes the dark places of this hidden, discrete, socially engaged stars, allergic to the custom of own show-business, which will always remain to a certain degree.
An obedient person, in the highest sense of meaning.
Paul Newman's departure this weekend enabled the lovers to return the film while his great role is being played together on a black memorial.
After it, it continues to flourish more than half a century and continues to change the American seventh art.
In the memory of the charming battle of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who rejects his meaningful wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the Cochce for a heated storm, adaptation of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
In the past (1990) we have been preparing for his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who was overwhelmed by a marriage that failed to meet all expectations.
So many other Paul Newmans came to the scene.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, torn, violent, unforgettable delicate from Somebody Up There Likes Me (In the meaning of hate) Robert Wise, the role assigned to James Dean, taken after his death, which Newman introduced in 1956.
Sympathetic Gangster in The Sting (Podraz), Oscar for the best film in 1973.
The charming and colorful football player in The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), also becomes the founder of The Color of Money Martina Scoresee, which will bring him the only Oscar with seven nominations in 1987.
This face traveling years, it was him.
And he's back.
In his professional drive, he competes with various eras.
Young people know her especially thanks to the cultural Slap Shot George Roye Hilla (1977) of Reggie Dunlop, a non-traditional hockey coach.
He was reunited with his fans in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of Coenov's brothers.
He then turned his career into the role of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition Sam Mendese in 2003.
Unlike a few of the movie legends, which were relatively soon abandoned, Newman stayed in a long-term bank, probably taking Hollywood away from his paychecks, shows, and discounts.
French filmer Bertrand Tavernier, never humoured her, considered "the living challenge of subplaying", the judgment that in his performances he pressed too much pressure on the pill.
For beautiful Paul Newman, whose role as a leader was not always so noble.
The first lovers, however, played less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, lupus and zupphales, whose fall and strains reflected in his perfect races.
As director Newman, he removed a few well-known pages of his shy feelings.
His film Rachel, in 1968 (according to the Canadian novel Margaret Laurences), in which his wife, Joanne Woodward, played a prominent role, gives a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
His son, Scott, who lost his son due to overdose, was filmed in 1984 by Harry and Son, a work of study and emotion.
In the battle that Newman had gained yesterday, his great friend and former partner Robert Redford (played together in The Sting and at Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) warmly declared: "His presence made my life and this country better."
Greatness, love for life, such are the main attributes of the dead priest.
If we mention his legendary career, there's also a great civil rights warrior, ecology, independent film, the horror of Hollywood.
We used to see his face on the bottle of a silver cup, a cup, a cup of soup, and other foods, which may have seemed quite unpleasant to us, though at first it was a joke.
However, the profits from the sale went to his Christmas gift account.
Newman did so, rather than letting himself become famous, until the last minute he engaged in the company.
He left a letter containing these words to his five daughters: "Always until the end your father was grateful to his happy planet.
I felt like I could be here."
And for us, it was a privilege to follow the life drive of such a clear and generous American artist.
And in addition, the end of the city is an exemplary citizen.
What happened in the factory at Zuschlag & Pol.?
On Monday, 8 October, the criminal proceedings against Janos Zuschlag and his colleagues began.
Policy and its partners are not only criminal acts, including litigation, accused of fraud of a long-term and systematic criminal organization, resulting in excessive damage.
According to the prosecutors, they used the money obtained in public competitions for their own purposes and often demonstrated the fact that they were effective.
Money from state and self-governance - about 65 million forints - traveled to Fiatal Baloldal's subsidiary organization, including to the captain of individuals.
The manner in which the investigation authority also informed him was that the money received in public contests was selected on the basis of an invoice for which there was no actual counter-appropriation, and the commitments accepted were never obtained.
Unfortunately, a large part of the bill was false.
Printed on these invoices came from the Yözsefvároska market, the golden cut was made in Kiskunhalasi.
On behalf of the company which has the production of invoices, the decision was made outside the district road along the northern coast of Balaton, to which István Ladose János Zuschlag sent.
According to his statement, he was first named to look at pensions and restaurants.
He asked for accounts for his own consumption, according to which the invoices were then produced under public competitions written outside the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, respectively, of the city of Samospra.
The invoices presented most of István Lados with his colleague Andrés Žorim, who, according to our information, wrote the messages needed to obtain the subsidy.
On his "Student Road" Lados looked at one of the pools.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlage and its partners in 2003, this hosting facility provided for the nine-year-old Bistos Pont group.
Many people would not be able to enter this facility at once, according to the company’s leading company.
In the same way, the formal and comprehensive errors of the invoice presented in 2002 were ignored by a survey called Jobb Jööjör, later by Együt and Harmadik Évezred.
There were only three bedrooms in the Badacsonytomatia, but more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, although it was reported to have been reported to be one hundred and thirty guests.
The authors of the press with a rich fantasy also took it when they pointed to evidence from a company that is also bound by hospitality - Pigal s.r. o., whose accounts were not included in the information provided by the State representative of documents bearing the name Jobb Yvöëret and Hoppa.
The leaders of Günzező Farkas for hvg.hu indicated that when they called him to the procurator and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew it was false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were on the wrong spot."
As he added, apart from the formalist, the fact that hundreds of people lived by the invoices, there are only eleven rooms that do not have such a great capacity.
In addition, there was also the exercise on the invoices, since their restaurants are no longer functioning for a long time.
The producers of the Horlivi invoice did not even agree that the well-known Budapest travel office only organises foreign roads, and on the invoice with cash payment, which was also not in line with the invoice practice of the companies, they indicated their travel as a service for transit through Hungary.
In addition, as a result of the investigation, they also indicated in the document DPH that the organisation of the road to the country outside the European Union should have been exempted from DPH.
In the four documents presented, Jobb Jözőret the company Hotel Révfülöp s. r. o. did not agree in addition to any other DPH. However, the company does not apply to the said 25 per cent, about 15 per cent DPH, but only printed invoices, the invoice made by the hotel was written by hand.
Nevertheless, the "supply" factor may have been distorted by the fact that in one company, it was found that the investigation of State representation was mainly due to the activity of road transport of goods that the company was not originally engaged in in investment advice.
The fact that the invoices are issued to the Együt and the Harmadik Éveveredret and to the tribes XXI. The cultural sites of the Eysulet and Bístos Pont have also proved false because of formal deviations - the inadequate format of the invoice and the wrong order.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or the Sports Camp in Kunfehértó, whose representatives announced that they would present invoices.
For example, the shareholders did not even realize that HIB s. v. o. from Nyíregyházy was in the time (2001) when a group from Fiatal Városert, in liquidation, was also accused by the company's liquidating commission, according to our information.
Facts were presented with knowledge
The second group of factors is those who knew they had to show a fixed factor.
Esély Budapest has provided four million Forints for the award of Armadik Éveveredretre at the request of the organization Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjj Socialist.
Collab s. r. o., the head of the company, according to the complaint, accepted a fixed account from one of the accused Ludovic Györfi.
Zuschlagem and its partners also worked with Biogate s.r. o, at the moment in liquidation, which in 2003 received Jobb Jözőret and the company Atlas and Vörösfeny’s invoices in the value of a total of five million Forints that were not the actual economic activity.
Even the movement of money because the invoices created were later rejected, which the organisations have already forgotten to include in their documents.
The other group of factoring companies are those who have been charged with the charges.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was a responsible representative of the Ukrainian director of Delta Trió s.r.o., who is engaged in trade with light-emitting vehicles and motor vehicles, but who is not located in Budapest.
In October, November and December 2005, the company presented several invoices for the sale of accounting technology at a value of approximately 18 million Forints.
According to data found in the investigation, these invoices were purchased by the cash Investment company, which was liquidated from 14 September 2005.
One company was a man from Romania who was supposed to submit letters to the company in 2002-2005 as well as Ivan Kubatov.
As we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that on behalf of the company he issued invoices to the tribes of Atlas, Hoppa and the surrender of Egyyukt and Harmadik Évezretret and himself accepted their counterappropriation.
At the request of Ivan Kubatov, the Romanian walls were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
Actually, neither company worked, according to the alleged lack of work.
However, he was promoted by the company because, at the request of the Associated Lawyer, Zsolta Sainte, who also prepared their supporting letters, he presented the company's invoices to the Atlass and Y-Generazione related to Zuschlaga.
In the name of the company Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave Cubatov a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million Forints.
The State representative claimed that Kubatov had come to 10 per cent of the figures and DPH.
For the exhibition of fixed invoices, this time for the selection of Bistos Pont, he also used the company Szi-Beri k.t.
In January 2006, Spolky Y-Generation and the Society and Modern Hungary submitted proposals to the public competition Nadace Mihalye Táncsicse (TMA), a public welfare organisation of socialist parties.
It reached 500 thousand forints, but the figures did not reach the objectives set out in the proposals.
To prevent this from happening, the TMA submitted five final invoices from the Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were recently found during a domestic inspection at the office of Árpád Kemexei at the Ministry of Education.
During the calculation, some of the suspects are likely to describe the process of producing invoices, as she has already done on the prosecution.
It may be more interesting if you decide to reveal all the main suspect, Janos Zuschlag.
His conclusion is not too detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised that he will do so openly, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - instead of paying a large share of the damage, a dozen million Forints, perhaps socialists have concluded a deal with him, and Zusi will take it on himself.
He could also have been affected lately because his request for reconciliation of the conditions of his detention, although he was being put in prison, remained unsolved.
While the perpetrators of economic criminal acts, who have suffered much more damage that has not yet been paid, can freely pass through or at least wait for the end of the regime against them in their homes, he does not have this opportunity.
Psychology trumpeting: Why do we lose more money?
In shopping, customers are willing to spend more money, to evaluate goods.
The neurological and economic foundations of this well-known - and apparently irrational - behavior have been able to identify researchers from the neurology and the economy of the New York University.
According to their studies published in Science magazine, people do not want to stay in the competition of the auction type eBay, so it is better to pay too much.
The research has tried to map the scheme of this "game" into the nervous system using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers sat down, the other group participated in eating auctions, using the methods of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) researched the active field of the brain of testimonials.
In both games, participants were able to win money, as well as at the auction game, whose important part is to overrun the other side, he began to work intensively throughout his brain core, called the striatum.
This brain area plays in addition to many other functions in the "self-changeing" mechanism of the nervous system.
It is therefore possible, according to researchers, to explain efforts to avoid a sudden reaction to the strata.
In support of their theory, members of the research team from a number of economies carried out financial cross-border investigations.
In his case, three groups were licensed against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was just reported what the actual value of the product concerned was and they made the cuts.
Further members were promised that if they left the game won, they would receive another $15.
The third group received $15 in advance of the auction, and in the event of losses, its members also received the money.
Thus, the difference between the two groups began all of a sudden in that one was highlighted the prize and the other the prize.
The members of the "opposite" group were also willing to go up above that was in the control and "vehicle" group, which confirms the hypothetosis of neurologists.
"These results cannot be derived from any existing economic theory.
To this day, they have explained their alertness to the auctions of victory and to avoid risk.
When neurological education methods helped us solve the conflict between these two theories, so that we have now reached a third interpretation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of economic colleges of New York University.
Hepatitis: When to look for a doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary, this chronic liver disease has been reported among the main causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated to be one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand of them are treated.
The name hepatitis is a composite designation of liver infections caused by various viruses.
In their symptoms there are a lot of similarities, characteristic of liver and pelvic infection, but the causes of disability and the disease caused by them are different from each other.
The sources of hepatitis are spread by two main methods: hepatitis A and E by traction equipment (e.g. infected foods, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other blood and body fluids (sparing secret, sludge).
Travellers should, in any case, be protected against virus A and B, against virus type C.
The signs of hepatitis A occur two to three weeks after administration of infected food, usually due to nausea, nausea, chest problems, vomiting.
Then, the skin and the eye whites create a yellowish, bright chair and dark power. The treatment may last for two to three weeks.
Each year, millions of people worldwide die of the most serious type of this disease, liver cancer and liver surgery caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that according to estimates, only every tenth of the patients received medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it may lead to liver surgery or liver cancer.
Most of those who have been accused of their disabilities are not aware of the fact that the causes of their disabilities are in short supply of liver cells, so the first symptoms will be delivered in many cases up to 20-30 years.
This is why it is very important for temporary prevention, regular debriefing.
In three groups, this disease is more common than in the average: between people who had blood transfusions before 1991, between drug users and people with tattoos.
At the present time, the estimated worldwide number of individuals infected with chronic hepatitis C 200 million is estimated.
Since the disease can be demonstrated by a routine laboratory examination, a person should, if any of the symptoms of an unknown origin are indicated, refer to his or her practical doctor.
In time of detection, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body and thus prevented from causing cancer.
30 September is the World Day of Hepatitis, which was organized by the World Health Organizations for the First World Diseases in 2004.
His goal is to warn the chronic liver infection caused by these viruses, the causes of his symptoms, and the importance of temporary detection of disability.
Who believes in God doesn't hurt so much?
According to recent research, belief in God works as a certain analgesics that could ease the death of already Catholic torturers.
Scientists from Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment, researching how belief in God is influenced by disease, reports the British newspaper Telegraph.
In a rather odd study, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were shocked by electric shocks, while all were observing the painting depicting Mr. Marie.
As a result, Catholic faiths were able to eliminate much of the pain.
The techniques of human brain research have also shown that Catholics have been able to activate this part of their brain, which is responsible for disease control.
The research is the first of the series of exercises that involve students and scientists, philosophers and theologians from various parts of the university.
A complete test was performed in such a way that the right hand of the test entity was added to the power supply of an electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants to make sure that they could observe two pieces: the 17th-century Sassoférat of Ms. Marie, and the 17th-century Lady of Leonard da Vinci, who was born in the 15th century.
The authors hoped that the view of Ms. Marie would lead to a certain kind of devotion, while that Vinci’s image was chosen because he did not get too much out of his mind and acted according to their comforting understanding.
The test subjects spent half an hour in MRI scanners and during this period they received the following four parts of 20 electroscopies, while separately watching images with a religious or common theme.
Catholics said that when they looked at Mr. Marie, they felt "safe" as if they were "guarded" and "caught, filled with peace."
When watching a picture with a religious theme, they felt 12 percent less pain than they had before.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the study, is believed to have a similar effect with any powerful influence on the image and in the atheists, only the right photograph should be found.
"We should find a picture that will be very positive, from the position of the mother or the father," said a psychologist.
English Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases also change our personality," Wright added.
After such great results, it is only the question of how the effect on the regulation of the pain of believers should be shown to any Madonna from Leonard or the painters of a similar calibre.
Would you point to the quality of Ms. Marii's achievement of even better results?
You're what you're gonna share.
Google can report on its tenth birthdays that people can find it in their pocket at least as well as in the sky above their head; he knows where they were allowed to go, what professional research is going on and what is interesting.
According to Erica Schmidt, one of the bosses of the company, it's still not enough.
With regard to sceptics, which make a parallel to the Orellian dark vision, this is not a clear basis for the 2.0 web.
Eric Schmidt recently stated to the Financial Times that the main purpose of Googlu is to collect more personal data on users, which is necessary to enable Google's depositors to keep their original purpose, which he said, "Let's arrange all information in the world!"
According to the representative of Googlu, after ten years of global work, it is the first time to be able to work with all the information.
On a question that will take five years, Schmidt replied that if Google could answer the questions of the type "what am I supposed to do tomorrow?" or "What job would I do for myself?" - on such seemingly simple questions the software will not be able to answer until they know enough information about users.
Not all Internet users know very well that the search words are exactly quoted during the Internet search and what IP addresses have been searched and on which sites have been moved to search.
Thanks to the Service Personalized Search started two years ago, users can keep their surfing history, for example, look back at what they were looking for and what they click on, and then, in a long-term perspective, they generate the findings that are adapted to much more directly to them - on the same logic will also include the Service Recommendations, through which the system will offer products and services based on previously mentioned and maintained preferences.
What if my data will be used against me, what if someone looks at me, what am I looking at? - the users who have a look at the data monopoly Googlu fear.
In most cases, the potential power represented by the company is more likely to increase, the opposition does not cause guilt on the Internet users, fear of abuse, free-of-charge touch or even opposition to power.
This is confirmed by the fact that all the expressions sought are not only quoted, but that in the case of reasons, a third party may also be issued, in such legal cases the privacy rights of Internet users are not protected.
The most famous example of recent years was probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided information to the Brazilian government that allowed the identification of pedophiles from the Orkut community sites organized by its media.
Internet users who are afraid of privacy rights, however, could still breathe in May when an EFF arm firm successfully proved its truth in the fight against the FBI: Google must not be in any future article of the constitution required to provide any information secretly required by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully defeated nearly tens of thousands of web addresses and thousands of searches, which were received with a call to strengthen children's protection law before the year of adoption, although it failed to obtain a list of individual users' search posts, their full list of websites and keywords for two months.)
The view of Google is so dissolute: it is welcomed by those who are afraid to provide their personal data, because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be by starting to use Googlu services, which are set up by the prisoner, and they come up against it with a revolution that belongs to an international company with a conservative image.
And while the American geek of culture and its divorcious relationship, consisting around itself of computer fiction, activists and users, appearing in many countries, it sees a new generation of great, "corporate, now fresco", in contrast with its Microsoft River, considered by Windows for the world's recipients as they fight for the same purpose.
This can be caused by Google does not require from its users an identification code and does not want money for its application; open, free and permanent clean source of information and software packages make it much more accessible, younger, "more" than the practice of official software work.
It can also be caused by the fact that the geek understand very clearly the very problem relationship between the Internet and personality rights that has brought them into contact with just one of the most exclusive keywords in recent years: web 2.0.
The web 2.0, however, is nothing more than cooperation, the fact that we deliberately leave ourselves behind and use the communication channels that we have available, and although their range is in each other, the principle remains the same: we show.
An average young person can upload a profile immediately on several community sites from Facebook via Xangu, which can easily communicate with other services, such as Twitter or Last.fm applications, which will record listening to music, all of which can be connected to navigation systems such as FriendsFed or Blip.fm, besides which you can write a blog that will automatically display its latest photo gallery, which will appear on Flickr or Picase.
At the same time, we can learn about a lot of examples from which it is obvious: a friend in the morning when looking at the flood photos of fellow friends will easily come to whom her bad friend had spent the night, or the company can only betray his employer because on his blog he has made his honest comments about top leadership: one is sure, the concept of a private life has been completely overrated today.
The one who lives online is determined by what he shows himself, so we can define basic these hiding behind today's youth behavior.
And whoever wants to hide something or at least avoid the googlos monopole has the option (the Scrooglem, which is using the Google search system, does not deliberately leave the footsteps).
A small number of people, for example, are not registered on the community pages so it is not possible to find them. Online Google applications from the text editor via the photo editor and the news portal are possible to exchange for alternative versions that are not linked to the wide range of server parks and which do not set up the most perfect profile for us.
You don't approach public opinion in secret, waiting for Google to show your teeth.
The subsidy has its current value of $156 billion higher than IBM ($140 billion), Intel (124 billion) or Coca Cola ($110 billion), in-sert areas AdWords/AdSense threaten the investment of advertising agencies and services carried out at an ever-increasing pace seriously interfere with life not only with Microsoft but also with other software designers.
In addition, however, critical observers also find contrasts with the disturbing idea: the high management completely rejected employees' protests after the double-rate wage for the company school, voluntaryly frequent day-care for employees was too expensive under the company’s leadership, all of which was also lost in the fact that Google was still hiding before the Chinese government in 2006 and in the meaning of their agreements, each finding, which is subject to a good test, is a matter for the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the internal rules of the company is that it never presupposes new services, even when it can already be used, but it is certain that the expected problems of the following months and years can be avoided by the world in new places: while some believe that the Googlu project focused on scanning and archiving books and magazines has such dimensions that the company will soon have something to do with the U.S. Supreme Court, another fear of its system, in which we can set up a complete own health profile with pre-school reading, medical, and medical.
The fact that Google is a genetic database, then it can serve as a good source material and for the next generation of sci-fi writers, the famous news of Cory Doctor's "Scroogled" describes the future of the Orwell Reminiscences, in which you can approach a person in awe only with data from Googlu.
A double murder from Ozdu helped to remove the feet of two young people
Two young people listened to the police in the case of double murder in Ózda, which, according to reasonable suspicion, helped to remove the extent of this criminal act, said in the second speech of the District Police Department of Borsod.
Persons suspected of having been found to be guilty of criminal acts have been found to be guilty of them at the present time.
Both young people, according to the MTI information, two girls are forced to be free.
The aid to criminal proceedings shall be punished by the withdrawal of liberty for up to 5 years.
A 23-year-old married man who seemed to be a double murder in Ozdu was taken to a temporary relationship on Sunday.
It is suspected of a criminal offence in advance of planned multiple homicides for serious reasons.
During the study, it was found that a 23-year-old man owed 53-year-old a larger share of men.
The suspect did not want to pay his debt, so he threw his fellow believer in the middle of a runaway in Ozdu, where he killed his first husband and then his nine - year - old daughter.
According to information from the MTI, a young man was preparing to escape a criminal offence, which he testified was also evidence that the murder was a weapon hidden in the scene of a crime.
The weapons and the circumstances of its use are under investigation by the police.
Warsaw bursa made an offer for the purchase of the porcelain
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - offered Warsaw's wallets of precious paper for the purchase of a 100% stock package of Prague stock exchanges.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchanges, confirmed the offer made by the Polish side even though the Czech Carp from the area of possible new owners of the Prague Exchange has already been excluded.
The reason is the fact that the owner of the Warsaw storm is a state.
99 per cent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which has over 60 per cent of the securities sold for several months.
According to the Czech economic newspaper E15, the Polish offer represents the highest amount that was offered by the Prussian bourgeois.
According to Czech leaves, the offer was offered by a visual exchange of securities, a transatlantic stock exchange of Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, a London exchange and Deutsche Börse.
The head of the Prussian Stock Exchange Peter Koblic stated last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all stakeholders and did not expect it to lead to the loss of Prussian Stock Exchanges in the future.
The value of pearl exchanges of precious paper is estimated by experts on the share markets to be 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholders' agreement, approximately 90 per cent of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague stock exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with about 25 per cent share, followed by Czech competitor with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a. a. l. by 13.5 per cent.
On the financial crisis in view of the European Charter
In its yesterday comments, the international financial crisis is already referred to as "second September 11th".
We can thank the President of the United States for the global financial disaster, the famous Russian President La Repubblica. The President was not even able to raise his own side to support the immediate payment of the bill, whose aim is to correct this desperate situation...
Instead of Pearl Harbor, who reminded the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk more about September 11th.
Also part of the Madrid print is seen by a criminal in Washington.
In El Mundo's view, the world economy has led to a reduction in the lack of political leadership.
The threat of the collapse of the U.S. financial system continues to grow, for which the whole world will eventually be paid.
Bush's plan has not been successful, however, after voting at Congress it is dangerous that Washington does not offer a political solution to the crisis.
The world economy is rising in the air - just when it undergos one of the biggest changes in capitalism events.
The threat can't be forgotten anymore, shows the female journalist Tages-Anzeiger.
The United States can now proceed to the monetary institutions of saved bread and tax collectors can save them from the scourge.
However, if the cost of the domain is mixed with other banks, then there will be no money or other improvisation.
In a long-term perspective, Member States of the European Union need to transfer their national egoism and combine control over the various financial markets.
Only on Monday did the existing monetary institutions get more than 100 billion euros, the Der Standard, according to which they are concerned that, like the Americans, they will have to dig deeper into the pockets and the European taxpayers, in the interest of solving the crisis.
The European Union is facing a crisis that, like the tsunamis, is facing an old continent that has not been seriously left behind.
"Suppliers" must not immediately have the euro stimuliards, but it would be good if they firmly decided, in which case it would be reasonable to take the money of taxpayers to prevent further damage.
Intelligent car imitates the summer of winter
What would be the best way of developing technologies capable of preventing conflicts without imitating detectors' obstacles that are being overcome in the world of nature?
For example, in the classroom.
The strategic idea of the amazing project, presented at the Japan CEATEC factory, has attracted engineers from Nissan's company. It was about how to set up a new generation of anti-fraud systems.
In cooperation with such a university, Nissan built a biomimetic robotic system of type BR23C, a robotized mini-car equipped with a purpose, with the ultimate objective of helping to create a system that can eliminate all conflicts.
"During the year each train will create its own personal space for the wave structure, which is actually very similar to our safety shield," explained Kazuhiro Doi, the Director-General for Technology and Research and Development, at the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi.
They play an important role in the complex eye that enables them to see in all directions in a narrow range of more than 300 degrees.
In order to verify the function of the complex eye, engineers were able to detect laser distance.
It identifies obstacles in the distance up to 2 metres before the BR23C in the 180-degree line, calculates their distance and sends a drop-in microprocessor signal which is immediately transformed into an operation leading to the control of the impact.
The stop is caught during the second half of the second half, after a robotized car starts to imitate the movements of the wheels and the rounds in the extent to which it is necessary to prevent the wheel from changing the direction immediately.
In contrast to any existing system, this flexible manoeuvre is simply instinctively.
"If it hadn't, a robotic car would not have been able to react quite quickly to prevent it," explains Toshiyuki Ando, leading mobility laboratories and a robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology reflects the most vulnerable and most internal type of safety shield within which the conflict is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what she's doing to avoid other enthusiasts.
This process must not last longer than the eye's closed.
However, in contrast to the angle, this movement cannot be directed up, down or down, only double-dimensional and only in a direction that can be circled around the car.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered by the interns, only the possibility of reverse movement, acceleration and slowdown was used in the case of a robotic car.
BR23C uses lithium polymer accumulators that are light and have a higher energy density, which means they have a longer life than lithium-ionate variants.
According to Andoa, there is an important instinctive, intelligent reaction, no processing capacity, so less data storage.
This mechanism needs to be processed and responded only to a few incoming signals after a second.
It is not necessary to store and react with intuitative logic based on data from previous manoeuvres, so only a few kilobytes remain in use.
You do not need to remember the giga- or megabyte capacity.
It is the first step towards developing technology for immediate avoidance, which, according to Nissan's report, could be achieved in serious vehicles within 10 years.
Another option of application may be to connect the unit to the GPS satellite navigation system, which, after avoidance, will lead the engine to the intended final target.
Damn dear child's name already.
The law on the packaging of savings for the economy of $700 billion, which should be distributed to several payments and whose objective is to recover non-qualified loans from the bank, is already in writing.
In the first wheel, half of the shares will be used.
After further meetings, which ended on Saturday after midnight in the United States of America, representatives of the Congress arrived at the agreement within a few days of the ongoing debate on a rescue package totalling $700 billion, the Reuters agency sent.
"We have made significant progress," announced Nancy Pelosi, the democratic president of the shadow representatives, according to which only the signing of the agreement is in progress.
The compromise on the package also supported both the presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said of the outcome of the compromise: "The programme will work and will be effective, but further steps must be taken."
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday at 8 o'clock of the Washington Time period (then on Monday at 2 o'clock in the Middle European Time), but no special entry on the boroughs was made.
On the proposal for a legal framework, on behalf of the necessary economic stability law of 2008, which is to be set up by the programme, will be put to the vote on Monday for the first time and will be held at the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosie on Saturday evening, after the announcement of the agreement was also made in the White House.
"With the progress achieved at night, we are satisfied and very much appreciate the efforts of both sides to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," said the White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
Finally, the programme is different from Bush's original proposal to the administrative authority, which should cover the purchase of non-quality securities secured by mortgages totalling $700 billion.
It is now possible to lose at least half the amount of 700 billion in the first round, so that 250 billion will be used immediately after the matter is expected to take place in the afternoon of the Congress, and the Ministry of Finance will buy them valuable papers for mortgages that are valued as non-qualified, and the remaining $100 billion will then depend on the President's decision.
The programme will be controlled by a special assembly, which will also be chaired by the President of the Federal Reserve Bank.
The second half of $700 billion will depend on the next Congress decision.
The Ministry of Finance may apply a combined tactic in the meaning of the law: it may at the same time buy out non-quality loans, mortgages and securities secured by mortgages, and other "sustainable" credits.
The withdrawal may take place within the auction and directly, by the competent representatives of the ministry.
The legal norm enables the undertaking concerned to participate in the insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance will provide guarantees on the basis of the underlying concern and will then pay the price corresponding to the expected injury.
According to Henry Paulson, the law provides the necessary means to meet the urgent requirements of the U.S. financial system by up to $700 billion, whether it is already involved in the extensive purchase of the wrong funds, their insurance, or the prohibition of the system's risk associated with the deterioration of some of the large financial institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be prepared to adopt the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
The chief banks who get into trouble and wait for state aid, however, can count on the government to reduce their distance - which is simply called a "goldfall".
In certain cases, their costs will only be limited, and these will depend on how the ministry is assisted.
In principle, the limitation means that if the ministry buys under the auction, a tax fine will be imposed on gold deposits if the bank's manager is not sent directly to the pension.
In the case of direct repurchase of non-qualified loans, the government is aggressively in order to ensure that the management money is not transferred.
It is necessary to add that the existing contracts on gold deposits will not change, the restrictions apply only to new contracts, which should be another incentive to participate in the programme.
"It is the first case in American history when there will be legal restrictions on the remuneration of general directors," commented the chairman of the Committee for the Financial Services of the Soviet Union, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State in participating banks will have the right to acquire a share that reduces the risk of taxpayers, as as the economy and the saved bank will stand on the foot, they can make this transaction.
The proposal includes that in the next five years, the President must submit a proposal to the Congress which provides for the way in which taxpayers can recover expected losses from the financial sector.
Of course, there were also voices expressing in connection with the crash plan on both sides.
"The American citizens didn't ask us for this, that's a dollar of tax taxpayers," said a Republican congressman from California Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague from Ohio Mary Capturo's court found that the provisions were directed to those who are responsible for the destruction of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to grow
The domestic sales prices in the industry increased by 0.1 per cent in August 2008 compared to August 2007 by 12.9 per cent, the Central Statistical Authority announced.
Export sales prices in the industry were above 1.1 per cent in July 2008 and increased by 3.9 per cent per year.
Production prices in the industry were as a result of changes in Turkish and export prices compared to the previous month higher than 0.7 per cent, an average of 3.2 per cent.
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by only a minimum of 0.1 per cent in the previous month.
The domestic sales prices in the processing industry also increased slightly by 0.1 per cent compared to the Germans.
The largest price increase occurred in August 2008 in the mining and clothing industry (2.8 per cent), particularly due to the monthly increase in prices in the steel and steel products sector by 4.6 per cent, respectively by 2.5 per cent.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials led to a significant monthly increase in prices in the chemical and product production sector (1.6 per cent).
The price reduction was achieved in the oil processing sector (1.4 per cent), the production of electrical machinery and equipment (0.9 per cent), as well as - to a minimum - in the woodworking sector (0.1 per cent).
The prices in the production of paper and publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In the other sectors of the manufacturing industry, we were planning to increase prices by 0.2 to 0.9 per cent.
In the production and development sector of electricity, gas and water, which has a high weight industry in the developing world, increased by 0.3 per cent, above all by a further increase in the price of electricity from 1 July.
In the 12-month comparison of domestic waste in the individual processing industry, prices increased most in the professional oil processing sector (32.4 per cent).
In the beef and veal sector, it was possible to observe 13,2 per cent, in the production of food products, beverages and tobacco products with a soluble weight and then 11 per cent increase in prices.
Price reductions were made in textile and textile products (2.5 per cent) and electrical machinery and equipment production (0.3 per cent).
In the other sectors of the processor industry, the rate of price growth rose between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
Total prices in the processing industry increased by 10.2 per cent during the last year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water production and development sector exceeded prices of 18.7 per cent from the previous year.
In the light of the sector's projection, the highest monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) in the production of weighted assets was demonstrated in August in the Turkish sales.
In the sectors producing consumer goods prices increased by 0.3 per cent, in the energy processing and further processing sectors, prices did not change due to the previous month.
The largest increase in prices due to the same month of the previous year was possible in August 2008 in the energy sectors processing and further processing (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods sectors, we planned to increase prices by 6.8 per cent, but in the mass assets, prices fell by 1.4 per cent.
The export sales prices of industrial products measured in raw materials increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, by 3.9% in the 12-month comparison.
Our domestic payment over a month has been reduced by 1.7 per cent, by 7.1 per cent, compared to August 2007 by 7.5 per cent and by 15.9 per cent.
Next year to the United States without a visa?
According to Kingy Güntz, it is a great hope that, on January 12th, the U.S.-Madarian Peace Agreement will enter into force, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spoke about it in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her opinion, "now almost everything is concerned with whether an electronic road permit system will be built in the sea by time."
She also warned that the part of the new system would not be allowed to enter, while tourists would have to be allowed to register before departure.
The representative of the Hungarian diplomat from today is continuing in meetings in Washington.
He meets with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Condoleezzo Rice, who passes through the Central Cross with the Star of the Order on behalf of the Hungarian Republic and conducts talks with a foreign candidate for the foreign policy of the Democratic Party of Barack Obama and the Republican John McCaina.
Barack Obama and McCain are for a package in a saved bank
Barack Obama and John McCain, presidential candidates of both large American parties, agreed on Sunday's support of the government package for the bank's savings of $700 billion, are also politicians who require the Minister of Finance's resignation.
After several days of meeting the Congress and the representatives of the administrative authorities were notified on Sunday morning: a basic package agreement was concluded on the bank's savings.
A financial package aimed at combating the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market became the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Like Obama, McCain is accordingly identified as the most suitable candidate for the country to emerge from the economic crisis.
According to the most accurate studies, at the same time as the economic issues were addressed, Obama was granted a certain benefit again and McCain's defeat, which was guaranteed under the Republican Convention on the appointment of the Vice-Presidents of Sarah Palin.
Obama expressed his hope on Sunday at the pre-trial meeting in Detroit that the law on packaging would meet at a rate of 700 billion quickly at Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contains a passport relating to consumer protection, which also supports.
"We have to go right now, responsible (...) to your places, I support, the entire industrial sector, the stability of the entire economy is at risk," said the 35 thousand-year-old tax.
I didn't give you the chance to call McCaino's economic representations old-fashioned.
McCain, in the interview with the ABC TV station, said: "All of this will be a little bit... but breakfast is just not possible."
As indicated by the President of the Republic, the proposal represents the Commission's arrangements for the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the derogation for the High Representative to which he was subject.
Both of the CBS stations reported that McCain did not have a more important role in the meetings, but he was himself in contact with the minister every day.
The speech president, Nancy Pelosie, announced on Sunday that his representatives would vote on the proposal of the law almost Monday.
Review of the printing of the German language area
The legal team is undeterred, only its voters have become more aware of it - thus analyzes the poor result of CSU in Bavorsku Der Spiegel.
The Haiderovs are ready to rule Rakousk to prevent red-black coals.
Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online release of the left German press magazine, Franz Walter will pick up in his article entitled "Bavorska revolution fires his father" the causes of the dramatic CSU abuse.
According to a well-known politician, CSU errors began long before his office took over the sad duo Beckstein-Huber.
For decades, Christendom’s socialist nations have been restoring Bavaria - and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The mid-term is also the problem of the whole Christian democracy, as well as of the Angel Merkel.
Debakl was not completely surprised for CSU, but on Saturday he completed a process that could have been predicted for almost ten years: hegemony of one state party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, CSU reached 47.7 per cent, the first of 50 years under 50 per cent limit.
This was repeated three years ago in elections to Bundestag in 2005, and still in the so-called Stoiber period.
The reason is the modernisation that the CSU has consistently carried out in this country and that burns its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but in time they have been very wrong. The secularization, the results of education, the settlement of the Germans from the east and the north in the developing regions of Bavorska still could not have been without the consequences of the faithfulness of the CSU voters.
Modernization is linked to growth of opportunities, which also has its visible political consequences.
The legal team is unbroken, only the voters within it have become more conscious, critical, more liberal.
It is also evident that in recent weeks CSU has been the most advanced in classical civil society; people in freedom of call, livelihoods, maturitus and high-school education.
That's why CSU's support has been reduced by 40 percent.

In its article entitled "Who, who, with whom? The President's party are in questions of coals sustainable", the Conservative Videoist claims that the intropolitical situation has been caused by the Raquesian elections.
You've got to talk to ÖVP before.
ÜVP requires the insertion of SPÖ into its internal affairs.
BECAUSE it is open to all meetings, greens still don't want to agree on coal.
The elections are behind us, now all around the coalition; in the debate organized in public television, the President's side has left much to be seen in their cards.
Mr Werner Faymann confirmed that he had previously spoken with ÖVP.
And SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two sides is certainly possible - in some partner countries and in social partnership.
The question is whether you can introduce coalition with Wilhelm Multer, the current president of ÖVP, as vice-president, left Faymann open.
As it turned out, Schüssel-Molterer's course was voted on every floor.
This Directive is not to be taken into account.
Multer responded to the red bids carefully.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to intervene in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses opposition or enters the coalition, he is still clearly open on the side, these issues should be discussed firmly within the ÖVP.
The President of BZÖ Jörg Haider again took the lead in all directions.
"To prevent red-black coyals, we're ready to ignore government responsibility," Haider said.
Journey: The preserved root of poverty and segregation must be broken
In Paris today, the European Summit of Equality, which this year host France, is currently the President of the European Union.
Livija Járók, a delegation of the European People's Party to the Fidess, as one of the main speakers of the professional year in his message, drew attention to segregation in school, as this is one of the most important illegal children in Rome, and also the most important obstacle to their use.
The Conference was held on behalf of the French Presidency - Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The annual meeting took place between the invited representatives of the government, European social partners, the most important European organisations for the protection of rights and civil society in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the Press Office of the Group of the European Socialists, Fides Járókvá has warned that, despite discrimination resulting from the collection of labour forces, Roma are driven from the European labour market, in particular by their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have secondary education and because of the poor quality of basic education, they can achieve a higher degree of education only an unskilled part of them."
It further stressed that education as a basic human right plays a key role in the application of other human rights.
Investment in early education for Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the delegation, it is necessary to establish the knowledge of these relations in the broadest circles - between Roma and non-Roman children.
As soon as that Roma student starts school, he will have a greater chance of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through income tax and consumption taxes, he will contribute to the national budget.
"The rights of their national citizens of the European Union need to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the elimination of them without prejudice to quality and separate education," added Lívia Járók.
According to the delegation, there is a need for the European Union's consistency with the objective and coordination to bring about an immediate acceleration of the decentralisation of schools, which is the first step towards ensuring proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations.
"It is necessary to break the preserved root of poverty, segregation and unemployment, to provide Roma children with the opportunity given to a democratic space so that they can participate as a full-time citizen in the future of Europe," demanded Járókova.
The aim of the European Equity Summit, organized each year from the late meeting in Berlin, is to ensure a independent forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and the elimination of discrimination at the European level and in the individual Member States.
CSU: Temporary Mercy
The judgment of the du Duchess Huber-Beckstein shall be decided at the end of October
Despite the rest of the electoral debate, the debate on personal questions was still rejected by the bavor CSU.
President Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Günther Beckstein can still stay in their seats, the question is, as long as this mercy becomes evident.
The judgment of the Tandem, which suffered a catastrophic 17 per cent loss of votes, will be decided on the last October weekend of the extraordinary convention of the party.
In any case, members of a highly criticised tribe were allowed to hear that they would not be thrown out of their ranks.
They were thus trying to calm down the frustrated members of the group and the base ones who, because of the loss of the absolute majority, requested the day after the "bavorous tsunamis" of the export of personal effects.
Five years ago - true, under the direction of Edmund Stoiber at the top of the career - she gained the Christian-Social Union 60.7 percent, now, a year after the strike against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent.
CSU has been producing 18 per cent of the German GDP "control" in Bavaria for 46 years.
There are still conservatives in the southern part of the country, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, high positions, but in the future they will be encouraged to coal.
One of the first signs of internal reorganisation is the fact that a member of a dedicated intelligence team, which starts a probe on the case-by-case coalition of the minority government with the liberal FDP, will also be the Vice-President and the Federal Minister of Agriculture of Horst Seehofer, who is considered to be the potential representative of Huber.
It is ironic that, at the invitation of the Free Volunteers, Gabriel Paul, whose appearance against Stoiber, used the Duo Huber-Beckstein to carry out the strike, but then, with ambitious municipal politics, did a cruelly short process.
The leading CSU representatives are now focusing all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transitional period, the active role of Stoiber, who has so far been behind, the former prime minister of the country, and some former president of the CSU, was called on on 28 September as his most enduring day of political career.
On Monday, Huber removed several travel notes to the CDU address, according to which they would have earned much more support from the sister side.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the breach as a warning for the CDU and Angel Merkel.
Following the elections to Bundestag in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become a Chancellor if CSU, which played a significant role in the overall success of 2005, does not put the common forces at risk.
According to Merkel, who has been seriously hiding his fall because of the injury, there will be no loss of CSU’s negative impact on the Berlin Great Coalition.
What is of course relative: healing the wounded CSU will not be easier and the crisis of social democracies will continue.
The SPD has reached Bavaria with 18.6 per cent of the worst result since 1946.
Lukašenko:oposity - 110:0
In Sunday's elections, there was no opposition to the Belarusian Parliament.
This can be explained by Russian observers for the prosperity and stability of the country under the leadership of Alexander Lukašenk, as well as by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE) of the illegality of voting.
The Committee, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the vote.
Although the 110-member legislative assembly of 10 million countries has been opposing opposition for well ten years, the opposition united on behalf of the United Democratic Force (ODS) before yesterday's elections sincerely hoped that Lukašenko, who had left behind the amendments to the constitutions in the elections with a discussionable transition in 2006, and to resume its presidential mandate, this time "allowed" to appear in Parliament several opposition Members.
The ODS has left the same way since the previously considered fight.
In the background of the opposition, it was expected that Russia's economy would continue to be increasingly dependent on Belarus - which, in the face of the slowdown of the threat of Russian imports of land floods, continued to believe that Beltransgaz, the country's own pipeline, had reached Russia's hands - had sought to improve relations with the European Union, where because of the Belarusian political arrangement assessed as anti-democratic Lukasenko and other high-level policies would not be allowed to enter.
It was previously shown that, when assessing the preliminary campaign, the OBSE was based on positive assumptions, and not on shortcomings, such as the ban on candidates for third opposition candidates.
The OBSE's Sunday flash report has already been awarded to the campaign, while opposition candidates in general could not appear in the press, in particular that the opposition cannot be counted in the vote.
At the same time, according to the opposition, only improvements can be felt in the political system: political prisoners have been released on their own, and Minsk is willing to leave with Moscow and in smaller confrontations, if he continues to refuse to recognize from Georgia the removed South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Russia, with which Belarus has become a member state of the party, considers these two countries to be independent for months.
"We have taken two steps ahead and one back, but most importantly, he has started a dialogue between Belarus and the EU," said our letter, Alexandr Millinkevic.
According to the candidate for opposition from the presidential elections in 2006, it is desirable that this remain, even though "the power is being thrown into the single opposition parliament."
In view of the results of the opposition, he does not plan protest action, and he tries more to deliver to the voters his report on the need for economic reforms.
"With this, of course, we have a lot of problems, opposition lists have to be printed in Russia, distribution the list of obstacles to the local authorities, yet I can see that the change continues to support more people, and among the elders," Millinkevic said, pointing out that the Lukashenko regime, which, for its greatest success, considers the creation of social security, does not guarantee the right or officially the most supported type of pension.
"Because of the debt of the country and the growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time when social security 'sustaining silence' is threatened," the Milinkevich judge.
In contrast to opposition policy, Russian observers viewed the elections as democratic.
The leader of the Community's independent state mission Sergej Lebedev, Russian news agency Ria Novosti, said that "people don't believe words, but acts", so the absence of opposition is nothing but evidence of the growth of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From this morning to work"
It's the first in the history of the Chigi Palace, which was built by the back door at the arrival and departure of employees.
However, from now on, this new measure will start to work against anointed people, against what they're smoking and then go to coffee at work.
News against Lennox has been reported today by Minister of Public Administration, Renat Brunettou, and the Secretary-General of the Presidential Council Maurem Massi.
"The door - says Brunetta - are a tool for better work, greater efficiency, more presentations and more services," the minister said.
"There is no opening of a new period of responsibility and transparency.
It's about reformism," also highlights Brunetta.
The Chigi Palace will complete the implementation of all the building Presidency of the Council.
For Masi, "the selection of the Father's doors is also important from a symbolic perspective".
There was no intention of employees, the Secretary-General assures us: "It was a joint process with all employees and cooperation".
No more breakfast at work; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "There's nothing better than good cappuccino in seven o'clock in the morning."
During a conference at the High School of Public Administration
In Rome, the Minister will finally report that in three months the public unemployment rate for patients has decreased by 50%, which means about 60 thousand more people per year."
And it adds that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more effective.
" its cost dynamics – explained by the Minister – have doubled over the past 8-10 years in view of the private sector and is far higher than the inflation rate".
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees were gathered to reject Brunett's decree in accordance with the request of Codacons.
"While today's public administration minister is presenting figures on lower unemployment unemployment unemployment unemployment – it says consumer protection associations – the nation's 'full lenchos' will continue to grow.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and right-wing employees in public administration who have gathered to report the war on illegal norms contained in the decree."
Taru will be protested in particular against the exclusion of payments on disability dependent on activities; the extension of the period during which the disease can be checked, the time limit for the inspection visits to be carried out, and the other rules included in the new ministerial provisions.
Labour rates, Napolitano: "Desolute prevention"
Every day in Italy there will be 2,500 jobs, three people will die and twenty-seven will remain disabled.
Inail values confirm that by 2007 we have a total of 1,200 deaths as a result of labour impacts.
These values testify to the seriousness of the evidence that remains one of the main causes of death and cause almost double death compared with the killings.
In order to regain the attention of institutions, social and information resources on this dramatic problem, Anmil is celebrating today in all the 58th Italian regions of the national day of the victims of the labour force imposed on the second week of October.
"A disturbing data spread by Anmil and the tragic reports of these days confirm how important the issue of work safety is," confirmed President Giorgio Napolitano in a report sent to President Anmil, National Association for Frozen and Inadequacies for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State shall express its alive vision to an ongoing joint effort on safety at work, on the protection of wounded workers, on the assistance of families of victims and on the participation of public opinion."
"The inspired 'sufficient' has been raised, and the face has been accurately shared with tragedy, which causes media and public participation, but every day's reality offers us again dramatic events, even repeating in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a resource problem here: it is crucial to invest in education and information.
In particular, there are numerous initiatives in the field of education to help young people who face the world of work gain a clearer understanding.
It is necessary to pay attention to this concern, not to give rise to its disturbing social burden, to apply and improve legislative standards.
President Gianfranco Fini stressed from his side that "as a result of the death of the labour force, it creates an absolutely critical social position, as it offends the conscience of each of us, and encourages all institutions to make sure that the necessary end of this state."
"As regards the data on labour effects, it appears that they show a certain positive attitude, however, it does not imply that the number of deaths due to labour levels is so alarming," said President Angelo Pietro Mercandelli.
"We wouldn't want this "reducing force" to get less attention, because right at the moment when the attention will be raised, the tragedy will disappear.
"We believe that it is generally too little to stop the impact problem and there are many activities that can affect this problem.
It is necessary, according to our opinion, to increase the control and inspection of Mercandelli, but also to increase the strength of the training of the staff, which is now from school age".
"There is still a need for another effort - he added – with regard to communication and participation in public opinion.
But there is a major need for greater responsibility for employee responsibility for the phenomenon, which represents an extraordinary social challenge."
Mercandelli finally announced that it is a progressive degeneration of the level of rights to compensation for the alleged victims and "resistance of supporting care" to which the system has been granted in recent years."
"The aim is therefore to return the employee's insurance guarantee - he added - because the punishment of those who are injured should not depend on the sponsorship or treatment of time from the time of the lawmaker."
Mp3 players accused, presenting a risk hearing
Listening longer to the loud music and using portable music devices as an Mp3 player can cause permanent damage to the ear.
According to today's published report, the European Commission, which in one official report published in Brussels, quotes the Committee on Health Risks as being recently identified (Csseri) Eu.
"From this scientific point of view, we read in the notes, it appears that 5-10% of those who listen to music for at least five years through portable music devices, week after week more than one hour a day and keep the device at high volume, risk lasting loss of hearing ability".
"I am concerned that so many young people who often use portable music devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can harm scientists in an unskilled way," admits Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific findings – continues to lead – there is a clear risk and there is a need to react quickly.
The most important thing is that we need to encourage consumers and publish this information.
We must continue to check the existing control systems in the light of this scientific discovery so that they become fully effective and that they can take steps with new technology."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine this problem in view of the high use of portable music devices and the growing number of young people exposed to this source.
"Students – closed by the Executive Officer Eu – confirm that it is necessary to take care and now the European Commission will examine together with the other members and parties who have faced the problem, what measures could be taken, and thus better to protect children and young people from exposure to noise caused by transmission devices and similar devices."
At present, there is a European safety standard that limits the level of lengths of portable music devices to 100 dB, but there is growing concern about noise damage which may be caused by excessive exposure to similar types of noise.
It is possible to limit these damage by seeking solutions such as lowering levels and duration of exposure.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee of Eu states that users of portable music devices, if they use a voice volume (more than 89 decibels) for a period of only five hours a week, exceed the current pay limits corresponding to the maximum allowed staff at work.
Those who listen to music under such conditions over a extended period of time risk the loss of hearing for five years.
This problem should concern 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be estimated between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Germany leaves the Commission free for the future of the capital
We'll start today, we'll close in March, we'll have sums in June.
This is the calendar given by Campidogli by the staff of the "Committee for the Future of the capital of Rome", which met this morning at his new seat next to the Caracas.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other members of the Commission will draw up plans for Rome.
When the door is closed in March, Gionta and the present Council of Assessment of Analysis and Projects will be able to present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official Exploration" of Campidoglia and his working Gianni Alemanna in June.
"The Commission is completely independent and all political, social and cultural ideas are included there – to highlight Germany – It will have to ensure proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually use the political decisions that remain of the Gianta e Council.
It's not about any change of function, but it's about the effort to have a place where to work a big project for Rome.
The work will be completed in March and will then expire, because this institution must have a precise time period.
In June – the elderly – we present a strategic plan and use the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital city of Rome.”
He who accuses the Commission of the fact that its opinions are not binding, Germany replied: "All is concerned with the work that the Commission will be able to carry out and the quality of their proposals.
If they are quality, such as the Commission's proposals, and I am sure that in Rome, its results will be decisive.
Often, policies will be made available to the problems of everyday life and to the tensions that will arise from time to time.
We, however, want to look further and further, in deeper perspective, to work hard at the development of Rome and its future.
Furthermore, the elderly of Rome would like to point out that "the Commission is neither an ordinary business nor a bluff: it is completely free, the Roman citizens will not be able to stand up to the euro and serve to think and engage the best intelligence the city has."
For Germany, in principle, "there must be a strategic plan as a starting point, not a definitive or immeasurable, to allow our city to take an authentic approach to the level it needs, and to think a united spirit on its future."
The future, which confirms the elderly of Rome's "will not only be limited to the current existing borders, but will seek a lot further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status, but also in the role that Rome can and must play as the main city of Europe and the Mediterranean".
The first anti-American president.
One well-known American president wrote that it is important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, decided the US economy and maintained relations (even today as a private citizen) with an enemy of Islam."
Wars against Obama will rise immediately as the election date approaches.
A woman from Miami wrote on the Web: "This man is full of ambition.
Both of them have the courage: they think they will get to the highest position of the nation, which had two governors and five black senators."
In fact, these attacks don't say much"; they're attacks of a single racial origin and they don't answer the voters' question: will they be a good president? And then we have research; they all say Obama wins and with a great gain.
In this case, there are those who follow the heart rather than the brain.
A newspaper from Mississippi, South America, wrote a comment: at least once in the polling office we know well who gives his voice to the American patriot.
There's one page on the surface of the American mentality that's been exposed until the last minute.
Tell me what you want, we'll finally take care of it ourselves, who's gonna shut up if Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear that if Obama should win, we'd leave America.
These are things that have never been expressed before, it seems almost certain success of a black candidate.
However, all these ideas for democracy are George Bush's main weapon.
The 1,500 people were asked: what mistake did Bush make during his mandate? Eighty-nine percent answered: Iraq.
America's changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost tens of thousands of soldiers and sent him home with copper to the back.
In Iraq the lives of 4500 soldiers were saved, and the Americans were not forced to fight.
Still, Iraq became the majority of Bush's weakness.
Whoever comes to the place of Georgie W will have to perform a huge task.
The U.S. economic collapse has also been felt by journalists: in the news there is a period of investigation, and many blame the Internet, "killer" prints.
PEW Research Center asked five hundred journalists about their professions and their prospects for the future.
Well, today, almost all the pessimists are talking about their future.
However, they did not openly say that they were less concerned about reliability.
It doesn't feel isolated like it used to be.
The problem is for American money journalists, the money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is the crisis of the destroyed economic model.
In addition, the drawings carried out in the newsroom, in the rooms where editors work to bring together the news are a huge problem.
According to the journalists asked, there is a problem that needs to be resolved if we do not want traditional journalism to change as it understands its broad audience.
The American journalist is making clear, but complex pessimism.
Six of the 10 press journalists and executive seniors are convinced that journalists are making the wrong way at national level.
In the local area, the executive group is 65%.
It was printed against the Broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
More publishers cross the way to the Internet, on which many look like a "killer" of prints.
"Economic pressure" to which journalists warn has increased to 79%.
Five hundred journalists interviewed admitted that they were turning to technology in hopes that their journalists would "be doing something good".
The biggest break in American journalism is between those who run the newsrooms – that is, the leaders – and the reporters who work for them.
56% of national leaders are sure that their reporters share their values while at local level, the value is 23%.
This has something to do with "right work" for someone.
Leaders who think they will lose their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
With regard to journalists, they're moving to 30%.
In the case of "certain work" related to staff (our editors, etc.) in America, it's still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on the contract.
In a large nation like Usa, three hundred million people and thousands of people with newspapers, magazines, radios, TV and the Internet often offer what they want, and so it is a question to take or leave.
Drivers get almost always large payments and the editor can also make $10,000 a month apart from payment of the pension and insurance.
As regards permitted persons, the argument is complex: a number of days after the first year, a number of days after the third year until the fifteen days after a certain number of years.
However, U.S. journalists, according to their own experience, are often ill within a year.
It's just a climate question.
UNIPOL: SOUD IN Rome, DANILO COUPOL IN GROTTAFERRAT
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Roman Court, Carmelo Rinaud, decided to refuse to grant an entrepreneur with the realities of Daniel Coppoly, who requested that he be able to move from his city, Grottaferrat, to live in Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in relation to the anti-subsidy at the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial at its own expense, he received a leave of absence from the domestic prison, which was converted into a forced stay in Grottaferrat.
His lawyer, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, requested that a real-time entrepreneur be able to change the place of residence from a foreign town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this move (to which pm was expressed) would allow him to influence his company and to obtain evidence that he was accused of.
elites in danger
This anger has occurred a few days ago when the Commora voted against the rescue plan for the $700 billion proposed by the White House: a large part of Americans were more interested in and interested in the construction of Wall Street than in saving the economy.
They also confirm this yesterday's New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis is spreading to the Republican side, which remains more and more divided between its old soul East Coast, more peaceful, opposed to the federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, which is rather conservative, hostile to the 'those from Washington' and against the world of finance, particularly in the middle and south states.
A soul that was proud of the vote I was talking about at the beginning.
However, this is just an example of changes, big changes that the current economic earthquake has already shown: not only in the United States but also in the whole West and perhaps not only here.
As in Usa, in Europe, it seems that this crisis is acting as an acceleration of the Jews who have been in the incubation for a long time, which are being used in the new climate and finally coming to light.
The first of these is the re-update, the extraordinary recovery of the market, the second category of State power in relation to certain economic re-nationalisation.
The crisis is the result of the crisis of banking institutions which, of course, have strong foreign debt, but in particular they include the largest number of people and families living in the single country, in the single state.
What has created a political problem for those who control it: it means how to respond to the problems and protests of people and families who are outside the ranks of others.
In the short run, the crisis is economic, but politics is almost totally national.
Political international seems to be essentially outside the game or has nothing to do with it: a clear evidence has been given by the European Union, which is always divided between different interests and different national strategies and which cannot be decided for a common political line.
And so everyone waits for the governments of each individual state, rescue plans, market recovery, new rules and mainly fund allocations: at the moment we get to the bottom, only states have economic resources, the amount of financial resources to try to put everything in order.
As well as the own resources and the right to use them: two sources of non-reasonable value, under certain circumstances, which almost no market and no international organisation will ever be able to make available in a similar manner.
This new era, which is subject to the crisis at national and national level, is finally becoming increasingly important in a simpler manner, which is attempting to adapt to one of the factors associated with it: territorial relevance.
In fact, paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the kingdom of the network, even more sophisticated technology, material, while we were convinced that global finances were already overrun to rule the world, we knew nothing about our future, however, that our future would have to be increasingly affected by such small non-material things as water, oil, oil.
All things that would have been said could have been transferred from one place to the other, but in any case, they are connected, absolutely, to the restricted area, the territory.
So whoever becomes their leader must have a lot more money in his hand than anyone who doesn't have it and who has the courage to live in a place without electricity, oil, and water.
I'm getting to the second newspaper, which, however, predicts evil.
Who speaks of territory, state, government, irrevocably policy, and leadership.
Given the economic crisis, it appears that there are two convergent waves.
On the one hand, it becomes clear that there is an objective need for authoritative guidance, a request for someone to be able to understand the situation.
On the other hand, there is a lack of confidence in existing guidance, especially in the economy, which has proved to be equally inadequate and full of dark places.
And together there is something even deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: mistrust, intolerance, feelings of incompatibility and intolerance, which are trying to control the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
It seems to be that there is still an ever-increasing expansion in the broad masses of citizens of conviction rather than that their actions are the same as the ideas of popular elites, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the right sense, that elite has already exceeded its time and is hostile to the views of most people.
The requirement for leadership is short-lived from the realm of one science, but a strong push for the removal of ruling classes and traditional political organization is demonstrated in recent "warnings" or in unexpected changes to collective power in the last and most recent period, from conservative entry to the fall of the British labs to protesting American congresses against Bush (and may also have to do with the legal victory in Italy).
We have the idea that traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, there are still more problems to understand, so to represent, which, not today, is created in deep types of Western societies and that the economic crisis is reinvigorating, growing, potentially changing climate.
Before this, it would be changed to talk about permanent "mass resistance".
But we certainly can't say that it means having a proper eye open.
Super beauty for walking on walls
To convert the laws of gravity thanks to the super leaf and in the future walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is an object of various American research centres and has now been very close to the four institutions.
Scientists were able to maintain a stochilogram body attached to a vertical wall using only 2.5 centimetres.
STUDIUM – The American journal Science published the findings of some University researchers at Dayton, Akron, the Georgian Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material found by the research team is the development of existing materials that are already using the special structure of the coal, which is called the coal pipelines.
"The basis of beauty we can imagine as a series of tubes set up as an organized spaghetti homagog," explains zhong Lin Wang of the Georgian Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the legs of gekon, covered with microscopes, which enable animals to ensure perfect addition.
Tests carried out on various materials such as glass, Teflon and glass paper have shown that the new leaf is ten times stronger than the bones of these plasmas and at the same time "simply disappears from the wall" explains Liming Dai, researcher of the University of Dayton Engineering.
CHODIT PO ZDECH? - "This material could be useful as a provisional pencil" adds Liming Dai.
Even after touching the air like Spiderman? Almost yes, but researchers think of far less fascinating use than connecting electrical devices, because the heat and electricity pipelines are heat and electricity drivers.
Other applications could be related to air space engineering .
I don't have any great brains.
A further study is also carried out by the University of Berkley, California.
In an article in the magazine American Chemical Society, Californian scientists presented a beautifully shaped micro-wave hair as hair that is clean from dust by moving around the surface to maintain perfect accessibility.
Medicines: Never With Jussy
Look at the grep, measles and apple juice.
If you take these drinks that are consumed primarily in summer, because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, together with some life-saving medicines, they will experience changes in strength or reduced effects with serious health consequences.
So that David Bailey, professor of Western Ontario University in London, highlights the risk of juicy both ready and fresh in combination with some medications, at the 263th National Meeting of American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, creates a new fear: one drop in fat, measles and apple juice to reduce the consumption of certain life-saving medicines, to eliminate their positive effects and to expose the health of patients.
The grep juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing to a toxic level the effects of certain antiarrhythmic medicines, antibiotics, anxiolics, antihistamines and neurological drugs.
RISIKS – The Italian Medical Agency has reported the same in an information bulletin two years ago and has challenged doctors and patients to avoid the dangers arising from this mixture and to pay attention to what they are taking, such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NEJEN GRAPEFRUIT – Experts also suggest that the apple and apple juice contain substances that are absorbed by medications.
Long list of effects of grapefruit and other juices.
From this point of view, Michele Carruby, head of the Department of Pharmacology of the State University in Milan: "These findings are reported by most immediately by the most diverse international and national medical agencies, which may provide and exchange information instructions for medicines.
So read all the illustrations of the medicines you get and if you find something unclear, don’t hesitate, but ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain it’,” said an expert for Ansa.
Nobel for the economy of Paul Krugman
Nobel Prize has been awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his study of commercial models and location of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novokenjönan who teaches at the University of Priceton and is a well-known editor of New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important criticisms regarding the foreign, economic and political steps of Bush administrations.
A few months after the attacks in September 2001, when Enron was arrested, Krugman announced in a comment published in New York Times that the second event would be, in the light of the consequences of the history of the United States, much more important than the first one.
The proposal, which caused a minor complaint and which was read after years, however, proved to be accurate.
“I’m surprised and shocked, with the speed of collapses such as Enron and Worldcom, Krugman announced at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenza Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "condom of great importance", but also a popularizer who has a very aggressive style, particularly critical of Bush's excessive liberalist administration".
Open Office, we have the third edition of the package "anti-Mis" here
It is an Open Office.org 3.0 edition, a package open source of personal products that leads to the destruction of more users, from house to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
After the annual work of volunteer workers controlled by the SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office shows wide audiences with different news: to welcome the screen and to a revised and improved open window are added further, far more essential, as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
The adults are ready to work with the 2007 Office package, Open Office is able to open the document and with new Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
The special features of some models such as which allows you to reduce the size of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for the transmission of an electronic route, or the possibility of transferring the PDF content to the graphical execution model and saving the original view of the page.
We can still create PDF hybrids from this view, which look like typical Adobe graphics and have the properties of a table processor or text program.
The cooperation is the first to get many improvements within the application programmes: it is extremely possible to work together among different users and avoid conflicts in changes, each of the staff members is assigned one color to commentaries in order to be more clearly identified in the audit phase.
Some companies also work on the transfer of some Open Office functions to the Web (on the cloud) and should stop the final results in the following weeks.
The Italian version can be downloaded to http://it.openoffice.org/download/0.0/Download300.html, which is available on the back of the package.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation cd may also be sent at the request home or at the workplace.
And if the issue of free of charge can be an obstacle to expansion in the homes, the Open Office business area is very quiet and can already be counted with the most diverse projects carried out in public administration and schools.
And there is no lack of training, consultation and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video recording that replaces Word; Calc is a table processor that guides to Excel; Impress for presentation similar Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, finally, is a graphical model.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5th million downloads, and when we consider that we are almost 3 million and 600 thousand today, with the publication of a new version, it is possible that this expected number can also be exceeded.
Also the results of Kohl are positive, it's the fourth case of doping
A new positive case on the last Tour de France: it's about the Bernhard Kohl Rakusing, from the Gerolsteiner team, a third-class and winner of the best-ranking triangle.
The report was quoted on the L'Equipe's website.
26th-year-old Kohl is a third-generation positive runner on Ceru, Epo third generation, after Italians Richard Rico and Leonard Peepoli and Germans Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner.
The results of the blood samples of Kohl belong to those performed in the last weeks by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the control analysis confirms the positive on Ceru, Rakushan will lose the third place on Tour and will have to face the two-year disqualification.
The report on Kohl’s positive attitude to the third generation is confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordry, who announced the Associated Press that he had already reported the outcome of the Russian government.
The 26th-year-old Rakushan was placed on the rank winnings for Spain's Carlos Sastrem and the American Cadel Evansem, also won a score of the best peak.
Immigrants: New York Team is in trouble, is Italian Russia?
Italy "as the country of immigrants has only changed to the last home for the priority objectives of migrants" accepted with support.
So it's part of a long article in New York Times that made this article on racism in Italy and started with the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan because he stole a treasure box.
This case highlights what New York Times define as "paradox in the north": the northern areas are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" are registered, but also "lower anti-psychotic thinking in the country and the strongest support for the North League".
To confirm increasing tension between Italy and the passengers, NYT cites cases of intolerance from Milan, Parmy, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
It's not that.
The new legislation required by Lego, which seeks to speed up immigration and facilitate access to illegal migrants, is also cited as an example of climate change in Italy.
The trend is highlighted by the pope, both the President of the Republic, "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting Benedette XVI in Quirinale, asked the state and the church to work together on the violation of racism."
Students with expensive rentals - up to 900 euros per room
The university students' rental market doesn't know the crisis.
According to the recent study of the Sudan, rental committees, the student can rent a single room in Milan up to 900 euros, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
"It has already reached such proportions that all classes of students have lost the right to study because of the very high prices that their families would have to bear – explains the leading office for the study of Sunia, Laura Mariani – in this city a large demand by the students has created the market in such a way that it has made the process of rising prices that has increased to residents."
In most cases rental offers include a number of transactions: contracts free of charge, unregistered, without limited rent, associated with leases.
For Sunji, there is a need for an exceptional provision that could regulate prices by means of the revision of the tax.
If we look at the research details, we will see that in Milan, in the area of Brianza, there is a need for a single bed of about 450 euros, for a single room is paid from the minimum price of 650 (Bande Nere zone) via the average value of 800 (Lambiate zone, Udine and Fiera) to the maximum 900 (Vittoria zone).
In Florence there is one bed in average EUR 350/400, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas near the university, there is a need for EUR 250/280 for beds in double room, from 370 to 500 in single beds.
In Rome, in the central university districts (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), they want a total of 600 euros per single room, 450 beds in double.
The values are slightly lower (550 euros per square inch) in areas near the other universities (Ostiens and Cinecity).
We will save only if we move to peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 per single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and so on.
In Naples, there is a need for 300/450 euros, for room from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the areas of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Ameni.
In Bari they want a bed of 250/350 euros, at least 350 per single room.
In smaller cities, prices are much lower, but they have a higher impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities such as Perugia, where the most frequently rented for students from outside the European Union, another anomalies are finally recorded: an increase of 25-30% of the salary they want for foreign students compared with Italians.
Welcome to the old cinema Paradise, cities ruining historical power
The cinematographic historical forces are involved in the prosperity of Multiplex.
"The city without kine is like blind, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by Director Giuseppe Tornator successfully records what is happening in large Italian city centers, but also in foreign cities.
The process of restricting the kine, the growth of large multilaterals on the property and the subsequent legacy of monosals in the central areas of the city is one of the events that seem inevitable and irreversibly, but also has all the signs of true cultural crime.
Often the historic places are surrounded by memories, "it's like we've come about a friend, a friend we've shared with, and a lot of emotions," feels the director of New China's Paradise, a film that he won 20 years ago by Tornator Oscar and a great price of jury in Cannes, who reported the poetry of one neighbor's cinema and the sadness for the way of life that the movie has always lost.
The values obtained by Anne, the main company of operators, are clear: in the last five years, there have been 316 Chinese doors of traditional type closed, and the highest accounts have paid the most important power in cities: 10 minutes in Florence, 9 minutes in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 minutes in Turin, 5 minutes in Palermo.
Among the regions most of the closures reached, Emilia-Romagna has lost 82 cinema halls followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And I prove that the first responsible for their mix is the multiplex approach, just the three Italian regions that recorded the highest number of new cinemas: 195 more payments in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 both in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagnó.
"Italian procedure has developed unreasonably," says Paolo Protti, President Anec, "is useful to create new structures, but it should be ensured that those already existing live because when one movie in the city closes, not all its visitors are willing to move to a multiplex.
We are not even talking about insufficient funding for the benefit of operators: the previous state debt is EUR 10 million.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
In support of the sector, EUR 16 to EUR 18 million should be needed annually.’
It is interesting to note that the first Italian city, which is concerned with the closures and which has decided to find the original signature of the protocol between the municipalities and the Anek, is the first type in Italy for the protection and promotion of small children, both in historical centres and in the province.
Among the planned standards are the steps of tax incentives in favour of operators and the benefits of the public with regard to mobility: the wild will be able to climb to a restricted area and will have special prices for stopping and some parking.
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, and I hope that the other cities will follow the example of the Bologne by introducing other measures."
However, it is certain that in order to be able to stand against the great force of multiplex, traditional forces must improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audience is more generous.
The defense of traditional cinema is the theme that has always been important: the closure of Super Kiana in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and growing up, was a joke that convinced me to put on the "New Paradise" that I've been thinking about for 10 years.
I've lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I've spent before the Rialt or Quirinal closed up in the National Street, where I shared so much emotion that I don't look at the text of the broken law, I'm going around on the other side."
Union between the political and mafia group 'draghet, old Gioie Tauro in prison
"The old man from Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the election of the city office according to the interests of the Mafia group Piromelli."
The charges brought by the leadership against the Mafia in Calabria against the elderly and the vice-prisonist Gioie Tauro Giorgioi Dal Torrione e Rosarios Schiavone, and the elderly Rosarna Carl Martellim, imprisoned this morning for external cooperation with the Mafian organization, are difficult.
In the railways too, Gioacchino Piromalli, an old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson, the chief's name, already accused of committing crimes of a mafia character, which is worth EUR 10 million.
"They have ignored all legal and moral standards, as well as sound thinking," writes state officials, when two local administrations expressed their willingness to pay a consultation of counsel to Piromallim.
"This would enable the Mafia Group – written judges – to officially enter the city authorities and thus facilitate control and management of public administrations."
President of the Calabrian Regional Commission Agazio Loiero does not hide that "secret agreements between local institutions and organised crime are very much in his country: "There are areas in which the focus of the Mafia is stronger than in others where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have a lot of local policies that give up the pressures of 'draghets, hounds that are still unrecorded'."
The arrests from today's morning follow after the arrest from July of last year, which the police have shown that the Mafia group of Piromalli has received final appeal .
Since the end of the last year - the city council of Gioii Tauro has been released since 1991, the reason for the alleged link between organised crime and local administration - has been that local policies have been fully operational in the current administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, president of Christian Democrats, who was elected at the time of the release to be the head of the true Middle East after the civil war in May.
He called for a scandal when Prefectura ordered the release of the present Council.
He called for the responsibility of the former Deputy Minister of Interior Marc Minniti and accused him of putting all of this behind him for political reasons, but the judges in the Rules of Procedure signed this morning explain that the Mafian Group had reached so far as to request a change in project A3.
Among the other statements made against Dal Torrion, he writes to the public prosecutors, he went on to say "to move the orders of the business, representatives of some larger groups very close, as is generally known, Piromallim and to adapt the elections to the public administration of the interests of the Mafian group."
When the energy comes from the wave, it's getting into this big game.
It is an endless legend that covers more than 70% of the earth's surface and is now being revealed by large global energy companies.
The waves, floods, floods, floods are new sources of unabated energy on which the air of the waves like Chevron is now trying to lift his hands on these sources.
The possibility of creating energy from the sea's motions has been studied for over a hundred years and in the 1970s in relation to the first major crisis, research has intensified.
When the oil prices decreased around 1980, the idea of the use of marine energy was foreign, but now the organic organisation and the new increase in oil prices gave the sector a new impetus.
In 2007 the World Energy Council (WEC) announced in London that about 15 per cent of the world’s electricity consumption could be covered by the use of the wave movement of the sea.
this amount would be a double energy generated at the present time in nuclear centres.
And there's also floods and floods and floods.
It's going to attack.
In 2005, Enersis agreed to set up a facility in northern Portugal.
When this purpose was announced, it looked like a huge revolution.
After two years of marine energy, there are still more companies than traditional marine energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology – a language company, which is linked to the red circle of the United States, in the economic journal Wall Street Journal – and is thinking about the possibility of working with us."
The cooperation we are considering concerns obtaining permission from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary for the discharge of the project for the use of marine energy in Alaska.
This signal cannot be underestimated, especially when we consider that just in the United States, it is still heavy, and recently President Bush came with a new floor plan.
In addition to Chevron, they monitor the rate of sea energy and Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey and recently invested sums, although not known in detail, show growing interest.
Technology, the core needs to be developed.
The experts are talking about technology, which is still in the first place, because they don't know what impact the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
In the meantime, the facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small and do not seem to be causing major problems to the ecosystem.
However, for more energy production, it is necessary to use technology with greater impact on the environment.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses the color system that is connected to each other.
The wave force that moves with the battles above and below is modified by the help of the warriors and cylinders on hydraulic pressure inside these battles.
The pressure breaks the turbine that gives energy to the generator.
Energy gets on the shores of the submarine cables.
Currently, there are four projects in the phase of this type of equipment, which are only expected for federal approval and the amount of energy could serve for military purposes.
On the other hand, Verdant Power is now producing energy for the shopping center and parking lot using six pdmourish turbines in the New East River.
The movement of water during the passage and discharge causes the movement of turbine, which is the result of this reverse movement of the generator.
Verdant stated that they have a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorisation for the possibility of using this energy.
On the walls, on the floor, and on the floor.
Special interest at this time deserves the potential for fuel and waste, said the Institute for Energy Research.
Although one of the independent factors, the tides and tides are more predictable than the wind, the sun, or the wave, and therefore more reliable than the source of energy.
In terms of energy flow and waste, such as New York, Maine and Aljaška, and other coastal states have already invested 7 and half a million dollars in 2008 and forecast investments up to $35 million in 2009.
