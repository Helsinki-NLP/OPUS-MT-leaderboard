Many of the rhythms in physiology and movements are mainly related to the existence of internal revolutions and the production of them by means of biological clocks.
Only periodic rhythms, bacteria, mandrakes, plants and animals, which do not belong to external periodicals have been identified in most living things.
The biological clocks are oscillators who have continued the period of free return, despite the lack of signals coming from outside.

It is the investigation of the traffic flows, the movement of biological drivers and the interaction between the two points and the interaction between the vehicles.
Unfortunately, it's hard to work on traffic winds because driver behavior can't be predicted by hundreds of facts.
Anyway, drivers show me how to behave in an orderly manner on a makul scale; thus, they show me how to have a smoothness that can be accepted by traffic flows and can be achieved mathematically.
To better describe traffic winds, the relationships between three main features are defined: (1) wind, (2) humidity, and (3) speed.
These relationships will help to plan, design, and operate the royal foundations.
