The cumulative incidence of coronary disease (COVID-19) increasing rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK, January 1st to March 15, 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronary disease (COVID-19) shows a train similar to that in the European Union/European Economic Union and UK that confirms that, although it is different depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing very rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, the country, the hospital, and the intensive care unit, it should increase its readiness to extend to patients with COVID-19 who will need health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, the pneumonia class with ethics was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
On 9 January 2020, the Tingkok Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported this disease's potential agent as a new coronavirus, now called the acute infection syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection have been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence has so far shown that approximately 80% of COVID-19 patients suffer from respiratory disease, such as respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, with most of this disease being healed.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops to become a more serious disease and needs hospital care, while 6% of other cases suffer from critical diseases that require intensive care.
Mortality of patients treated at the hospital is approximately 4% of COVID-19.
In this study, we examined the COVID-19 U.S. economy (EU/EEA) and England Raya (UK) and compared it to the U.S. province of Hubei, Tiongkok.
We also compare the number of COVID-19 cases now in the EU/EEA and UK with the number of cases in Italy for 31 January-15 March 2020.
Case COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK
After Tiongkok, COVID-19 has experienced a far deeper and dynamic field of COVID-19 in other parts of the world now following Pandemi dignitaries in Tiongkok.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In the Eurosurveillance 2020 issue of 5 March, Spiteri et al. reported the first Europeans with the COVID-19 cases confirmed on the basis of the definition of WHO cases.
In the EU/EEA, three cases were first confirmed reported by France on 24 January 2020 to those who returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
On 15 March 2020, the COVID-19 cases have been identified throughout 30 EU/EEA and Ingres Raya (UK), between 31 December 2019 and 15 March 2020 including 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy.
Get cumulative numbers and cumulative incidences of COVID-19 cases
At the European Center for Prevention and Control of Diseases (ECDC), the number of cases identified by COVID-19 in each country worldwide is announced every day at 8.00. This percentage is only available from official sources such as the National Health Authority, the national and regional health authority, and WHO.
This data is used to examine COVID-19 trains in EU/EEA and UK, and compare it to trains in Italy.
As an active COVID-19 prevalence proxy, we count the cumulative incidence of 14-day deaths, thus taking into account the normal journeys of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and UK, during the period 1 January-15 March 2020.
We also have the cumulative number of cases reported in each country until March 15, 2020 at 8.00 compared with the Italian case for the period 31 Januaryâ€“ 15March 2020.
COVID-19 train in EU/EEA and UK
Cumulative insident train killed 14 days of the COVID-19 case in the EU/EEA and the UK generally followed train in the Hubei Province (Tiongkok) (Gambar 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the COVID-19 cumulative incidence began to rise about 21 February and then increased approximately 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This train is primarily driven by rapid increase in the number of cases reported by Italy, but all other EU/EEA and UK countries show similar cumulative insident growth train COVID-19 (Additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK compared to the cumulative number in Italy for the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
The data suggest that, until 15 March at 8 a.m., 15 other EU/EA countries and the UK reported a total number of cases comparable to the total number of Italy cases three weeks earlier or less.
Our results show that the number of COVID-19 cases reported increases rapidly in EU/EEA and the UK.
A train that has been hit by the COVID-19 cumulative incident indicates that the pandemic is rising at a similar rate in all countries.
This is due to the different levels of national experience, the variation of public health responses, and the possibility of different definitions of cases between countries and the different protocols to choose patients to be tested for the COVID-19 confirmation, which includes the examination of the case.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the Italian region who met to explain the situation of about 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media resources to report that hospitals and units of intensive care in this region have reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, COVID-19 cases are received at hospitals and/or intensive treatment units at EU/EAA level only 6% and 1% are available for each case (data not shown).
However, data must be collected in a systematic manner to complete surveillance data now focused on the number of cases reported and the number of deaths reported.
A study conducted in 2010-2011 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive sleep and medical care in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less energy than Italy (12,5 places of intensive care and media care per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The modeling scenario is related to the complexity of health care capacity, with the estimate of the prevalence of COVID-19 cases as appropriate for each EU/EEA and UK risk-related risk-related countries > 90% above the capacity of intensive care facilities, prepared in the six rapid ECDC risk assessment on COVID-19.
Because this is far the most classified case in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of certain regional service providers, information on the cases and places of intensive care is best prepared at the United Nations Environment Programme level for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Experiences from Italy and trains in other countries show that COVID-19 pandemics are growing very rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, the country, the hospital, and the intensive care unit should prepare themselves for the SARS-CoV-2 community transmission scenario and increase the number of COVID-19 patients who need health care, especially intensive care, as is happening in the region in Italy.
As demonstrated in the recent rapid risk assessment of ECDC, rapid, proactive, and comprehensible delays in SARS-CoV-2's preaching, with the exception of a shelter to a migrating location, because an increase in the number of cases, such as diagnosis, may not provide sufficient time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept, and adapt the correct response if this is not previously implemented.
The rapid risk assessment also stimulates public health steps to examine the impact of pandemics.
There is a short opportunity window when the country has the chance to improve its control in slowing down the SARS-CoV-2 and reducing stress on health care.
If the EU/EEA health system fails, other EU/EEA systems may be facing a long-term patient who needs intensive care in a few days or weeks to come.
The 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the Coronavirus 2 acute infection syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), has recently killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in Tingkok and other parts of the world, causing human damage.
Mirip with its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS to thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from the lungs and cause similar damage through similar mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 has a lower rate of poverty and mortality compared to SARS, but more and more about sex than young people, and more about men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on new diseases, this article seeks to provide timely and comprehensive information on rapidly growing research subjects.
We'll discuss the basic epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
Although there are still many unanswered questions, we hope that this report will help us to understand and deal with this serious illness.
The Semi Museum Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unforgettable memory for all Tionhoa people who are ordered to stay at home for a few weeks after the outbreak of a new virus.
This virus is highly homologous with the coronavirus (CoV) that causes the acute infection syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it is called SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the disease it causes is called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, Tingkok, and soon spread throughout the country and in almost 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, this virus has affected 80,000 COVID-19 confirmed cases, with more than 40,000 patients being infected and 3,000 patients died worldwide.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "a lot of numbers" and the potential is more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.cbi.nlm.jyk.gov/pubmed/), within less than two months of the first report on 7 January 2020 setting virus sequences isolated from some patients, more than 200 have been published on COVID-19, which includes virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This report is trying to record the progress of research in the new areas of growth.
Maybe we'll try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other diseases caused by CV, the Middle East Syndrome (MERS, published in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about the dangers and the prognosis of disease and other questions that have not yet been answered.
Based on tradition, CV is considered non-metal pathogens for humans, especially causing about 15% of the 4th pillar.
However, in this century, we have found a highly pathogenic CV for humans twice, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each of which has caused the first publication in Tingkok in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality.
That's why COVID-19 is now the third version of COV in written human history.
As noted in Gbr. 1.1, the primary pneumonia cluster was reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the National Committee of the Red Cross.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was broken.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case of Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spreads rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20th, the health care provider's infection was reported, which indicated that human transmissions could happen.
On January 23, a circuit assembly was held in the city of Wuhan and the entire congregation was closed.
On January 24th, the first clinical study on this disease reported that only 21 patients with confirmed cases were directly opposed to the Wuhan marine food market, which was considered to be the beginning of infection from unknown animal sources.
On January 30, WHO announced the release of this brochure as a global health measure.
By the time this report was published, the disease had spread to nearly 50 other countries throughout the world.
Because the situation is growing very rapidly, the end of the conflict and the spread of corruption still needs to be fixed.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-stage study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 COVID-19 patients, was confirmed, presented the following updated epidemial images (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bbbdA).
SARS-COV-2 infected people at all ages, but especially at 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those who are infected over 50 years of age, only a few who are under 20 years of age, and only 14 people who are under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 has increased male infection (0.31/100) compared to women (0.27/100).
COVID-19 is scattered into the classrooms, especially inside and around Hubei.
COVID-19 consumes time-rates 5 (2-9) days from avidon to diagnosis.
The rate-incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) a day.
The time rates ranged from the plane to the death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproduction (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and R0 is 2.23-4.82.
Hundreds of people infected have increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, according to the time of mass transportation before the Semim Museum Festival in Tiongkok.
Mortality of patients with major confirmed cases is 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and mortality is recommended for all major patients 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three main risk factors for COVID-19 are types of pelvic (pria), age (â‰¥60 years), and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a subfamily of large virus gathering that contains the single RNA sense.
CoV can be divided into four genes, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-coV known for human infection.
Glycoprotein tonne or Spike (S) combines with cell receptors, angiotensin 2 (ACE 2) enzymes and peptidil peptide 4 (DPP4) each for SARS-CoV and METS-CoV, and then the membrane fuse occurs.
The RNA virus is released into sitoplasma; after replication through the virus, RNA genometifies the total glycoprotein and the nucleocapsid protein forms virion-like vesicles, which then experience fusion with a plasma membrane to release the virus.
The economic sequence SARS-CoV-2 was first reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new beta-CoV type with genetic equality over 99.98% of 10 samples followed; the sample was taken from the original site, namely the Wuhan Sea Food Market.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV compared to MERS-CoV.
Through the microscopic transmission, the SARS-CoV-2 particle was found in the epithelium part of a very typical human breathing system.
ACE2 humans found are receptors for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, S SARS-CoV-2 protein in combination with ACE2 is weaker than in relation to S SARS-CoV protein, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes non-serious infections of SARS-CoV infection in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein that is bound by orf3b and protein that is added with the eardrums of the orf8.
Protein orf3b SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in the pathogenicity of the virus and inhibition of IFNv expressions; however, orf8 does not have a known functional or motives domain.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported the Cryo-EM ACE2 complete human structure in resolution 2.9 Ã… in a complex with an amino asymno B0AT1 transporter.
They found that a complex, which has open and closed transformation, together forming a diameter and ACE2-B0AT1 complex can build two S proteins, which are evidence of contamination and CV infection.
B0AT1 can be performed in a therapeutic solution in a prescription for stressing SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Mother is living and between
SARS-COV and MERS-COV are known from the environment and each is transmitted to humans through the muscles and lungs.
By comparison of SARS-CoV-2 to another CoV, the beetle is considered to be the original species of SARS-CoV-2 because this new virus is 96% identical to two coV-like-SARS of the beetle called the bat-SL-CoVZX45 and the bat-SL-CoVZ21.
However, the gap between the transmission and the transmission of the virus has not yet been established, and the transmission route has to be explained.
Ji, et al. advised the snake as a carry-on virus to humans that involve homolog recombination in protein S.
According to a study, a researcher in Guangzhou, Tiongkok, suggested that interfering, breast-feeding, often used in traditional Tionghoa medicine, was potentially among SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homology in the coV found in the ring and SARS-CoV-2.
However, 1% of the difference that is spread across the globe remains a major difference; therefore, the resulting results as concrete evidence have not yet been achieved (G. 3).
Most of the physical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet known.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can last for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 Â°C and a 40%-50% threshold.
SARS-CoV-2 may have a similar quality.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and heat radiation at 56 Â°C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, chlorine-containing infection, peracetate acid, chlorform, and other fats, but not chlorohexidine, effectively activates the virus.
In general, the entire human population has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and because it's rare to this new virus.
Currently, no detailed study has been reported on immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to other coV studies previously, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gr. 4.4).
In general, after invasive ingestion, the virus is identified by the immune system by means of an pelvic receptor (PRR), which includes C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
Through different routes, the virus induces the expression of the inflamatory factor, the measurement of dendritic cell, and the synthesis of type I interferon (IFN) that limits the spread of the virus and speeds up the fagostois antigen virus by macrophag.
However, protein N on SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid immune response.
Soon afterward, an appropriate immune response joined in the fight against this virus.
Limfosit T, which includes CD4+ cells and CD8+, plays an important role in this battle.
T CD4+ cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and T CD8+ cells kill cells infected directly by virus.
Cell T assists in producing proinflammators to help protect the cells.
However, CoV can inhibit cell T function by inducing apoptosis cell T.
Sexual immunity, which includes complications, such as C3a and C5a, as well as antibiotics, is also important in the fight against virus infection.
For example, an antibiotic that is isolated from a patient who has recovered control of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, a growing immune system reacts to a large number of radicals locally free, which can cause damage to rain and other organs, and, on the worst scenario, failure of the immune system and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is prescribed by the avitant cluster, is much more related to lung disease and pregnant women.
In general, those who are infected with a large number of viruses or who are infected with the immune system have a higher chance of infection than others.
The estimate of the SARS-CoV-2 rate incubation period is 1-14 days, most 3-7 days based on the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study on 1,099 cases showed that the rate-incubation period was 3 days and affected from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) per day based on demographic 8.866 cases.
It is vital that health authorities adjust the time of the effective quarantine based on the most accurate period of incubation to prevent the infected, but without delay, transmit the virus to others.
As a general rule, people who are infected with the virus or who are infected with it are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Do you have to wait 24 days for her quarantine?
Swelling is often the COVID-19 main and initial cycle, with or without other symptoms such as stiff stones, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, swelling, headache, erythema, chest pain, diarrhoea, diarrhoea, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experience dyspnea and/or hypoglycaemia one week after the outbreak of disease.
In severe cases, the progression of disease is rapidly becoming acute arthropod syndrome, sepsis, metabolic asidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients suffering from dementia and/or acute constipation and dementia should be treated with the virus for local diagnosis, even if there is no difference in perspiration.
Demographic studies at the end of December 2019 show that a high percentage of pregnancy is 98% for breastfeeding, 76% for breast cancer, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diet; 8% of patients need ventilator support.
The same meeting has been reported in these two recent studies, namely studies on family and class classes that have caused the transmission of asymmetrics.
In addition, studies of demographics in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also experienced dementia (98%), kidney stone (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as the main cause.
However, 80% of patients need ventilation support, far more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with MERS patents higher than COVID-19.
Diare (26%) and tuberculosis (21%) have also been observed in patients with MERS.
In SARS patients, dementia (99% to 100%), kidney stone (29% to 75%), dyspnea (40% to 42%), diarrhoea (20-25%), and constipation disease (13-25%) were shown to be the main cause and ventilation support was needed for approximately 14%-20% of patients.
By 14 February, COVID-19 mortality was 2% with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
Similarly, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10 percent of 8,096 cases confirmed.
For MERS, based on demographic studies in June 2012, 37% of the 2,494 cases were confirmed.
Previous studies have reported that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reaches a height of 6.47 with confidence interval (CI) 95% greater than 5.71-7.23, while R0 SARS-CoV only affects 2 to 4.
SARS-CoV-2 comparisons with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in pregnancy, mortality, and R0 are given in Table 1.
These figures show that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher publishing capacity compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but do not limit MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge of controlling SARS-CoV-2 pandemics is greater than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemics.
Classrooms are often found in one family or another in a group or in a car, such as a passenger ship.
Patients often have on a journey or live in Wuhan or another part of the country that they encounter or that they encounter infected people or patients within the last two weeks before birth.
However, it has been reported that people can carry a virus without showing more than two weeks of pregnancy, and patients who have been expelled from the hospital can carry another virus.
At first, patients had white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) normal or low.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count < 4Ã—109/L, which includes lymphocyte count < 1Ã—109/L, and aminotransferase aspartate and increased viral concentrations found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The incidence of heart enzymes and bone disease and myoglobin increases in the blood of a number of patients, as well as the C-reactive protein and the rapid increase in blood pressure in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, D-dimer increased, i.e. fibrin clearance products in the blood, and lymphocyte levels gradually drop.
The contrast of Toraks photos was found on the large COVID-19 patient's size and was determined by a bilateral wave or ground-glass opiate in the lungs.
Patients often experience acute pneumonia, acute skin cancer, and acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occur, tatter-controlled inflammation, air accumulation, and progressive fibrosis are very widespread.
The dysfunction of type I and type II pneumositis lowers the surface level and increases the pressure of the surface to lower the dust capacity to increase and increase the risk of dust collapsing.
As a result, the worst finding on the toraks photo is often parallel to the worst disease rate.
On February 18, 2020, the first analysis of COVID-19 pathology showed a lack of pneumositis, the development of hierial membranes, and interstitial lymphosis infiltration, as well as sensory cell counts in patients who died from this disease, according to pathology of virus infection and ARDS as well as the analysis of pathology of patients SARS and MERS.
RNA SARS-CoV-2 detection is used as the main criteria for diagnosis of COVID-19 using the polymerase transcriptase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
However, due to the level of false negative levels, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations have begun to be used for diagnosis (which is not only on RT-PCR) in Tiongkok on 13 February 2020.
Similar situations have occurred in the SARS diagnosis.
As a result, combinations between disease epidemics, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiology are very important and a consequence of making an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group explained the technical use of SHERLOCK based CRISPR for SARS-CoV-2 detection, which detects the RNA SARS-CoV-2 synthetic fragment at 20 Ã— 10-18 mol/L to 200 Ã— 10-18 mol/L (10-100 alternates per microliter input) using cell hooks for less than one hour without having to require a limited instrumentation.
However, this new technology can greatly improve sensitivity and flexibility if it is checked on clinical samples.
Because of lack of experience with new CoV, doctors in particular offered support to COVID-19 patients, while trying various therapies that have been used or previously recommended for other coV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2.2).
This therapy includes current therapy and potential antiviral therapy, immunosuppression, steroids, plasma from healthy patients, Tinghoa traditional medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from newly recovered patients is recommended for use in therapy.
The pharmaceutical industry has developed antibiotics and vaccines against this virus.
At the initial stage, SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks dust and may also attacks other organs that express ACE2 at lower levels, such as gastrointestinal and kidney systems.
However, a major threat to the health and well - being of the sick and the cause of death is illness.
Therefore, medical support is very important to reduce obesity and save lives, which includes general oxygen therapy, high-temperature oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive ventilation, depending on the severity of disease.
Patients with severe hepatic impairment should be supported with extracorporium (ECMO) oxygenation, namely the modified cardiopulmoner technique used for heart failure or life-threatening surgery.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic cancer, as well as the protection of vital organ function, is also very important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
The increased immune response of patients with SARS and MERS is a major factor.
Badai sitokin is a systemic inflamatory response form specified by the mouth of the sitokin release, which includes TNFÎ±, IL-1Î², IL-2, IL-6, IFN, IFN, IFNG, and MCP-1.
These sitocins induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that become the main cause of ARDS and failed to develop the immune system.
Immunosuppression is very important in the development of sytokin tumors, especially in patients with severe illness.
Corticosteroids and Tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6, have been used to treat sitokin vessels.
Other immunosuppressive devices for sitocin test include modulation of immune response to T cells; IFN-g, IL-1, and TNF-blocking; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; sytokin signalization; and HDAC inhibitor.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, are widely used in the SARS treatment to reduce inflammation.
However, the high dose steroids do not benefit from the weight loss of patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, steroids can cause serious side effects, especially osteonecrosis, which have a very devastating effect on prognosis.
However, short-term short-term administration of corticosteroids to the lower dose is encouraged to be carefully given to COVID-19 patients who are critically ill.
At the time of writing this report, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous redisivir donations, i.e. a nucleotide analog, were found specifically in a COVID-19 patient from the United States.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral medicine developed by Gilead, again for the treatment of Ebola and Marlburg virus.
In time, remdesivir also showed resistance to RNA virus alone, which includes MERS and SARS virus.
Based on this, Gilead prepared this animal for Tingkok to do a sample test on SARS-CoV-2 infected people, and the result was very expected.
In addition, baricytinb, interferon-Î±, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been recommended as potential therapy for patients with acute skin rash.
Diare, nausea, vomiting, heart failure, and other side effects may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
This therapy interaction with other medicinal products used by patients should be co-administered.
Plasma from healthy patients and antibiotics
There is a long history of blood collection that has been cured from infectious diseases to treat other patients who have the same disease or to prevent the disease from happening.
True, patients who have recovered often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood.
Antibodi is immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by lymphocyte B to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, recognize the unique molecules on the pathogen, and direct them.
Based on this, plasma is collected from a group of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and is placed in 10 patients with severe diseases.
Their body temperature improved in 24 hours, including the spread of inflammation and viral loads, and increased oxygen levels in the blood.
However, verification and classification must be performed in order to establish this method for the use of large scale prior to the development of specific therapies.
Further, in addition to the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related deficiencies need to be considered together.
Antibodies, for example, can stimulate the immune response in excess of time and cause a sytokin release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
Antibodies in blood are usually low and plasma is required in a large number of patients with critical diseases.
The development and production of specific antibiotics quickly enough to fight global epidemics is difficult to do.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate cells B from healthy patients and identify genetic code that inhibits effective antibodies or make effective antibiotics for important proteins for the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the level of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in Tingkok for thousands of years.
However, most effects depend on the combination of different components in the formula. This formula is different from the diagnosis of disease based on the theory of TCM.
Most of the active components are yet to be known or not clear because it is difficult to extract or verify that component or its optimal combination.
Now, as effective and specific therapy for COVID-19 has not yet been available, TCM has become one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate to moderate to severe diseases or for those who recover from severe diseases.
For example, Caps. Shu Feng Jie Du and Caps. Lian Hua Qing Wen were found successful for COVID-19 therapy.
The teratial clearance rate in the COVID-19 patient therapy was observed in some Tiongkok provinces using TCM in 87% of its patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while in the Hubei province, only about 30% of CVID-19 patients, had a lower clearance rate (13%).
However, this comparison is still valid because many other factors, such as the number and severity of the patient, need to be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and friends offered a study comparing only Western Medicine (WM) therapy with WM and TCM relations.
They found that the time needed for body heat recovery, loss of heat, and relatively short stay on the WM+TCM group was compared to the WM group.
Even more impressive, the severity of pregnancy (from weight to weight) is much lower for the WM+TCM group compared to the WM alone (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and mortality lower than the WM+TCM group compared to the WM only (8.8% compared to 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCM still await a better test on a larger scale and in more research centres.
The other thing that's interesting is to cover the working mechanism and classify the effective component in TCM therapy or its combination, if possible.
Most of the patients expected or confirmed COVID-19 feel very afraid of a disease that is very contagious and even fatal, and those who are diagnosed also feel free, lonely, and angry.
Further infections, such as dementia, hypoxia, and bone disease, as well as the effects on the immune system, such as corticosteroids, can lead to increased stress and mental pressure.
In the early phase of SARS release, a range of psychiatric morbidity, including depression, depression, panic attacks, psychomotor stroke, psychotic disorder, delirium, and even suicides have been reported.
Communication of contact travel and quarantine, as part of a public health response to the COVID-19 media, can make people feel more comfortable and guilty of the effects of addiction, carantine, and stigma on relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, those expected, and those who are opposed to them, as well as the general community that needs.
Psychological support should include multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with routine and accurate analysis of SARS-CoV-2 coverage, and therapeutic plans and the use of professional devices and electronic applications to avoid contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are very important in determining the transmission line from the animal reserve and humans infected with rare and often highly qualified antiviral therapy in control of the epidemic caused by viral infection.
The surface has been made to develop protein-based S vaccines, which, in the long term and effective form of control antibodies and/or immune defenses against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, a life-threatening vaccine has been evaluated on experimental animals.
However, the effectiveness of this vaccine candidate in vivo in the lansia and the model of lethal resistance and its protection against zoonotic infection should be determined before the initiation of clinical studies.
This may be because the SARS passed 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since then.
On the contrary, the sporadic and MERS cluster cases continue to take place in the Middle East and spread to other areas because there are still zoonotic sources in the countryside.
The vaccination strategy has been developed for METS by using an activated virus, DNA plasma, virus vector, nanopartikel, particles similar to the virus, and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in experimental animals.
The development of vaccines against safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunians is a very urgent and important task to control the current epidemic.
However, this challenge is not easy to deal with because of the long time to develop vaccines (the 18-month rate) and the dynamic CV variation.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show its full clinical course to thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient will be able to recover completely.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and high mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, the achievement of the disease forecast is very important for health care bodies to give priority to their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the long-reported clinical study, the following factors can affect or are related to COVID-19 patient projections (Table 3):
Usia: Usia is the most important factor for SARS forecast, which also happens for COVID-19.
COVID-19 was first reported at 30-65 years of age with 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age in a study of 8.866 cases as described above.
Patients who require intensive care tend to have osteoporosis and complications as well as significantly older patients are compared to patients who do not need intensive care (mean 66 years compared to 51 years), which determine age as a prognosis factor for the end of the COVID-19 patient.
Type of insurance: SARS-CoV-2 more infected men than women (0.31/100, compared to 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidity and complications: COVID-19 patients who need intensive care are more likely to experience acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
The condition of the heart is also a major cause of death for the patients in the SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 has also been reported to be collage with ACE2-positive, which can affect heart function in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and illness are very correlated and can affect one another.
Abnormal laboratory findings: C-reactive protein (CRP) in blood represents inflammation or network damage and is recommended as a potential prognosis factor for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
The correlation between the CRP level and the prevalence of COVID-19 has also been recommended.
In addition, increased dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and CK may also help predict the end result.
These enzymes are very high in various organs, especially in the heart and heart, and released during network damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are a traditional medicine for heart and heart dysfunction.
Primary clinical trials: Toraks photos and the development of temporary clinical trials should be considered together with other things to predict the end result and COVID-19 complications.
Steroid use: As explained above, steroids are immunosuppression that is widely used as long-term therapy for infectious diseases to reduce inflammation.
Because high dose corticosteroids are widely used in patients with severe SARS, many people who survive this disease eventually suffer from vascular osteokecrosis with the ability to live a lifetime and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at a lower dose and temporarily administered to COVID-19 patients.
Mental pressure: As explained above, during the COVID-19 release, many patients suffer extraordinary stress because they have to go through their long and extreme periods of uncertainty and witness the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychology and long-term support advice must be given to help this patient recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on this long-term demographic study, COVID-19 seems to have an epidemiological picture that differs from SARS.
In addition to applications in the lower armchairs, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively apply on the upper armrests and cause fainting or without pain in the early phase of infection, like other CoVs that cause a pill.
Therefore, at the early stage or incubation period, infected patients can produce a large number of viruses during day-to-day activity, which pose a major challenge in controlling the epidemic.
However, the SARS-CoV transmission is believed to occur when the disease is terminally ill and most of it is not in the initial phase.
Thus, COVID-19 is now much worse and more difficult to control than SARS.
At present, great efforts are being made in Tingkok, which includes the quarantine of Wuhan and the surrounding cities and the quarantine of almost all populations with the hope of completing the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Although this action has greatly affected the economy and other sectors in the country, the number of new patients has decreased, indicating the risk of epidemics.
The most optimistic estimates indicate that the release will end in March and the breeding phase will last for 3-4 months.
Some experts, however, do not agree.
Paul Hunter et al. estimates that the COVID-19, which seems to be much larger than the SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., made a model for predicting the end of the epidemic and said that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the global population.
The Canadian study group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in a middle-class hospital and that a patient who had recovered and returned from the hospital two weeks earlier. This indicates that the virus that was identified back could be a recurrence episode, similar to influenza.
However, the signs promise to happen in Tiongkok, if seen on the basis of a new number of cases, which shows that the strategy is now likely to succeed.
Once again, Ebolaâ€™s predictions would lead to one million deaths as well as half of deaths.
But with its caranthins and strict isolation, the disease can eventually be controlled.
Maybe, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens its ability to Infect and eventually disappears or becomes a virus that is not too pathogenic to humans.
The comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemic is given below (Gbr. 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is very easy to transmit through stones or gas, and perhaps through direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
This virus is also found in feses so that it interferes with the possibility of new transmissions, i.e. fisses-ke-mulut transmission.
This recent study in 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by non-ocomal infections, which include 17 patients with other prior diseases and 40 healthcare providers.
Therefore, joint preventive action must be taken to protect people, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, workmates, and even those with disabilities who are ill or who are infected.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is through the use of facial masks, good masks as well as N95 respiratory masks (the number of the 1860s) help control the spread of the virus.
The mask is designed to keep people from getting infected with the virus from the air or to hang on the surface of the material, where it can be kept for others.
However, only the N95 mask (the number of the 1860 series) can protect against virion inhalation with a smaller size of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% virion can be fully menetized; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in terms of size, both of which are approximately 85 nm.
Since the particles can mementoize even five fat masks that are thrown into one, the patient's immediate healthcare provider should wear N95 (the number of the 1860 series) rather than the mask.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear appropriate isolates to reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also cause eye infections.
On January 22, 2020, a SARS-CoV-2 infected doctor, despite wearing N95 masks; the virus may enter his body through eye contact.
For that reason, health care providers should also wear facial expressions or facial expressions while working with patients.
For the public in the affected areas or in the affected areas, it is highly recommended that each person wash his hands with soap contaminated more often than usual, try to stay at home with his quarantine, and avoid contact with those who are infected.
Three feet [2.6 m] in length were placed in order to protect from the disease.
These actions are an effective method to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, must be a major warning for Tingkok that has a strong memory of the 2003 SARS release.
However, on 19 January 2020, the Director of the Wyohan Disease Control Centre comforted the population by saying that this new virus has a low-performance and limited reproductive capacity from humans to humans and prevention and protection of this disease is not a problem.
This message is so comforting to the publicâ€™s fears, especially when the whole country is preparing for the Semmi Museum Festival, so that this critical time is passed to cover the very small disease in Wuhan.
Tingkokâ€™s disease control team should draw lessons from this and make great progress in the future.
For example, this body should (1) be more careful when making public announcements because each word is observed and can change their attitude and decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to non-clinical information than to expect official reports from a doctor or a competent official; (3) more restrictive use of the potential for epidemic at the initial stage, and not to try to satisfy the public; and (4) more often to achieve targeted and effective public awareness of the disease and testing and to improve the system of public response on a periodic basis.
The COVID-19 version is caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus that began to collapse at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the magazine has been reaching the entire country of Tingkok and more than 50 countries around the world at this time.
Since this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the COVID-19 virus has effected like the SARS virus returned.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which is very important for the prevention of epidemics and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 is more about abortion than young people and more about men than women, and the rate of death is also higher than that of young people.
Mortality SARS is higher than mortality COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
The COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are not pregnant, while the SARS patients usually transmit the virus when they are ill. This makes it more difficult to spread the COVID-19 than the SARS.
This explains part of the reason for SARS-CoV-2 to spread faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
RNA routines to check SARS-CoV-2 can produce negative results in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have recovered may be able to obtain further positive results from virus testing.
These encounters have greatly increased the risk of viral infection.
With the rapid development of COVID-19 research, some important issues still need to be solved, namely:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a major genetic homology has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two coV-like-SARS thresholds, we still can't conclude that SARS-COV-2 is from the threshold.
What animal became the interspecies to manipulate the virus from its source, tell people about it, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to the numbers 1 and 2, we can't decide the transmission effectively and we can turn it back at any time.
Although molecular and biochemical models show that SARS-CoV-2 is compatible with ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the liver cells and affect subsequent pathology changes?
Is this virus also linked to the cell that expresses an ACE2 in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus develop genetically during human transmission?
Will this pandemic become a global pandemic, end up like SARS, or return periodically like flu?
The answer to the above questions and many other statements is very important, but it may take time to find them.
However, no matter what the cost, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible in order to get back to normal life.
Zonotics virus human crown
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have caused co-evolution of the corona virus (CoV) and its ring, including human.
Prior to 2003, two human COVs (HCOVs) were known to cause infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis.
The acute infection syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East (MERS) syndrome reverses the situation and reveals how much HCOV infection can damage and endanger the soul.
The SARS-CoV-2 museum in Tingkok centre at the end of 2019 has made CV a challenge back and surprise us with high transmissions, but with lower pathogenicity compared to his brother, SARS-CoV.
HCOV infection is a zoonoses, so the original understanding of the zoonotic HCOV will benefit us.
Most of the HCOV comes from the wild, and in this animal, the virus is not pathogenic.
The amount of reserve between some HCOV has also been known.
The identification of the mother of animals has direct implications for the prevention of human disease.
Animal interaction studies can also provide important insight into the pathogenicity of CV in humans.
In this report, we present a general picture of the current knowledge of seven HCOVs, with a focus on the history of its discovery and its zoonotic origins and the transmission of its inter-species.
Most importantly, we compared and compared HCoV with the sum of evolution and recombination genome.
The CV 2019 disease epidemic (COVID-19) is currently being discussed in this context.
In addition, the conditions of birth that have been successful and that involve the evolution of the virus on the spread of disease are also regulated.
Coronaviridae virus (CoV) comes from the Coronaviridae family, consisting of a group of RNA viruses, positive indera, and isolated.
This virus has the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilograms between the RNA virus called "CoV", because its morphology is similar to that of the virus under the electron microscope.
On the basis of its structure, the CoV has an unsembled genome that has a similar meaning.
About two thirds of the genome consists of two large open readings (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are interconnected. Both are transformed into polyprotein replications pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyprotein has experienced further dehydration to form 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome is made up of open reading form (ORF) for structural protein, which includes tonical or spike (S), pelvic or envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of complete proteins that are specific to a specific gene line are also identified by the various codes of the coV.
Based on differences in protein sequence, CV is classified as four genes (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and Delta-CoV); among these four genes, the beta-COV gene has the highest HCOV and is divided into four consecutive lines (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence shows that cherries and vegetarian animals are sources of largely alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while ungulates are the primary reserve of gamma-CoV and Delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, the CV continued to pass over species limitations and some CVs have become important pathogens to humans.
So far, there's seven human coV (HCOV) known.
Among the seven of these viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
Five other beta-CoVs have been infected with HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV virus, East-CoV syndrome virus, and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 often cause mild sweating, such as pill and/or diet.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing lower respiratory infection relatively more patients and have a higher chance to develop into acute respiratory arrest syndrome (ARDS) and manifestations outside the lungs.
The first HCoV-229E beach, B814, was isolated from a patient's intestines in the mid- 1960s.
Since then, increased knowledge has been collected through deep study of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which causes healing.
In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that the general HCOV infection is not dangerous, until the SARS virus occurs.
The SARS reported in 2003 is one of the most devastating outbreaks in history, which has infected more than 8,000 people with the death toll of about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle Eastern Syndrome (MERS) was responsible for further epidemics in the Arab World by means of a series of sports campaigns in various parts of the world.
The new HCoV 2019 (2019-nCoV), hereinafter referred to as SARS-CoV-2, is a cancerous agent of the 2019 virus virus (COVID-19), which has killed more than 3.120 people and infected more than 91,000 people by 3 March 2020.
The alarm is closed and the world needs to prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 bid to come.
These seven HCOVs all have zoonotic origins from turtles, rabbits, or conservation animals.
Many of the evidence supports the origin of all HCoV's evolutions from the universe, and in the universe, the coV is well-placed and non-pathogenic, but it shows great genetic characteristics.
The COVID-19 epidemic has caused medical, scientific, social, and moral challenges to Tiankok and the world.
The zoonotic origin of HCoV has given the task of understanding natural phenomena, motion patterns, and the elimination factors resulting from the movement of species.
This study can also lead or facilitate the search for spare animals, among other things, and the accumulation of SARS-CoV-2, which has an important impact on the prevention of the coming preaching.
In this interview, we gave a general picture of zoonotic origins, interspecies transmissions, and HCoV pathogens.
We especially study and discuss the general topic that HCoV's mother virus is usually non-pathogenic in its natural reserve, but it becomes pathogenic after transmission of interspecies to new breast.
We also argued that the HCoV evolution train is that the capacity to transmit is often accompanied by pathogenicity generation.
The end result of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
CoV animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the isolation of HCoV-229E beach B814 of the first of the most popular diseased species, various CVs have been isolated from various infected animals, including turkeys, cats, dogs, cats, and dogs.
In the last few years, seven HCOVs have been identified.
A brief summary of HCOV findings in chronological order (Table 1) is an informative guide.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory system that experienced respiratory infection over 1966, which was subsequently adapted to be released on the WI-38 paru cell line.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E showed osteoporosis, including headaches, nausea, vomiting, and constipation, including toothache and stones seen in 10~20% of cases.
Next in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and a series of cycles in the still deteriorating brain.
The clinical description of HCoV-OC43 infection appears to be similar to the infection caused by HCoV-229E, which can not automatically be compared to other infectious pathogens such as influenza A and Rhinovirus virus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed worldwide and the most widely transmitted feed during the cold season in the drying area.
Usually, the time of incubation of these two viruses is less than one week and is followed by a period of illness for about 2 weeks.
On the basis of a voluntary study of human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCV-229E have experienced mild exercises.
Only a small number of patients with weakened body fat systems show low blood pressure infection.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is the first pandemic that has been well documented in human history and its etiology agent is SARS-CoV, which is the third found HCoV.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, Tiongkok.
The AIDS epidemic has caused 8,096 cases reported with 774 deaths, which have been reported in many countries and countries.
Disappeared from the super driver, each case is expected to cause about two seconds, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the virus load peaks seen on the 10th day of disease.
The patients who were infected with SARS-CoV first experienced mialgia, headaches, dementia, vomiting, and screaming, followed by dyspnea, stones, and respiratory disturbances as a result of further elevations.
Lymphopenia, an abnormal heart function test, and the increase in bone creation is a different laboratory for SARS.
The effects of alveolar fusion, epithelial proliferation, and macrophages are also rare in SARS patients.
Next, about 20-30% of patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the low blood pressure, some organs that include gastrointestinal disorders, heart, and kidney may also be infected in severe cases, usually including sytokin disorders, which can cause death, especially in patients who are weak.
The virus was first isolated from the lung biopsy opened by the nol patient's relatives who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, much has been done for HCV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
This virus was initially very contagious to infants, nurses, and patients who were severely affected by infectious diseases.
The image of corizus, conjunctivitis, dementia, and bronchiolititis is found in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study explained the isolation of the same virus from the same genetic species as the male male 8 months of suffering pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, this virus has spread worldwide.
It is thought that HCoV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of the general infectious disease and its peaks occur at the beginning of the summer, summer, and winter periods.
HCoV-NL63 is linked to obstructive laringitis, which is also called krup.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from 71-year-old men who had been treated even because of pneumonia and bronchialitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and community bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is reported to be associated with acute asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide, causing foot-and-mouth disease.
These four HCOV communities have all adapted to human beings and generally have a small possibility of being highly pathogenic. However, extraordinary cases have occurred because of unknown reasons, such as in the recent subtype HCOV-NL63 subtypes reported causing severe respiratory infections in Tingkok.
In general, when it comes to the ability to move efficiently and to maintain self - control in humans, this HCV virus and pathogenicity is also lacking.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from a 60-year-old patient who experienced acute pneumonia and failed prison in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the cases were confirmed by the laboratories from the Middle East, in some cases the cases of imports were reported in the second half of the European Union and Tunisia.
The other 186 cases were confirmed in South Korea in 2015.
MeRS clinical manifestations are similar to SARS clinical manifestations, which are spread by acute progressive pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients experience acute renal failure, which is far more likely to occur only in MERS among HCOV-related diseases.
More than 30% of patients showed gastrointestinal fever, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
Until 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 cases confirmed by the high deaths of the laboratory, that is, 34.4%, made MERS-CoV one of the most frightening viruses known to humans.
By the middle of December 2019, a retrospectively-related pneumonian class was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that the outbreak of low respiratory infections that are occurring and caused by SARS-CoV-2 as the Global Health Authority and the cure of COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with the death rate of 3.4% of the capital cases.
It has to be reported, the death of the case in Hubei, Tiongkok, 4.2%, while the death of the case outside Hubei is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes serious weapon infection such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with tooth, stone, and breath loss.
Diare was also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly develop into acute respiratory arrest syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because of high nucleotide sequence homology, 82%, they are both grouped into different phylogenetic trees.
The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly lower, but it's more advanced than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 infected subspecies have been reported and may play a role in the rapidly spreading of SARS-CoV-2 throughout the world.
Comparing and comparing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCOVs shows very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the time of incubation and the duration of the journey of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 followed six other HCoV public trains.
Second, the COVID-19 collapse is found between SARS-CoV and four other communities of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63.
On the one hand, the SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more general picture of the Community HCoV infection, which includes non-specific mild or even non-pregnant iron images.
On the other hand, some small cases of COVID-19 that are damaged can appear to be SARRS-CoV infection despite a slightly lower race.
Thirdly, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows interesting pool characteristics, which are similar to the common HCOV and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the ability to transmit SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the community HCoV.
On the other hand, sending out does not have the ability to transmit SARS-CoV-2 after some roads in humans still need to be reversified, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases.
Finally, like the other HCoV, SARS-CoV-2 can be identified by the feses sample.
"Is SARS-CoV-2 fecal-oral transmission important, such as in the SARS-CoV transmission case, at least in certain situations, it still needs to be defined by the next study."
What's also important is whether SARS-CoV-2 is the seasonal character of the community's HCOV case.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 image, which includes the ability to transmit, pathogenicity, and further communication in a number of roads in humans, will have a great impact on the final output of the COVID-19 that is going on.
The four HCOV communities that have contributed to the slowdown have all been adapted to humans.
From a different point of view, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, good HCoV and humans may be the species of probational HCoV.
HCOV, which is a major human disease, and people who suffer from HCV, has been diagnosed.
For this to happen, HCOV must apply to humans in a number of ways to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations to be used against the cold cut-off factor.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 release continues and the more people are infected, the greater the risk of this virus being fully adapted to humans.
If the virus is properly adapted, human transmission will be difficult to stop with carantine or other infection control.
Over the years, four CoV communities have been scattered in the human population and have been feeding on immunocompetitive people.
This virus does not need an animal reserve.
Rather, the very pathogenic SARS-COV and MERS-COV are not adaptable to humans and its transmission in humans cannot be preserved.
Both must defend themselves and make sacrifices in zoonotic reserves and seek opportunities to preach to rare human targets, possibly through one or more interpolation and amplification.
SARS-CoV-2 has a picture similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCOV communities.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easy to transmit like HCoV community, at least now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than HCOV community and non-spatogenic SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It still needs to be checked whether SARS-COV-2 will be fully adapted to humans and circulatory in humans without a reserve animal or between.
Before we talk about the origin of the HCV, we need to discuss the definition and characteristics of the evolutionian, natural, reserve, interlocutory, and the amplification of the HCV.
The animal acts as the great evolutionist HCoV if it has a close and high level of humology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The adult virus usually adapts well to the non-pathogenic properties of this species.
In the same way, the reservoirâ€™s mother brought HCoV in more and more times and over the centuries.
In both cases, infected breast is normal and is normal breast for HCoV or breast virus.
On the other hand, if HCOV has just entered the interlocking area just before or around the time the virus enters humans, the virus is not adaptable to the new and often pathogenous conditions.
This interface can function as a zoonotic source of human infection and play as an amplification ring by allowing the virus to temporarily apply and then transmit it to humans to amplify the human infection scale.
HCoV can be infected in the neck if it cannot keep its transmission in the middle.
On the contrary, HCoV can also adapt to intermittent tension and even create long-term immunity.
In this regard, the beauty of the region becomes the beauty of a natural reserve.
Epidemiological data reveal retrospectively that the case of zero SARS has a link to the heart animals.
A further study of seroprevalence showed that these animals sales had a higher prevalence of IgG anti-SARS-CoV compared to the general population.
The month of the month (Palama larvata) and the live animal dog is the first to be identified carrying the similar SARS-CoV virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This is not directly supported by the fact that no further cases of SARS have been reported since all disturbances on the market have been killed.
Thus, it has been reported that putting the moon out of the wild or the undisputed landscape into the market of living animals gives the majority of the negative test results for SARS-CoV. This indicates that putting the moon may only act as an intermittent amplification ring, but not a natural resource of SARS-CoV.
It must be noted, since 80% of all animals on the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be estimated that many small mammals may also function as inter-SARS-CoV amplifiers.
All this ring seems to be the end ring of the SARS-CoV.
The search for wild animals for SARS-CoV continues to reveal the nearby nearby CoV shark, known as the Rhinolopus family of SARS HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-Bat-CoV HKU3), which is located on the Tiongkok vessel.
This equation results in positive testing for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and sequences through SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This coV and the other coV have been sharing humology of a nuclear sequence of 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
This study is a foundation for a new concept that the landscape is beautiful for new human pathogens.
Some coVs like SARS (SL-COV) are also identified from the environment, but only one, called WIV1, can be diagnosed as a live virus.
Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) enzyme is known as SARS-CoV receptor.
The WIV1 from the sample of cirrhosis of the liver is shown to be using ACE2 as a ovary, muscle, and human as a receptor to enter the cell.
Interestingly, a group of patients with convalescent SARS can control WIV1.
So far, the WIV1 represents the closest peaks of SARS-CoV in the solar system, with a high-95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Disappeared from high  homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that the WIV1 is not a direct mother virus SARS-CoV and that the nurse is not a direct reservoir of SARS-CoV.
A phylogenetic analysis combines MERS-CoV into the same group as the CV-HKU4 and the CV-HKU5.
CoV-HKU4 hosts and MERS-CoV uses the same incandescent receptor, i.e. peptidil peptide 4 (DPP4), as the path to the virus.
The RNA polymerase sequence depends on-RNA MERS-CoV in a phylogenetic way on its presence in the vast beta-CoV identified from Europe and Africa.
So far, there has not been a MERCS-COV alive found in the desert.
MERS-CoV and close relatives CoV-HKU25 have only 87% of the second nucleotide homology.
As a result, the crew may not be able to afford the immediately MERS-CoV reserve.
On the other hand, the study in the Middle East showed that the Arab gene produces a seropositive result for specific antibodies that control MERS-CoV, like the Middle East salt in some African countries.
MERS-CoV lives an identical life with the virus found in humans is isolated from the Arab National Park. This further indicates that the well is the true reserve for MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that musive virus flows are usually relatively easy to detect in a test that is infected with MERS-CoV.
It needs to be determined, the virus that infection reduces the virus not only through the clothing route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of the virus flow from the back.
However, the question has not yet been answered because many confirmed MERS cases do not have contact with rats prior to pregnancy, possibly the consequences of human-human transmission or transmission routes that involve unknown animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 divides 96.2% nucleotide homology with CoV ratG13 diosolated by Rhinolophus afinis.
As in the SARS-CoV case and MERS-CoV, the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is too large to establish maternal relations.
In other words, it may not be a direct backup of SARS-CoV-2, except if the CoV is located almost identical later in the day.
It is possible that wild animals between SARS-CoV-2 are among wild species sold and killed in the Great Sea Food Market. Many cases of early COVID-19 relate to this market, which indicates the possibility of transmissible human beings.
Some recent studies based on metagenomic sequences show that a group of endangered small mammals, known as the trangling (Manis javanica), may also lead beta-CoV in conflict with SARS-CoV-2.
This new coV bonding genome is 85-92% of the second nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, these coVs are closely associated with RATG13 with a 90 percent greater than nucleotide sequence.
Both of them are grouped into two sub-regires of the virus like SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one part of the receptor binding domain (RBD) that is similar to SARS-CoV-2, with a sequence of a large amino acids of 97.4%.
Unfortunately, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 are far different, although secondary homology levels are all higher.
Previous studies in the patient's relationship also reported viral contiguous detection of lung samples, which also appeared to be in conflict with SARS-CoV-2.
This study is doubling different approaches and manual curves to produce sequences through particles consisting of approximately 86.3% through complete virus.
We can't ignore the possibility of interlocking as one of the most beautiful animals between SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence that supports SARS-CoV-2 directly from the interference because of the sequential differences between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relative SARS-CoV-2 connection.
Moreover, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-COV relative SARS-CoV-2.
The SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary route in the corridor, the trangling, and other mamalia still needs to be set.
Although the highest secondary homology in RBD is found between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relative SARS-CoV-2 interconnecting, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 share the highest homology at the secondary level throughout.
It is too speculative when it is said that the level of similarity between RBD beta-CoV relative SARS-CoV-2 interconnecting and SARS-CoV-2 is caused by the evolution of convergence that is selectively mediated.
Hypothesis supports recombination between beta-CoV-sarabat-SARS-CoV-2 interpolation and RatG13 in third species.
As a factor in the movement of evolution, many recombination occurs between beta-CoV.
Researchers have not yet been able to decide on the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV, zoonotic origins HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been patented.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be derived from coV invasive, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in breeding animals.
It has been reported that the ARCoV.2 (applaachian Ridge CoV) identified in the North American three-colored lake shows close proximity to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E genetically competes with other coV giants, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which is detected in Ghana, with Camelidae is also thought to be the most common among them.
To make it more clear, current knowledge of the origin of HCoV animals is summarized in Figures 1 and Table 2.
A phylogenetic analysis has confirmed the occurrence of HCV transmissions throughout history.
About 1890, when HCoV-OC43 invented species from domestic animals for human infection, it was noted that there was an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.
The history of HCoV-229E transmissions is not very clear.
Alpha-CoV translucent with HCoV-229E has been found.
Between them, there's alpha-CoV alpha.
Some evidence supports the transmission of the virus directly from space to humans.
First of all, humans, not alpacas, may be intertwined with the environment.
Humans, on the other hand, have a close relationship with the alpacas.
Second, alpha-CoV-coV-conformant HCoV-229E has various types of and non-pathogenicity in the pancreas, while alpha-CoV alpaca causes infection in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV alpaca was not found in feral animals.
Therefore, the possibility of getting alpha-CoV relatives from HCoV-229E from humans cannot be approached.
In fact, witchcraft is a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, which include the virus rabies, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus, and the Hendra virus.
As a result, it is not too exciting that the virus may directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
Another possibility is that while alpha-CoV is the most advanced function as the HCV-229E gene node, alpacas and Arabic nodes may function as the interdependency that transmits virus to humans, exactly like the MERS-CoV case.
MERS-COV is a very good example of the transmission of inter-species from the landscape to the southern Arab and from the southern Arab to the human.
Evolutionary METS-CoV from the universe is known for the initial identification of the virus and also strengthened by subsequent encounters.
Clearly, the virus is a rich range of species of viruses for genetic fragmentation of interspecies and transmission of interspecies.
Long-term, densely populated colonies, strict social interaction, and strong flight skills, all are conditions that support the environment to be an ideal 'vournage'.
On the other hand, MERS-COV has been entering the Arab border for decades.
This virus has been adapted to the angle that has changed from the angle between the angles to the angles of a stable and natural reserve.
MERS-COV causes very mild disease and preserves relatively low mutation rates in this animal.
Its sporadic transmission to humans happens suddenly and humans remain beautiful at the end of MERS-CoV because it can't continue.
Not like the iron part in the SERS-CoV transmission, the interconnection part, if any, in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
In particular, beta-CoV contagion is highly pathogenic in constipation.
The connection may be the last ring for the SARS-CoV-2 relatives, similar to the soft in the SARS-CoV case.
In the coming studies, some possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2 interspecies from animals to humans should be measured or aligned.
First of all, it could be a reserve ring for SARS-CoV-2 relatives who are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share in many of the ecological cycles around the globe by means of a flood or a hailstorm.
Second, the interference could be one of the most common amplifiers for newly entered SARS-CoV-2 relatives virus.
Humans have been infected with the deadly virus of the brain and with it.
Maybe, a lot of mammals, including protective animals, are on the ground for SARS-CoV-2.
Antibodies and wild animals need to be processed.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in third species that are closely related to the environment and the trangling.
The original SARS-CoV-2 animal research is still ongoing.
Surviving from various species of wild animals, three main factors of the side of the virus are also important to make it easier for CoV to pass over species' limitations.
First, the relatively high mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to the RNA virus alone, the rapid mutation of the CoV can be considered as "high" to "high" with the rapid replacement of the high-rate rate ~10-4 per year per cup, depending on the adaptation phase of the CV to the new ring.
CoV has exoribonuclease prognosis, an endpoint that affects very high mobility, attenuation, or even invasiveness.
Interestingly, the analogous nucleotide Remdesivir is known to stress the replication of CoV through the inhibition of this exobibunuclease and RNA polymerase based on RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARRS-CoV-2 agents that will be tested in clinical trials.
However, CoV mutations are about a million times higher than their mother's mutation rate.
In addition, mutatis mutants are often high when the coV is not adaptable to the ring.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has high mutations, the SARS-CoV-2 mutations are actually lower, setting a higher adaptive level than humans.
Maybe the SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to other beautiful ones who are close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this is also true of MERS-CoV that has been adapted to the Arabic border.
According to theoretically, little chance of genetic contamination will quickly make vaccines and antiviral agents of SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large RNA in the CoV gives extra flexibility in the genome modification, for mutations and recombination, to increase the probability of co-evolution between species, which helps to develop new CV when appropriate.
This is supported by many unique open readings and protein functions that are felt towards the end of 3â€² genome.
Thirdly, CoV kerap replaces the template by a sequence of replications of RNA through the unique "select-salin" mechanism.
In the ring that works as a contestant, the spinal cord took place during the RNA CoV transcription.
A full and subgenomic RNA that is highly homologous can experience recombination to form a new coV.
Natural recombination phylogenetic evidence has been found on HCV-HKU1 and HCV-OC43, as well as on CoV animals such as SL-CoV and CoV-HKU9.
Virus interactions in its connection with transmission
In addition to the three virus factors mentioned above, interaction with inang receptors is another major factor that affects inter-species transmission.
Here, SARS-CoV recombination is considered a special example, which also shows positive selections during inter-species transmission.
Based on comparative analysis between SARS-CoV isolates human and musculoskeletal, SARS-CoV is expected to experience rapid adaptations in various angles, especially with mutations in RBD protein S.
In general, RBD protein S CoV interacts with cell receptors and is intensively targeted to respond to cold antibodies.
At SARS-CoV, RBD is a 318 to 510 amino acid in the S1 fragment, which is linked to ACE2 humans and its receptors as the path to the virus.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to identify different ACE2 receptors, which include vertebrates, musculoskeletals, ticks, and fungal dogs, thus allowing transmission of virus between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acids that are identified as different from the human virus isolates and sat in RBD and 4 of them are located on the receptor binding motive for interacting with ACE2 receptors.
SARS-CoV slows down K479N and S487T mutatis mutandis in its RBD, which may increase protein interaction with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be very important to adapt the virus to humans.
It must be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The significant 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in unit S1 protein S implies protein binding afinity S to ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, a study of cryo-EM shows the aphinity of ACE2 human and S SARS-CoV-2 10 to 20 times higher than that of ACE2 human and S SARS-CoV protein.
What's also important to know is if there's another co-receptor that might be needed to transmit SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also associated with ACE2, but with different parts of S.
There are many other HCOV receptors, such as aminoopeptidase N for HCV-229E and 9-O-terasetyl acid for HCV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the ability to adapt this CV to humans after transmission of inter-species from its animal nest.
In addition to cell receptors, the results of the end of HCoV inter-species transmission are also arranged by the underlying factors and other parental endpoints.
The difference between human protein and natural reserve salts, such as nasals, abrasives, and fertilization animals, can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoV must take into account the inhalation factor and the decommissioning factor in order to succeed in the transmission of inter-species.
In this case, the molecular insights in the field of interaction of these important viruses should still be identified and disseminated.
The entire passage through the unusual to see the underlying factor and the fine cut-off of SARS-CoV-2 using the most advanced CRISPR technology may be useful.
New HCoV angle: return to the start of the range
CoV's suspicion gave us a great opportunity to develop a new HCoV.
In this case, the coV is working as an HCoV gene loop.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also stimulate HCV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the ability to develop or lose new proteins can dramatically modify the phenotype of virus.
Among SARS-CoV axesori proteins, ORF8 is expected to play an important role in human adaptation because of the virus in which the SARS-CoV family virus is isolated found in the ORF8 protein levels.
SARS-CoV with a special score of 29 nucleotide was found on the beach that was isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This conclusion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is expected to be an adaptation mutatis mutatis mutandis that supports the smell.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with the line of alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV, with a large number of smaller recombination areas identified in RNA polymerase based on RNA.
Recombination sites are also identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and some nsp14.
In the same way, the recombination event between the various lines of birth was shown to occur at the MERS-CoV epidemic, which took place in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the reconnaissance event has also been observed in other HCoV places where HCoV has experienced recombination with other coV animals in its non-structural gene.
It should also be cautioned that action selection can play a role in unwarranted changes through the viral, potentially caused by the release of the virus from the selective pressure that has occurred, such as by the immune system.
The example of this effect is the loss of ORF4 full of HCoV-229E prototype strain due to the end of two nucleotides.
While the ORF4 can be observed in the vertebral virus and in contact with HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV alpaca shows a single nucleotide reaction that causes the range movement.
Finally, the new HCoV evolution was also driven by the select pressure on the top of its reserve.
Low or non-detectable thresholds are detected during the coV infection cycle, which shows the adaptability between the coV and the environment.
It seems that the universe adapts well to the CoV in anatomically and physiological manner.
For example, failure of the proinflammase vaccine on the stomach would effectively lower the pathology of the coV.
In addition, natural killer cell activity on the neck was forced by the regulation of the NKG2/CD94 killer cell receptors and the degree of molecular expression of the complex Histocompatibility Main Class I sub-class I complex.
In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen (ROS) species from high metabolic activity can suppress the replication of CV and influence the replication by exoribonuclese to give selective pressure to the production of highly pathogenic virus strains when entering the new nodes.
More pathogenic coV strain may also develop through recombination, which can cause protein perpetration or new protein filtration to adapt the angle.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that the new three HCOVs have appeared in the last two civilizations.
CoV is non-patogenic or causes light yellow in its reserve ring, such as snow and snow.
CoV is strictly applied without causing a strong immune response.
The secret here is that there are innocent carriers and the cause of serious human infection.
The severity is particularly severe because of the increased immune response rate and the presence of sitokin, with increased lung damage if the immune response is stronger.
On the contrary, on the counter, the immune response has disappeared from the coV replication.
The same strategy to resolve immune response may be useful in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The response of the interferon is particularly strong on the horizon.
Therefore, type I interferon delivery, at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, NLRP3-inflammation-inflammation ratios are defective.
For this reason, inflammation of NLRP3 with MCC950 may be beneficial in the COVID-19 regimen.
The SARS-CoV-2 community followed the general warning of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While beta-CoV is a 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is a 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although fresh and other animals on that market were found to carry an identical virus with SARS-CoV, the direct link between SARS-CoV-2 has not been found.
Beta-CoV trangling that is very homologous with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, indicating that trangling may play as one of the inter-partial or beta-CoV trangling may contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although still questioned, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 has been done well in whole or in part.
CoV has become the focus of the new SARS-CoV-2 release.
CoV studies in the wild and other animals have greatly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and the conservation of animals for HCV in human transmission.
A lot of evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are from the ground floor and transmitted to humans through the middle.
Remembering that SARS-CoV infection comes from human contact and slowing down on the verbal market, perhaps the closing of the oral market and the killing of all breast cancers that effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, mergers should be transferred from the labor market to prevent zoonotic transmission, recall the discovery of several lines of beta-CoV bonding closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the truth and the SARS-CoV-2 mechanism are transmitted to humans through radiation and other matter still needs to be identified in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the Arabic line for a long time.
It works as an important transport tool as well as as as as the main sources for meat, milk, skin, and wool products for local society.
The Arab is widely spread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
As a result, we cannot kill all the snakes to control the Mers, as was done in the wild animal market in Tiongkok to prevent the preaching of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the MIRS infection, consensual exposure must be made to develop vaccines for effective bone marrow against MIRS-CoV and combined with other infection control measures.
Before we can eliminate this virus, new genotypes can appear and cause inflammation.
It's different from the coV zone in the wild.
In particular, the zoonotic giant coV is very complex.
There are many possibilities for this zoonotic CV to revolutionize and experience recombination, which leads to the emergence of a new CV that is easier to transmit and/or more to humans in the future.
The culture of feeding wild animals in some parts of Tingkok has to be abandoned in order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the experiences of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparation and preparation should be put in place.
In fact, many viruses have been found on this planet since then.
These viruses are in the general reserve until there is an opportunity to preach.
Despite the many factors that have contributed to the spread of the virus, humans have had the opportunity to fight wild animals and other wild species.
Further surveillance of mammals needs to be done to better understand the environment of the CoV and its natural ring, which will prove useful in preventing the transmission of animals and the coming media.
As a conclusion, the most effective way to prevent zoonoses of the virus is that humans must keep away from the deep ecological reserves of the natural zoonotic virus.
Some parts of the original zoonoses have not been found from SARS-CoV-2.
First, if the virus transmits the SARS-CoV-2 virus to the radiation, the condition when the radiation and the convulsions are shared into the environment is important to be known.
Second, if we have a more direct role to play in the transmission of human life, how we deal with it must be determined.
Third, if there is a third mother who plays a role as the most important part, how she interacts with other species, including humans, the human race, and the interconnection must be explained.
Finally, because of many mammals, including potentially resistant to SARS-CoV-2, good testing and surveillance infections should be done.
I don't know whether it's an accident, crashing, or other mammal, it's expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its almost identical native virus can be identified in its natural beginnings in the future.
Further research in this field will expand the evolutionary SARS-CoV-2 path in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
A comparison of the diagnostic criteria "debt case" and "confirmed case" COVID-19 must be performed
On February 6, 2020, our team published quick advice for diagnosis and plans for new Coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV). This prison is based on our experience and is a good reference to combating pandemics worldwide.
However, the 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, our maturity and knowledge are increasing on the basis of ongoing research findings and clinical practice; therefore, the diagnosis and planning strategy is also constantly being revised.
In this letter, we responded to one comment on our advice and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "sustained cases" and "confirmed cases" based on the Diagnosis and Designation of the COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Committee of the Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) has become public, which is now formally referred to as Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus is called Coronavirus acute care syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed quick advice and this advice has been published in the Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
That article has highlighted one way to make that possible.
However, it needs to be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our maturity and knowledge are increasing on the basis of ongoing research and clinical practice; therefore, the diagnosis and intentional strategies are also constantly being developed.
As an example of the Diagnosis and Designation for COVID-19 issued by the National Committee of Republikas Rakyat Tiongkok (http://www.hhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, the Commission has issued a total of seven editions with some contexts changed quite a lot.
Our team received a comment from Zhou et al., they identified the offer of a simple score based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds fresh evidence of our success and of our appreciation for the worldwide brotherhood.
We support the work that they do, and we express our gratitude for their efforts.
However, the results of their work also require an addition based on Diagnoses and Designs for the latest COVID-19 (version seven trial) and the latest study.
On the basis of the seventh edition (3 March 2020), in order to confirm the suspected case, a combination of one epidemiologis rivet is required with two clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or three clinical manifestations are required if there is no clear epidemiologis rivet:
Epidemiologists: (1) travel or stay in Wuhan City and its surrounding area, or other communities where the COVID-19 case was reported in the last 14 days before the crash; (2) contact visits with SARS-CoV-2 cases (with positive nuclear tests); (3) contact visits with patients who have been suffering from dementia or infection in Wuhan and its surrounding area, or other communities of COVID-19 cases have been reported within the last 14 days prior to the accident; (4) confirmation of contact with the case cluster (â‰¥ 2 cases with dengues and/or armages occurring within 2 weeks in the small area, such as home, office, school, etc.).
Clinical manifesto: (1) dementia and/or nasal fever; (2) COVID-19 infection titres; (3) total white blood cell counts indicate normal lymphocytes, declines, or decreases at baseline levels.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with one of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) a real-time positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a complete sequence of viruses showing high homogenity for a new known coronary virus; (3) positive for specific IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or changes in the specific IgG-SARS-CoV-2 antibiotic from negative is positive, or titres increase â‰¥4 litres at the above stage of recovery at the acute phase.
We can see that a real-time PCR test of nuclear assay in the model of a suit or blood count is added to the second edition (18 January 2020) and third (January 22, 2020).
The pathogenic detection of blood samples was added to the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020); then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
This modification is based on further research by researchers to search for optimal nuclear asterisk kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples of the respiratory system including blood transfusions, which increase the availability of various species, and support the production of certain positive antibiotics in the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is increased light on what we can learn from the Bible, which helps us to keep our senses completely.
That's why the Zhou et al. has to be released because they classify people without clinical care as "low risk".
In the future, the score system will need to be refined in practice and clinical studies.
Finally, we looked forward to the day when we would see proof that the speaker was coming and that we had called on the audience to comment.
For the diagnosis of "sustained case" and "confirmed case", we are advised to follow and follow the latest advice in each country.
Our team will also regularly offer suggestions on how to do so.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest daily deaths
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in one day due to the virus.
Until yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IDECR), Bangladesh, reported on the number of cases of infections recorded in 114 active cases and 33 domestic health cases.
Totally 17 deaths.
In an editorial, the director of the IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that death involved four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases are over 60 years old, two cases between 51 and 60 years old, and one cases between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said two victims came from Dhaka.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
A hospital officer told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was the Saifur Rahman Road, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was cared for at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in a video release, the Minister for Road and Coastal Transport, Obaidul Quader said that public transport would be stopped longer than planned, until the Saturday came.
This public transport campaign began on March 26th and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of wood needs -- medicine, fuel, and food -- is still allowed.
The first incidence of COVID-19 infection reported in Bangladesh was on March 8th, on two newly returned from Italy and also on the wife of one of them.
On March 19, those three men were dead.
SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeds one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronary infection is more than one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 thousand deaths are associated with COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronary virus.
The plan took place on the same day that Malawi confirmed the infection of the first Korean virus and Zambia experienced its first death of the Korean virus.
North Korea complained, on the day of Kamis, that the country was one of the few countries that remained free from the infection of the Korean virus.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours since 10 morning European Central Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States (AS), there are more than 244 thousand cases of coronary virus, affecting at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News Agency reports that, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, more than 1,000 deaths in the US have been caused by coronary virus infection.
Throughout the world, the nations have announced a stronger response to the spread of disease.
On Kamis day, Sergei Sobianin, Moscowâ€™s capital, extended his circuit to May 1.
According to Nationally, President Vladimir Putin said Russian citizens would remain paid without having to go to work until 30 April.
The Portuguese parliament held a vote to extend the status of the national parliament for 15 days; the vote was slow with 215 votes supported, ten abstentions, and one vote refused.
Saudi Arabia extended the nightâ€™s stay in the holy cities of Mecca and Midian all day long; before that, the night was just between 3 oâ€™clock in the morning and 6 oâ€™clock in the morning.
Thailand plans to spend the night between 10 a.m. and 4 a.m.
Governor Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the country had extended its residence order until May 1.
Toko-toko in Australia lowers the cost of selling the toilet by transaction
On Sunday and Saturday evening, the Australia Woolworth and Coles networks each down to two and a half times a transaction at all stores at national level.
GODâ€™S WORD also applies to certain aspects of the Lordâ€™s Evening Meal.
This restriction has been announced as a message on the Internet and on the Facebook page.
The buyer reported making preparations because of the fear of COVID-19 when society needs to make a stand-alone isolation.
On Rapu, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet toilets for delivery to the house to one lady at a time.
This change followed the closure of four bosses per transaction that were previously set up by Woolworths and Coles each on 4 and 5 March.
In his press release on March 8th, Coles reported that with the four officers' rapist, "many stores have been lost in one hour since the delivery", and referred to the request "before it happened", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Saturday, called it "unexpected".
The sale of "increasing" last week, according to one of the Woolworths talks.
Toko Costco in Canberra also limits the number allowed up to two weeks ago.
In order to avoid corruption, Cole ordered larger meals from the cook and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered additional preparations, while ALDI made preparations for the special Arab promotion activity that was originally prepared.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Peritel Association, said that the peritel tried to improve the preparation, but the limitation of local government bodies for the time truck delivery made it difficult.
He pioneered the production fee, while the farmer tried to meet the demand, and a little more special promotion.
On Saturday, the Lord announced that since the preparations had been made earlier, some shops could not hold special rabbis.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, director of the Queensland University of Technology, said that the store filled the preparations every night.
He stressed that the toilet tissue was a large volume of stuff so that the number of preparations was low and, if sold, made many empty rooms in the pans so that the mess was getting worse.
Coles and Woolworths are [that] if there's a lot of stuff in the rag, if products like toilet and toilets can be bought and there's a lot of money, maybe it can be redeemed, Russell Zimmerman's source through the U.S. News Office.
The product of the toilet towel for the Who Gives a Crap said on the other day that they were missing preparations.
Kimberly-Clark, who made the Kleneex Toilet Tisu, and Solaris Paper, who made Sorbent, forced them to work 24/7 to take care of the crew, according to News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real state site, reports that some owners offer free toilet tickets to the first loser in Melbourne, when a little bit of mud was created because the buyer took the jeans for the last day's rest.
The NT News edition, one day published in Darwin, listed eight aspects of the vowel to be broken and used as a toilet.
Toko-toko actually refused to apply restrictions, according to the Australian ABC report on 3 March, they said they didn't intend to apply the purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, handicrafts, raw foods, handcuffs, and sedatives.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday evenings a supermarket in England and the Ocado was estimated to limit the sale of two dozen Andreâ€™s tortoises.
World Health Organization (WHO) says COVID-19 as a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported a COVID-19 release that is happeningâ€”a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirusâ€”as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemi" is only concocted to the extent that disease has spread, it is not as dangerous as the case, WHO writes that it needs to motivate the government to act:
All countries are still able to change this pandemic.
If the state of destination, testing, handling, isolation, and mobilization of its people as a response, then Tedros Adhanom Ghereyesus, Director General WHO, is investigating it.
We are well aware of the extent of our preaching activity and the extent to which we are concerned, and the extent to which we are concerned.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic "has never happened before."
He said, in a report published by CNN in February, "except influenza, there is no virus that has ever been followed from its presence to its continued global preaching."
Ghebreyes expressed a similar view, saying, "We've never seen a pandemic that was infected by the coronavirus."
He goes on, "and we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new state of the pandemic followed a WHO decision in January that stated this statement as a global public health crisis.
Director National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease in the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, says about this plague, "in essence, this plague will get worse."
To Kimis, Associated Press reported at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, affecting more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is the 2019 Coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) that is ongoing and caused by the Coronavirus acute infection syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Published in Wuhan, Tiongkok, December 2019; now known as the World Health Organization, on January 30, 2020; and Awake!
By 10 April 2020, some 1,61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, which have caused about 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 people were healed.
The number of fatalities is estimated to be 4% in Tiongkok, while the whole world is affected from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
The general eye is covered with teeth, legs, and almost breath.
Compliments can include pneumonia and syndrome beyond acute breath.
From the time of birth to the birth of the baby, it may take about five days, but it can affect from two to four days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral therapy.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive action involves washing your hands, closing your mouth when you hit, keeping away from others, and controlling your isolation for those who are expected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by making restrictions on travel, quarantine, at night hours, on the risk of workplace dangers, and on the closure of facilities.
This trend has led to serious social unrest, social exclusion or exclusion of cultural, political, economic, social, and social activities, as well as widespread corruption of goods that are spread by panic.
Schools and universities have been well established at national and local levels in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the students â€™ population worldwide.
Information about this virus has spread abroad, and there are xenophobic and discrimination against the Tionghoa people, with the heritage and appearances of East and South Asia, and from areas with significant virus cases.
As a result, traffic and heavy industrial closures, air pollution, and carbon emissions fell.
The health authority in Wuhan, Tiongkok (Hubei premixture book), reports the pneumonia cluster for unknown reasons on December 31, 2019 and the investigation was carried out early in January 2020.
These cases are mostly related to the Great Sea Food Market and therefore the virus is supposed to have zoonotic origins.
The virus that causes the spread is called SARS-CoV-2, the new virus that has been detected and is in conflict with the colonavirus in the wild, the coronavirus in contact, and the SARS-CoV. The first with the disease was discovered on 1 December 2019, and the latter did not have a clear relationship with the language market class mentioned later.
In the first case cluster reported in December 2019, two thirds of them were found connected to the market.
On 13 March 2020, a report not yet verified from South China Morning Post suggests that a case that could be reviewed on 17 November 2019, at a 55-year-old in the province of Hubei, is probably the first one. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, with a new case being reported in Tingkok, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside Tingkok has exceeded the number of new cases in Tingkok for the first time.
There may be a number of unreported cases, especially among people with relatively few exceptions.
Up to 26 February, relatively few cases reported among young people, with 19-year-olds below 2.4% of cases worldwide. The head of British scientific adviser Patrick Vallance, estimates that 60% of the English population need infection before group survival can be achieved.
The case was based on the number of people tested by COVID-19 and the results of the trial were confirmed positive according to the official protocol.
By March 23, more than 3% of the population had been tested, and many countries have made official observations not to try people with disabilities, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in Tiongkok, up to 23 January, 86% of COVID-19 infections were not identified, and that undocumented infection was a source of infection for 79% of cases documented.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March suggests that the number of infections in Italy is considered to be greater than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of the baseline number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the number is likely to be 5.7.
Most of the COVID-19 pain is healed.
For those who do not recover, the period from an increase of 6 to 41 days, with a maximum of 14 days.
Since April 10, 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19.
In Tingkok, up to 5 February, about 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75% had previous health problems, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official deaths resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic are generally detrimental to people who have been tested for COVID according to the official protocol.
The actual fatality rate resulting from COVID-19 may be much higher, remembering the official number of possible deaths without testing, for example, at home, at the hospital, dsb.
The partial data from Italy found that the number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official death benefit of COVID with a 4-5-fold factor.
A female spokesman for the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted, "We know [the number of deaths reported] is lower than the actual number", a statement reinforced by an unknown report on the U.S. deficits. The lowest rates often occur in pandemics, such as the flu epidemic of H1N1 in 2009. The first confirmed death was on January 9, 2020.
The first of these cases occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first of these was in France on February 14.
Until 28 February, outside Tiongkok village, more than each death cell was recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
Until 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories reported deaths, in each village, except Antarctica, and in general some of the victims were used to count deaths.
This number varies according to the region and often, and is influenced by the number of tests, quality of health care systems, options of nutrition, time from the first stage, and the character of the population such as age, type of medicine, and overall health. The ratio of deaths to the case represents the number of deaths shared by terdiagnos cases within a specified time range.
According to statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the death rate worldwide is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) for 10 April 2020.
This number varies according to region.
In Tingkok, the risk of death from 17.3% (for people with disabilities 1-10 January 2020) is 0.7% (for people with disabilities after 1 February 2020). Other complaints include the number of fatalities (CFRs), which represents the percentage of people with terragonosis who died from certain diseases, and the number of patients with IFRs, which represents the percentage of those with terragonosis (terdiagnos and non-terragnoses) who died from certain diseases.
This statistics are not limited to time and follow a certain population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to count these figures for certain populations.
Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford increases the number of fatalities for pandemics in total between 0.1% and 0.33%.
The pressure on this line of thought goes along with the results of the first test for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical survey that analyzes the findings of the CFR opinion.
WHO insists that this pandemic can be controlled.
The point and the end of this sentence are unclear and may vary from place to place.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University says, "Without any control, the spread is usually near and then begins to fall when the disease is gone.
But it's almost impossible to make a project that makes sense now about when that happens."
Senior medical adviser Tiongkok zhong Nanshan believes that "this campaign may end June" if the entire country can be mobilized to follow WHO advice on steps to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17th, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine said that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to leave, possibly up to a year or two."
According to the Imperial College research conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical and other steps will be required "until the vaccine is available (maybe 18 months or more).
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it's a small possibility that this coronavirus, because it's very easy to transmit, can eliminate all of it" and this disease "may change into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
The vulnerability of abstinence will depend on the ability of a group and mutatis mutatis mutandis.
The COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and the infected person can be unaccompanied.
Two common colds are dementia (88%) and cold stones (68%).
The most common side effects include fatigue, the production of spouts (flegma), loss of breathing, breathing problems, stomach and bone pain, headaches, headaches, nausea, vomiting, hemops, diarrhoea, or synosis. WHO says that about one in six people have a severe illness and have breathing problems.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) U.S.A. recommends increased risk of respiratory problems, seizures or pain in the liver, swelling of the liver, difficulty walking, and swelling in the face and lips; medical attention is immediately advised if these events occur. Further disease progression can be harmful pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, septic cancer, and death.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, i.e. without clinical examinations, but with the results of tests confirming infection, therefore, researchers suggest that those close to the infected should be tested and tested to ensure that they are not infected.
Tinghoa estimates that asymptomatic races affect from a few to 44%.
Incubation period (when between infection and pregnancy) usually affects between 1 to 14 days, most often 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the number of COVID-19 sufferers who lost their first 30% appetite and then fell to 15%.
The information covered in this brochure may not apply fully to your situation because of tax laws or other laws in your country.
The COVID-19 message is believed primarily to occur at close contact time and through small droplets produced during stone, gas, or conversation; the contact is contact within a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
The study found that uncovered stones could cause droplets up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some researchers suggest that the virus may also be transmitted by small droplets that are longer sustained in the air and produced when speaking. The droplets can also be produced when breathing, including when speaking, even though this virus is not usually transmitted through the air.
Droplett can fall into the mouth or lips of a person who is near it or may be living in the woods.
Some medical procedures, such as intubs and heart disease (RJP), can make the secret of the equipment change into aerosol and spread through the air.
Preaching can also happen when someone is affected by the condition of a person, including his skin, and when he is affected by eye, nose, and mouth.
Although there is concern that the virus can spread through the feses, this risk is low.
The Tiongkok government has rejected the possibility of sending SARS-CoV-2 effectively.The virus most spreads within the first three days after the accident, although the preaching may occur before the accident and at the next level of disease.
A positive test was performed until three days before the event, which marked the event, or the event, was likely preceded by a significant event.
Only a few reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed by the laboratory, but asymptotic seizures have been identified by some countries during the study of contact checks.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not yet fully clear how easily this disease spreads, one person in general infected two or three people.
In particular, it has been found that the virus can be detected for up to three days on plastics (polypropylene) and a 304 cardboard strip, one day on the cardboard, and more than four hours on the cigarette.
However, this variation depends on temperature and temperature, and the animals and other animals have been tested positive COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can spread the virus to humans, although the British authorities suggest that they wash their hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with a surface that may have been infected by infected people.
Coronavirus acute infection syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three pneumonia patients associated with the acute infectious disease cluster in Wuhan.
All newly infected SARS-CoV-2 virus is related to the coronavirus in nature. In humans, this virus can be destroyed if it has a host cell, which has an amplifier amplifier. SARS-CoV-2 is closely associated with SARS-CoV initially.
The virus is supposed to have a zoonosic origin.
Genetic analysis reveals that coronavirus is genetically classified with Betacoronavirus gene, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (generation B line) with two genera.
This virus has 96% of the total level through the other coronavirus samples (BatCov RatG13).
In February 2020, a Tionghoa researcher found that there is only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the sequence between the linking virus and the human virus.
So far, the overall comparison by finding the largest of 92% of the genetic balance between connective coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, is not enough to prove that interconnection is the angle between SARS-CoV-2.
The virus infection can be diagnosed temporarily on the basis of pregnancy, but confirmation was finally made through reverse polymerase transcription (rRT-PCR) response to the infected secret or through CT titration.
A study that compares PCR to CT in Wuhan shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but is less specific, with a lot of pneumonia-related screening pills and other disease-related processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT cannot be used for writing or as the first line test in diagnosis of COVID-19."
WHO has issued some RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which was first released on January 17th.
Test using a linear reaction of polymerase transcription back real-time (rRT-PCR).
A test can be performed on the basis of a sample of red or red blood cells.
The results are generally available within a few hours and several days.
In general, this test is performed on the nasopharyngal system, but it is also useful for a number of laboratories and companies to develop a serological test that detects antibodies.
On April 6, 2020, none of these serological tests proved to be sufficiently accurate to accept its wide use.
In the U.S., the serological tests developed by Cellex have been approved for the use of rats, only by certified laboratories.
The characteristics of the radiography and tomography are computerized (CT) in a person with a symmetrical opiate basis glass peripheral asymmetry and no effusion of pleura.
The Italian Radiological Society is drawing up an international database of data sources for the findings in the confirmed case.
Because of the outbreak of other infections such as adenovirus, screening without PCR confirmation has limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A major study in Tingkok compared the results of CT DNA to PCR and showed that despite the lack of specifics for infection, titration is faster and more sensitive so that it is recommended to be considered as an epidemiological device.
The network of neuronal converges based on scientific wisdom has been developed to detect the virus screening features with radiographics and CT.
The strategy to prevent the spread of this disease includes keeping a good personal hygiene clearly understood, washing hands, avoiding eye contact, noses, or mouth before washing hands, and using bone when lying or drying and immediately removing the hair to a garbage dump.
Those who may already have infected are advised to wear a mask in public places.
The authorities in various regions have restricted or suspended all non-essential journeys to and from the country and the most visited areas.
However, in most parts of the world, it has reached the level of public witnessing.
This means that the virus has spread to the public, and some members of the community do not know where or how they are infected. Health care is recommended to treat people who may be infected to perform standard prevention, contact prevention, and eye protection actions. Contact planning is an important step for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further infection.
The use of local telephone data by the government for this purpose has created a problem of privacy, with statements from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations that include this type of surveillance.
Various applications have been implemented or recommended for voluntary use, and on April 7, 2020, more than a group of experts have worked out a private network solution, such as using Bluetooth to record a long-term approach to other phones.
Next, the user will receive a message if they are close to someone who is positive for the COVID-19.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to improve it.
Washing hands is encouraged to avoid getting sick.
CDC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least two decades, especially after toilets or when their hands are exposed to dirt; before eating; and after washing their teeth, stones, or soap.
This disorder is because, outside of the human body, the virus is killed by a married couple who damages their protection.
Further, CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand milling with less than 60% alcohol content based on volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO recommends that people not touch their eyes, noses, or mouth before they wash their hands.
The surface can be decontaminated using a number of pipes (in one minute infected for the surface surface of the karate), including ethanol 62-71%, isopropanol 50-100%, hypochlorite sodium 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and povidone-iodine 0.2-7.5%.
Other side effects, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that if COVID cases are suspected or confirmed in the general facility, such as office or child care facility, all areas such as office, bathroom, public area, electronic devices, such as tablet, touchboard, keyboard, remote control, and ATM devices used by the sufferer should be infected.
Health organizations recommend that people close their mouth and teeth with a stench that is pressed or used as a stench or a swirling swirl or swirl or swirl.
The mask is highly recommended for those who may have been infected because the mask can limit the volume and duration of the ventriloquist droplets that are exposed to speech, smell, and rock.
WHO has issued instructions on time and manner of wear.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "The use of masks can reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces with insufficient clean hands, which is the main source of cure."
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who take care of COVID-19, although WHO also admits that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have begun to promote the use of masks to members of society.
In the U.S., CDC recommends the use of nomedital masks made of leather. The use of medical masks specifically recommended once used to healthy society, especially when approaching (1 m (3 ft) or less with others.
Hong Kong recommends wearing masks while using public clothing or living in many places.
The Thai health agency encouraged people to make bread at home and to clean it up every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned public access to public places without wearing masks or covering their teeth and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam invited all its citizens to wear masks when they went to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government forced everyone to enter the convent to wear a mask.
Israel urged all its inhabitants to use the mask when they were in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks per day since the middle of March, has been responsible for the firefighting and the antiquated bus wearing masks for April 1.
Panama is responsible for the use of facial masks every time it comes to home, as well as recommending their own facial masks for those who are unable to buy face masks.
Face masks were also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social exclusion (also referred to as physical restraint) is an infection control action designed to slow the spread of disease by making close contact between individuals.
Social networking involves cartoons; travel; and school conclusions, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.
People can use social networking methods to live at home, limit their travel, avoid public places, use public transportation, and avoid contact with people.
At present, many governments have imposed bans and restrictions on social networking.
The majority of the people gathered, recommended by the U.S. government bodies and health organizations, started from 250 people (if there are no COVID-19 messages in a region) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany prohibited meetings in public areas involving more than two people. Lancia and people with medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and high-risk immune systems that had serious diseases and complications that could be recommended by the CDC only in the public domain that were present at public level. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term "social exclusion" as "physical exclusion", to explain that it was intended to reduce physical contact by maintaining social relations, either virtually or from a distance away.
The use of the term "social exclusion" has the effect that people should fully isolate themselves from society and not force people to remain in contact with others by alternative means.
This recommendation includes an engagement to sexual relations only with people who live with you and do not have a virus or virus disease.
Isolation is found at home recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who are expected to be infected.
The health authorities have issued detailed instructions for the proper state of affairs, and many governments have been responsible for or recommending their quarantines for the entire population in the affected region.
Carantine's instructions stand out for those involved in high-risk groups.
The most likely victims of COVID-19 and the new ones are going to the country or region with COVID-19, which is widely recommended to do their quarantine for 14 days from the time of their last appearance.
The strategy in public control is protection or surprise, as well as migrating.
Protection is done at the early stage and aims to track and isolate infected people and take other steps to control infections and vaccinations aimed at stopping the spread of disease to the whole population.
When it is no longer possible to protect the spread of disease, the next effort is to change to a mitigating level: these steps are taken to slow down the preaching and reduce its visibility on the health and public care system.
A combination of protective and mitigating actions can be done at the same time.
Suprei needs more extreme steps to turn the pandemic into a reduction in the number of basic reproductions to less than 1 part of the spread of infectious diseases is efforts to lower the epidemial peaks, known as the coverage of the epidemic curve.
This poses a serious risk to health services and provides more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions to deal with the public's prevention activities, such as hand cleaning, facial masks, and quarantines; community-level steps aimed at physical exclusion, such as closing schools and canceling public meetings; community involvement to stimulate acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental steps, such as cleaning of the environment. Other drastic actions aimed at protecting the public are carried out in Tingkok when public corruption is more real, such as the whole of the city and the taking of strict travel bans.
Other countries also take various measures aimed at restricting the spread of virus.
South Korea is known for its abundant resources and quarantine, as well as for its alertness about the movement of infected people.
Apologize for the financial support of those who have been infected with carantine alone and who have been unable to do so have caused great pain.
Taiwan improves the production of face masks and condemns medical preparation. Simulations for England and the United States show that mitigating (slows, but does not stop the preaching of the epidemic) and suppressing the growth of the epidemic have major challenges.
Optimised mitigating aging may reduce the demand for health care to 2/3 and death to half, but it still affects hundreds of thousands of deaths and severe health systems.
Suprei can be selected, but it must be maintained during the virus still spread in the human population (or until the vaccine is available, if this is first reached), because if not, it will slow back as soon as the suspension steps are released.
Long-term interventions to pressure the pandemic bring attention to social and economic factors.
No specific antiviral medicine has yet been approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are being made, including existing drug testing.
Succumbing to drugs, alcohol, and recreation can help you to reduce anxiety.
Depending on the level of burnout, oxygen therapy, intravenous smoking, and maintenance support may be required.
The use of steroids can damage the patientâ€™s condition.
Some animals previously approved for other virus treatment are being patented for use in treating COVID-19.
WHO also said that some "traditional and domestic relations" could eliminate the scourge caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO says that improving capacity and adapting health services to the needs of COVID-19 patients is a basic step in the public response.
ECDC and the WHO regional office of Europe have issued openings for primary hospitals and health services to provide resources at various levels, including focusing on laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, allowing for the abolition of electoral procedures, sharing and insulation of COVID-19 positive patients, and improving the capacity of intensive care by training staff and increasing the number of ventilators and sleeping sites.
There are different theories about the origin of the first case (called nol patient).
The first known outbreak of a new coronary virus can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, Tiongkok.
Within a month, the number of cases of caronavirus in Hubei increased dramatically.

On 23 January, in response to the decisions of the central government applying the ban on transport in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea said that although the step was "explained not the WHO recommendation", it was also "a very important indicator for the scope of the epidemic in the most concentrated area" and he called it "never before in public health history". On 30 January, after confirmation of human dependence on people outside Tingkok and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO said it was the World Health Organization (PHEC), namely, the ninth PHEIC since the first phase of the 2009 outbreak of civil flu.
Director General WHO Tedros Adhanom said that PHIC is said to be because there is a "global risk of public preaching, especially in countries with low and middle-class challenges that have not yet had a forgiving health system.
Faced with the end of the journey, Tedros said that "there is no reason to take steps that interfere with international travel and trade unnecessaryly" and "the WHO does not recommend ending trade and movement."
On February 5th, WHO welcomed the global community to contribute $675 million that would be used to address strategic preparations in low-income countries, as well as to mention the urgency to support countries that "have no system to detect people who are infected with the virus if they fail."
Further, Tedros made a statement that "the strength we have on the ground is weakened" and urged the international community to "investment today or pay more in later days." At the press conference on 11 February, WHO identified COVID-19 as a disease name for this virus.

This virus may come to your place and you need to be ready," and stress that the right approach can help the world avoid "the worst."
Further, Ryan says that data now does not allow public health officials to report global pandemics, and he says that such a declaration means "that we basically accept that every person on this planet will be infected with that virus."
On March 11th, WHO identified the cancer virus as a pandemic.
Director General WHO says that WHO "is sensitive to the alarming level of preaching and isolation, as well as to the level of action that is alarming." WHO accepts criticism because it is considered inadequate to deal with pandemics, which includes delays in declaring public health standards and classifying virus as pandemics.

The group of experts said that each person has the right to intervene in the salvation of the soul and the government to take responsibility for this.
This group stresses that at least the lack of energy or health insurance cannot be used as a cure for discrimination against certain groups.
Experts argue that each individual has the right to health, including the disabled, the minority group, the laymen, the internal refugees, the tsunami, the people living in very poor conditions, the people in prison, the refugees, and other groups in need of government support.
The organization of the international government is trying to address the social and economic crisis COVID-19.

The Tiongkok government received criticism from the United States, the Prime Minister of the British Bureau of Raya Michael Gove, and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, on a campaign that took place in the province of Hubei, Tiongkok.
A number of the administrators of the Tiongkok Province Party (CPC) were prevented from connecting the quarantine effort in Central Tingkoh, which is a sign of failure to respond to the political community in dealing with the media in the region.
Some commentators believe that this step is intended to protect the Secretary-General of the Communist Party Tiongkok Xi Jinping from public anger related to the coronavirus.
Some Tiongkok officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected previous confessions of the coronavirus version that began in Wuhan, and supported the conspiracy theory on COVID-19 from the US or Italy.
The U.S. government Donald Trump referred to the coronavirus as "Tiongkok virus" or "Wuhan virus" and said that "Tiongkok's closing actions gave strength to the virus that is now changing into a global pandemic." This statement was finally criticized by a number of critics as racism and "rejecting its government's failure to handle the crown virus."
The Daily Beast receives a message from the U.S. government that sets out a communication strategy and clearly comes from the National Security Hall, with a strategy translated "All about Tiankok.
We are told to try and deliver this message in any way possible, including press and television conferences." Media such as Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg claims that Tiongkok's efforts to send help to countries affected by the virus are part of the propaganda campaign to affect the world.
U.S. Secretary of State Joseph Borrell warns that there is "a geo-political composition, which includes a struggle to gain influence through the conversion of the facts and the 'freedom policy'."
Borrell also says, "I'm aggressively promoting the message that, unlike the US, they're a responsible and reliable partner."
Tingkok also called for the United States to withdraw the sanctions against Syria, Venezuela, and Iran and to send aid to the last two countries.
Jack Ma's contribution was 100,000 masks for Cuba blocked by the US sanctions on April 3.
The U.S. government has also been charged with distributing aid to other countries in their own countries.
There are also linked masks reported between other countries, such as Germany, Austria, and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey took hundreds of Ventilators to Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian government criticized at least the European Union's solidarity with Italyâ€™s coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, the great Italian leader for the European Union, says that "He has Tiongkok who responds bilaterally.
Of course, this is not a good sign of European solidarity."
On March 22, after receiving a telephone call from the Italian Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin urged the Russian army to send military medical forces, specialized vehicles, and other medical devices to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous "high-level policy source" as saying that 80 percent of Russia's aid "is of no use or little benefit to Italy."
The source accused Russia of attacking the geopolitical and diplomatic character.
President Lombardy, Attiliio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio left the media report and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo ship to the United States for medical assistance.
The Kremlin speaker Dmitry Peskov says that "when you offer help to fellows in the United States, [Putin] assumes that if the U.S. device manufacturer and medical material gets an opportunity, they will also be able to pay if needed."
NATO military training "Defender 2020" planned in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic States, namely NATO's largest military training since the end of the Cold War, will be on a smaller scale.
The Secretary-General of the Nuclear Defense Campaign Kate Hudson criticised Defender 2020 training: "In the current public health crisis, this training not only endangers the lives of U.S. soldiers and many participating European countries, but also the citizens of the country where they operate."The Iranian government is seriously affected by this virus, with about two million members of parliament being infected with five political agents now or earlier.
On March 14, 2020, President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders to ask for help and said that his country was struggling to fight hunger because of lack of access to the international market as a result of US sanctions against Iran. It has moved the United States to adopt public social security in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child care, family payroll, and higher levels of education for public health.
Political analysts estimate that this could be a negative chance for Donald Trump to be re-elected in the presidential election of 2020. The diplomatic relationship between Japan and South Korea has deteriorated due to this trend.
South Korea criticises the "invasive and passive Japanese quarantine effort" after Japan announces that every person who comes from South Korea will be placed in the quarantine for two weeks at a government-based location.
At first, South Korea's public opinion is partly linked to President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed a petition, well combined with Moon's support, based on their allegations of government errors in dealing with the press, or praising their views.
Several commentators expressed concern that this could allow the government to strengthen its sovereignty over power.
In Hungary, his parliament chose to allow the Ministerial Guard, Victor OrbÃ¡n, to rule by decree without time, to suspend parliament and the general elections, and to punish those who were considered to be spreading false information about the virus and the planning of the crisis by the government.
Coronavirus vaccines are reported on cases of lack of oxygen, resulting from an increase in global use of equipment to combat fraud, procurement due to panic, and industrial and logistics disruptions.
The U.S. Agency for Medicinal Products and Food warns against drug shortages and medical devices by increasing the demand for consumer protection and prevention.
Some areas also experience procurement because panic attacks cause the need for wood, such as food, towels, and bottled water, which causes lack of fuel.
In particular, the technology industry has warned of the spread of electronic communications.
According to the director general WHO Tedros Adhanom, the demand for self-defense equipment has increased 100 times.
This request resulted in an increase of up to 20 times the normal price and an increase of four to six months of medical equipment.
This also causes a lack of self-defense equipment worldwide, and WHO warns that it will endanger health.
In Australia, the Pandemi offered new opportunities for buyers to sell Australian products in Tiongkok.
This activity has led to the decline of formulae in some supermarkets and has finally been banned by the Australian government. The COVID-19 case prevalence in northern Italy and Wuhan region, as well as the demand for food, both areas are protected from food shortages.
The steps of Tyongkok and Italy in combating trafficking and illicit trade in important products have been successful so that the shortage of food that can be digested in Europe and North America can be avoided.
It is Northern Italy, with its large agricultural production, has not yet experienced significant fertility, but prices can rise according to industry.
An empty food item was found only temporarily, even in Wuhan, where the Tingkok government officials often provided animalistic advice to ensure that public officials were available.
Similar attitudes also exist in Italy, which obliges food producers to keep advice for such emergency situations.
Global economic instability has been felt in Tingkok: According to a media report on 16 March, the economy in Tingkok was seriously affected in the first two months of 2020 by the actions taken by the government to stop the spread of the virus, and by 20.5% of retail sales.
Since Tingkok is a major economic centre and factor, the spread of the virus is considered to pose a major threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais from the Economist Intelligence Unit assumes that the market will continue to decline until there is a clearer picture of the potential of the end result.
In January 2020, some analysts suggested that seeing an economic downturn on global growth could go beyond SARS 2002-2004.
A professor at the University of Washington, St. Louis, U.S.A., said that the publication showed more than $300 billion on the worldâ€™s shores, which could last for two years.
The National Organisation of the Pegexport Earth (OPEC) is reported to be "cooked" after the ground oil price has been reduced due to a shortage of requests from Tiongkok.
On 24 February, the global market fell because of the significance of the number of COVID-19 cases outside Tiongkok land.
On 27 February, due to increased concern about the spread of coronavirus, various U.S. Saham indexes, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 Index, and Dow Jones Industrial Average, recorded births taken since 2008, with Dow 1,191 points, the birth of one day since the financial crisis 2007-2008.
Those three random indexes closed the week with more than 10% births.
On February 28, the Scope Ratings GmbH stressed the Tiongkok government credit chain, but it maintained Outlook Negative.
Half of the time, because of concerns about the coronavirus, the largest birth took place on March 16.
Many people think that economic reverses can happen.
The economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the step taken by the central bank and the state of the region at the right time.
The central bank reacts faster than they did during the 2008 monetary crisis.
Tourism is one of the most dangerous sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public places, and government actions that limit travel around the world.
As a result, many passengers canceled their flights because of their small request, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Kantas, while the British Flybe regional skiers fell.
Look at the services industry is on a scale that has never been seen before.
A number of railway stations and railway stations have also been closed.
The epidemic is similar to Chunyun, a major journey that is related to the New Yearâ€™s holiday.
A number of events involving many people were cancelled by central and district governments, including the annual New Imlek Festival, and secretaries were also actively closing shops and tourist sites, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many New Year's celebrations and tourist sites are closed to prevent mass meetings, including the Banned City in Beijing and traditional temple celebrations.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, towns, and districts of Tingkok, the authorities extended the New Yearâ€™s holiday to February 10 and ordered that most jobs be stopped until that date.
These areas represent 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong improves the prevention of communicable diseases and announces emergency situations, closes schools to Maret, and cancels New Year's celebrations. The railway sector is globally affected by a reduction in working hours or temporary closures.
Visits to emperors in Europe and Latin America have dropped by 40 percent.
North American and Middle East suffer from 50 to 60 per cent births.
This also affects 33-43% of the birth rate and the rate of walking to the center of the market in March is compared to February.
Business operators around the world are taking additional steps, such as the increase in sales, the demand for buyers, and the distribution of events. According to the opinion of the Economic Commission for the PBB for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic can cause people in extreme poverty in Latin America to increase between 14 and 22 million people compared with the situation without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the foot of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people in Tingkok lost their jobs.
In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government aid.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus can cause 47 million jobs in the United States and up to 32% growth rates. Carantine in India has caused tens of millions of migrant workers (paid through a day's pay). Surveys from the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households experienced similar loss of employment. Almost 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since it took place in the region on the mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers made temporary visits and 1 million British workers introduced a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany submitted short-term employment schemes to their official, Kurzber.
Germanyâ€™s short - term work schedule was set up in France and England.
Around the world, the art industry of exhibitions and cultural heritage has been greatly influenced by the pandemic, which affects organisations and individuals, both working and staying.
The arts and cultural organizations are trying to reach their mission (which is often publicized) to give cultural heritage to the public, to protect civil and public health, and to support the arts if they are allowed.
In March 2020, in all the world and at various levels, museums, museums, exhibitions, places of worship, and other cultural clubs were closed without time, with celebrations, events, and exhibitions cancelled or cancelled.
As a result, intensive efforts are being made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. The emergence of this new and rapidly growing disease is the distribution of security services, large sports events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences, as well as oral relations.
The film industry has also experienced controversy, declaring that the Christmas celebration in Rome, which fell in the last week of the Christian Passover, was abolished.
Many failures encourage the Christian community to stay at home and not attend Mass on Sunday; some churches provide church services via radio, direct TV or television, while others offer drive-in or follow-up worship.
By closing the church and the chapels of the Roman Catholic Church and bound up the Holy Peter Square by Christian historians, other agencies also canceled services and restricted public meetings in the church, Massids, churches, churches, temples, and tombs.
Iran's Health Report announces the violation of the Sabbath in the area of the plain and the places of worship then closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign citizens and its inhabitants into the sacred places in Mecca and Madinah.
This trend has contributed to much of the worldâ€™s sporting events since World War II.
Most major sports events are cancelled or cancelled, including the UEFA 2019-2020 League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, the UEFA Euro 2020, the NBA 2019-2020 season, and the NHL 2019-2020 season.
This publication destroyed the 2020 Olympics, which was originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "rewaled until after 2020, but will not be more than the 2021 summers."In the world, casinos and other places have been closed and live poker tournaments have been canceled or cancelled.
As a result, many deaf people move to deaf countries, and many deaf people report significant increases in the number of new arrivals, and entertainment industries have also been affected by various music groups, which cancels or cancels concerts.
Many large theaters, such as Broadway, also hosted all the shows.
Science explores various ways to continue to produce and share work via the Internet as an alternative to traditional performances, such as direct live music concerts or make a web-based "festival" for scientists to see, preach, and publish their work.
Many have found that using the Internet can be a source of harmful association with people who have become addicted to humor and who have become addicted to pornography.
Since its adoption of COVID-19, it has been noted that there have been discrimination, xenophobia, and racism against the people of Tinghoa and East Asia, as well as against people from the regions of Europe, the United States, and other countries.
The ideas of fear, suspicion, and hostility have been developed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Passific region.
A report from February (when the majority of the cases are still limited in Tiongkok) records racial sentiments expressed in various groups around the world that the Tinghoa people deserve to receive the virus or accept what they claim as a final reward.
Some African countries also experienced an increase in anti-Tiongkok's feelings.
Many Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination on their origins.
There has been support for the Tinghoa people, the wells and the holes, and for the people in the areas where the virus occurs.
Following public development in new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first European countries experienced serious COVID-19, could also be the cause of suspicion and xenophobicism. The war in the countries included Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed a petition to prevent Tinghoa from entering their country in an effort to stop disease.
In Japan, #ChineseDontComeTo Japan has become a train on Twitter.
The Tinghoa and other Asians in England and the United States reported an increase in racism and violence.
As President Donald Trump was criticized for calling the coronavirus "Tiongkok Virus", which critics call race and anti-Tiongkok.
In Ukraine, leaders thought they were attacking buses bringing Ukrainians and foreigners who were exiled from Wuhan to New Sanzhary.
A study from East India, bordered with Tiongkok, and studies in major cities of India have been reported to have been carried out in the area of Coronavirus.
The president of the Bharatiya Janata Party of the United States of West Ghosh said that Tingkok had destroyed the world and "that's why God punished them."
The statement was later threatened by the Tinongkok consular in Kolkata, calling it "the hero". In Tingkok, xenophobia and racism against non-Tionghoa people are covered by the pandemic, with foreigners being described as "foreign prostitutes" and intended for "destruction".
Many letters of appreciation have been passed on to the branch office by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon to the address shown on the coupon or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.
Many scientists, therefore, have concluded that the vast majority of scientists who have come to the conclusion that it is a product of an intelligent mind.
A few scientists have chosen to quickly share the results on a Pratachic server, such as bioRxiv.
New infectious diseases â€” New pathogen infections occur, often new in the range or method of spread.

The laboratory tests for the colonavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods to detect the virus's condition and antibodies produced in response to infection.
The state of the virus in the sample is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects RNA coronavirus.
This test is specific and designed to detect RNA virus SARS-CoV-2 alone.
This test was used to verify a new infection or still active.
Antibodies (serology) detection can be used for diagnosis and population surveillance.
The antibodies show the number of people who have been infected, including those who have been too weak to report or who have been unaccompanied.
The exact number of deaths and the severity of the population may be determined by this test.
Because of limited testing, until March 2020, no country has reliable data on the prevalence of virus in its population.
By March 23, there were no countries that tested more than 3% of their population, and there were major variations in the number of tests carried out in the countries.
This variable may also have a significant impact on the number of fatalities reported, which are likely to be high in some countries.
Using a linear reaction of real-time transcripse polymerase (rRT-PCR), this test can be performed in the sampling samples obtained using various methods, including the nasopharyngal or sputum samples.
The results usually last for hours until two days.
The RT-PCR test performed on the urticaria can only be based on the first week of the disease.
Then the virus can disappear in the throat as long as it continues to apply in the lungs.
As an alternative, for people tested in two weeks, sample material can be taken from the breathing system by using a catheter, or sputum, that can be used.
One of the initial PCR tests was developed in CharitÃ©, Berlin, in January 2020, using a real-time reverse polymerase transcriptic reaction (rRT-PCR), and forming at least 250,000 test tools for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
UK Raya also developed a test on January 23, 2020. South Korea's Kogenebiotech developed SARS-CoV-2-based PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus) based on a clinical evaluation tool on January 28, 2020.
This device searches for the gene "E" that has all the coronavirus betas, and the RdRp gene that is specific to SARS-CoV-2. In Tiongkok, BGI Group is one of the first companies to accept the use of prescriptions from the National Medicines Administration of Tiongkok for the SARS-CoV-2-based PCR detection tool. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes the RT-PCR Real-Time Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to the public health laboratory via the International Reagent Resource.
One of the three genetic tests in the old version test tools resulted in incredible results due to Reagen errors, and the number of trials in CDC in Atlanta is limited; this affects less than 100 rates per day during the process throughout February 2020.
It is considered impossible to rely on two components until February 28, 2020, and it is only after that that that the state laboratory and the local laboratory are authorized to carry out the tests.
This test was approved by the U.S. Medical and Food Agency based on the U.S. Commercial Laboratory began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced a COVID-19 test release based on RT-PCR at national level.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics conducted the COVID-19 test on 9 March 2020.
No quota limit has been declared; collection and freezing of the species must be done according to CDC conditions.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the VECTOR National Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology.
On 11 February 2020, this test was registered by the Federal Health Oversight Service. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to develop a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for tests that could be performed for 3.5 hours with high volume so that a machine could perform approximately 4.128 tests during 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an authorisation for the use of the U.S. plant to Abbott Laboratoryes for testing on the m2000 Abbott system; the FDA had previously issued the same authorisation as the Hological, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheit also received the U.S.A. from the FDA for a 45 - minute test.
The FDA has agreed to a test using an amplifier technology that is not a PCR.
Since no change in temperature cycle is required, this method can only produce positive results within five minutes and negative results within 13 minutes.
Currently there are about 18,000 of these machines in the US and Abbott precipitates to increase production to produce 50,000 daily tests. The test using monoclonal antibodies specifically attached to new nucleacapsid (N protein) coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, hoping to produce results within 15 to 20 minutes, such as rapid influenza tests.
A poll published in March 2020 concluded that "toraks photo has a small diagnostic value at an early stage, while the CT [computed tomography] encounters may already have existed before dawn."
The special win at CT includes ground-glass multilobar bilateral opiates with peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution.
Subpleura domineering, paving crashing, and consolidation are often the result of disease.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR with CT at the current pandamium source point shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although not specific, with many fetishing cirrhosis slows down with pneumonia and other diseases.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT cannot be used for writing or as the first line test in the diagnosis of COVID-19." In March 2020, CDC recommended PCR for initial writing.
Part of the immune response to infection is an antibiotic solution that includes IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infection in individuals for about 7 days after pregnancy, to determine immunity to disease, and in population surveillance. The test can be performed in the central laboratory (CLT) or with point-of-care (poCT).
The system automatically with high results in many clinical laboratories will be able to do this research, but the preparation will depend on the production level for each system.
For CLT, it is generally used as a peripheral blood speciation, although a fraction of the speciation can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCTs, generally one peripheral blood speculator is used by red blood cells.
Unlike the PCR method, no extra action is required prior to the investigation. On March 26, 2020, the FDA mentioned 29 associations providing information to the Agency as needed and therefore could now distribute their antibiotics tests.
On April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA based on the authorisation of the use of the vaccine. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epipe Diagnostics have agreed with Europe for their test tools that can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The potential for testing to a few hundred samples within a few hours is much faster than conventional PCR testing for RNA virus.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the outbreak of infection. In early April, England found that none of the antibiotics they bought were good enough to be used.
Hong Kong suggested a scheme so that the suspects could stay at home, "the department of care would give the patient a specific link," they went into it, sent it back, and obtained results some time later. The NHS England announced that NHS was pioneering a case test scheme in the home to eliminate the risk of the patient flying to the hospital or to infect an ambulance if used. In a random test for the case of COVID-19, a professional health force would take example using appropriate preventive measures.
On 2 March, the National Association of Statistics Health Insurance Germany said that Germany had a capacity of about 12,000 tests per day in street arrests and 10,700 tests had been performed in the previous week.
Money is charged by health insurance if the test is requested by the doctor.
According to President Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 samples per week.
On March 19, a test was performed in several large cities.
On March 26, 2020, the number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, overall, at least 483.295 samples have been tested and included in weeks 12/2020 and 33.491 samples (6.9%) positive effects for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital have developed and tested methods to test samples from 64 patients jointly, by combining samples and only further testing if samples are found positive. In the Wuhan, the laboratory detecting a maximum of 2,000 metres in depth called "Huo-Yan" (Mandarin language: fire, or "Fi Fire" in Indonesian language) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which could process more than 10,000 samples a day.
With its construction being guarded by BGI Wang Jian's founder and eating for 5 days, the modeling showed that the case in Hubei could be 47% higher and the payment related to quarantine purposes could be doubled if this test capacity did not exist.
Wuhan laboratory was immediately followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in total 12 cities throughout Tingkok.
On March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity is 50,000 samples per day. The open-source multiplex design by Origami Assays can test many 1.222 samples of patients for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. This balanced design can be performed in a small laboratory without the need for robotic radiation.
By March, the number of uncanny reactions had grown to include mass tests in the European Union, England, and the United States.
As a result, a number of researchers have tried to explore the sample advertising protocol that involves sampling at 98 Â°C (208 Â°F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA through further testing. On March 31, the Arab Empire reported that more coronavirus tests were performed by the capital of the population compared with any country, and were prepared to increase the test scale to reach most of the population.
This is achieved through a combination of random testing and laboratory purchases resulting in mass population estimates from Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Huo-Yan" detection laboratory in Tiongkok).
Built in 14 days, this laboratory is capable of doing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory to have this scale outside Tiongkok.
The various tests that highlight the various genetic profiles of Coronavirus were developed in Tiongkok, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization has approved Germany for the production of testing tools sent to countries with no resources to develop themselves.
Germany's reception was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Center for Disease Control was not prepared until January 28 to delay testing in the United States. At the beginning of the publication, Tingkok and the United States had problems with the reliability of test tools; both countries and Australia could not provide sufficient testing tools to meet the demands and recommendations of health experts.
Instead, experts say that the wide range of tests in South Korea helps to reduce the number of new coronary infections.
The test capacity, mostly in the secret sector labs, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16th, the World Health Organization included the development of the test programme as the best way to slow the COVID-19 pandemic growth. A high request for testing because the spread of the virus caused hundreds of thousands of tests to wait for work in the U.S. secret laboratory, and the preparation of tools and chemical reactions became essential.
In March 2020, Tiongkok reported on his test tools.
In the United States, a test tool developed by CDC has "damaged"; the government then removed bureaucracy barriers that prevented the test by secret. Spanish purchased testing tools from Tiongkok Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were not accurate.
The company explains that the wrong results may result from failure to collect samples or use test tools correctly.
The Spaniards said they would draw the resulting devices wrong, and replace them with other test tools provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test equipment purchased by the Czech Republic from Tingkok gave the wrong result. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test tools from Tingkok that were not actually accurate.
The Prime Minister Matovic recommended that this test device be removed to the Danube River. The Kara fire from the Turkish Health Service said that the test device bought by Turkey from Tiongkok had "high error rate" and they did not "use it". Ingris Raya bought 3.5 million test devices from Tiongkok, but at the beginning of April 2020, they announced that this test device could not be used.
The test, followed by the quarantine of positive people and the tracking of positive SARS-CoV-2 people, gave positive results.
Researchers working in the city of Vo Italia, the first death site due to COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two tests on the whole population of 3,400 people, with a length of about 10 days.
About half of the positive people don't have any jealousy, and all the cases found are quarantined.
With the end of the journey to this community, the infection was just as common.
With aggressive contact monitoring, entry closures, testing, and quarantines, the 2020 koronavirus pandemic in Singapore has grown much slower than other developing countries, despite extreme closures, such as the closure of restaurants and rival companies.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore urged residents to stay at home on 28 March, but schools were reopened shortly after the holiday on 23 March.
Some other countries also deal with pandemics with aggressive contact routes, exits, tests, and quarantines, but with less aggressive regions, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, had a much lower probability of fatalities, perhaps because these countries were more able to detect people with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no testing capacity, and the national laboratory with limited experience with COVID-19, send five positive samples COVID-19 and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO laboratories for confirmation tests.
Of the 16 labs, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following section, the column "%The positive test results" is influenced by the country's test experience.
A country that has only been tested in hospitals will have a higher percentage of positive results than a country that has tested all its citizens, whether they show jealousy or not, with the same other factors.
Washing hands, also mentioned by washing hands, is an act of cleansing someoneâ€™s hand to remove dirt, oil, microorganisms, or other undesirable substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently at certain "critical times" during the day prevents the preaching of many diseases, such as fever and cholera, reported through fecal-oral routes.
People can also be infected with infectious diseases, such as influenza or selesma, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, noses, or mouth (such as mucosa).
Five hours of criticism all day important to wash your hands with soap is: before and after a great waste of water, after cleaning your childâ€™s skin or changing your skin, before feeding your child, before eating and after preparing food or meat, fish, or vegetables.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with soap.
Before, when, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for sick people.
After changing the tires or cleaning the childâ€™s toilet.
After washing his teeth, stones, or gas.
After touching animals, eating meat, or touching animals.
Medical hygiene violates the principle of hygiene in connection with medical procedures.
Washing our hands before handling a drug or medical treatment can be harmful or can reduce our ability to preach.
The main medical purpose of washing hands is to clean hands from pathogens (bacterials, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for those who are caring for their health or who are working in the medical field, but it is also a matter of public policy.
Washing hands has many health benefits, including preventing influenza, coronary virus, and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious diseases; reducing food infections;
and reduce baby mortality at home.
A study in 2013 found that the increase in the number of children under the age of 25 could have contributed to a slight increase in the number of children under the age of 14.
In developing countries, the number of infant mortalitys resulting from infectious diseases and accidents can be compounded by identifying simple changes in behavior, such as the washing of hands with soap.
This simple action may reduce the mortality rate by up to 50%.
An intervention that encourages hand washing can reduce the incidence of cases that occur around it; it can be done by providing clean water in the area where it is exposed.
48% reduction in cases of cancer can be associated with toothache. Washing hands with soap is the only effective and easy way to prevent toothache and acute skin infection (ISPA), as a low-conscious behavior done at home, school, and society all over the world.
Pneumonia, which is the primary ISPA, is the cause of the death of one newspaper; it causes about 1.8 million deaths a year.
Diare and pneumonia cause nearly 3.5 million deaths each year.
According to UNICEF, making handcuffs with soap before eating and after using toilets as a clinging habit can save more lives than vaccines or any medical action, and reducing the effects of death to almost half and death as a result of acute infection.
Washing hands usually combined with other sanitization actions as part of the water, sanitation, and cleaning program (WASH).
Washing your hands also protects you from impetigo transmitted directly through physical contact.
The small side effects of drying hands are a commonly done hand washing that can cause skin damage because of skin weakness.
A study conducted in 2012 in Denmark found that washing hands more frequently could lead to catalytic and dry skin conditions, which are known as hand rash or hand dermatitis, which are particularly common among health officials.
Washing hands too often is also seen as one of the obsessive-compulsive (OCD) barriers.
There are five hours of criticism all day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the spread of infectious diseases, namely: before and after using toilets (small water, large water waste), after cleaning the childâ€™s skin, before feeding the child, before and/or before preparing food or meat, fish, or confectionery.
Another important time to use the technique to clean up the right hand to prevent the spread of disease is before and after treating the wound; after washing, stone, or tooth decay; after touching an animal or handling an animal; and after touching a wound.
In many countries, the level of hand washing with soap is still low.
A study on the washing of hands in 54 countries in 2015 found that 38.7% of married homes practice soap. A 2014 study shows that Saudi Arabia has a highest rate of 97%; the United States is nearly 77%; and Tiongkok is now a 23% lower rate. There are some methods of changes in behavior to improve the habit of oral sex during the crisis. Cleaning hands for students at the time that has been decided is one of the choices in the developing countries to raise their hands in child behavior.
The Department of Education in the Philippines has set the right example for children to take positive action to promote their health and education.
The supply of milk twice a year, combined with washing hands every day with soap and brushing teeth every day with fluoride, is the purpose of this national program.
The program was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Skin microorganisms are strengthened by the addition of soap or detour into water.
The main task of soap and deterrent is to reduce the stress of smoking and to improve the flow of energy.
Just water is a skin cleaner that is not efficient because of fat and protein, which is a component of organic contamination, is not easy to swallow in water.
As a result, we have sufficient water to wash our hands and to remove fat and protein from our body.
A hot soap, because it can be used again, may contain bacteria obtained from previous use.
A number of small studies that investigated the spread of the contaminated soap bacteria concluded that it was not possible to do so because the bacteria were infected with it.
However, the CDC continues to say, "The water that comes out of the air without being touched is more pleasant."
The antibacterial soap has been widely encouraged to a health-sensitive society.
To date, there has been no evidence that the use of antiseptics or infections recommended is better for an antibiotic-resistant organism in the natural world.
However, antibacterial soap contains such a common antibacterial agent as triclosan, which contains a wide range of chemically modified strands.
So, even if an antibiotic - resistant strain is not targeted by an antibacterial soap, it may not be effective based.
In addition to surfactant and skin protection, fresh formulations can contain ash (assetates, ascorbate assorbates, lactatases) as pH regulators, benzoate as active antimicrobials, and further skin conditioner (liquids, vitamins, mantols, plant extract).A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon University of Public Health Faculty of Health shows that the snake is normally the same as the antibacterial salt that contains triclosant levels in preventing disease and cleansing bacteria from hand.
The warm water to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill the bacteria.
The bacteria grow faster in body temperature (37 Â°C).
Hot water is more effective than cold water that is used to wash away natural oils that prevent contamination and bacteria.
However, contrary to the beliefs of many, scientific studies have shown that hot water consumption has no effect on reducing the number of microbes in the hands.
Handproofing or antiseptic is an unwatered cleaning agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand washing agents were non-water-based alcohol abusers (also known as alcohol-based abusers, antiseptic abusers, or hand abusers).
Most of these cleaning agents are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, which is formulated in combination with such metal materials as carbomer (acrylate-like polymer) as a gel or with liquids such as glycerin, or so that it is easy to be used and to reduce the effect on alcohol.
Adding hydrogen peroxide encer increases antimicrobial activity further. Hand insulation that contains at least 60-95% of alcohol is an efficient chemical killer.
The abuse of alcohol kills bacteria, many drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, Rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza, and hepatitis), and tuberculosis.
Alcohol abuse, which includes 70% alcohol, killed 99.97% (log loss 3.5, as well as 35 decibels) of patients in 30 seconds after clothing, and 99.99% to 99.999% (log loss 4 to 5) (log loss 1 minute after wear.
Almost all alcohol-based manipulation is not effective against the virus type norovirus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of gastroenteritis. Antiseptics or alcohol abuse in numbers should be used to treat or cover both hands as a whole.
The front and back of the two hands and in the back and the end of all hands are stretched about 30 seconds to rain, so, or iron.
The end of the hand should also be washed well by touching it in two hands. The U.S. Center for Control and Prevention of Disease is more recommended than any other fingernails, especially when the hands appear dirty.
Increase the use of anti-inflammatory agents as a result of rapid use and killing activities against micro-organisms; however, the anti-inflammatory agents should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing, except for soap and water not prepared.
The use of alcohol-based handwashing can often cause severe skin, unless emolien and/or skin swelling is added to the formula.
The effect on alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emolien to the formula.
In clinical trials, an alcohol-based inducement that contains emoleen causes erythesis and skin irritation far lower than soap and antimicrobial derivatives.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives in alcohol abuse are rare.
Low concentration makes contact dermatitis an alarming power of this product compared to washing hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-air agents do not wash their hands from organic matter, but only infect them.
For this reason, the healer does not have the effect of soap and water in preventing the preaching of many pathogens because the pathogens are still in the hands.
The reality of alcohol abuse is highly dependent on its content and formulation, and according to history, this product is significantly worse than alcohol abuse.
Recently, formulations using benzalconium chloride have been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after wear, not like alcohol, which has proved to be less effective after repeated use, possibly due to progressive side effects.
Many in the community struggle with poverty, but they could not afford to purchase their own land or land.
Water or land may be considered more effective than water, but the result is less effective than soap.
One of the concerns is, if it is contaminated with microorganisms, land or abu could increase the spread of disease.
Like soap, copper is also a disinfectant agent because, if it is contact with water, it will form alkaline derivatives.
WHO recommends dust and sand as a soap alternative when soap is not prepared.
The technique cleans the right hand based on the recommendations of the U.S. Center for Disease Control to prevent the spread of disease includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with hot water or cold water.
It is recommended that water be used for safekeeping, but it does not appear to have an effect on the water.
Wash your hands with a lot of soap, including the back of your hand, in your hands, and underneath me.
Soap rises from skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more closely when using soap than when using water.
At least for 20 seconds.
Insects create heat, which helps to eliminate skin cancer, and in the long run removes more oxygen.
Squad together under water running.
Swimming in the pocket can make your hands contaminant.
Reduce with shortness of breath or let it melt in the air.
The most common area of the region is a cavern, a stretch of hands, an area between the hands, and under my neck.
I'm working and my freed cat can keep microorganisms.
Loneliness is often recommended to keep your hands from getting dirty; skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection.
Various low-quality options can be made to wash hands when running water and/or soap is not available, for example, to pour water out from the pipes or bottled and/or use soap, if necessary, in the developing country. In situations where the water supply is limited (such as school or in the developing country), there is a waterproof solution, such as "type-tap", and other low-quality choices.
The tippy karang is a simple technology that uses water bottled with rope, bone operated by legs to put a little water into the hands, and a few soaps.
Effective hand fear is an important part of the process of hand washing, but there is a debate on the most effective hand healing form in the public toilet.
More and more research shows that the paper sheet is much cleaner than the electrical power found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and provided by the European paper industry Tissue Symposium, to compare the level of paper cleaning, hot air pressure, and more modern jet pressure.
After cleaning and raising hands with hot air pressure, the total number of bacteria was found to rise by 194% in manual books and 254% in handcuffs.
Reinforced by jet air currents cause the total number of patients at a rate of 42% in my manuals and 15% in my hands.
After cleaning and cutting hands with paper sheet, the total number of bacteria is reduced by 76% in manual books and 77% in handcuffs.Ilmunan also has a test to determine the potential of lung contamination on other toilet users and the environment of toilets resulting from each type of delivery method.
The jet air carrier, which discharges the air from the unit at a speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of taking micro-organisms from hand and unit and capable of searching for other toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 metres.
The use of hot air forces spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from power.
In 2005, TÃœVâ€™s study of the product und Umwelt, various methods of devaluation, did not show any sign of significant microorganisms.
After handwashing, the following changes in the number of patients were observed:
There are a number of hand tools, and hand tools have been compared to the power used by the press.
Washing hands by using a hand-washing tip is an alternative for walking away if there are no soap and water.
Alcohol-based handwashing should contain at least 60% of alcohol.
Medical hand pollution was imposed long after Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis found its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found that the rate of infection fell with the use of the device.
Medical hand washing is done for a minimum of 15 seconds, using soap and water in a large amount of soap or glass to wash and dry each piece of your hand.
The hands must be rubbed together with each other's hands together.
If there's a hole in the bottom of my neck, the skin can be used to wipe it out.
Since copper can withstand in water that is in the hands, it needs to be mixed together and rubbed with clean wool.
After drying, the paper sheet was used to close the water chain (and open the door out if necessary).
This action prevents the recontamination of the hand from reaching that surface.
The purpose of washing hands in health care is to eliminate pathogen microorganisms and avoid them.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that at least one hand is still at an unacceptable level in most medical circles, with a large number of doctors and caregivers still forget to wash their hands before they touch the patient and spread microorganisms.
One study showed that washing the right hands and other simple procedures can lower the rate of blood flow related to blood infection up to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has issued a swab that shows the standard of drying hands and gloves in the health sector.
Also available on the WHO website for comment.
The relevant investigation was carried out by Whitby et al.
A commercial device may be able to detect and validate hand washing if it is necessary to demonstrate the need for a regulation.
The World Health Organization has "Five Hours" to wash your hands:
after being transferred to blood/body.
before the aseptic task, and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (the "medicine" or "antimicroba") works to kill your fingertips.
The function of killing this one may be desired before it is done or in situations where an antibiotic-containing organism is very sensitive. For 'gnosing' hands before long surgery, it is necessary to remove and eliminate the needles that can be removed and removed without touching, chlorohexidine or iodium, sterile lap to wash your hands after cleaning, and steroid stimulating and other steroids to clean up under you.
All the jewelry must be released.
This procedure restricts washing hands and hands down to the waist, usually two to six minutes.
The length of time, 10 minutes, is not required.
When boiling, the water in the bottom must be prevented from turning back into the hands.
Once the hands have been washed, the hands have been reduced with sterile leather and leather.
To reduce the number of Kingdom publishers, it is better to wash your hands before and after touching a person.
For the control of staphylcococous infection in the hospital, it was found that the greatest benefit was to clean hands from the first 20% of the cleaning, and that the additional benefits received were very low when the washed hands were increased by 35%.
Washing with soap is more than three times as likely to cause infectious diseases to eat compared with the antibacterial soap. The comparison between mixing hands with alcohol-based soap and washing hands with antibacterial soap every 30 seconds shows that alcohol-based smokers reduce the contamination of the bacteria by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based users to reduce the influence of A H1N1 and Clostridium Tracks that are difficult from hand. Intervention to improve the healing of hands in health care can include education for staff on hand cleaning, increased the preparation of alcohol-based caregivers, and written reminders and licenses for staff.
More research is needed to find the most effective interventions in various health - care centers.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as a basic way to get good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supplies, soap, or hand washing facilities in peopleâ€™s homes, schools, and workplaces poses a challenge for maintaining a high - tech lifestyle.
For example, in most parts of Africaâ€™s densely populated area, hand mills near private toilets or public toilets are rarely available, even though there is an option to make hand mills available.
However, the level of hand washing can also occur because of the culture that has been planted and not because of the lack of soap or water.
Washing and washing hands with soap can affect your decision - making, increase your awareness of the benefits of hand washing, and bring about long - term changes in the behavior of the population.
In order to walk effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic survey of 70 studies found that community-based placements are effective in raising hand sugar in LMIC, while social health care campaigns are less effective. One example of school-based dental encouragement is the "Thirding of the Stars" by UNICEF which motivates schools to take simple and generous steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other cleaning conditions.
When the minimum standard is reached, school can move from one star to the last three stars.
Building a place to wash hands can be a part of the campaign of encouraging handshake, which has been done to reduce the disease and death of children.
The World Hand Clearing Day is another example of the campaign for increased tolerance that seeks to achieve the purpose of change in behavior. As a result of the 2019-2020 Korean virus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged cheap clothing.
Some studies have studied the effectiveness of money cleaning the overall hands of developing countries with regard to the prevention of Disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) or the size of the year lost due to disease.
One survey showed that encouraging handcuffs with soap meant a much more careful payment of water intervention and other sanitation.
It is important to wash hands for human health, especially for people in nursing conditions, such as a newborn mother or a wounded soldier in a hospital, first known in the middle of the 19th century by two clean hands: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who works in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, "increasing modern care" in England.
At that time, many still believe that the infection is caused by a cloud of dust called miasma or bad air.
In the 1980 â€™ s, food and infection reports related to health care made the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention more active in promoting hand hygiene as an important way to prevent infection.
The flood flood in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 will increase in many countries it will be important to wash your hands with soap to protect you from this epidemic.
For example, the poster "Technique Cleans the Right Hand" is placed on the side of the kitchen table on the public toilet and on the kitchen and airport construction toilet in Germany.
The expression "cleaning your hands" means saying someone's willingness to take responsibility for something or to follow in something.
That statement comes from the Bible account of Pontius Pilate when Pontius Pilate wielded authority on the issue of Jesus Christ, but it has become widely used in the English - speaking world.
In Shakespeare's work, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands continually to clean up the imagination; the action that showed her guilty of the evil she did and because she had touched her husband to do it.
It has also been noted that, after remembering or meditating on unethical actions, the tendency is more often to wash your hands and to increase your appreciation for the tools you use to wash your hands.
Further, the person who is allowed to wash his hands after meditating on it has less chance of being involved in the "cleaning" compensation action, as if to volunteer.
Religion commands the cleansing of hands for the purpose of cleansing and symbolism. The cleansing of symbolic hands, using water, but without soap to wash the hands, is part of the ritual washing of hands in many religions, including Baha'Ã­, Hindu, Jewish beliefs, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam.
Hindus, Jews, and Muslims were required to wash their hands after using toilets.
In addition, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews, and Muslims were required to wash their hands before and after meals.
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19
The risk control of the workplace for COVID-19 is a health and occupational health methodology for risk control of the use of the 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Proper risk control at work depends on workplaces and jobs, based on the risk of unemployment, the level of disease in the community, and the risk factors for each worker that may be reduced to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Health (OSHA), low-risk jobs have minimal employment contacts with the public and other employees; for this work, steps are encouraged to prevent basic infections, including washing hands, moving workers to live at home if they are ill, when they are dressed, and do cleaning and regularly infecting the working environment.
The risk-taking job is involving jobs that require close or often contact with people who are not known or expected to suffer COVID-19, but may be infected because of a flood in a society that is passing or international travel.
This group includes workers who have contacts with public communities such as schools, the working environment with high population attendance, and high-voluntage rivals.
Risk control for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention steps, includes ventilation using high-efficiency air supply, protective against gas, and providing self-defense protection devices when encountering COVID-19.
The OSHA considers the health and body's strength of the person who is known or expected to suffer from COVID-19 to be at high risk, which increases the risk of being very high if the worker carries out aerosol performance procedures on, or takes or handles the species from, the person who is known or expected to suffer COVID-19.
The appropriate risk control for this worker includes technical control, such as a negative ventilation room, and self-defense protective equipment.
COVID-19 can have a few glasses at work.
The worker may not come to work because of illness, the need to take care of others, or because he is afraid of possible accidents.
Trade pools can change, good in the type of goods requested or how to obtain these goods (such as cash out of the busy hour, through delivery, or delivery).
Finally, the shipment of goods from the very affected geographical area of COVID-19 can be interrupted. The preparation and plan of the prevention of infectious diseases can be used to control protection.
The article considers the risks associated with various workplaces and jobs, including savings resources, risk factors arising from home and public health care, as well as the risk factors for each worker, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
The article also provides practical suggestions on how we can avoid those dangers and how to deal with them.
The preparation and the treatment of infectious diseases may be subject to national or subregional recommendations.
The aim of the ban is to reduce the gap between the staff, to protect those at higher risk for ill health complications, to maintain business operations, and to minimize the adverse effects on other entities on the crew's lines.
The spread of disease in the community in the business community has a bearing on the actions of the disabled.
The risk factors are the risk factors, which are often associated with high - risk work habits and health risks.
When the danger of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is technical control, administrative control, and the last protective device.
Technical control involves insulating services from employment-related risks without relying on work practices and can become the most expensive solution to be implemented.
Administrative controls vary from person to person, depending on the type of work involved or the type of work involved.
Self - protective devices (APDs) are considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but they can help prevent certain diseases.
All APD types should be selected on the basis of risk at work, properly installed as they are (invented, respiratory), used consistently and properly, tested, supervised, and modified periodically, if necessary, and released, cleaned, and kept properly or removed to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Health (OSHA) of the United States, low-risk jobs have minimal employment connections with the general public and with other employees.
The basic prevention steps recommended for all workplaces include often washing their hands together, encouraging workers to stay at home when sick, when clothing includes covering stones and washing, preparing nets and soap, preparing work from distant or remote times of work, when needed, informing workers not to use other tools and equipment, and doing cleaning and cleaning work regularly.
The quick and isolated identification of potential individuals is an important step in protecting workers, employers, customers, and others at work.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that servants with acute infectious diseases stay at home until they are free from dementia, signs of dengue, and other diseases for at least 24 hours without the use of other congenital drugs or other alternative drugs, and that the treatment of painkillers is flexible so that they allow them to stay at home to care for the sick family members, and to know about this.
According to OSHA, the risk-making work is covering jobs that require close or often within six feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known or expected to suffer COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-COV-2 because of public awareness about business location, or because a new person makes an international trip to the site with an extensive COVID-19.
This group includes workers who have contacts with public societies such as schools, working environments with high population levels, and high-voltage networks. Technical monitoring for this group and high-risk groups includes building high-end air filters, raising ventilating levels, building physical removals such as paint protection plastics, and building windows for the service of the hostages. Administrative controls for this group and high-end working groups include meeting up with virtual communications, creating a guard guard with high-flamming and high-flamming high-voltage systems, preventing unnecessary interference with high-flamming and high-flamming systems, preventing the use of high-flamming air pollution filters for high-efficiency air pollution, high-flamming air pollution systems, high-frauding systems, high-fraudming systems, high-frauding systems, high-fraud or high-sming services for maintenance services, high-fres, high-fresight systems, high management systems systems systems systems systems systemss, high quality management systems systems systemss, high-cares, high quality management systemss, high quality management systems systems systems systems systems systemss and maintenances, high-trains, high-trains systems systems systems systems systems systems systems systems systems systems systems systemsssssss, high-trains.
Workers in this risk group don't need respiratorys.
If someone falls sick on a plane, proper controls to protect the worker and other passengers include sharing a patientâ€™s six - foot - long [6 m] leg [6 m] walk, showing a cabin bell to take care of the patient, and offering masks to the patient or asking him to close his mouth and nose with a stone or a knife.
The cabin crew should wear medical gloves once when taking care of a sick passenger or touching the body or a potentially contaminated surface and possibly other self-defense equipment if the sufferer is suffering from dementia, continuous stones, or breathing difficulties.
For commercial services, including passenger ships and other crews, the risk control shall include travel if they are ill, isolated, and inform the medical center of the ship immediately if they are in trouble or otherwise on board.
Ideally, medical advances have been made in the homes of people who have been isolated. As a result of public witnessing, for schools and child training facilities, CDC recommends short-term closures to clean or disinfect if the infected person has been in school building.
If there are social exclusions at a minimum level until now, the social exclusion strategy can be implemented, which includes: canceling visits to the fields, meetings, and other large groups, such as physical education, class of singing, or eating in the cafeteria, increasing the distance between tables, visiting and relaxing times, limiting non-sensitious arrivals, and using separate health offices for children with flu-like violence.
If there is a high level of education in the local community, along with the social exclusion strategy, extending school conclusions can be considered. For law enforcement officers who perform regular daily activities, health risks are directly considered to be low by CDC.
The law enforcement officer who should contact the confirmed or suspected COVID-19 is recommended to follow the same procedure as emergency medical technology, including using appropriate self-defence tools.
If contact is close during the arrest, the worker must clean up and disinfect the binder and the task equipment before re-use by using a reproposal or rehabilitator and follow the standard operation procedure to control and remove APD files and to control and clean the dirty clothing.
OSHA considers the health and health of certain body rooms to be of high or very high risk.
High-risk jobs include health care, support, laboratory, and medical transport forces compared to patients known or expected to be COVID-19.
This work becomes a very high risk if the worker carries out aerosol production procedures on, or takes or handles the specifics of, known or expected COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol production procedures include intubs, bone induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some oral procedures and examinations, or invasive species.
The work of the high-risk rooms involves the work involved in preparing the body of a known or suspected COVID-19 at the time of death; this work becomes a very high risk if the worker performs an autopsy. The additional technical control for this risk group includes an isolation room for patients known or expected to be COVID-19, including when the aerosol performance procedure is carried out.
Ventilation of negative stress may be appropriate in some health care centers and body rooms.
The species must be treated with the prevention of the level of biological safety 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients come to a different waiting room if they are expected to be COVID-19. In addition to other APD, OSHA recommends respiratory recommendations for those who work within 6 feet of a patient known to or expected to have SARS-CoV-2 infection, and those who perform aerosol successful procedures.
In the United States, N95-former respirators that are approved by NISH or that are better to be used in the context of written and comprehensible clothing protection programs, including appropriate testing, training, and medical examinations.
Another type of respiratory can provide greater protection and improve the quality of your work. WHO does not recommend covered clothes all over or Coverall because COVID-19 is an infectious disease and is not transmitted through the body.
WHO's just recommending a lot of masks for the screen agent at the entrance point.
For those who take equipment, care, or follow COVID-19 patients without aerosol production procedure, WHO recommends masks, protective gloves, or facial prints, fingernails, and fingernails.
If aerosol production procedure is performed, the mask is replaced by N95 or FFP2.
Remembering that APD teams are not covering the whole world, WHO recommends neglecting the needs of APD through long-term medical services, physical discharges such as a flashlight window, with only those directly involved in the treatment can enter the patient's COVID-19 room, use only the APD needed for certain tasks, continue using the same respiratory system without allowing it to treat many patients with the same diagnosis, repair and coordinate the APD's lines, and do not induce the use of masks for people without reason.

BARIS SUBJEK: [Covit-19] Laying off the burden and preparing for the future
MEMORIAL ATTENDANCE: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LIST: CC0: No rights protected
We find ourselves in a unique situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes it clear that people are global and responsible that we have each other.
We've never experienced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, work together, and the development of a global community, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendships and interests that we have witnessed among all our coworkers by e - mail, texting, and chatting are unique to those of us who are quite fortunate to be able to work with them.
I am so grateful and proud that I can call you a workmate.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me of what it means for the world today to be able to access Wikipedia and how this is a powerful symbol of this important source of energy to keep ready for all.
Your job allows this to happen, unless you make sure this site continues to run, help pay off our friends, or help preserve our community's security.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, especially now.
This is the moment when not only the work we do but also the way we do it, will make the world a viewing scene.
Since this mission is important and your role in it, we will make some important adjustments to how we work together, which will start next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team met last night to discuss our appointment and schedule for a few days and months coming.
In that discussion, we considered what we thought was the right answer to the challenges we faced and the best way to keep the organization going.
We were eager to eliminate the pressure and support our mission for a long time.
If you need to lower your work schedule, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors, and contractors:
Our day - to - day work is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice is made.
We don't set a day off, if you can work more on normal hours, this mission needs you.
However, the world cannot be predicted right now, and you do not have to care for loved ones, pay for the needs of wood, or go to a doctor, your health is our priority.
We don't waste your work time.
If you're sick, don't work.
That should not be said, but we did.
Patients or PTOs are not required, sufficient to inform your manager and your team of your calendar and schedule to ensure that the main areas of work can be resolved.
(If you are diagnosed positively suffering from COVID-19, hope to know Bryan in T&C Ops so that T&C can help with support and ensure that your situation gets proper attention from management).
The friends whose reward is based on time will be paid in full.
We told her, and we told her again, to respect our appointment with the contractors and the clock-based staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their secular work.
This includes if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use jobs to reduce stress in the world around us.
The work we do can bring great satisfaction, especially in times like these.
Again, the most important thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to do and can take appropriate action.
Certain jobs are considered essential.
There are a few jobs that must be kept running.
SRE, SDM Operations, Trust & Security, as well as the DDA team, among other things, do important work that may require additional support.
We're going to start the process with all departments to look at our current goals and focus our attention on supporting what is essential to our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we're just going to focus on the most important project.
Relaxing now will be nothing for the future.
We don't plan on "the work of the wolf chasing the desert" after it's over.
You will not be expected to work as a carpenter to fill a time gap that is not now realistic.
We realize that the situation changes and will try to set new targets and lines if needed.
What about the APP?
In order to adapt to new realities and to expect the working hours of the day, we intend to adjust the time line for the implementation of the 2020-2021 Learning Plan.
Our aim is to encourage the extension of the 2019-2020 articles that allow more time to make appointments so that servants can give priority to important work, self-care, and the care of their loved ones, as well as harmonizing their needs or wanting to work with schedules less for the next few weeks.
The current increase in the number of workers and the pressures of planning is a significant reduction in the number of employees in the organization today.
We will present our proposal to the House next week and announce the delegation and the committee at its next stage as soon as we receive confirmation.
Thank you for your leadership team in this regard.
Status, schedule, and office cleaning
Last week, we were informed that one of our partners based on the SF may have been infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, because of our great concern, we were working as antiviral cleaners to infect all the surfaces in San Francisco office.
They use antiviral radiation in hospitals to treat infections every face, lungs, and all the lifts on our ground.
The builders used their own safety protocol using products that supported the safety of their occupants.
We're happy that the office will be ready when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has shared the COVID-19 protocol to us and all the staff members based on the DC.
Starting last week, our DC office has moved to a remote station, along with the instructions shared with San Francisco.
As some of our brothers in the NYC were aware of our visit to Brooklyn, we were discussing the location.
This discussion continues, but it may take time.
A few of our colleagues work from far away for the first time.
Our longtime colleagues are well aware that it may need adjustments and they want to give you advice:
The length of a period of at least one or two hours.
If you need more time, consider how to share it for a few days.
Define clearly the relationship, make an appointment, and send literature beforehand.
Make video as default, with tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate direct collaboration and connections.
Show the director how to falsify each of the two parties, one to record a question - and - write list of speakers, and one to help make a summary (or make a collaborative note).
Send email to technical support if you need a secure headset.
Use your health compensation to buy little food.
Join the #remoties in Slack to talk to each other about shared work
The SDM Operation team is looking for a web-based ergonomic platform to support the expansion of the work that has been distributed throughout the Earth.
Last week we asked all the community officials to cancel a public event called Wikimedia, such as Edit-a-thon, until WHO said the pandemic was over.
We let them know that we understand our request for settlement and other terminations can make them unable to complete the agreed settlement process and that no one will be given funding because they have to notify or modify this agreement.
This coming week we will follow with further guidance on Wikimania and regional community conferences and other themes.
In general, feelings from the whole global community seem to be the sad result of this confusion, but once again slowed down the explanation and ability to focus on its own community, good Wikimedia and others.
Next, CRT is trying to prepare a platform in Meta-Wiki to provide a room for the community to monitor and follow our communication with them.
Keep connected during COVID-19 situation
We'll send you an invitation to your calendar for Kamis coming, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff summary.
We'll use this time to share additional additions, answer your questions, and spend time with each other connected.
We're together in this situation and we want to help our own.
In the meantime, you can keep getting information from this email and all the other vital information related to the COVID-19 in Office Wiki.
The CRT will continue to expand this area and ensure that all information is in one place.
We're also trying to keep regular communication with staff living in countries that are currently being significantly affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, basic work, or problems about clothing, or anything else that might require help, do not hesitate to get to know and work with CRT.
We're here to help provide support and make the necessary calls.
If you have a secret or sensitive problem, please send an email to Bryan Judah, Director of the Global SDM Operation International.
None of these changes are viewed as a reason for our work and our duty to God.
Rather, this change is an admission that, at present, our work and our responsibilities may need to be adjusted in a way that we have never done before.
This change is the steps that we are confident of being able to support one another in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the support we need to move, and provide the world with the services they trust.
The work we've planned before will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, this is the time to support one another and to create a room for important work that will come in a few weeks and perhaps months to come.
We need you all to create it, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work best when you need it.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!

b'Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of the cell (cell membrane) in the lungs, arteries, heart, ginillas, and usus.
ACE2 has anti-angiotensin enzymes (ACE), reducing angiotensin-II levels and increasing Angiotensin (1-7), thus making it a drug target that promises to treat cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also works as a point of entry into cells for some coronavirus.
ACE2 version of humans is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 is angiotensin converting enzyme that contains metalloenzymes that are placed on the surface of endothel cells and other cells.
Protein ACE2 has the M2 terminal peptidase domain and the transporter domain as well as the renal collectrin terminal-C domain.
ACE2 is a single type I protein membrane, with the active domain in enzymes compared to the cell surfaces in dust and other networks.
The ACE2 extra domain is separated from the transmembran domain by another enzyme, known as Sheddase, and contaminated protein produced released into the bloodstream and finally dextres into the urine.
ACE2 is located in a large part of the organ: ACE2 is placed on the membrane of the brain, especially the parous alveolar type II, the enteroside of small uses, the endothelial endocrine and the vein, and the osteoporosis of the large part of the body.
The MRNA ACE2 expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and bone marrow.
The main ACE2 function is as an ACE developer.
ACE inhibits angiotensin I hormone to become angiotensin II vasosconstrict.
Finally, ACE2 inhibits amino phenylalanine terminal carboxyl from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis becomes angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Argy-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also eliminate a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, aplin, neurotensin, dinorfin A, and grelin.
ACE2 also arranges for the port of the transporter's asymptomium neutral SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembran protein, ACE2 functions as the primary entry point in the cell for some coronavirus, which includes HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the SARS virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19 virus).
More specifically, the combination of S1 protein on the spine or SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the ACE2 enzyme domain on the surface of the cell causes endostois and translocation of viruses and enzymes into the endosomal in the cell.
This virus-injection process also requires primary protein S by the TMPRSS2 protease serum, which is currently being controlled as a potential therapy. This fact causes people to assume that the generation of ACE2 in cells may help fight infection.
However, many professionals and regulatory bodies recommend continuing ACE and ARB inhibitors.
A systematic and metaanalysis survey, published on July 11, 2012, found that "use of ACE inhibitors causes a 34% increase in pneumonia risk compared to control."
Further, "the use of ACE inhibitors also lowers the risk of pneumonia in patients with a higher risk of pneumonia, especially stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with the generation of pneumonia related mortality, although the result is less severe than the total risk of pneumonia."
ACE2 recombinant humans (rhACE2) are expected to be new therapy for acute hair injury, and it seems to increase the hemodynamics of hair and oxygen content in baby babies with acute breathing syndrome induced by lipoplascaride.
When rhACE2 is administered to humans about 10 hours with a work schedule of 30 minutes, it has a 24-hour effect.
Some findings indicate that rhACE2 may be a promising medicine for patients with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin inhibitor (RAS inhibitor) or to disease with angiotensin II in blood circulation.
b'COVID-19' Applicsi's application is a generic device designed to help the contact plan to reverse the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, that is, the process identifying the person ("contact") who may have made contact with the infected person.
Many applications have been developed or recommended, which have received official support from governments in some areas and jurisdictions.
A number of tools have been developed to help build contacts.
The issue of privacy is raised, especially when it comes to systems based on the geographic location of the application.
An alternative that does not take too much privacy includes the use of Bluetooth signals to record user presence with other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple together announced that they would integrate functionality to support these Bluetooth-based applications directly into Android and iOS operating systems.
In Tingkok, the Tiongkok government, together with Agora, has published applications that allow citizens to check whether they have been contacted with the COVID-19 disease.
This application was used in over 200 cities of Tingakkok. In Singapore, it used the name TraceTogether application.
This application was developed by the local IT community, written as an open source and will be distributed to the government. Northern Macedonia destroyed "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track down infected people and respond quickly to health care authorities.
This application was developed by the Communications and Technology and Health Committee.
Until April 14, 2020, these applications still await the approval of Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12th, the government said that the contact programming application is in progress and will be ready for release within a few weeks. Similar applications are planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovide").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether Singapore application and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia aims to identify geofencing applications for COVID-19 terragonisation patients who live in Moscow; this application is designed to ensure that they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security at Cambridge University, mentioned a number of practical problems that might arise on application-based systems, which include false positives and possibly less effective if data taken limited to a small part of the population are limited.
In order to overcome the concern about the preaching of corrupt or dangerous koronavirus applications, Apple sets limits on the type of organisation that can add the related kronavirus application to the App Store, i.e. restricts only for "resmi" organisations or with good reputation.
Google and Amazon use a similar approach.
Private supporters suggest their attention regarding the involvement of mass surveillance with the use of coronavirus applications, in particular whether the surveillance infrastructure made to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be stopped after the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued statements that limit such surveillance.
The organization stated eight conditions on the government project:
surveillance must be "in accordance with the law, necessary, and proportionate";
maintenance and surveillance activities must have a darker sunglasses;
the use of data must be limited to the purpose of the COVID-19;
data security and anonymity must be protected and proven on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance must avoid increasing the risk of discrimination and marginalization;
Each data sharing with third parties must be defined in the laws;
there must be protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
Participation means all "relevant importance" required, including social health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) Germany and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also issued a list of reviews.
The Google/Apple article recommended to deal with the monitoring problem continues by removing the tracking mechanism from the device operating system after it is no longer necessary.
Some countries use web-based platforms, rather than applications, to eliminate the impact on applications and ability to avoid them.
In Israel, a network of networks was established.
A network-based solution that has access to data from a remote location has a significant potential for privacy problems.
However, not all systems with the center server need to access personal data; a number of privacy systems have been created and use the centre server only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, non-application systems are used to make contact announcements.
As a result of the use of special applications, the system collects seed information from various sources, includes data from the device field and transaction data, and combines this information to produce information through text messages to those who are capable of infection.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government also makes this location information available to the public, which is allowed to have extensive changes to the privacy laws after the MERS has been removed in that country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries such as Germany consider using one-off systems that protect privacy.
Until April 6, 2020, details have not yet been published.
Contact talks that protect privacy are an advanced concept, with a large number of research literature starting at least in 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a group of experts working on private solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record user access to other phones.
However, the PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that has focused and decentralised, not only protocol. The decentralised protocol includes the Privacy Protection Protocol (DP-PPT/DP-3T), the Temporary Contact Number (TCN, previously referred to as the Contact Event Number, CEN), the Protocol and the sensitive Mechanism for the Securer Contact Dictionary (PACT), and others.
In this protocol, the personal data that can be identified is never left the device, and all the matches are on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Private Group has developed SafePaths, a platform to use technology to protect privacy when collecting and using location or intersex data of the year to track the COVID-19 preaching.
This is based on a study of the White Paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020.Other features are the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that develops private technology and is originally also established in MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share their location and sensitive health data with other users and officials without offering that data to them.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Coalition was established by a group of groups that have the same location and are a multi-stakeholder protocol, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and allowing global interoperability for the application of warnings and warnings, which is the main aspect of reaching wide acceptance.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that they had made the BlueTrace protocol used by the government's official application as an open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, a company that manages Android and iOS platforms, announced initiatives for contacts, which they claim will protect privacy, based on the combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography that protects privacy.
They also investigate the technical specifications used in this system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is meant to be destroyed in three steps:
A tool to allow governments to make official applications of the Coronavirus monitoring that protect privacy
The integration of this function directly to iOS and Google Android and Apple plans to deal with the problem of data recovery and surveillance continue with initial distribution of the system through the deployment of the operating system, and then delete it in the same way after the threat passes.
b'Reposition of medicine (also called a new purpose, new profile, or a new task on medicine or therapy) is the use of medicine that has been approved for new medical purposes, i.e. for diseases or medical conditions that differ from the original purpose of medical development.
This route is a scientific research path currently being undertaken to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research approaches include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and the transfer of convalescent plasma. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be the target of drugs, each protein has several linkage sites.
Analysis of these linkage sites can be the basis for an effective antiviral drug development project for COVID-19 protein.
Some SARS-CoV-2 target proteins most important are proteases such as papain, RNA polymerase dependent on RNA, helikase, protein S, and ADP riphosphatase.
Hussein A A, et al studied several candidates who were then optimised and analyzed the similarity with the medicine that had been accepted and had the highest tendency to speed up the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential drugs in its practice study to be recommended in clinical design.
Chlorokuin is an antimalarial medicine that is also used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18th, WHO announced that the related chloroquinine and hydrochloriculin are two of the four medicines that will be designated as part of the Solidaritas clinical trial.
Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that a test of chloroquinine and hydrochloriculin in New York would begin on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloriculin sulphate and phosphate based on the Authority for the Use of Darurat (USA).
This treatment has not yet been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised on the basis of the USA only as experimental treatment for the use of vaccines in patients under treatment, but cannot be accepted in the clinical trial.
CDC says that "use, dose, or hydrochloriculin duration for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not been established.
The doctor said they used that medicine when "no other choice."
A Turkish team of researchers in Istanbul is doing a small study on the use of chloroquinine combined with fat, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Larger studies are being conducted at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
THE New Langone Medical School is doing its best to test the safety and reliability of the use of hydrochloric acid.
Tingkok's clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir proved to be an "effective explanation".
Thirty - five patients in Shenzhen were diagnosed with a negative effect on the median for 4 days, whereas the disease rate was 11 days for 45 patients who did not accept it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients were given favipinavir and half the patients received imifenovir.
The Italian Pharmacy Agency reminds the public that the evidence there is to support this medicine is small and too small.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy that medicine from Japan for preparation and use the military to send it to a university hospital, where it would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made a statement to the government of the Trump about the purchase of these drugs, which may be less effective in cases of serious diseases with a virus that has been multiplied.
This medicine may not be safe if it is used by pregnant mothers or those who are trying to contain it.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "there is no therapeutic benefit".
This medicine is designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by attaching protease.
A research team at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drug to find a life that will coincide with SARS-CoV-2.There is criticism in the scientific community about the supply of energy for the placement of drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in an international solidarity test.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus and Marburg virus infection. Later, Gilead Sciences found that Remdesivir has an in vitro antivirus activity against some philo-, pneumo-, paramicso- and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is the occurrence of resistance through mutations that can cause disease and transmission.
Some initial studies of the pauji-test show that remdesivir may have high genetic resistance levels. Some clinical trials are ongoing, including two clinical trials performed by the University of Cleveland Hospital, one for the sick and the other for the sick.
There are three clinical trials that are undergoing intravenous C vitamin C for those who are adequately treated with COVID-19, namely two controlled placebos (Tiongkok, Canada) and one uncontrollable (Italy).
The New York State began testing for azitromysin antibiotics on March 24, 2020.
Japan National Health and Global Medical Centre (NCGM) is planning clinical trials for Alvesco (cyclosonide) Teijin, inhalation corticosteroids for asthma, for the treatment of new pre-symmetric coronary infection patients.
For a form of angiotensin 2 angiotensin-like enzyme test, phase II testing is going on with 200 patients who will be recruited from an adequate treatment case in Denmark, Germany, and Austria.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of coloxiin in reducing inflammation and renal complications in patients suffering from low-fat COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, recruited 6,000 adults 40 years of age and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and who were suffering from nausea so much that they did not need adequate care.
Women who are pregnant or breast - feeding or who do not use effective contraceptives do not meet the requirements.
Some anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Heparin is used to treat patients with a low molecular weight so that the Italian Medicines Agency will issue a statement on its use.
A multi-posted study of 300 patients who studied the use of enoxaparin sodium at the prophylaxis and therapeutic dose was published in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, many scientific attention has been focused on providing new medical targets for approved antiviral drugs, such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the Tyongkok edition 7
Umifenovir: umifenovir is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the Tyongkok section of the 7th edition
Some antibiotics identified as potentially new drugs can be used to treat COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (Anti-receptor IL-6): agreed by Tiongkok.
In addition, tests were also performed in Italy and Tiongkok, see also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'Vaksin COVID-19 is a hypothetitis vaccine against coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has yet been able to complete a clinical trial, there is much effort being made to develop it.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, this infectious virus will not be prepared for less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates are in the phase I security study in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
In 2020, the world over, the world over, made huge investments and research to advance vaccines.
Many organizations use the genome published to develop vaccines that may be able to fight SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative announced in April that the thing to be noted in the development of vaccines is speeding up, production capacity, preaching on the required scale, and global access.
In April, CEPIâ€™s study reported that 10 different technology platforms were in research and development during early 2020 to make an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform target advanced to Phase I security study, including:
nuclear assam (DNA and RNA) (Phase I development and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
virus vector (Fase I development and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, adenovirus type 5) vector
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, the total 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milk Institute), and 37 others have been published, but with little public information available (as thought to be in planning or planning).
A phase I-II test of safety and early immunogenicity, usually carried out gradually, placebo-controlled, and in some places, as well as a more accurate effective dose.
Phase III tests usually involve more patients, including control groups, and tests on the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent disease, with the impact on the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active vaccine candidates (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 of them are not yet in the human assessment (also in the "praclinis") study.
On January 24, 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that they are investigating the potential of genetically modified protein proteins to induce immune reactions.
On January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccination Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced that they began to develop vaccines, with a human test target in 2021.
The vaccine development project was announced at the Tingkok Center on 26 January 2020 and Hong Kong University on 28 January.
On January 29, 2020, Farmers Janssen, led by Hanneke Schuitmaker, announced that they began to develop vaccines.
Janssen works with his biotechnology mitrate, Vaxart, to develop oral vaccines.

On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania examined the design of vaccines with technologies similar to the technology used to treat neoantigen cancer vaccines.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the vaccine synthesis and would begin the test.
On February 27, 2020, Generex's company's children, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that they started a vaccine project to make Ii-Key vaccines for COVID-19.
They want to produce vaccine candidates that can be tested in humans "for 90 days."
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington, St. Louis, announced its project to develop vaccines.
On March 5, 2020, the U.S. Medical and Medical Research Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Institute at Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were developing vaccines.
On March 10, 2020, Emergency Biosolutions announced that they worked with Novamax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of vaccines.
Further, this study summarizes the practice studies and Phase I clinical trials in July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Health Service announced that they were working 11 islands, and even on the fast - moving road, at least one - to - two years of vaccine development would take time.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported partial development of coronavirus with partial screening from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
This vaccine is being studied in the laboratory, with a human test scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier, The Guardian reported that President AS, Donald Trump, had offered "a large amount of money" for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine to CureVac, which was protested by the German government.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company, BioNTech, to develop mRNA-based vaccines together.
Currently, the MRNA-based vaccine candidate, BNT162, is in clinical trials with expected clinical trials starting in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020 in Italy, the Italian Biotech biotic company Takis Biotech announced that they would have the results of a paclinism test in April 2020 and that the vaccine candidates at the final stage could begin to be tested in human beings during the rainy season.
On March 19, 2020 in France, the Institute of Pasteur, the Themis Bioscience (Wina, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, with total CEPI investment in the evolution of COVID-19 vaccines, announced a large investment of $4.9 million in COVID-19 vaccine research.
Another CEPI investment Mitra for the development of COVID-19 vaccines is Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University, and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, the Russian health authorities announced that scientists have launched six vaccine candidates on animals.
Researchers Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing RNA vaccines that can amplify themselves for COVID-19.
The vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving a second from Tingkok.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced a large amount of C$275 million for 96 medical research projects on COVID-19, which included a number of vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and Saskatchewan University initiative.
In close cooperation, the Canadian government has announced a large amount of C$192 million specifically to develop COVID-19 vaccines, with plans to establish national "vaccin banks" containing some new vaccines that can be used if other coronavirus outbreaks occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the PittCoVacc University Medical School reported on a COVID-19 vaccine candidate at the clinic; they said that "MNA that gives S1 SARS-CoV-2 boosts the response of a potential antigen specific antibiotic that begins to appear 2 weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo Farms College in Canada announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential genetic component.
Using bacteria, DNA is designed to apply in human bacteria to produce harmless similar particles, which can induce immune systems to produce antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, government, industry, and three U.S. universities collected power sources to access supercomputer from IBM, combined with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google's nuclear software.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, which are also called non-specific effects.
That means that these vaccines can benefit from outside the disease it prevents.
The most recent attempt in Australia has been to follow 4,170 health officials.
There is a possibility that vaccines in development will not be safe or effective.
Early studies to examine the authenticity of vaccines using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, show that protection steps are needed to reach the level of biological safety 3 in the management of live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard health procedures.
The vaccine against SARS and MERS has been tested in human form.
By 2020, there has been no known cure or vaccine for SARS that has proved to be safe and effective for humans.
According to a study published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of vaccines and new medicines to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health communities worldwide.
When MERS becomes prevalid, confidence-based SARS research can be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapy for MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, there is one METS vaccine (the DNA base) that completes phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines are in the process, all of which are virus vector vaccines, two adenovirus vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts employ conspiracy theories that claim the virus back to the COVID-19 has previously been known and that vaccines have been prepared.
The patents introduced by various social media posts refer to the patents available for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus glaucoma, such as SARS coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a manic disease caused by Coronavirus acute infection syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The general eye is covered with teeth, legs, and almost breath.
Other symptoms include nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation, loss of appetite, and stomach disease.
From the time of birth to the birth of the baby, it may take about five days, but it can affect from two to four days.
Although most cases are caused by mildew, some develop to develop viral pneumonia and have a history of brain failure.
As of April 17, 2020, over 2,24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, affecting more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568.000 people have recovered, especially when they have a close contact, often through a bite or a small droplets produced by stone, gas, or when they talk.
Although it was produced when the breath was released, the droplets usually fell to the ground or surface and did not travel far.
People can also be infected by infected surfaces that are contaminated with their eyes, noses, or mouth.
On the surface, this virus can last up to 72 hours.
This virus spreads very much during the first three days after pregnancy, although the preaching may take place before pregnancy and after the next diagnosis. The standard diagnosis method is with a linear reaction of real-time transcripse transcripture (rRT-PCR) in the nasopharynx.
The use of masks is encouraged by those who are suspected of being infected with the virus and those who take care of it.
Recommendations on the use of masks by different public authorities; some authorities recommend not to use masks, some recommend their use, and others advocate their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local disease transmission has been reported in almost all six countries in the WHO region.
People who are infected with the virus may experience colds or colds such as fever, fever, fever, and respiratory failure.
Respiratory disorders include breathing problems, pain or swelling in the pancreas, constipation, difficulty getting up, and face-to-face or sweating; medical surgery is immediately recommended if these events occur.
The upper jaws, such as fever, inflammation, or constipation, can be found, but they are less common.
Gastrointestinal disorders, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, are present in a low percentage.
Some of the cases in Tingkok were initially only with the clinical images of breast cancer and palpitation.
In some cases, disease may develop to the point that it may increase the risk of pneumonia, stroke, and death.
This period is called the period of incubation.
Incubation time for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can affect from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who have been infected will experience pregnancy in 11.5 days, and the report shows that not all people who are infected experience pregnancy.
The role of the transporter without this skill in the field is not yet fully known; however, the initial evidence indicates that they may have contributed to the spread of disease.
Currently, the proportion of unaccompanied infected people who are not yet known and are being addressed, with the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all cases remain unconfirmed during hospital care.
The Tingkok National Health Commission began to report cases without a case in its case on 1 April; from 166 infection on that day, 130 (78%) did not show a case in case of trial.
Sputum and lubricant can carry the virus in large scale.
Speak with mildness, even when provoked.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered stones could cause droplets to reach 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although this virus is not usually transmitted through the air, the United States National Sciences Academy shows that bioaerosol transmission may occur and the air collection that is located on the outside of the room produces a positive sample for RNA virus.
Some medical procedures, such as intubs and heart disease (RJP), can make the secret of aerosol and spread through the air.
Although there is some concern that the virus can be spread through feses, this risk is recognized as low. The virus is most likely to spread when people do it; even though the preaching may occur before the outbreak, the risk is low.
The European Center for Prevention and Control of Diseases (ECDC) says that although it is not yet fully clear how easily this disease spreads, one person in general infected two or three people, and this virus can remain on the surface for hours and days.
In particular, it was found that the virus could be detected for one day on cartons/cards, up to three days on plastics (polypropylene) and cardboard (ISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% rifles.
However, this variety depends on how much light and heat the sun produces.
soap and detergen are also effective if used properly; soap products cover the body fat of the virus protector, the deactivation of the virus, and release it from skin and other surfaces.
The other route, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate, is less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, water samples are taken in the median two days after the proper start.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest virus level, and the sixth patient showed the highest virus level on the second day of test.
Coronavirus acute infection syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute infection syndrome, first isolated from three people with pneumonia related to acute infectious diseases in Wuhan.
All the new SARS-CoV-2 virus is on a coronavirus that is terrible in the world.
Outside of the human body, this virus is killed by a married couple's soap, which damages its protection. SARS-COV-2 is closely associated with the first SARS-COV.
Paru is the most common organ of the COVID-19 because the virus accesses indign cells through angiotensin 2 (ACE2) enzyme, which is the most expensive in type II parous alveolar cell.
This virus uses glycoprotein specifically called "peplomer" to connect to ACE2 and enter the intestine cell.
Acute heart failure was found in 12% of the infected patients treated properly in Wuhan, Tiongkok, and more often on the disease.
High cardiovascular events due to systemic inflammation response and immune disturbance during disease development, but acute myocardial infarction may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptor describes very high heart rate and is involved in heart function.
The incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was high in patients with COVID-19 infection in ICU and possibly associated with poor prognosis. Otopsia in people who died from COVID-19 found HIV infection (DAD) and infiltration of lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a trophisme for a respiratory epithelial cell expressing ACE2, patients with COVID-19 are pregnant with systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, the T cells that suppress GM-CSF pathogenics are shown to correlate with monositic seizures that suppress IL-6 inflammators and poor oral pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Limphosic infiltrate has also been reported on the osteoporosis.
WHO has reviewed some test protocols for this disease.
The standard test method is a linear reaction of the polymerase transcription back real-time (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually performed on the basis of a method used by a nasal tube; however, it can also be used by a nasal or sputum.
The results usually last for hours until two days.
Blood tests can be used, but they require two samples of blood taken for two weeks, and the result is less time.
Scientists from Tingkok have been able to insulate this coronavirus and modulate its genetic sequences so that laboratories around the world can develop an independent PCR response test to detect infection by this virus.
On April 4, 2020, an antibiotic test (which could detect active infections and if someone had previously infected) was in progress, but not much has been used.
Tingkokâ€™s experience with this trial shows that only 60 to 70 percent of them were active.
The FDA in the United States agreed to the first point-of-care test on 21 March 2020 to be used at the end of that month. Diagnoses published by the University of Wuhan Hospital Zhongnan suggest a method for detecting infection based on clinical images and risk of epidemiology.
Obesity ground-glass multilobar bilaterally with peripheral distribution, asymmetry, and posterior distribution was found many at the beginning of the infection.
Subpleural domains, seizures, seizures, and seizures can occur several times.
Some data is available on the microscopic and pathophysiology COVID-19.
The main pathology finding on the otopsia is:
Macroscopic: pleuritis, pericarditis, parus consolidation, and pulmonary oedema
Four types of pneumonia virus infection can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumositis hyperplasia, major apetic pneumonia, interstitial inflammation with lymphostic infiltration, and multi-sorption of the pancreas cell
severe pneumonia: DAD damage to alveolar difus (DAD) with adhesion of the difus.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory disease (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia in the developmental stage: site defects in the alveolar and interstitial lung fibrosis
Blood: intravascular disease (DIC); leukoirebroblastic reaction
The prevention steps to reduce the possibility of infection stay at home, avoid many places, often wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practice good hygiene, and avoid touching eyes, noses, or mouth with uncleaned hands.
CDC recommends closing the mouth and nose with a tip when tapping or grinding and recommending the use of parts in the syringe if the tip is not ready.
Hygieneâ€™s right hand was restored after a stone or a resin was removed.
The CDC recommends the use of skin closures in public places, partly to limit the spread of people without violence. The social exclusion strategy aims to reduce contact with people infected with many, by shutting down schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large gatherings in public places.
The entrance to the tomb also includes people who care for at least six feet [1.8 m] or about ten feet [1.8 m] in length.
There is no known effective medicine to prevent COVID-19. Since the anti-instigation vaccine has not yet been found until early 2021, the main part of the treatment of COVID-19 is to reduce the epidemiological peaks, known as "curva diet".
CDC also recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after toilet or when their hands are exposed to dirt, before eating, and after washing their teeth, stones, or soap.
Further CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based manipulations that contain at least 60% of alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial hand manipulation is not available, WHO provides two formulas for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate the bacteria' track in alcohol; this is "not an active substance for an antisepsis.
Glycerol is added as a mixture.
People are treated with support, which can include cold therapy, oxygen support, and other vital organs that are found.
CDC recommends people who think they're carrying a virus to wear simple facial masks.
Extracorporium (ECMO) oxygen has been used to cope with the problem of malnutrition, but its benefits are still being considered.
Self - improvement, living habits, and eating habits are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive care may be useful for people with mild fever at the early stages of infection. WHO and the National Commission for Health Tingkok have issued recommendations to deal with COVID-19 diseases that are not adequately treated.
Intensified medical personnel and paramedics in the United States have recommended treatment from various societies as a free resource, i.e. IBCC.
By April 2020, there was no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For pregnancy, some of the medicinal products prefer parasetamol (astamineinofen) to be compared to ibuprofen for the first line use.
Preventive action should be taken to minimize the risk of virus spread, especially in health care arrests when performing procedures that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For the health of the COVID-19 patient, CDC recommends that the person be placed in the Tular-Old Insolation Insulation (IIR) Room (IIR) in addition to using standard prevention, contact prevention, and emergency measures. CDC provides instructions for the use of self-defense devices (APD) during the attack.
The recommended device is APD hair, respiratory or facial masks, eye protection, and medical gloves. If it is available, the respiratory (not facial masks) is better.
The N95 respiratory system is approved for industrial processing, but the FDA has authorized this mask to be used on the basis of the Authority for the Use of Darurat (USA).
The N95 respirator is designed to protect from airborne particles such as dust, but the effectiveness of certain biological agents is not guaranteed for use not mentioned on the label.
If the mask is not ready, the CDC recommends using the mask or, as a last resort, the mask itself.
Most of the COVID-19 cases are not too heavy until they need the ventilation of the mechanism or alternative, but some cases are really heavy.
The type of support for people who have experienced COVID-19 respiratory failure is actively being addressed to those who are not adequately cared for, and there is evidence that intubs can be avoided by high levels of radiation or atmospheric pressure.
It is not yet known whether one of these methods produces the same benefits for those with chronic illness.
Some doctors prefer to continue using invasive ventilation, when prepared, because this technique restricts the aerosol partial preaching compared to high breast cancer. The more serious cases occur in a person over 60 years of age, and in particular those over 80 years of age.
Many developing countries do not have a hospital bed for moderate capitals, which limits the capacity of the health system to deal with a number of cases of COVID-19 that are sufficiently damaged to require adequate maintenance.
A study in Tingkok found that 5% entered intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In Tingkok, about 30% of the COVID-19 patients who were treated were finally admitted to ICU.
Ventilation of the mechanism is becoming more complicated by acute respiratory tract syndrome (ARDS) occurring in COVID-19 and oxygen is becoming more difficult.
Ventilator capable of operating pressure control mode and PEEP high is required to maximize oxygen transmission once again minimize the risk of lung injury and the related ventilator-related pneumatoracs.
A high PEEP may not be ready for a long - term ventilator.
Research on treatment potential began in January 2020 and some antiviral drugs are being studied in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising one.
Although new drug developments may take up to 2021, some of the drugs being tested have been accepted for other uses or have been tested further.
Antivirals can be tried in people with severe diseases.
The WHO volunteers recommended to follow and try to test the efficacy and safety of potential treatment. The FDA has given temporary authorisation for convalescent plasma as experimental treatment in the case of a very or very dangerous person's life.
Convalence plasma has not yet been studied in a clinical study needed to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for this disease.
In February 2020, Tiongkok broke down the cell application to handle this disease.
User is required to enter their name and ID.
This application was unable to detect 'links' using surveillance data so that it can detect the risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the risk potential is identified, the application not only recommends quarantine standing, but also informs local health officials. Analytical analysis of phone data, facial technology, telephone tracking, and professional skills are used to track infected people and those who are in conflict with them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized the security team to track the phone numbers of people who were expected to be infected with the virus.
It was taken to treat quarantines and protect those who might be in contact with infected people.
In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared phone records with the German federal board, Robert Koch Institute, in the field of research and prevention.
Russia uses face-to-face technology to detect caranins.
Regional Health Commissioner Italia, Giulia Gallera, said he was informed by telephone operators that "40% of the citizens still move around."
The German government took action at the end of 48 hours with more than 42,000 people.
In addition, President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global commitment to creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People may experience stress due to carantine, travel closure, side effects, or fear of infection themselves.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying, "The increase in social isolation, loneliness, health, stress, and economic instability is a perfect barrier to mental health and social health."
This disease can pass slowly or without a fever, which is like breathing problems on the other side of the world, like a fever.
The practice of breast - feeding usually lasts for two weeks, while those who suffer from chronic or critical illness may need between three and six weeks to recover.
A pregnant woman may have a higher risk of COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is still low. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs to the point of pneumonia.
In the most vulnerable person, COVID-19 can rapidly develop to become acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) that causes lack of clothing, systolic fever, or failure of the major organ.
The complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clotting, and heart damage, kidney, and heart.
Unlike blood clotting, especially prothrombin increases, were observed in 6% of COVID-19 patients who were adequately treated, while the renal function was seen in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 images show transaminase.
According to the same report, the average time between pregnancy and death was ten days, with five days spent in the proper period.
However, the patients transferred to ICU had a seven - day lunch break between bedtime and death.
In a study that investigated early cases, the lunch period from the beginning to the end of death was 14 days, with a line of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) Tiongkok, men have 2.8% deaths, while women have 1.7% deaths.
A study of postmortem paru histopathology shows that alveolar damage is caused by fibromysoid alone in both pairs.
Changes in virus sytopathic properties were observed in pneumositis.
The paru image is like an acute breath syndrome (ARDS).
Of the 11.8% deaths reported by the Tingkok National Health Commission, heart damage, with increased trophynine or heart disease.
According to U.S. Maret, 89% of those who were cared for had the conditions of delivery, and the availability of medical and social resources in a region can also affect mortality.
The idea of mortality from the circumstances varies because of the differences in the region, but also because of the difficulties of methodology.
At least the solution to the cold case could lead to the loss of the number of deaths that are estimated to be too high.
However, the fact that death is the result of a past case can mean the number of mortalitys now being considered too low.
Percococs have a risk of 1.4 times greater in severe COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive treatment or death than non-smoking.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20 percent to 30% birth control on some patients who recovered from the disease, and the diagnosis showed organ damage.
This can also cause post-rehabilitated post-respiration syndrome.
Until March 2020, it has not been known whether previously infected people have given effective and long - term immunity to those who recover from this disease.
Immunities may be considered to be available, if they see other coronavirus behaviors, but they have been reported to restore COVID-19 followed by a positive coronavirus test a few days later.
This case is believed to be a serious remaining infection, not a re-infection.
This virus is believed to be natural and comes from animals, through spreading infections.
In fact, it was not until December 2019 that the world headquarters of Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses in Brooklyn, New York.
A study of 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, revealed the date of the first broadcast on December 1, 2019.
The official publication of WHO reported the first hitchhiking on December 8, 2019.
In general, some sacrifices are used to count the cost of death.
This number varies according to the region and throughout time, and is influenced by the number of tests, the quality of health care systems, the choice of nutrition options, the time from the first stage, and the character of the population such as age, type of entertainment, and overall health.
By the end of 2019, WHO established the ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for death due to the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for the death of COVID-19 diagnosed with clinical or epidemiologists without the laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. The death ratio for the case represents the number of cases of terragnosis within a specified time range.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the death rate worldwide is 6.9% (153.822/2.240.191) on 17 April 2020.
The percentage varies according to the region. Other charges include the number of cases (CFRs), which represents the percentage of people who have died from certain diseases, and the number of people who have been infected (IFRs), which represents the percentage of those who have been infected (terdiagnos and non-terragnoses) who have died from certain diseases.
This statistics are not limited to time and follow a certain population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all people are infected, the immune system can provide information about the number of people infected.
At a public epicenter in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600 people, 80 (1.7%) have died.
In Gangelt, this disease is spread through Karnaval festival, which spread to young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and probably not all deaths COVID-19 are classified as COVID-19.
More and more, the German health system has not yet been established.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as tested by blood donors.
69 people (0,004%) who were infected died from COVID-19.
Look at the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher than men in studies conducted in Tiongkok and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in the '50s, with a list of risks between the new men and women not seen at 90s.
In Tingkok, the number of deaths for men 2.8% and for women 1.7%.
There is no doubt that differences based on such factors are factors, but genetic factors and behavior may well be factors.
Immunologists vary depending on the type of pregnancy, lower prevalence of smoking on women, and men with comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, younger than women, can contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% died because of COVID-19 were men.
By April 2020, the U.S. government did not track the related data of the type of software for COVID-19 infection.
Research has shown that HIV, Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
The percentage of health officials who have a higher profile of women, especially caregivers, and they have a higher chance of being infected with the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of this disease is "COVID-19".
The leader WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO is a milestone for the corona, VI for the virus, D for the disease, and 19 for the first time identified: 31 December 2019.
This name is chosen to avoid references to certain geographic locations (such as Tiongkok), species of animals, or groups of people, in accordance with international recommendations for the prevention of stigmatisation. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called coronavirus acute equipment syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 responsible virus" in public communication.
Well, both disease and lazim virus are called coronavirus.
At the beginning of the campaign in Wuhan, Tingkok, this virus and disease are called "cronavirus" and "Cronavirus Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and acute infection 2019-nCov as a temporary name for virus and disease according to the 2015 deadline for not using the name in the name of disease and virus.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-COV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to the limitations of capacity in standard feed chain, some digital producers print health care materials such as nasal and ventilator components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital needs a ventilator locker, and the cook can't give in the time needed, a local company is going back and prints 100 needed lockers in the evening.
Following the beginning of the COVID-19 release, conspiracy theory, misinformation, and misinformation were misleading about origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of disease, which spread rapidly.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of the replication of the virus on dogs, bees, and dogs.
No medicine or vaccine has been approved to treat this disease.
International research on vaccines and COVID-19 drugs is being carried out by government organizations, academic groups, and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization examined "SOLIDARITY Trial" to examine the effect of four life-threatening antiviral treatments already in place with the most promising truth.
The vaccine has not yet been prepared, but various agencies are actively promoting the vaccine.
Previous studies on SARS-CoV were used by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 together using ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being addressed.
First, the researchers are going to make the entire virus vaccine.
The use of this virus, whether it's a good non-active or dead virus, is intended to speed up the human body's immune response to new COVID-19 infections.
The second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create vaccines that make the immune system sensitive to certain subunits on the virus.
In the SARS-CoV-2 case, this study focuses on S-spice protein that helps the virus to overcome ACE2 enzyme receptors.
The third strategy is nuclear acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, new vaccine techniques).
The experimental vaccine made with these strategies should be tested to know its safety and accuracy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a non-hazardous genetic code derived from the virus that causes disease. Antibodies have been developed as a potential challenge for the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this method is still controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials are ongoing in April 2020.
The seven tests test evaluate the treatment agreed upon for malaria, including four studies on hydrochloric acid or chloride.
The new targeted antiviral drugs form a major part of the Tingkok research, with nine phase III tests tested in remdesivir in some countries during the reporting period at the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic analysis of clinical development for vaccine candidates and COVID-19 is available. Some antiviral drugs that are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chlorokuin and hydrochloric acid, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir are combined with beta interferon.
In March 2020, there was a temporary evidence for the truth of remdesivir.
Clinical growth has been observed in patients treated with redisivir in emergency treatment.
Phase III clinical trials are being carried out in the US, Tiongkok, and Italy. Klorokuin, previously used to treat malaria, was held in Tiongkok in February 2020, with initial results.
However, there is a need for caution regarding the use of such sites.
The Korean Health Authority and Tingkok recommend the use of chloroquinine.
However, the Institute of Virology Wuhan, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, states that twice the dose is very dangerous and can be eliminated.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued authorisations for the use of hydroxychloriculin and chloroculin as a medicine to treat COVID-19 disease. The 7th edition of Tiongkok also includes interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir to be used against COVID-19.
The initial data show that the high dose of ribavirin is required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 by in vitro.
Nitazoxinide has been recommended for further in vivo studies after showing SARS-CoV-2 binding in low concentrations.Research shows that early priming on the protein to be administered by transmembran 2 (TMPRSS2) serum protease (TMPRS2) is very important to enter SARS-COV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptor.
The study of chloroquine and hydrochloriculin with or without azitromycin has a large limit that has prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The complication of sitokine can occur at COVID-19 with a serious step forward.
Tocilizumab has been included in the Tingkok National Health Commission's medical report after a small study has been completed.
This medicine is undergoing a 2nd phase test at national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe diseases.
In combination with a serum fertilization test to identify sytokin cells, this medicine is intended to fight sytokin cells, which are expected to cause death to some of the victims.
In 2017, antagonis interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid refraction syndrome induced by different causes, namely CAR T cell therapy.
To date, no definitive and controlled evidence has shown that tocilizumab is a successful treatment for CRS.
Transfering clean and improved antibiotics produced by the body of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to those who need it is being addressed as a non-vaccin passive immunosuppression method.
This strategy was tried for SARS with non-conclusive results.
The neutralisation of the virus is a working mechanism expected for passive anti-bodies therapy that can mediate defence against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cytotoxicity, which depends on antibiotics and/or faggotosis, may also be.
Other passive antibodies, such as monoclonal antibodies produced, are being developed.
Convalence cell production, which is part of the blood of patients who have recovered and contains specific antibodies to this virus, can be increased for faster use.
Coronavius disease, a associated syndrome group
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Center Hospital, was injured and died because of the COVID-19 after causing the spread of the virus.
