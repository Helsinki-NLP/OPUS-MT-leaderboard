The Prime Minister of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been visiting his first important foreign visit since his election in May to discuss economic and security relations with his Japanese colleagues Shinzo Abe in Tokyo.
Mr Modi is on a five-day journey to Japan to establish economic relations with the world's largest economic nation.
Plans for enhanced technical cooperation are above all on the agenda.
In addition to reports, India hopes for a treaty on defence cooperation between the two nations.
Karratha police hold 20-year-olds after fast motorcycle jam
A motorcycle was stolen after the driver had driven it 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and by Buschland to get the police out of Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after they had observed it, as it left a tank station on the Bathdate Road with 125 km/h.
The police report that the driver then ignored the signal and went on the Burgess Road before he left in the country where the officers lost it from the eyes.
The bike as well as a person who spoke to the driver's description were later seen at a house in Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
Karratha's police accused a 20-year-old man of not observing a stop signal and of being unrecognizable.
He will appear before the court in Karratha on 23 September.
The engine wheel was secured and seized for three months.
George Webster accused of hotel abuses in Naim and Pitlochry
A man stands before the court because of the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was charged with hearing from the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is charged with the rape of a woman in Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
The complaint suggests that Webster attacked her, while she "was unconscious, unable to signal, and could not understand."
In addition, Webster is expected to have raped a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish Highland on May 4, 2014.
The Court of Justice, Lady Rae, set the negotiating deadline for 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Relating to the very American idea of labour rights as human rights
Congressman Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions as a citizen.
"As trade unions die, the middle class dies," said Elison, a democracy from Minnesota and the deputy president of the Progressive Caucus at the Congress.
That is why I am proud to present the Staff Regulations with the Ombudsman, John Lewis.
This law is breaking down by law, workers have equal legal opportunities for discrimination because of the organization of trade unions as well as other forms of discrimination, and thus ceases anti-fellowship forces.
The addition of the national labour law in order to create an opportunity for discrimination-based workers to organize a trade union representation in order to appeal before a civil court to obtain justice - and to obtain compensation or punishment - is a meaningful and necessary initiative.
But there is certainly no radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Elison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their legislative proposals propose is to link the link back to a very American idea.
Despite the delays that the trade unions had experienced in the past years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country - Americans have encouraged countries around the world to recognize, extend and retain labour rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans were still reminded of what this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of speech and freedom of expression and the right of association.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that military autocratic Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full recognition that the workers and their associations played a role in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognized that "the rights of workers to unite and co-operation and trade are guaranteed."
When the United States defeated Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff forced the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Fascism Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that workers would have to organize themselves and to raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans added a clause which explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations to ensure and improve working and economic conditions is guaranteed to each individual and to each profession or company.
Agreements restricting or restricting this right are null and void; they are illegal.
When former Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the presidency over the International Commission for Human Rights, which was designed by the General Declaration of Human Rights, as it was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "every person has the right to form or participate in cooperation in the protection of his interests."
Since generations, Americans have accepted the reason that labour rights are human rights.
When this country tells other countries how civil and democratic societies can be formed, Americans say that the right to establish a partnership - and that it should be protected from collective negotiations as equal partners with companies and government agencies - must be protected.
After these rights have been created in America under a decision, it is actually very clear that the American ideal should be re-directed, so that the working population must have the right to unite and become a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the movement of workers has not limited the strength of the nation, but has increased it.
Through the introduction of the standard of living of millions of people, work has created a market for industry in a wonderful way, and the whole nation has grown to an unprecedented level of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
The story reminds us, and we should do the same.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' communications - is far too far-fetched.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renewed the ideals that the United States has made in the past and broke the promise of democracy.
The judge temporarily suspended the law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana might be forced to close
On Sunday, a U.S. federal prosecutor suspended the application of a law in Louisiana, stating that it might have led to the closure of all five state operating clinics.
This measure, which was adopted by Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, on June 1st, and should enter into force on September 1st, would force doctors to acquire a patient's admission right at a hospital within a 30-mile radius to acquire their practice.
The decision of the Director, however, means that doctors can continue to carry out legal proceedings on a temporary basis while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law while striving to obtain these rights," the Federal Court of Justice John de Gravelles wrote in his judgment.
Within one month a hearing will be held for the judge to make a more lasting decision for the law.
Derogation advocates welcomed the decision, the most recent in a series of judgements against similar measures, and said that doctors had spent more time in order to obtain hospital registration rights.
"Today's decision means that the women in Louisiana have passed a permanent law that wants to take their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and president of the reproductive rights centre, who was charged on behalf of three of the five hospitals in the state to maintain the law.
It was not clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the complaint and had also applied for the right of notification.
Louisiana is one of 11 countries which have passed similar laws, where courts have recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi for non-constitutional reasons.
Key clauses of a law in Texas, which had forced most of the hospitals in the state to close, were terminated on Friday by a federal judge.
The U.S. College of Ostreticians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association agree that the rights of doctors require unnecessary restrictions.
In contrast, the measures to protect women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of closure of clinics, are opposed to the fact that measures are intended to protect women's health.
Only a doctor who conducts operations in Louisiana has patient rights, shared the reproductive rights centre.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to do no more operations, this doctor would no longer be afraid to carry out the operation for his safety, the group said.
In its argument against the Court, the representatives of the Louisiana State said that they would not punish doctors for conducting investigations while their applications for patient authorisation were still pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher rates of death by Eirstockrebs in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James made a video show for her mother online, who died in 2007 at Eierstockkrebs.
For women in the rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from Eirstock cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians who were diagnosed with Eirstock cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent of the five years after the diagnosis were still in existence.
Research director Susan Jordan of QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk during the study was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
KLEINE STUDIE: New medicines may slow down lung and kidney cancer
The researchers studied the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, the type of kidney cancer, existing predispositions, and the social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
For older women and those who had advanced cancer at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk was 20 per cent higher than for those in urban areas during the study.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city die of higher risk of Eirstock cancers, Dr. Jordan suggests a late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible.
"This disease is best treated by gynaecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services in order to counter the removals, they proposed, as possible, strengthening the service of trained doctors to give specialists the opportunity to provide women closer to their homes, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study, independent of geographical status, gave a poor long-term life rate in women in Eirstockreb and underlined the need for better treatment and precautionary strategies.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is now published in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother from the Gold Coast, learned that she had a aggressive form of icestock cream.
Unmatched home allocations of garden centres
The return, together with an increased number of households under 35 years of age, could lead to the loss of 10 thousand cents per year if today’s young consumers are reporting on a study of HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, the "Cerneral Group for Garden Products".
The report states that renters spend an average of 55 per cent of their income on people with their own property for their garden.
The increase in people living in high urban areas without gardening, the popular procedure to try to escape parking and the low garden sizes are other factors that threaten the industry, estimated at $5 billion annually in sales.
In London, London, where the share of household owners has decreased from 61 to 43 per cent over a period of 6 years, the minimum expenditure for garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society indicate that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people can't draw plants.
Guy Barter, head of the RHS, said: "Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants, because they can take their plants in exchange."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden Timer" of garden retail trade due to increasing household and economic well-being from the late 1980s to the mid-90s.
In addition, he predicted a better market situation for this year because of the better weather following adverse weather conditions in March and April last year.
The opposition policy of Imran Khan and the spiritual Tahirul Qadri protest movement in Pakistan continues.
In the capital, Islamabad, about 1,000 demonstrators have beaten the state television channel PTV.
Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have forced the protesters again from PTV buildings.
The sender introduced his operation for about 40 minutes, but in the meantime he sent it again.
At the same time, some 3,000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Around a kilometer away, they delivered them with sticks and stones equipped with security forces.
The police set up trains.
The demonstrators asked Sharifs to come back, but he did.
The country's army therefore has a political solution to the conflict, "without time to waste and use no violence".
After a meeting at the headquarters of the Sunset, the military said: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already played more frequently.
The opposition politician, Imran Khan, invites Prime Minister Sharif to participate in the parliamentary elections last May.
The protests were held weekly, after Khan and Qadri had called their supporters to order Sharif's residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey orders US diplomat for spy reports
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has commissioned the country's largest US diplomats to publish a report on American and British spying in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said the U.S. and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German Magazine The mirror as well as the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former US analysts of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a major area of activity for the US and British Secret Service.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyyip Erdogan showed the importance of the report and said that all important countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report that also had the most important secret service of Germany's Ankara in the visit provided for significantly worse reactions from the Turkish government.
Warnstreik: Heads of the ship with consequences for Pendler
The federal warning line of the leader at the Montagabend could also affect the traffic of people in NRW.
All transport companies, including remote, regional and S-road transport, shall be informed by the customs authorities for the period from 18 to 21 hours.
The main direction of the warning line is freight.

said the president of the German company Lokomotivführer (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We're counting on major disasters.
Regional issues do not give rise to this.
The main direction of the warning line is the freight traffic.
The German train in NRW announced to do everything to keep the effects as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where they wanted to strike, so it was difficult to predict the consequences.
Police chief of the magaluf of corruption accused
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence of arrest by the police and officers of the city of Calvia.
Calvia's chief of police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after corruption by business people and barbets in the famous Binge-Drinking Hotspot Magaluf.
Commissioner-General José Antonio Navarro was arrested after corruption by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most bars and night clubs of Magaluf are located.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of arrests by the police and officers of the city of Calvía on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the purposes of corruption and were questioned together with Navarro by a judge.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that the late night club owners claimed that the authorities' weather economy had a serious impact on their business.
"It's not about money, it's about survival," said one of the business people to the court.
Leave our base of life out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
In this summer, Magaluf made an official YouTube video on international hits, in which an 18-year-old British tourist was shown, who completed 24 men during a summer tour of Fellatio.
The island authorities have either tried to stop the improper behaviour of alcohol-encumbered runners in Magaluf by reducing the number of participants to the popular alcohol-deprived knopentours.
The Playhouse Club, in which the Fellatio accident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the Kneipentour-Organiser Carnage were to pay a penalty of € 55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort Magaluf, especially among young British passengers, is also known for alcohol-induced accidents, including the trend of "balconing", when people jump from a balcony to another or from a balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring with nasal and slum weather conditions affected flights from Adelaide Airport
The FURTHERING has protected South Australia's winter surprise, with heavy shadows and strong winds, which affected flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening, up to 21 hours more 5mm rain falls on the city, after 6,6mm, which had already gone down in the night to the sun.
The last snowfall was the result of a series of short, sturmic watches, including a cave which started just 20 hours ago and provided for nearly 4mm of snowfall in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week had provided for an early dose of Frühlling, the city’s temperatures fell again on Monday at a maximum of 15.8°C.
The high weather conditions have probably led to the delayed landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The aircraft should have landed shortly after 19.30 a.m., but it was hit by a wind - a sudden change in the speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start.
Windstorms reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft also had to be launched at a second landing and finally stopped at about 20.40.
The delay led to the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
Adelaide has a maximum temperature of 16°C on Tuesday, with possible visibility.
Mathies means: the highest time for big networks
In view of the progressive technical progress that makes our pleasant home change in high-tech switch control, our Colonist Bernd Mathies is disappointed with a highly trusted electronic accessory.
While I write this here, my eyes fall on the spiral cable that connects the ear to the phone, and I think: Boah, how is retro that?
But then there's a misunderstanding: If the cable hadn't been, in a short time all the ears would have flown out in the house, and that would be even more significant retro.
However, it is applicable to the eclectronic (electronics)?
No, typing error: electronic) Sector has changed the rule that the world's newness of today's electricity cut is tomorrow.
And whoever, for example, still has a thief in the living room, just says he's basically refused TV.
Why are these assumptions?
Because this week, our absolute incompetence in matters of electronics brings us to the conclusion of the Ifa's call.
The Laie, the former secretly controlled washing machine and CD player, does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread to him by an incredible expert: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press station.
Yeah, is it still going?
What should you talk about with people who freely spread such a circle?
The reason is that it has been around 20 years, especially since we are going to be able to connect our house.
So that the Joghurt himself will be paid to inform us at the time of the holiday of the Maledives that it is burning in the working room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we from the office from the air conditioning on our cheap arrival ...?
Yes, but this is a climate situation.
But a dream will certainly come true at first: We have our armrest, she says, "Saugen!" - and at home the dust grower leaves.
Come on.
Everything runs on nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are broken," a factory identifier, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steam garage sends the weather report and shows how long the pizza still needs it, but it doesn't work because we're in town.
From the daily practice we also know: If a modern device is really needed, the battery is guaranteed empty.
What is another reason that the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next feature exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air-protection rooms, during the 50th day of the war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza, while the area recovered from the wars.
The school started bringing joy and hope to the communities drawn by rocket fires in southern Israel, but the signs of the wars are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, a staff member of the "Passosh" Kindergarten, who was hit by a rocket, met the student Granatslitter from the walls and sidewalks.
"We're a little scared, but they're upset," said Ronit Bart, a resident of the Kibbutz Saad and other English teachers there.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Your 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart said it felt like "a little funny" to go back to school.
"That was difficult times, and we have never left the house," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the Gaza border to provide his support.
Until a cease-fire in the last week, thousands of residents of the border communities like Saad remained in their homes or left their homes to escape safely from Gaza and to escape the rocket and deadly fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a municipality near the border to Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian Morsegranate, still hesitate to return.
The Ministry of Education announced that about a dozen families had not returned.
Their children were temporarily transferred to other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu visited a school in Sderot, a border city in Gaza, which is severely marked by the Palestinian occupation.
He called on the children to learn a lot and said, "We will make sure that your knowledge is acquired and will provide you with security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on a non-resistance of arms in the past service day.
The gunfire provided for an immediate end of the war; however, important problems remained unresolved, as the demand for Hamas after a suspension of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarmament of the Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in battle.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt this month.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of civilians, and at least 494 children were killed according to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel maintains this information and considers that at least half of the deaths are about combatants, but did not provide any specific facilities for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar grenades during the fighting on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military led more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or damaged thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools built in temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and cease fighting, the educational authorities have moved the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will be reopened soon so that we can learn more, like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who lives in a school in Gaza City.
After selection in Saxons: CDU-Vize Strobl issues NPD procurement procedures
In view of the loss of voice by the NPD in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvise Thomas Strobl spoke for the end of the ongoing NPD opposition procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvise Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition procedure against the NPD before the Federal Constitutional Court should be finalised.
"The NPD cuts worse than the last time," said Strobl, who is also head of the CDU country in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger People's newspaper".
This is a happy development in the right direction and a development that makes me more aware of the outcome of the political fight against the NPT and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD was divided almost completely into five per cent hearts at Sunday's vote.
The first ban on the right-wing party was lifted in 2003 because the constitutional protection was also in the NPD-Spetz.
In December 2013, the Federal Council issued a new application in Karlsruhe after further preparation.
The Federal Government and the Federal Day are not closed.
Harburg: Rare for new refugees
In the new country, refugees are now being forced into cells.
The central reception for refugees in Harburg is located in all the snow.
Now the internal authority has set up three cells of the Red Cross.
The regional politicians were first informed - they were less interested.
"These hauruck actions further ensure that citizens and regional politicians are not able to contribute constructively to the human contribution of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, president of the Greens in the Harburg Regional Assembly.
Its party calls for the regional administration of Harburg to provide homeless housing.
96 refugees can be transferred to the three cells.
Reasons for filling in the recovery are the demand of aid seekers - and the condition that the authorities cannot provide sufficient seats in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
The main prizes have experienced the strongest winter increase in seven years, shows a constant watch-up index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for owners in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 per cent in August, so the RP data from Monday.
With this increase, the total increase in June, July and August is 4.2 per cent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than doubled as the increase in 12 months until August 2013, but the increases were not distributed equally over the country.
The research leader of RP Data, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne were pursuing a double market.
The figures from RP Data show that the main prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 per cent last year, while in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices increase by an average of five and six percent.
On the other end of the scale is Canberra, which has been severely affected by state expenditure cuts and where prices increase by only 1.4 per cent over the year.
Mr Lawless further said that with the spring start, for the next few months there would be an increase in the real estate sales that would be subject to "a real test".
"If you take into account the steady high rate of auction prices, a general fast sales rate and the steady low interest rate, it is likely that the ownership increase will continue in the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the new press, he contradicts the statements of the manager of the business, Peer Medau, and certifys that he is "as a field hero".
That's not the style of college, it's the message.
So if the Medau family had already been informed about the views of the University in June.
The statement that the plans were only announced in July is definitely wrong," says Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that there is no "predictions or even decisions" in the plans, but there is "preferences".
The construction of the narrow road in addition to the castle is also less dramatic than the Medaus.
It was a nine-metre wide street, and it's not the talk.
It goes to the current position of 5.50 meters, which is a meter wider than before," Pötzl explains.
The argument of Medau employees that their free and school parking areas in the future are used only by students of the university, does not want Pötzl to apply.
The park is not going to be reached because it can be resolved intelligently as in other public parks.
Think About the People
The children's peaks, which are located on the ground, and which would lead to long access to Parkdeck, are to be "not affected by" according to the President of the University.
There is much to think about, "that this is not only about the children's clothes, but also about the people at the invitation to the Friedrich-Streib-Street Street and the 800 students of the nearby real school.
It is therefore much more than the partial interests of Mr Medau," Pötzl said.
Whether the criticism of the parentheses of the children, with the development of the street, would be entitled to "lost a few natural-believing patches of Coburgs", "the reader can decide for himself".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the State Bauamt Bamberg, wants to inform the city councils about the constructive development of the University by 2020 "and in this context the importance of the new creation" will be reflected.
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the children's seizures last week about the plans of the university.
Then the access to the new park should not lead to the campus and the Friedrich Streib Street, but to the Medau Mountains.
This meant that the narrow road had to be constructed on about one kilometer length twice.
According to the calculations of Medaus, traffic in the park of Castle Hohenfels would be reduced.
Of about 2000 vehicles, the talk is daily.
On the side of the city, you didn't want to go out on the project.
Glandorf returns from Handball National Mission
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31st year of the Federal List of SG Flensburg-Handewitt led to this decision in particular health problems.
The decision has not been easy for me, it has been attacked over several months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and finish my career in the National Mission," the World Master shared on his Facebook page from 2007.
So he goes with a balance of 167 country games and 576 tours for Germany in international peace.
Because the professional backroom player for the champions-League winners from Flensburg has been trying to go to Torejagd for a few years, he is now no longer available to the new German Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelandn, who announced his framework for the country's games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf conducted a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and actions have inspired me just as much as they will be loved by my long-term players and my followers.
But for my club, I would also like to be healthy in the coming years, for which longer regeneration breaks are needed, which do not allow the current double taxation.
The left-hand man had to fear his career after an infection in 2012.
Because of the problems of Achilles' vision, he had been able to treat himself with a cortisone sprite, which later dissolved a strong dispersion.
A note-up and two other inputs followed.
Glandorf then announced a complaint against the human race, which ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national missionary careers go to no body without question.
I have some health facilities that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infections-related foot operations that occurred in the short term in 2012, I never got my blood pressure right in the grip.
Here are some other sexual complaints.
At the beginning of the year, I have noticed that I control my head, but my body cannot shut," Glendorf explained in the interview with the magazine "Handball Time".
For a comeback, he would only be in absolute emergency.
"If all the cracks are gone, I'm always ready to talk," the two family heads told the shop.
However, I can count the years in which I can play handball at one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have also become quite depressed about my health.
After my career, I want to be able to go at least a few steps.
In addition to the 2007 WM title and the 2014 win of the League champions, he won the EHF Pokal in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012 he also assured himself with Flensburg of the European pocalation of the pocalizer.
German economy broken by 0.2 per cent in the morning
The crises around the globe have broken the German economy in the second quarter.
The gross domestic product fell from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter by 0.2 per cent.
It shared with the Statistical Office and thus confirmed provisional calculations.
Only the consumer lived the economy in the spring, while the investment returned.
The external trade also brought the conjuncture to a halt.
A total of 0.8 per cent of GDP compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "Munsterland-Mooiste", which was first held on Sunday by the City of Burgmanns.
The Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced an invasion of the Dutch "Fietzenfarer" on Sunday.
The largest sports association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Munsterland Mooiste".
This is the largest route across the country of Münster, the railway paradise near the Netherlands.
Over 1,000 participants thanked Jos der Hueren for organizing this round trip through the country.
Written in various professional journals, this tour has been offered interestingly.
We come from the light and are traveling through the night to take part in this journey.
We also want to learn more about this kind of country," the bikers rejoiced over the route through the streets of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After the registration in the Conciliation of the Defence Forces Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace road" through the city over the Wall, where the start followed.
The route, which was written for three different categories, further led to the direction of Herrenholz on the Schöppinger Mountain in the direction of Coesfeld and on Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometres with 1175 altitudes, 120 kilometres with 1475 altitudes and 145 kilometres with 1775 altitudes, the bikers prove their good condition.
They were assigned to Havixbeck and Billerbeck along the way.
Chief organizer Jos der Hueren and mayor Heinz Lölfing were very pleased with the achievements of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a wonderful experience for all those involved.
The organization loved no problems and there were no negative events," says Heinz Lölfing, a positive phase of this event.
Unfortunately, there were not as many participants as the organizer expected, possibly on the bad weather forecast and on the morning rain.
"We will see us again in the summer of 2015 in hopefully beautiful weather on 30 August or during another weekend," but the driver still promises to return to Münster and the organizers plan a new surface.
Konstantin Weckers Unbelievably Honorable Memory
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which has brought Konstantin Wecker, singer, pacifist, political activist, former prisoner, in "Man and War" on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more meditation festivals for meditation festivals, the Munichn born on 1 June 1947 signed his memoirs, each chapter is inserted by an appropriate song text.
And he is honest in this: from the Annan as a Gymnasian to the loading stake and drug consumption he leaves no human weakness.
Also to show how he has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow humans.
Widespread space also takes abstracts, but so important concepts: love, soul, ego, who is present in spirituality - all that he tries to walk on the basis of very philosophical, but also very personal.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - as well as how he has not only been subjected to music (the opera fan became a solo and rock musician), but also his prison life.
Later, the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker also brought near the ascetic monk, who is created "by subtraction", as he says, "to abandon all unnecessary things".
Among all the high-level views, there are also short anecdotes on the earth: some about skiings in a local frequented by GIs or a driving car, where he ordered a tree at the front.
Even here he's absolutely honest.
Lenny Henry: My father didn't take me in the arms.
Didn't say "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died as Henry 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry tries for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was created from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with vivid tunes.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is thinking about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to get to know him.
One never saw his face, only heard his voice, "Hear with power.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to see Cricket.
My older brother Seymour and Hilton - who had grown up when I was a child - walked with him into the shoes and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket glass.
I've never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life was this serious type in the corner that read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a pipeline in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than in his father's time, he won a glimpse of how life could have been for him.
Now it's a little brighter, but they're dark, dreamy, deep sleek labyrinths with flamenx and smoke and lots of noise.
My father had just settled in the Valley earlier and then could hear him sing slowly as he started singing because he could wash the dishes from himself.
When I came back there, it became clear to me that he had done it for years to bring the food to the table, and my attention in front of him grew bigger.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without the words of his parents ’ love.
My father didn't hug me, he didn't say, "I love you."
As soon as it went wrong with my mother at the end of her life, we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had lost as a child.
Can you stop with the "I love you"?
Stop bothering me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It's still a friend of France, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
That's what contributed to her death.
When I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "They must be radical.
So I went through this fitness and also had to make a dramatic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's intense.
No one likes Karotten.
Henry's career change may show itself in his elegant, short-cut bar.
Since being believed by the critics for his Othello, he has been joined by the theatre.
It followed the comedy of the raids, and then funds from August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the Sitcoms and Comedys who have fulfilled their business life.
He started working in a factory when he was only 16 years old.
A DJ discovered him at the stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the middle of the seventeenth year. "I was for a very long time the only black imitator/Comedian in the television."
He learned in the profession.
I had to grow not only in front of the public but also from 1975 to 1985, how I could become an efficient white history machine, while I was a star by television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the right to be on the Black and White Minstrel Show, an easy entertainment program in which people were "blacked", Henry carried out his comedy there over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I wanted something that would never happen, but I'm not sure I did.
It was a unique, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on rice projects with and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "year-old priced light salt of British television" was also a "great parody of black people."
Through the introduction of figures, which inspired both the British black culture and celebrated, Henry worked in the eight cities at an alternative comedy circle.
The first line of Lenny Henry Show was sent in 1984, and he was known among the nine, among others, as chef Gareth Blacklock in the Comedys series Chief!.
Advertisement, documentary films, TV series and film roles won his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought, "What do you do as next, Len, because it feels like it's all as if you just spend time or get a little on the spot?"
Then came a series of documents for Radio 4 with the title What's So Great About ...?
The first consequence is Shakespeare.
I was actually allergic to Shakespeare.
I never really learned about him in school, and I held him too much for a domain of the middle class, white in slurfhouses and a coal head in front of it.
So I was very worried about it.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench said, "You should try it once.
Don't do it wrong if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few words into your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare like that.
Henry took 20 lines from Othellos last talk for the documentary and was excited.
I felt like I could make it.
It was almost as if someone had put my head in the right direction.
"That's why it's a serious matter, take it seriously, learn your text, research a bit.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece a month before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car crash, and it just didn't happen.
And soon he's in the comedy of the raids.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre and I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinct to keep the audience.
"A little voice said to me, "You have to break 10 minutes now while they repair the computer."
Instead, the tour guide announced that the presentation continued as soon as the problem was resolved.
I went from the stage and something in me said, "Oh, God, thank you."
I'm not responsible for this.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a theater, so stay in your role."
Henry in Finance at Duchess Theatre
The text for learning finance was demanding.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the vision.
That also came well, so it's like a great shame of the gods who say to me, "This is your determination."
He says this, of course, with a DONERNDING voice.
So I'll stay.
I really love it.
I love being in a sample room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation has been followed by humorous explosions, while he always imitates people again.
I have decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I think this kind of immediate satisfaction from a hall full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you're always looking for it, you're driving ahead of a wall.
I sometimes start living in Apollo when I'm interested in it, but I don't care much as much as I used to.
I'll ask him if he'll make a stand-up comedy tour again.
The pleasure I have in a room with a director, who helps to form a beginning, a medium and the end of a trip - I don't think I want to do that again.
So is this his new incarnation here?
I think so.
I like a actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block streets in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between the Swiss Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Huthis called for civil disobedience in the capital of Sanaa.
Huthi angels had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a speaker of the Huthi Party said "Ansar Allah".
The access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media reported on a traffic accident in the capital.
According to the online release of the "Yemen Post" newspaper, Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthhi called on the measures on Sunday afternoon.
Huthi, after stating the sheet with a further breakdown of the conflict, should not comply with its requirements.
The Scythian Huthis fight for more independence from Sunni-regulated Yemen and demand the return of the government.
The Huthi people's tribe has been stocking the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
About 30,000 rebels have created protest camps on the great route to Sanaa.
In the surrounding country, there is still a bloody fight with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registers offices to accommodate "responsive"
Kenya has begun to register all state officials biometrically in order to remove "guaranteed" from the government's accounts list.
Staff members who would not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid received a notification from the government.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still receive payments from the public service after their decision.
President Uhuru Kenyatta made a commitment to combat corruption in the public service at his office in 2013.
At the beginning of this year, it was found that at least $1 million (700,000) per month had been lost by payments for "reimbursed" and by other miscellaneous financial practices.
The government suspects that prisoners will continue to be paid to accounts after a person has died or leaves the public service, Wadwa Chebusiri reports to the BBC from Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations is included in a government message.
All those who would not do this without a convincing apology would be cut off from the balance sheet, the message continued to be heard.
"This action will contribute significantly to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of officials and also adjusting the balance sheet at both levels of government - thus eliminating the "incentives"," said Anne Waiguru, the Cabinet Secretary in the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal against the Art Counsellor Helge Achenbach will be negotiated for the first time before the Court on 11 November.
Five inheritances of Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, require EUR 19.4 million damage from Achenbach and two of its companies in insolvency proceedings in a civil process at Düsseldorf.
That was the case with a judge on Monday.
In the classic book, Achenbach has contributed to the purchase of works of art and timers and calculated Berthold Albrecht’s purchase prices higher than the actual price actually paid.
This would also make the agreed provision higher.
Achenbach has purchased for 121 million euro securities for Albrecht.
Children Need Wings and Flights
He was in debt for 44 years, 23 of which he served as head of the school.
From this time on, Manfred Richter has been known as many Peterhouses and Colbachers from his time as a student.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always motivated by his efforts to see people in the student.
The snowflake is the most famous mountain in the Riegenge Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motive of his home.
Director was born in 1930 in Trauteau/Northböhmen, today Trutnov.
He had already been interested in the school for four years.
A year later, the Southern Germans were eligible.
Within half an hour the family had to leave her home.
After a few months in a camp, it arrived in 1946 in Bayern - in the Guterwagon.
So it hit the judge into the U.S. Senken village.
The education took place in Bamberg.
In addition, Manfred Richter had to walk six times a week to the next train station, take the train to Bamberg, where three kilometers across the city to school and return to the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter received a bedtime opportunity in a Red Cross home in Bamberg, along with up to 15 students in a bedroom.
In 1951, he made the first and three years after his first grade, the second state exams.
Since Oberfranken had no free teaching establishment for him, he went to Oberbayern and came to the school in Kolbach on November 1, 1954.
The "Fruulein Room" was his first "service" in the school house.
In 1958 he attended a three-room service in the newly built teaching house next to the school.
This house was purchased by Manfred Richter in 1980, after the school was dissolved in Kolbach in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kolbach in the Petershausen-Kollbach school band and five in Petershausen.
From the year 1968/69, these were collected in Petershausen in today's Council.
When the Indersdorf school was founded, only the primary school remained in place.
To get back to the lower school, the then Rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
However, Petershausen grew up, and thus the children and their teachers were able to relate to today's building, which was extended in 1997 after the Director's pension.
Manfred Richter commends the uncomplicated generosity of the then Mayor Ludwig Götz, who also built a workshop at Community costs and in the extension of 1997 as well, although it was not available under the School Building Guidelines.
"Citizen Master God was very good at school," the judge recalled.
In his entire career, Manfred Richter never forgot the speech of a government representative who had responded to a lecture by a schoolmate on justice and justice: "I can never forget love." Manfred Richter said what he had heard there as a young teacher.
"I have to bring up the children twice: wings and birds," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to learn, "This doesn't always work." Whether he's just his students or his own six children, it's not quite clear.
In any case, Director Tun was sometimes unconventional.
When the disciples were in trouble, they did not receive any work from him, nor were they allowed to sit next to him.
At the expense of the community, judges had allowed two pairs of boxing shoes to be obtained and allowed the two competitors to meet each other, even if there was to be a difference.
For the benefit of the school, judges as Rector made a good relationship with the former mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the partial judge after his retirement to apply at least 1996 to the CSU list for the Community.
However, the judge was selected six at a time and attended the CSU.
180 kilometres in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 bicycle drivers are located in Bad Salzhausen and Shots Interstop
If the bikers are making their trip in Bad Salzhausen or Shots, it is nothing special to each other.
On Friday, however, the number of passengers was unique: the 700 participants of the hr4-roudangur and the accompanying trip enjoyed a break in the basement of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under free sky in the Scottish Alteburg Park.
Under the motto "Radel and celebrate new paths between Nedda and Kinzig" the participants had met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and there lived a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it was serious: the bikers took the first step, 60 kilometers across Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and then to shots in attack.
In Bad Salzhausen, the sportsmen of Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started with the bike in Bad Vilbel, were welcomed by the owner of Bad Salzhausen, Petra Swing Doöring.
To refresh bodies and spirits, all the good things were prepared: The rural women from Ranstadt and Lower Mockstadt had 85 bleches of apples, vegetables, strawberries and cheeses that made the beautiful bikers wonderful.
"That kind of kitchen can only bacon farmers," a participant from Alendibach praised, while he ordered another piece.
In the drinking state of the Towerverein Geish-Nidda, cold refreshments could be created.
The "Duo Bravo" includes visitors with famous tunes from operas and musicals and excited applause.
The beautiful atmosphere of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman recently told his partner: "What he has earned, he has finally re-confirmed already broken bicycle chains today."
Therefore, the mayor and the executive director had to work still: they were interviewed at the fountain in front of the reporter Rainer Janke and used the opportunity to rent on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Also, Chief of Promotion Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4-roudour 2004 as a tour guide, was able to move only briefly, but he had enough to do with the technology in front of the site.
His pickup pressure, in which he, through three telephones and a functional device with his staff and the 15-head motorcycle staff of the police, communicated, wrote Facebook entries and reported, also needed a check.
"The majority of participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from Gieten or Fulda, from Lauterbach or Taunus, and even from many cities in Westfallen, bicycles are angels.
The number of participants shall be limited to the available overnight capacity.
In Category I, the participants are transferred to hotels, in category II in meeting rooms.
From the short, the bikers had a good impression when they woke up after one and a half hours, saying, "Shut!"
"It was beautiful in Bad Salzhausen!" they waited for a divorce.
After arriving in Scotland, the group had to take a short break.
But at night the bikers were asked in the idyllic Alteburg park.
Under the reign of the Scottish Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS), the park had a beautiful festival environment and, of course, Leckereie was prepared, such as flammcuins with well-skinned federal whites.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC President Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs, as member of the ADAC Hessen-Turingen, welcomed the visitors.
The three appeared to be happy about the "many operations in shock".
DJ Tobias Hagen subsequently released the dance pool.
The opportunity to move freely under the free sky was used in spite of the sporting activity on the bike.
Among the guests, there were increasing suspicions of citizens, who were also affected by the good vote as well as the large share of the driver.
On the second day, the trainers stood at the stations Birstein, Wächersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the trainers - on the program.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of Radelns, the athletes again met in Bad Vilbel.
Tens of thousands of Turkish police officers against the government
In total, 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey because of the suspicion of the "conspiracy against the government", local media agencies reported.
The police authorities did not comment directly.
Among the arrests are 14 high-ranking police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government employees, including four government ministers in last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested because they reportedly established an organized criminal union and had called telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (the then Prime Minister) described her actions as part of the activities of the Islamic Spiritual Fethulla Golden against him and others in power positions.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Schools were opened almost everywhere in Ukraine on Monday (September 1st) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had opened up to him, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not everywhere peaceful over Ukraine.
We have to fight for a peaceful heaven.
The entire Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people's front, has to fight for a peaceful heaven.
Aleksan Pastukhow, head of the school in Slawjansk, who visits Jazenyuk's daughter, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will once again prevail here and that children will receive a education that will benefit them in their future lives.
The first day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, where the children wear tight pants, hold balloons in their hands and give their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets with a proud silence from the banking world, the media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own experience.
Her career began with the global management consulting company Bain and Co., where she changed to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearson.
She was president of the Financial Times for seven years and returned when the top posts of the parent company Pearson went to a younger male colleague.
Your recovery amounted to almost 1 million £.
Her political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended by David Cameron of Lord Browne, the former president of BP when she looked for more private economic knowledge in Whitehall: she became the head of the cabinet.
Her husband is a former member of the Tory Council.
Already in May, I described the position of the president with a broken neck.
Not only is the BBC a huge and complex unity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: through the first guard of the own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outside as a voice of public concern and anxiety when things go wrong.
This provides for almost unsustainable dualol, which requires a comprehensive reform.
But what new presidents would risk, take part, agree on everything, and join an institution, which is as complex as a Chinese Dynasty, while perhaps he himself is doing his job.
It's a difficult task.
And if that isn't enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC reduced - power, money and status exceed.
As competition draws closer and new technologies threaten old, comfortable security, the ongoing negotiation of license fees for the BBC is linked to special risks.
For the estimated amount of £145.50 per year, the British public buys into the world’s largest media business.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households and costs only 40 pounds per day.
And apparently the BBC is rising on the popularity scale again: 53% today, compared to 31% 10 years ago.
The sight and usage habits for BBC have changed: I get news messages today on my phone and see past programs later on my iPlayer.
But she remains a very loved and considerate institution.
She needs an important president - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says he wasn't authorized to take his tweet.
On Sunday, a tweet from the official account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, included a significant comment on the democratic state of the province, which is in the middle of a criminal charge against him because of the abuse of the office.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another perry's user account, which deleted the previous one.
Gerade has been sent a tweet from my account that was not authorized by me.
"I won't pay the tweet and I've deleted it," said the later news.
Perry's staff did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the tweets of Perry's official user account were issued, it was not clear who was actually paying for the feed.
In the previous tweet, an unprecedented picture of the district council of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn, which was condemned in April 2013.
Perry introduced a Veto against a financial promotion of her office when she refused to return what could be a complaint against Perry - the perhaps 2016 presidential candidate - in front of a Grand Jury this month in Austin.
The text of the tweet says: "I don't always drink with the three-fold permissible alcohol supply ... but if I do, I complain to Governor Perry when he spreads it."
I'm the most popular Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not entrusted with the investigation of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special government lawyer from San Antonio, who was elected by a Republican judge.
Perry complains not guilty and called the charges a political trick.
His high-class team of lawmakers called on the judge concerned to dismiss the charges and argued that the law against the most powerful governor in the history of the state of Texas is inconsistencies.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state funds to the State's Public Integrity Unit - which is located in Travis County and reported in cases of state corruption in Texas - refused to return as Lehmberg.
This Veto provided for a public complaint from a left-hand watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After he had finished at the elections in Iowa during his presidential candidacy 2012 as a fifth, Perry agreed on speculation that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself at jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, let's come!"
Berkeley explains the housing market again for "normal"
One of London's most prominent construction entrepreneurs pointed out that the housing market in southern England was "reversible" again at normal level.
Owners in the main city were warm and the object of enormous prices, which moved the bank of England to set up mortgage credits in June because of the widespread fear of a credit bill.
Tony Pidgley, founder and president of the high-class construction company Berkeley said on Monday: "From the beginning of the current financial year, the market has been back to normal transaction levels since the highest level in 2013" and added that it offers a "stable scope of action".
The real estate market in London was well established during the discharge, as foreign buyers pressed into the capital.
According to information from the Catasteramt, prices in the city area have increased by 18.5 per cent in the last year alone, far more than the average increase in England and Wales.
The average sales prices at Berkeley's private, price-added and student offers rose about a fifth last year and reached the end of April of £423,000.
However, in the last few months, a stronger fund has made real estate property in London less attractive for foreign buyers - some of them have also been cut off by introducing new real estate taxes and political rhetoric to a possible "Vile tax" in front of the general elections in the coming May.
The London real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, in the difficult credit comparisons, would lead to lower market growth in the second half of the year, both in real estate sales and prices.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decline in the mortgage permit in July, which also means that the real estate market is falling apart.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, adjusted its forecast for the increase in real estate prices in London for 2015 by 3%, based on a now weak home price awareness.
The transaction volume in London's most expensive areas, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has gone back to a quarter of a year, according to the Maker WA Ellis.
However, the desire to own a property in the capital city of Berkeley is a blessing because the falling amounts for the sale of the term are more than €2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product in the best places has remained stable and, as a result, the sales of time have also remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new properties in the year until the end of April - almost a third more than in 2007 before the crisis.
The annual tax result increased by 40 per cent per year to 280 million, the turnover by 18 per cent to 1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday before the company's annual meeting, Mr Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley would be in line with current market expectations in the current year.
The analysts estimate the annual pre-tax result at £450 million.
Berkeley shares stood at $23,96 on Wednesday in London trade.
Photos by Jennifer Lawrence by Hacker on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appeared at the 85th Oscar League.
Naked photos of Oscar Presbyterian Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker, who claimed to have a "master list" of more than 100 stars.
A representative of the star from "The Panem's Tributes" confirmed that Lawrence's photos were real and called on the hacker because of "extreme damage of privacy".
The authorities were notified and were followed by all those who continued to post photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos that were originally posted on the photo-shared page 4chan were apparently created by a failure in the online storage system iCloud by Apple. The alleged "Masterly list" of the hacking victim includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Cate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not sure how many of the images are real, although Winstead, Star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" also criticized the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I took years ago in our private neighborhood of our house - I hope you are so satisfied with you," wrote Winstead on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the Nicolodes series "iCarly" and "Victorious" argues that there are pictures of her hand and second "These images of me are GEFELCHT, people.
But we'll be at the same time as the beginning. * Word game intended*.
Buzzfeed reported on the late Sunday that a speaker of Popstars Ariana Grande had withdrawn the truth of the alleged photos from her.
Except for Howard Jacobson's high-end new novel about love and the letters "J".
They burst out, so you could best describe it, they slowly release themselves like a card you've left in the rain.
Perhaps a woman told him that he was too serious, demanding, intense, distant and perhaps somewhat rude.
And then he shot his hand.
He knew it.
He was as stupid as Igel, yeah.
The last victim of this stupidity was a just beginning affair that was promising for a slowdown of the only length of his life, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a sedentary charm with unscathed hair and a flat heart from a village on the north coast, which was even more remote and rough than Port Reuben.
She had come with an older escort to the south, who held the keverns for her aunts, who had carved a plot in a warm but paradise hall with the striking name Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for many years.
The roses were bright, in the bathrooms were still spinning, snowflakes had left their tracks on all the windows and believed that they belonged to everything, and the garden had been monitored with unkraut, which looked like huge coalheads.
It was like the house from a child market, both dangerous and shocking, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the long list for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had eaten hand in hand on the broken bed in the high grass and had enjoyed an unusual warm breakfast. Both had gone to the service console, which provided the country with soothing music and relevant news when, at the sight of their crucified legs, he remembered him in an old song of a long forgotten black entertainer, whom his father liked to listen to in closed wheelchairs in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their pure aggressiveness, songs of this type were no longer played at the console.
Not prohibited - Nothing was so strictly prohibited - simply not played.
It was successfully obsolated, just as the word was obsessed.
The general taste created what authorisations and regulations had never been made, and how people in books choose from teller-waves-to-Millionary Memories, Cook books and love novels, they chose to dance at the music.
In the Euphoria of the day, Keverns began to play an imaginary piano and to wear large feet in a grob-commic serenade Ailins.
Ailinn doesn't understand that.
"It was a famous song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her and automatically placed two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done that to stop letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It started as a game between him and his father when he was young.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told him.
If you start a word with a J without two fingers on your lips, it costs you a penny.
It wasn't very funny at the time, and it wasn't very funny right now.
He knew this was expected by him, that was all.
It had to explain what Jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of anyone yet.
Jazz became, even though he wasn't banned directly, not played.
The improvisation was no longer modern.
It was just a place for a single "win" in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody where they would end.
It's also the mind.
His invisibility made people nervous.
And Jazz was musically expressive.
Although he was 10 years old, without being a member of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about Jazz from his father's half secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain that Fats Waller was black.
In her age, she probably couldn't remember a time when the pop singer wasn't black.
Again, no laws or restrictions.
A consistent society meant that every element of this society would be grateful to the principle of group forgiveness - thankable as those who were released from the shipyard.
People with afro-caribic origin were suitable for entertainment and sport, so they sang and ran.
People who were originally born from the Indian subcontinent were like nature with electronic talent and were charged with the task to ensure that no family remained without a functioning telephone.
What was left of the Polish community was concerned about the canalization; what was left of the Greeks, they threw Teller.
Those from the Gulf states and the inhabitants whose grandparents had not left the country as soon as they were concerned about what happened- from fear of being accused of fires, even from fear that the flames would be consumed as soon as they were next - had opened up labneh and Shisha pfeifen restaurants, thought and were depressed with inactivity.
Everyone according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard balls, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the misleading words, which had just crossed her mind, could have been exposed.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really boring," said Kevern.
Except for people whose feet are too big.
My father didn't punish anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the trusted garden gave him the tricky feeling of security.
Nothing was able to overcome the diminution of the huge cooler leaves.
Ailinn still doesn't understand.
Why would your father love something like that?
He wanted to say it was a jux, but he wished to put two fingers in her face again on the lips.
She already thought he was something special.
"It seems funny to him," he said instead.
She accidentally shot her head and stopped looking for Keverns.
There was nothing else to see around the world than her undressed red hair.
There was nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say it," she said without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're prejudging me.
You look really worried.
Are my feet too big?
He saw it again.
Your feet aren't that straight.
Maybe your button, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my bones are too thick?
Do you hate it?
Of course I didn't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early.
"Your thick bones are exactly the reason why you fell for me," he tried instead.
I'm a little perversity.
That doesn't sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because he, like his father, did not have the refreshing charm that he needed in order to maintain the warmth in white.
Maybe his father wanted to be rude too.
Maybe he wanted to be.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons became red and withdrew from her bedroom, burned the consoles and burned the wine they had drank.
Holder flower wine, so drinking was no excuse for him.
In their arrangement they seemed to sit like palm trees in the storm.
"And your dickhead is exactly the reason why I feel sorry for you," she said...
Except I'm not.
She hurt him because of the unnecessary incompatibility of his words and the fear that was shown in her eyes when she stood up against him.
Did she think he'd beat her?
She had not told him about life on the cold North Archipelago where she was raised, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same huge and ice-cream ocean came here like there on the Ufer.
The same angry men, with even thicker skin and more sad to follow the DEM WHAT GESCHEEN WHEN it was their past as a smugler and beach driver, were always ready to raise their hand against a woman who had rejected or humiliated them.
Dickkopf?
They would have shown her a thick faucet if she hadn't adjusted!
She first knutschen - Knutschen was the most commonly used word for a erotic attraction between men and women, a contrast to the unsatisfied love ballasts from the console - first knuts them and then beat them.
According to Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary cleaning, since the knife itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomon gave him a sign through his body.
He got out of bed like an old man.
She felt the same way, but the wait of her grief surprised her.
That wasn't the end of the world.
You're hardly able to do it.
She looked at him as he left - like a room in the upper floor with her companion - a man who complained about something he had complained about himself.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and for men in general, even though some of her hands had lifted against her.
A man turned away from her, his back, shamed, overcome her, without a struggle spirit - why was that a moment she seemed to know well, if she could not remember one time, when she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomon looked at her feet.
A few years ago, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent 32-year-old researcher, commissioned by Offnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for the public vote, worked in a short speech on the continued violence at a low and medium-sized level in the countries in which their reduction, if not initially expected, would be in view of the money and energy invested in the exploitation of this violence.
"It has been done a lot, and a lot has to be done," she wrote, "to anger the aggressiveness of a people who has led thousands of wars and who have won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, in which the sweet spirit of human friendship has been seen historically despite the highly demanding church structures among the tribes.
But some features appear to be inevitable.
The higher the church tower, the less the suffering it continues to grow.
The people, when they hear sentimental dances, are familiar with stories about extreme difficulties and insist on believing in the widows and family life, but still not only does the former wealth hold the rural communities as well as our urban refuges in hand, but there is also facilities for creating a new and lasting road to home, on the workplace, on the streets and even on the playgrounds.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to transfer," said her mentor when he read the entire report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum cut her head.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," replied Esme Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Again Esme appealed to her right to privacy and refusal of the statement.
Feminist?
Again, Sweige.
"I don't ask that," said Luther Rabinowitz finally, "because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a free place of work.
We serve a profit-free society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are absolutely acceptable and worthy of praise, can sometimes distort the results you have presented them.
You yourself have apparently taken advantage of the church, and these things that you call "sustainable" and "roh" could be interpreted by others as well as an expression of natural strength and vitality.
If you continue to travel to the area, which is what you are going to do, if it were to happen yesterday, it would mean to take the country’s essential life force.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Following his head, a LED letter in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Opnow had given the country in the last quarter of the century or longer.
Laugh on their neighbors, value their partner, listen to dances, visit musicals, use their phone, talk, explain, listen to, agree, apologize.
Language is better than Sweige, the song is better than written, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand absolutely where you want to go," Esme Nussbaum replied with a calm voice when she was sure that her predecessor had spoken to her at the end, "and I say nothing but that we are not as effective as we make ourselves.
My concern is that without warning, we can find out how we repeat the error that is at all the same time the only thing that leads to what has been done.
This time, however, it is not the others where we leave our forest and our mysteries.
Luther Rabinowitz made a pyramid with his hands.
To mean English patience.
"You go too far," he said, "if you refer to actions as "false" which our parents may or may not have committed.
They're going too far if you're talking about that they'd put out their "Wit" and their "Misters" on "other".
In fact, it should not be necessary to remind anyone in your position that when we understand the past, as in the protection of the present, we do not speak of "us" and "other".
There was no "we" and there was no "other".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From him, if we are truly ourselves," Esme insisted, "no part of the society can claim to have behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was bad or good, what happened is happening.
That was then.
There's no need to say anything more - we're a few of them.
And just as no debt must be assigned, no debt must be added if such a payment is appropriate and if there is a way to go.
But what is the past if we don't learn from this?
The past makes us forget it.
If I can say something--
Luther Rabinowitz brought his pyramids together.
"I'll think of her report," he said, and left her.
The next day when she went to work as usual, she was taken over by a motorcycle driver who, as passengers described, was on the road in a kind of "brutal wood".
There are cases.
Lesto-Military member says there is no state authority planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho objected to planning a state strike against the government and said that they were opposed to police officers who were called upon to engage in the arrest of political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country and reported that the country's army had surrounded its office and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The Premier brought his family to the bordering South Africa after he reported threats.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that the fact does not give the fact that the military reacts to the threat by "political fanatics" whose armed forces are led by the police.
"What happened this morning that the defense forces of Lesotho acted after he had received several secret reports that within the police some elements, which actually wanted to attack some of the political, political and political young fanatics, who were just ahead of them, were causing devastating damage," he said to Voice of America.
The South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said that military action had made the impression of a revolution.
"Even if no one has claimed that the government should be subjected to violence, all reports agree that the activities of the defence forces of Lesotho have previously shown signs of a state strike," he said.
Speakers of the soldiers of Lesotho told on Sunday that the soldiers would return to their barracks and be at peace in the capital.
In the meantime, Vizepremier Mothetjoya Metsing took over government leadership during the absence of Taliban.
Thabane explained that he believed that because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country, he became a target.
In Lesotho, there have been great tensions since June, after the Taliban Parliamentary sittings have been suspended because of the suspensions in his government.
He said that his actions had not been determinated by the government, but other accusations were heard.
Production in the euro area on a 13-month basis
The increase in production in the euro area slowed down at the lowest point in August of the last 13 months, with a very careful study.
The final market sales manager index of the manufacturing company (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a stand of 51.8 in July.
A statement of over 50 indicates an expansion.
New contracts went back and factories experienced increasing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures will take place on Thursday before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets expect a clear plan for dealing with a slow recovery of the euro area and for declining inflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the President of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could make further information this week on whether he would take into account a quantitative simplification for the euro area, according to those taken by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than even no growth, the dramatic effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers have become more evident," said Rob Dobson, leading economic scientist at the market.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economic nation of the block, France, the PMI fell to 46,9.
France remains a child of concern, as well as the Italian descent from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Note that growth trends in the key industrial mechanism in Germany and in Spain and the Netherlands are no longer worrying," said Mr. Dobson.
The decline of the industry probably results in the fire of analysts waiting for more monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI increased to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Head of Finance expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say about the sales manager index of the production business in the euro area since August is that the sector continues to grow."
He added: "Employed producers in the euro area find life to be very difficult now as current geopolitical tensions - especially in Russia and Ukraine - continue to increase insecurity in many countries.
These growing uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and the consumer confidence, and it is likely that some contracts will be delayed or even cancelled, in particular large contracts.
He said that it would be "always more likely" that the ECB would finally have to launch a kind of QE, "though we suspected this would be limited."
The teenage years of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible detention of the school, as the children still suffer.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people from Czech militias were taken as hostages in a school in Beslan in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of their children, were killed in the three-day Martyrium that the world was shocked.
We are returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who died at the funeral in the classroom.
Just a decade after Beslan's school was founded, 334 people, including 186 children, were warned of the bright night before a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
As fanatic Islamic terrorists children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of a new school year, arrested and killed, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united the West and the East in Abscheu, and then miraculously turned into action and hope for the future in the worst land.
Ten years later we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who died at the funeral in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome opposition, even though the memory of this terrorist hero will always be followed.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that Ukraine is now seeking - and in the child as they die - now finds an end.
The girl who was photographed in the attempt to get back to the school hall
She was photographed by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov and famous when she tried to climb back into her underground school hall after a mine was exploded.
Aida, now 40 years old, looked after her mother, Larissa.
Both of them were kept alive for the dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me I should run for my life, but I couldn't," said Aida at the time.
My legs were bleeding.
I stood up and climbed back to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her to safety.
After a number of operations, she felt completely healed, but yesterday she said: "The pain returned three months ago.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to work again.
Some granaries are still in my nose.
Your goal is now to become dentists to help people how you were helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she said in a fight.
"That's happening to me, and it can't be changed.
Once a year, I always go to the sports hall to remind myself of the ones who stayed there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapova was killed there.
We played together when we were young and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I finish my study and start my career.
I'm thinking about a family later.
She says that the burial will always remain a part of her, even though the memory will become a bit weaker each year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our tears and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me online, how I get back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our catastrophes and contribute to something that doesn't happen again.
The young man who flew through the cave hall, in the opinion of his mother, was dead
It was his first day of work (Russia goes to school with 7 years) and survived the three-day detention in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven years old, he said, "Mom has told me that I'm going to rely on myself if there's an explosion and hold their hands."
After an explosion, he thought she'd die.
She said to him, "Go away."
Full of fear, they could be dead, he flew and saw on the way a little little boy, caught it by his hand and flew through a bullet hole.
His father, Vladimir, who locked his son out of the army, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save them."
In fact, Tamara was shot outside and with injuries in the hospital, on the other hand, in the belief that her son had died.
After her reunification, she said, "I was hungry for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in here and confused me.
Damir was later fled to London (from the news of the World newspaper released) to receive the title of a Bernardo's Children's Championship from the immediate Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror pursues you every day, but I wish I could stop with the memory," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's going to get worse in my mind.
I still know I'm gonna steal all my toys right away.
But now I can play computer games with shots and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the sports hall, but I don't think about myself anymore.
I remember these kids I played with in the court, and they didn't get it out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We're saying they're staying in the sports hall.
I remember very well on my trip to London, especially on the game bookings where I could find everything I wanted and the ride in an open car.
But now he is afraid of a place like Ukraine where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends experience.
This horror follows you every day, but I wanted to stop thinking about it.
"I'm so sorry for all those who suffer under the clouds," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I'd like to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they'll take me to the school academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood have been murdered, can you imagine?
I remember the awful silence after the seizure, there were just no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted many months.
She remembers living on her journey to London with Damir.
The people in London laughed when I told our story.
I understand how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was Cherie Blair and her foundation grateful for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just say that 10 years have passed, but I still remember her and her husband in London, and how the Damir and I have helped.
I still remember how Damir wanted to eat Borschsch and invited all local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with Kellners in a restaurant. He shot them with his gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said: "I always think this world has not been better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine the war continues, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and still are killed.
They're just like us.
I think for many of the war is a part of the news they hear when they are late or are busy with something else.
I just know how these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that's so sad.
It has become big and is a very mild and quiet young man, he is not aggressive or aggressive at all.
For example, he's not looking for rache, he's not overrun by the past ravens.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he's got six good friends from the class, and they're going to the sports halls on occasion and sneaking around there.
When he was younger, he let me remember how he sometimes put himself on the sofa, turning his face away from us for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he kept all his weapons and other military instruments. Now 17, bigger than I, good-looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came to my feet, I looked around, and saw the holes around me, with all the body parts lying around.
I was absolutely sure my little boy could have survived in this cave.
"I remember saying to him, "Damar, run, run," but I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he's heard it and he's gone.
And that's how life, unlike many others, goes on for us.
George Ilyn, 17
The young man whose creepy image was put on the symbol of the tomb of Beslan
Trust: The Beslan survivor Georgi Lyn with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, right a picture of Georgia today
His bloodthirsty face was drawn by fear when he ran around his life while Chechnya terrorists shot down his class cameras.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbaria of Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, had appointed him for his first day of work before she was fired to bring her older son Vladimir to university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists beat him, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three awful days," she recalls.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives from us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgie managed to survive.
The closer this date comes, the harder it is to think about and talk about it.
There's no single day we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been here for a long time, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days always follow me.
No one will forget what I promise you.
End: The picture of Georgia (left) was one of the most shocking of the attacks and was confirmed as status (right).
I remember that Georgia wanted to go to school that day. He said he wanted to beat his teachers.
I knew he was alive when I saw him on the TV.
And now there's even this statue of the virgin Georgia in San Marino.
Georgia doesn't like the picture, and it's hidden from us at home in the book order.
I understand this, but I also think that people all over the world are feeling our pain.
Georgia says today: "It's important that this can never happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever learn the truth.
People are constantly searching for such tragedies and never learn the truth.
And now they're investigating the collapse of this boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever learn what caused him?
This world is going to be terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years are nothing in such pain.
We need thousands of years to forget it a little bit.
It touched my health, and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had some albums because of the seizure, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who were murdered.
That's why I always go to the sports hall when the 1st September draws closer.
I want my old childhood friends to be tributed.
It's hard for me to go to the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget it, but I won't accompany me.
My life is going on.
I finished school this year and visited a medical college in Wladikakaz.
I'll be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
George Fanijew, 20
The boy who survived, even though he was caught in the footsteps of a killer terrorist
A miracle: Georgie Fanijew was arrested while he was being held in custody for the feet of a killer terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was arrested in the sports hall and next to the bomb stationed at the foot of a killer terrorist.
It's really a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We feel like it's been yesterday," says Georgi, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret substance, but could not do this because of his health damage due to the seizure.
It's still with me, it's nothing I've left behind.
I'm older now and people say that children can easily cope with bad experiences - I have to say it doesn't agree.
"2006 I worked with psychologists and then felt something better, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I'll never go back there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I've been sitting in this famous picture.
Survivors: George Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the arrest on the laptop
My pain is unbearable, and I bring him with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think or talk about it, and they never asked me after school.
I'm good physically.
I should be careful with my wounded knee, but I can run well now.
But because of my health, I could not study at the FSB's Secret Service Academy in Sankt Petersburg as I wanted.
I have my documents, also the medical records, and they have answered that it is not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to chickens".
He said, "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know anything about it, and of course they should not suffer it.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: "This pain doesn't leave me.
He's in my soul, worse when the anniversary draws closer.
I'll go to the holidays to think about it.
I know Georgie won't get involved.
It has to be even harder for him because he was there and I didn't.
I waited for him home and couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God that he has been given back to me.
It's still in us.
Georgi is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept this if something like this happens.
He's a young man, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his neck.
He has been operated several times, he can run, but he doesn't run a sport.
I'd say he'd overcome the Horror by 50%, but you can never completely overcome and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the camp and this only strengthened my pain.
I've lost a lot of people I knew well and they were dearer to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could do for me, but my heart is about the murderers.
I know about families in which new children were born, but also about white people who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life continues, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart leaps in me when I see him in the hospital.
And now I see what's going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why did they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I can't believe it.
We were a friendly country before, how could it be that we are fighting now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine and many more have been killed.
If only we could take all these rebels and throw them out - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tsakajewa, 10 / 15
The baby that was so excited by a special deployment command was safe.
Saved: Aljona Tskajewa is delivered by a Russian special service command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the gravity
The world was beginning to lose its spirit in 2004 when the baby Aljona was brought into the arms of a Russian police officer from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let them go, but in their pregnancy they kept their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar back in the school hall.
Makhar, then three years old, came out, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murder camp.
Her father Ruslan has recently remarried, and with his new wife Swettlana, he has named a little girl he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the situation and is raised to an intelligent and happy girl, saying neighbors.
"They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories of the tenth anniversary.
They'll understand why.
Man accused of having girls on foot pass through five
An 78-year-old man is standing in front of the court because of the passing of a three-year-old girl on a walkway in Fife.
Gordon Stewart is charged with driving a girl on the transition to Pittenween in East Neuk.
The complaint is that Mr. Stewart has controlled his audience Q3 without the necessary care and attention and has hurt the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Antwerp, argues the charges against the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC introduced the procedure for January.
4 Tips for Better Water Photos and Videos
If you want to make photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most valuable option is a waterproof point-and-shot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action-cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which is both worth $300.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras, all available at a price of less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are some rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the batteries and other containers are closed close.
Also place your camera on the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and camcorder have stage and recording modes that optimise the lighting time for the dry water conditions.
And before you jump in, check how deep your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search in our shopping guide and the evaluations for traditional and waterproof models.
Make multiple seizures - because many won't be hit.
Point-and-shot cameras have a LCD that you can compose images that do not normally have action cameras.
Even if you have a LCD, it is difficult to view this under water, and the correct image setting is a cause of happiness.
So make a lot of recordings.
If your camera has a line mode that makes a series of recordings with slightly modified lighting settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light is dramatically worse, as long as you stay away from the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface when you take a pool, a lake or the sea.
This allows you to add more colors to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice to the country, but it is much more important under water because of bad light conditions.
It is especially important when you work with an action camera: These devices often have a fixed width lens, which means that you need to stay closer to your objects if they are to fill the entire image frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the kind whose character changed things, even in such a giant organization as the NHS.
As an expert anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to saving patients both the agony of disease and the quality of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife remembers, was a MI6 worker who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the doctors are important for diagnosis and disease, while the treatments are mainly involved with something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he began his path of suffering.
"I didn't feel it," he wrote in May this year.
I had trouble getting up.
As he struggled with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he had been impatient with his wife Juliet.
"I want everything more immediately than later," he said.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt very unusual and frustrated.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out an examination of his breasts.
Just two weeks ago, he was in the French Alps for skiing.
The results of the X-ray survey were presented.
He lies at Mesothelium, an unbleached cancer that attacks the chest wound, so that the tongue is overcome by the skin.
As with most cancers, the exact solution is most difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers suffer from lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have been former smokers.
But Mesothelium is different.
In almost all cases, the solvent is an asbestos tax - contact with the fascist substance, which was once considered a "substances" but between it being known as a deadly substance.
For most of us, Mesothelium is a disease that can easily be ignored.
Asbest is a product of the past.
The most dangerous asbetty type has been no longer used in Britain since the 1960s when the industry voluntarily committed to using it no longer.
Even where he was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the substance - Klempner, construction worker, roommates and weld workers, for example.
As an industrial hazard from another time, it does not seem to be of concern today.
But this self-satisfaction is unsatisfied.
Britain, as it seems, is experiencing today the height of a mesolthelium epidemic.
There are more deaths by Mesotheliom here than in any other country of the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, as many people die in this disease as in traffic accidents.
Annual numbers of mesothelium accidents since 1980 and expected future deaths in Britain
The reason why we now experience the deadly effects, even though asbestos has been illegal for years (all asbestos types have been prohibited in 1999) is that a mesothelium develops only after decades.
And the taste of mesothelium is not limited to former workers of the baobab industry.
Asbest was, and is often present in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the businesses in which we buy.
And that's why Mesothelium doesn't know any class problems, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bases, from the elegant shopping houses in London to private schools, are not a shelter.
Parliament's buildings are busted.
Even in hospitals where we are to be healed, this deadly carcinogen has already been excavated.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a Klempner either.
In fact, he found it difficult to imagine where he might have been in contact with asbestos.
Then find it out.
"It looks as if in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my education for six years, there was a lot of asbestos."
All - students, nurses, doctors and nurses - use the tunnel.
You wonder how many of my old friends will suffer from the same disease?
He could at least partially answer this question.
"Of the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital and who had been sick for the past five years at Mesotheliom," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last who still lives."
How many of us are still sick?
In Andrew Lawson, Mesotheliom was diagnosed at 48 years of age.
When he died on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
That was an unusual long life.
Fifty percent of all mesotheliomeric patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease is always deadly.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us are still sick?"
The leading British expert on Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, notes that, when the asbestetidem in Britain is expected to occur in the United Kingdom from 1870 to 2050, there will be 90,000 cases of the disease as a whole.
Most of them still have no idea they're going to die like this.

A brief look at the acts of the courts, often used by the victims because of harmful conditions, shows how far the mystery of mesotheliom has spread.
In June this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, offered to have Janice Allen put on a driver's license.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of the Flagshipsstore in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Alle was only 18 when she started working at M&S.
Now she's got two kids in the twins.
"For this matter," she says, "I had never heard of Mesotheliom, I didn't even know anything about asbestos.
I'd never thought it would touch me.
There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos.
In fact, the concept of asbestos is not a substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name refers to the word "asbestyform", a description of the phaser structure that makes the substance resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in construction.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is today the most widely found asbestos found in buildings.
It has been used for roofing plates, foot-and-mouthing plates, rotary solutions, bottle resolution, even for brakes in cars.
It is less deadly than other asbestos forms, however, is considered by the EU and WHO as a "great health risk" with possible fatal consequences.
More dangerous, however, is the brown asbest (Amosit) and the blue asbest (Crokydolith).
Britain was the first world largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts argued that "there is clear, but indirect evidence that this was a fundamental basis for the unique high mesotheliomers."
A staff member from Marks & Spencer was assigned to the Flagshipsstore at Oxford Street, London, Alamy
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesotheliomorph, but Julian Peto's work indicates that her story is not unusual at all.
He has submitted a study of the subjects showing that "a significant part of the mesothelium was caused by work or probably by asbestos contact in the environment without known exposure."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our building.
It looks like no one can be safe from it.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which has examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people in the heart of the government may have been exposed to the substance.
Goddard reported in 2009 that service stores and pipelines were contaminated behind the parliament's committees with asbestos, whose deadly phases could be triggered by something as unhindered as "strong air movements".
Members of Parliament are often accused of caring for their own interests, but this seems to be the case.
While the directive of the Parliamentary Labour Service stated that the Westernminster Palace had received a "pure health certificate", it was not disputed that 1 billion euros of work should be allocated over several years to renew Parliament's power to modernise and remove the asbestos and that after the general elections in 2015, the members of the Council will probably meet in the next QE2 conference centre rather than on the Green Banks in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not held in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do now is wait.
A person who could not accurately determine the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general physician.
As Andrew Lawson suspects the 50-year-old Abbot that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I've worked in a hospital in which the asbestos complaint was made positive," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all places where you worked and the data.
What he still remembers is the day of December 2009, when he arrived in such a kind of fibre.
He was 45, and soon he carried out an operation last night.
Suddenly, I had lunch.
It came suddenly.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I'd make the ride home any more.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain of the chest wound, the skin, was caused by his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to deny a mesothelium.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Marvelous doctors have taken ruptures of his chest and put Pleurakathether in order to remove fluid from the lungs and test in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remain undiagnosed.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his workplace.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after sports activity and intense breathing.
In 2011, a patient was diagnosed with mesothelium in combination with similar symptoms in his practice.
But even now, Abbott is not connected with his own case.
Finally, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in that case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott’s condition deteriorated again, and his housewife brought his CT scans and round calls to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after the first time that the abortion had become a disease, a sin with a camera was introduced into the cave between the rib and the chest.
I'm an optimist.
I'm usually just going on," he says.
Honestly, I didn't even have so many worries.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelium."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesothelium
Suddenly, Abbott had a term with Macmillan's nurses, who advised him to take an attorney.
First he understood the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings in which rhore was often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to the asbestos in these buildings are now sick.
And so Mesotheliom is now dealing with younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous raw materials with asbestimulating in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably no longer exposed to the substance.
But many employees who moved from one building to another (such as Andrew Lawson) or underground orphanages (as Graham Abbott often did), came in contact with the toxic substances most likely.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-threatening for patients, but life-threatening doctors.
He'll be removed today too.
Students put their buns burners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just about hospitals.
Asbest was often used in offices, businesses, libraries and city halls because of its fascinating and flammable properties.
Schools, too.
In fact, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Over the country, in thousands of hours of chemistry, students have thrown their bunken-burner onto asbestos mats.
On websites the theme of asbestos is now often discussed in schools.
And that's why such innocent objects in our houses have standard asbestos in foot-and-mouths or boots.
"It's an industrial tax that is included in most of our properties," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who has represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's hospital.
In one case, the only contact that involved a woman was the abortion of a garden shop in the 1970s.
So watch how you cut your garden shoes.
The effects of diagnosis, and the knowledge that disease is unhealthy, are immensity.
"It takes a long time to process it," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I noticed that I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to experience another Christmas party.
With the greatest difficulty, the perspective change from a doctor's position to a patient.
He remembers how innocent patients before him were overemphasized by all the information he had to get.
"It was very hard to take everything away," he says.
"I asked my doctor how long have I been?"
And you gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to experience another Christmas party.
That was then."
Mesothelium is particularly domestic, because it is our life-saving mechanism - the breath itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelium are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbest consists of the smallest fibers.
When the asbest is lifted up and the fibers are inhaled, they can be fixed in the chest area, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestraters irritate the chest failure and may resolve cell mutations.
"The problem is with the bone marrow-shaped asbesthenes," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart surgeon who changed to Guy's hospital in 2001.
Exactly the hospital, which Andrew Lawson suspects that it has exposed him to asbestos, is now ironically a leading centre in the treatment of mesothelium.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training at the hospital.
As soon as the asbesthnadels reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they will be pressed from the breath to the edge where the skin is.
From nature it is from the beginning to the invasive.
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well with mesothelium.
The effectiveness of an operation is, for example, a hot conflict.
Some think she's worth a try.
Traasure's ruining that.
"You can't cut the fracture out," he says.
You don't come here with the Messer.
That's why the cancer says "on chemotherapy isn't very good," the "work shows" but not entirely.
"Sometimes there's a long-term existence," says Treasure.
But at the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live longer, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gold died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott still fights.
After contacting Mesotheliom, Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became a single-man support and advice office for the victims.
"Hallo, Krebscentrale," he introduced himself happily when he called.
"It was very positive," said Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years ago and was still very active.
Initially, abortions were offered six chemotherapy cycles, which lasted four months and would probably extend his life only for a month.
"I was confused," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, created it "to let things appear in something more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a heart thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had a advantage because I didn't have to be persuaded, I just called and got a term," says Graham.
A normal patient should receive a prescription and wait for the treatment to be approved.
Money is crucial for mesothelium cancers to be able to carry out the best available therapies.
But if these treatments are finally unavoidably failed, many are affected by another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in hopes of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it was recognized that a very low burden also posed a health risk.
And here's where the company's independence began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally reported their case, but it was not what Morgan called a "full compensation" because Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelium was returned to an asbestos contact at Guy's.
After the investigation of his death, however, a speaker from Guy confirmed that "the asbestos fibers were removed in the range concerned in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos can be removed
In fact, it is a major problem for mesotheliom companies that are struggling to make damages - usually decades after the events - to assign the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a workplace.
Many of its former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who argue against their claims know that the time is for them, but most surely not with the claimants.
In response to this year, there were major new legislation that makes it easier for mesothelium-affected people to complain of damage, even if their former employers are no longer found.
The law has established a fund supported by the insurance industry of £350 million for all diagnosed after July 2012 but no one can complain.
In these cases, the complainants receive 80 per cent of what a court would have been able to speak to them in a normal criminal proceedings - about £20,000.
About 300 successful applications for the programme are expected every year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many mesotheliom victims that 350 million £ were a "very good job" of the insurance sector.
"This is a deal of insurance insurance for insurance policyers," he says, indicating that in this sum, there is a quarter of what insurance policy would have to be paid if the time had not been over and mesothelium banks could find the companies and they would normally regret it.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, also said that the law was "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan gave us that in view of seven deaths a day, it is necessary to act quickly.
"People suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom Act in December last year.
At this point, Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
Following her first consultation, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation that, in contrast to Tom Treasure, he expected a positive effect.
This was accompanied by a radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a three-phase therapy that can present a survival rate of up to 40 per cent with the Long Lazdunski over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"That's of course the most important thing," says Abbott.
It's always seen in patients.
There's something that can keep you going.
If you give up, you're going much worse.
Graham Abbott undertook the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
No signs of disease were seen in post-care scans.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just got 50.
That's not life-threatening.
That's life-threatening.
Again, Abbott took six chemotherapy cycles.
Now there is no trace of the tumor anymore.
But the process is physically and mentally very intense.
They have to think about practical things - about the money if I'm no longer, for example, or my wife shows how the ball time settings work.
If you get bad news, you'll be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin 14, that's not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my daughter that I would have a disease that I wouldn't be old.
They reacted quite differently.
Tamsin is very rare and unsatisfied.
She told her friends about it and we soon received very many calls.
Ellie was back.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients need to do.
But for mesotheliomers, such conversations are not taken by hope, not by hope of survival.
The disease (as it is most likely for Stephen Jay Gold) brings a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelium is not life-threatening.

China declines Hong Kong Right to Government elections, demonstrators black compensation
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided despite the increased call for democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by Hong Konger Elections.
This procedure may encourage long-declared protests in the Hong Kong Business Area, while activists led the planning and mobilisation into the streets within a few hours after the departure.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the Communist leaders in principle to withdraw all non-peaking candidates.
"That doesn't come unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
The people of Hong Kong have joined us.
And it is clear that we have to do it with an authoritarian regime.
In his defence of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the authorisation of public nominations in the Hong Kong government elections would be "chatotic".
Since 1997, when the UK has returned control over Hong Kong to China, Beijing has promised to allow the citizens to choose the government president from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision on Sunday as a democratic break, because Hong Kong citizens have a direct right of choice, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership maintains the run-off through a closely controlled Beijing nomination committee.
Only candidates "with love for country and love for Hong Kong" will be allowed after a new clause.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most active protests in Hong Kong have been held for many years.
Following the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong, the movement of the Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to close the financial area if Beijing does not allow for a general right of choice.
On Sunday afternoon, hundreds of Occupy-Central engineers gathered in the rain before the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new stage of civil disobedience and that they had planted protest bells in the coming weeks.
However, they did not make any details of this to appear to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers said that "the movement of the central region has taken into account only as a last resort, an action that should only take place if all dialogue options are open and no other choice exists.
We are sorry to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been created and that the occupation of the central region will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for the Beijing announcement for days, and on Sunday before the government building, security measures were taken, including police officers and barracides.
The disturbances are strengthened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they will soon lose control of their city.
The training of people from the Festland strengthens the competition for products and services.
Furthermore, the fear grows that Hong Kong values such as democracy and freedom of speech will begin to break under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement as they threatened the business company - the lifesaver Hong Kong.
"The protests they are talking about could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they go away," said Legal expert Queen Ip, who has been criticising the movement for a long time.
We do not want to be afraid that Hong Kong will not be controlled.
This impression is bad for investment.
The state-controlled media China also reported recently on the democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
In this summer, activists organized an informal referendum on election rights, with 770,000 participants - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July tens of thousands participated in one of the largest demonstrations of democracy in the history of the region.
The tradition of school dropouts in the United States is now transferred to universities where Freshmen events are offered with private aircraft.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and to offer the first luxurious travel service to students from Britain today.
To get a particularly impressive performance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also pointed out that the service has a security party.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who, in addition to having to choose their hairstyles in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we are happy to make sure this year that students reach the university with a minimum of demand and maximum of luxury.
One company speaker said that there were no new bookings yet, since the service had just been introduced, however, adding that "Students would book the service in the next few weeks".
The company also claimed that despite the student fees of $9,000 per year it expected a market for this offer.
Students today differ in their expectations and demands very much from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important to make a great first impression, and with HIV you can do that exactly.
The National Student Union, however, criticized the service as being outlawed.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NUS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the life of the majority of students.
Many students who start this month with the study see a crisis of living costs as the available financial aid in the form of loans and scholarships do not take the far-reaching steps for the simplest basics of life before they can ever think of spending thousands of money on something as simple as coming home.
Feminists criticise racial issues and police behaviour by Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants raise their hands in the air and sing, "Hands up, don't shoot," while waiting for the finalation.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, due to the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, feminist commentators put sex before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income equality.
However, as the tensions in the Middle East increased and the country was observed, Perez saw that the responses of white women turned to 100% around the race.
In comparison with the answers of black women shortly after the 9th of August, the personal essays with titles such as "Thinking to Ferguson by a white woman" and "feminism is not only about the oppression of women" were relatively late.
But for Perez, this meant an important change.
"I don't think that in feminism there are many people who speak about white and privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the events.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized that they have to express it.
For English Professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought problems to light which black Americans are exposed every day, but which are not regarded as "female themes" in the cultural area.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from all over here," said Mitchell.
If I put something about how paints stand in their own country under siege, it's a shame.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in the public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, sex and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between race and sex problems.
For them black women have not had the luxury to separate the subjects clean; they live every day in combined reality.
While women now know the subjects of race and sex in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors are doing the opposite.
"At least 10,000 black men were reached between 1865 and 1890, and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in history in order to justify the murder of Lynch.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came at the point where white fighters for women's right of choice, such as Susan B. Anthony, analyzed the country in the late 19th century and determined that the struggle for electoral rights could only be successful for each group: women or blacks.
"They decided to apply for women's right of choice, and the right of vote for black should come later," Hattery said.
When you think of such things, one has the power to know why colourful women do not trust white women.
We haven't done our job well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after the women received the right to vote in 1920, it lasted another decade until white women organized against the Lynchen in the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was created almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flow of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - is a reflection of the time in which white feminists " catch" played with the problems that black women had been sitting together since generations.
"Would it not be great if the activists who have the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to receive control over such traditional feminist platforms?" asked Mitchell.
Women of the second generation, who have built their careers in the fight against reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now trying to understand what this means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went to Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown's release and published an article by Rebecca Carroll, a Colonist of the Guardian, in which she demanded more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand the risk of the body - and opinions on race that are clearly different in public questions - will be affected by the changes," wrote Stone.
Although stone stands for a more intersectoral feminism, in the same race as sex themes, some of its comments on the theme of race in America have been amused.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinms comments on Ferguson are contrary to their earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But as the White House recently set up a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Spanish men, there were generous reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police's relationship with the black community is not the only problem that pushes itself in the face of mainstream feminism.
After almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors have arrived at the southwestern border of the country this year, the issue of immigration reform is again on the surface - this time as a woman's theme.
Andrea Mercado, Co-President of We Belong Together, an organization which mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a review of the topic as a major theme, they should only publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the large majority of labour visas are available to male immigrants, the women accompanying them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a clue in women's organizations," she said.
"Sweine House" in Ipswich is for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed from real estate mowers, as it was shown that it showed a large woman who had made herself comfortable in the living room.
The holiday house has a bedroom, is on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for 120,000 £.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - of which also a Swine heard that his head had prayed on a sofa.
Immobilienmakler Connells said the wine on the photo was the owner's pet.
"But the photo was suddenly published and removed between," said one company's speaker.
In the exhibition of the house, Connells described the former meeting house as a "unique single family house with a bedroom."
Although the artist has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The sale of the house provided social media for interest, as some asked whether the wine was included in the purchase price.
After Lottowinn, the SW City Harvey hides a new millionaire
A Lotto player from Harvey is out this month
The search for a new millionaire in the south-west of Perth is going on, with a happy winner who gets almost $1.1 million from the lottery on Saturday.
A newspaper skiing in Harvey took the jackpot to the first division for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the happy winner still has to sign up.
The shop owner Steve Forward said that the profit was concerned about conversation in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city is talking about nothing else, and everyone's pretty excited.
We thought such a profit could come in.
Eight WA-winners have celebrated winning in the first Division last month, a rewarding conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week a player from Canning Valley was one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont arrived just a few weeks before the Megawinn of $7.5 million.
The winner couple had been playing for twenty years and said that the win allowed them to buy a world trip and a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, totalling almost $85 million.
A Leonidas in Gladiatorna
Not only did the gladiators stand in the match at the first Rheinbacher Romer day in the holiday park.
However, the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1,000 visitors yesterday, who were able to overcome the rain and the raindrops and the colds and remain eager for the historical spectacle.
There was a beautiful range of exhibitions, performances, games, exhibitions and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the Martial Battleship of the Gladiator School "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate its robust battle art with soft sand.
The gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and professional presenter and sent his men to the ring for the bright twin struggle in various gladiatorial corrections.
First, the "provocators" were on the line with right-hand and short-sighted as well as legs on the left leg and armschien on the right arm.
It followed the "Essedarii" with chestnuts, shorts and spinal cord, as well as its gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the "retiarius", which was attacked by a fire net, Dreizack and Dolch against the "Sector" and shortly after fighting the burs on the ground.
As the heavy metallic contrasts, the blades created, and the walnuts flew suddenly through the arena that a fear and flag could become of the health of gladiators.
But on the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscleless judge, had a constant eye.
"We wanted to survive the Roman daily and experience the culture of the Roman era," explained Lorenz Euskichen, president of the organizer "Freundeskreis Romemercanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, an "Oppidum Romanum" was set up from the outdoor park for a day, as Vizebürger Master Claus Wehage has stated in his speech.
Finally, the Romans brought not only war and conquest into our region but also the Roman culture and many buildings that we still admire today.
The rest of it was also to be destroyed on the day of Rome, about "Aquadukt-Marmor" from the 11th meters high and 1400 meters long Roman canal bridges, which were at the site of Lüfttelberg.
The Frontinus company put water and energy supply first and now, and business leader Petra Fricke knew, "We are still benefiting from the knowledge of that time".
This is also confirmed by the "Innovative TeamTwo" of Rheinbach, the instruments of measurement of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Romemerville in Blancenheim presented ski lifts and models from the excavations anno 1894, as well as steel stones from the original Hypokaste, the heat heating, which first heated the Romerville.
It is also impressive that the foot prints that were left by Wolf and Fuchs two thousand years ago left in the foothills of the ton before they were burned.
In 2011, the Landesverband Rheinland's Landesverband had excavated the rest of a Roman villa in the North Business Park in Rheinbach.
It has been found that the walls of an economic building have been covered with a hole for drying of wheat and flour.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural good, explained the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of fragments from these decorations were presented in a glass-vitrine, including a large counter, several fine glassware, as well as parts of a leather chain.
The villa may have existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the collapse of the Germans in Rome at the time.
In her career, the children also worked with the Roman windmill game, like today's ball game, or they wrote their names with metal taps on tables.
At the position of the Roman thermal Zülpich, the children were forced to lay the mosaics themselves, build the glass museum of Rheinbach Glasmosikas, and at the location of the natural centre Eifel Nettersheim served a heavy white powder of stone to soften the flour for a floor break or a mousli.
With the original Roman passenger car built by two Kalt flowers, the visitors went through the leisure park and came to the impressive state of the city Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Romer Project Weeks" here.
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also be included in the 2014 Rome-wide Rome-wide event to commemorate the death of Kaiser August 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and history associations, as well as the Wander-Verein watch, the partnership and the Oberbachem playground, they are offered a lecture, cooks, and guides for school classes and remind you of the past of the Roman Wachtbergs.
For example, a Roman legionary will be told of his work at the present watchberg, presented plants as living memories from the time of Rome and presented a significant teaching time in matters of international understanding between a group of German waiters and those who are drawn to Rome.
The Adendorfer Primary School is devoted to the Roma theme during a project week.
With the Roman week, the numerous, but often no longer should be re-experted on the first visible traces of the Romans in the Wachtberg.
A small presentation at the foundation of the Berkumer Matronenheiliglum will be remembered in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic imposes the West African Economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious threat to the economy.
Markets are confused - and international companies go far.
The dominant Ebola epidemic is the West African economy.
The Gents are scattered on the fields that have been left and the markets have been destroyed - the virus has added to the region.
Some international companies are already on the move.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis but also an economic one," says the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is most affected
"It is a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothing on the second largest market in Liberia's capital, Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola will be on the market.
Liberia is the worst hit by the virus, alone here the fever falls more than 600 people to the victim.
The health authorities have recently stated that the disease is alleged in every corner of the country.
Also in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria have spread the virus.
In total, more than 1,500 people have died, thousands more have joined them.
Foreign firms withdraw employees
Over the resources countries are placing companies at their disposal.
Foreign companies such as steel companies Arcelor Mittal withdraw their employees, and several international airlines no longer fly to the regions concerned.
The domestic merchants and farmers also react: only a few people leave their homes to provide shelter.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under Quarantine, the main coffee and coffee beans in the fields are broken.
The farmers did not drive it to leave their homes for the orphans.
Food becomes scarce
"People will travel ever less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris expert on the West African economy.
The man, for example, who normally goes to the market and sells his shirt, remains more than that.
Therefore, the population is experiencing the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food becomes scarce.
On the markets, the precedent for basic food products such as rice.
At the same time, the strong influence of international companies in the region depends on an image - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international firms are mainly spending long-term time in the area, says Philippe Hugon of the French Think Tank Iris.
Be determined how far and how long the virus will spread.
In the case of investors, the impression could be "that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and therefore to invest," warns Hugo.
The disease also imposes the strategized state-owned holdings of the states
The disease also imposes on the state resources of the countries concerned the unexploded.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be severely stratified by the high expenditure on the health system and in addition by the corrupt economy.
The African Development Bank has already agreed to assist the health systems of the countries concerned with $60 million (EUR 45 million).
Unfortunately, the effects are also already in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
Although the southern Nigerdelta region has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere many people are already afraid of being housebound.
Also bookings in hotels go back to great lengths.

The "Dannenwald" Berngau champion celebrates its 50-year-old foundation festival from 12 to 14 September.
The preparations for the 50th anniversary of the establishment of September 12 to 14 are being held at high tours at the protection zone Tannenwald.
It is scheduled on Friday, 12 September, a large entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker".

Fest capelle is the Blasakalle Bergau.
The government has taken over Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schütztengesschaft Tannenwald Berngau" comes from 1907, when the Union was founded on 21 March to "social maintenance through living room and small-scale skiing".
The NS regime had ordered the resolution of the Union in 1937.
Only in 1964 were 19 young men found themselves in the house of Lukas, who took the "new" shield "tannenwald" Berngau out of the pool on April 30, 1964.
Karl Marz and Adolf Ried led the union as a champion through a difficult time of the beginning, where it was the first time to find a union location and to install the ship operations.
Already in the autumn of 1965, the guard company in the guesthouse "Leinger" began fighting with two men.
In the years that followed, the sport protections, which were currently organized in seven men, were established in all classes up to 1st Gauliga.
The union record was cleaned annually and the magic limit of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the performance of the active shields has increased, the membership figures have also developed positively.
After the merger "Leingers" has no longer met the requirements of a modern protection unit, the then-run company decided to create a future dominol in the basements of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After a 2700-hour workout on 8 May 1988, Pfarer Streets distributed the church’s new protection rooms.
One of the great heights in the history of the Union was certainly the 44th. Gaussies, linked to the celebrated whiteness of the new stage of protection in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Defence Forces celebrated its 30-year-old construction jubilee.
In 1995 a group of farmers was established.
Josef Schmalzl was referred to as Böller.
A major challenge for the "buller" and the Union as a whole was the orientation of the Bayern Buller Meeting in 2005.
In many hours of honorary work, the members of the Union have modernized the rooms and the storage facilities in Bergauer Hof and have thus brought to the latest state of technology.
Elf Teams in R & D
You can also see the sports services of the Association.
In total, eleven men are currently involved in the round-up battle: six aircraft men, one aircraft gun man, one sport gun KK1, one young and two AH men.

The 2nd mansion with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml have arrived from the Gauglia North to the Gauoberlaga.
In addition to the skiing sport, events such as basketball, fashioning and royal ball, holiday flight and Christmas holiday tradition have been held.
With this, the shields are also at the festivals in Pfarrei and community.
Tony Stewart caused an accident when returning to the race track
Tony Stewart's return to the racetrack ended about half the way through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart went against the wall for the second time after his right forwards in round 172 and ended up at night.
Stewart went into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team leader Chad Johnston said his 14-year-old team was disappointed, but now focus on the race next week in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better use and a better outcome for him," said Johnston.
We go to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart had already been running on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch in a wall and had to repair the right side of his car.
"I've come into good hopes today with right hope," said Johnston, adding, "It just didn't regret it."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the locker and the team had packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart released three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at an axle race in the north of New York State.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who was on a race on the train to confront Stewart.
On Friday, the authorities announced that the investigations due to the accident would be carried out for at least two weeks.
There was no decision on whether Stewart had to file a complaint.
The dramatic champion was received with great surprise when he was presented before the race.
After a start at position 12, Stewart was already in the first 10 claims and was temporarily placed in place four.
After a reboot in round 122, empty pockets
Cars with No. 18 out of control after the exit from Curve 2 and collitised with Stewart, where both cars ran against the wall.
Stewart went on, but he went back to place 21.

Bulgarian prison guards protest throughout the country
Hundreds of prison staff from all over Bulgaria have organized a country-wide protest before the Ministry of Justice in Sofia's capital.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands after restoring their old working conditions that were recently changed.
There is also a list of claims to be discussed with interim Justice Minister Christo Ivanov.
Officials have been protesting for a month in symbol of the new working hours and calling for a return to the previous 24-hour shots.
Despite the meetings between the association of prison workers and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the Bulgarian National Ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations continued, and the Director-General for the implementation of criminal measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov, gave the BNR.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the Association of Staff of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian Army granted Luhansk airport
In Ukraine, the Prussian fighters are still on the front line.
After heavy fighting, which apparently also involved Russian panzerballoons, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, set up the airport of the Rebelenhochburg Luhansk.
The army shared that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Peter Poroshenko had already taken personal consequences from the heavy downset of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the Supreme Army's conduct without detail.
Prorussian separatists shot off aircraft
In the fight against Ukrainian government strikes, Persian separatists once again destroyed a fighter aircraft and two military bombers.
In addition, about 100 soldiers were injured or killed in wars in the Donzk region, and the rebels joined the Russian agencies on Monday.
Coast Guard Ships Deployed
The rebels also claimed that two ships had first landed in the Asows' Sea of the Ukrainian Coast Guard.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships were flying by sea on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
When seven border guards were injured, a speaker in Kiev told the sender 112.au.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Foreign media made Russia responsible for the incident.
The separatists reported that several areas in the Donezk area had been under their control.
Diplomatic Offensive in Minsk
Today, the Ukrainian contact group is in the city of Minsk, the capital of the White Russia.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, a messenger of the separatists from Ukraine should participate.
In advance, all actors used their appearances to make their request publicly known.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia because of the Ukraine crisis in Eastern Europe.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels, NATO took part in the 1997 NATO-Russia Council's founding agreement.
However, the NATO chief accused Russia of "a serious breach" of the Agreement.
"Today we must see the reality that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner," Rasmussen said.
From documents and opinions of the Russian side, "to see us as enemies".
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen also announced that he would like to strengthen NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A NATO summit in Wales to conclude "Readiness Action Plan" will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the east as long as it is necessary," Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow have some on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have subsequently agreed on official data on new talks to deal with their gas dispute.
The negotiations were scheduled for the next Saturday, said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak on Monday.
The European Union will also be expected to decide whether it is also a representative of the discussions.
Because of the dispute over gas prices, Ukraine has been unable to obtain any fuel from Russia for weeks.
Finally, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger announced between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt the gas supply for Europe.
Europe has about a third of its land gas from Russian sources, most of which flows through Ukraine.
Marker Speaks Answer: but will come "ganz clear"
Now the Chancellor's face is clear.
However, it is not a book for all complicated details.
Heartwarming thoughts from the CDU against the Pkw-Maut have given rise to the CSU.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke after persistent opposition from her CDU in response to the introduction of a Pkw-Maut.
"To be clear: she is in the coalition treaty, and she will come," the party chief said on Monday after the meetings of the CDU-Spitzengrems in Berlin.
In a detailed model, however, Merkel did not first establish itself.
In the black-rolled government programme, there were certain parameters.
Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobindt (CSU) has "made a proposal and is now continuing to work on it".
The NRW CDU, however, needs its no to a wall on all roads.
Markel stressed, too, that Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is constructively involved in the discussions on a draft law.
In addition, he spoke with Dobindt about further opportunities to activate more private capital for infrastructure investments, including in broadband development.
"There's nothing special about it." Söubble had left a "spigel" report uncommented on Sunday to check his house a own concept to pay car investors with interest - after the 2017 election.
CSU-Chief Horst Seehofer therefore warned to develop in the Cabinet the concept of Mautkonste against the federal minister.
CDU-Bundesvise Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The Coalition Treaty never went out of it to host all circuit and federal roads," said the North Rhine-Westphalia CDU president.
Otherwise, it would be an important signal that Seahofer has now announced once again to talk about the subject.
Opposition to the plans also comes from Baden Württemberg and Rhineland Pfalz.
The background is fears that a wall will affect the small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seahofer had demanded a series of CDU coalition streams due to the wall criticism.
The left sees the plans in the face of the conflict in the Union as broken down.
"The Murks-Maut is dead," said Party chief Bernd Riexinger of the "New Osnabrücker News" (Montag).
"With the Wall, the Minister is breaking up." Dobindt wants to introduce a Vignet's duty on all German streets to start in 2016.
According to the Coalition Agreement, domestic car owners may not be taxed additionally.
Therefore, they should receive a full comparison of the Kfz tax for the wall.
However, the model cannot be shared by foreign drivers in accordance with EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
One Brittin says she thought she was going to die as a result of a missing diagnosis over many years.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the faith that she had only a few years to live after she had been diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, it is located at the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of serious disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and backmark.
Charity CMT UK reported that missing diagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT, because it is so little known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in Britain are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, insecure walking and damaged teeth.
Patients also suffer from feelings of depression or pain. The disease is unhappy and progressive, which means that the symptoms become worse with time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she was suffering from anxiety at the Peace Ataxia (FA) - a disease with very bad chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she'd sit in the wheelchair before she was 18, and died before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, now 51 years of age, said: "As a child I knew I couldn't do the same as the others.
I fell down all the time, and everything lasted longer with me.
I was never able to ride with the other children Rollschuh or Skateboard and was often sent to school because of my nature and to run.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several operations to deload her achilles vision and to pull her feet out of her illness when her doctor left the room and read that she was in the FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA company," she said.
When I received the answer, I was shocked and scared in panic.
I thought I'd be in the wheelchair with 18 and die with 25, and in the meantime, I'd lose all my skills.
I did it all alone with me and planted my own preparation.
She said when she turned 17, she became clear that her abilities had not been taken as strongly as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just stood up, and he woke me up and said, "Dear, I don't think you've got it, or you're already in the wheelchair."
I think you have something much less life-threatening.
Following some genetic tests, CMT was established.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has started a CMT-Awaress month to pay attention to this disease.
A. D. Berni Dieter has been working since the end of the former crew space as a fireworker
For almost ten years, no more shoots will be shot at the former gang site in Monsingen.
Nevertheless, every month the deadly munitions in the heart of the Biospheric Alb comes up.
The granaries are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be thrown in front of the place.
A non-smoothing knall stops at the blasts over the heart of the biospheric area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot took place at the Münsingen Group, which was completed after 110 years of military operation.
Since this time, the 6500 hectares large area has been the core of the Swiss Alb, which is opened on 13 dedicated routes for passengers and passengers.
Tax burden on business people in Washington is rising with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax decisions for companies in the country in the past year have been slightly increased, while economic recovery has accelerated, so a new published study in the past week, and the companies in the Washington area had no exception.
Enterprises in the Area District, Maryland and Virginia totaled $27.6 billion to state and local positions in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to 2012 revenue of $26 billion.
The State and local tax burden of the company increased by 4.3 per cent in the past year to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent in the previous year, and it was the third year of growth following several years of declining notifications 2009 and 2010.
State taxes are higher than local charges, by 4.3 per cent, so the study conducted by the service agency Ernst & Young with the State Tax Centre was conducted by a tax policy group.
More than half of the tax revenues in the district, 56 per cent, are from corporate taxes, while 36 per cent of Maryland's revenues are from companies.
Virginia achieves the lowest tax revenues from companies by 28 per cent.
A large part of the increase in tax revenues is based on a reduction in company real estate values, says researchers, which led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after the next three years with growth rates of less than 1 per cent.
While much of this profit came from large states, such as California, New York and Texas, the run seems to meet for the Washington Room.
Enterprises in the District, Maryland and Virginia contributed more than $10 billion to state and local real estate taxes in the past year, compared to $9.6 billion 2012 - an increase in one year by 4.2 percent.
However, the apparent recovery in real estate values in Maryland is not as effective in increasing government and local tax revenues as the real estate taxes are almost more than one fifth of the company's tax decisions.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, a large part of the property, especially in the tax area around D.C., is owned either by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, director of the State Taxation Centre.
Maryland is therefore forced, for example, to leave much more on income taxes in order to provide the same services that other countries offer.
The most recent recovery of tax revenues by companies cannot be attributed only to the recovery of the real estate market.
Company revenue also seems to be obtained, such as the data.
Companies in the region reported revenue taxes to state organisations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland received $1 billion in company income tax, the highest amount in the region.
As the trend goes the same direction, local tax burden for companies does not rise equally in all three places.
The rate of increase in the district reached 4.3 per cent at the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 per cent.
Only Virginia reported an average tax income of 4.1 per cent.
Virginia has 6 per cent in all three official areas of the most significant company income tax (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The company tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 per cent and the district is 9,975 per cent relatively high.
A comparable study of the US Hand Room at the beginning of this year showed that lower government and local corporate taxes are required in Virginia and a better tax climate is generally dominated by Maryland.
In the study, the district was not examined.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure through its southern neighbours.
North Carolina has adopted laws to reduce its corporate tax rates in this year by 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall by 5 per cent next year.
If the State continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the state's income tax rate by 3 per cent by 2017.
In the meantime, small businesses in Washington seem to go better, and they pay more government and local taxes, such as the latest study.
Enterprise taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business people - a transition structure, which is organized by most small companies - in the district, Maryland and Virginia last year, rise to 20 per cent to $2.4 billion, a significant rate of growth compared to the corporate taxes as a whole.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes in the entire country is likely to be maintained this year, with an increase in the general VAT revenue for the State and local governments by 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
However, the Washington area could be reduced if the Federal Government's spending cuts on the labour market in the region.
Partner city: Deutsches Bier for Guangzhou
Hope and Malz - also a popular combination in China.
Deutsche's beer enjoys a wonderful reputation in China.
Frankfurt Partner City in China is now looking forward to a bridge and also looking forward to a direct connection between the two cities.
Deutsches Bier, used in Frankfurt Partner City Guangzhou, thus expresses the urgent desire of officials in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German browser were to be released into our city," said the vice-president of the South Chinese Metropole, Li Yiwei, during a visit to a SPD delegation in his city this week.
Again, the executive of the ruling Communist Party of China came back in the course of the conversation on this occasion of the twelve million-metropoles.
Guangzhou, also known as Canton in Germany, was one of China's richest cities, Li.
Therefore, people also see the power of buying to produce German beer.
The Hessian SPD President Thorsten Schäfer-Gombil, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would join a possible partner in Germany for the project.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, vegetables and pleasure of life," he added on lunch with the party worker in Guangzhou.
This pleasure of life has already come out of Mr. Li, and he kissed the guest.
However, the official from Guangzhou started with a cherries - but with red wine, which was served for food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German bridge art.
Tsingtao-Bier is used after the German cleaning offer.
More Business Transport
A second wish of the Chinese guest would be a direct link between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vize-Party chief Li.
The Airthansa had offered the flight earlier, but in 2012 it was economical.
"It would be rewarded again," said the Communist politician.
"The business between our two cities continues to grow."
At the time, visitors had to take the village over Changsha in Hunan Province, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong Province, the capital of Guangzhou, is also looking forward to the flight connection.
The Deputy Governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this desire forward in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," answered the Creator-Gombel - Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate German, did not agree.
Member States shall ensure that the following conditions are met:
The famous vice-president of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt in the coming year for a partnership.
Li Yiwei was already at Main, but not yet in this function.
He came to the office this year only after his predecessor was transferred from the office because of corruption.
The local leader, Van Qinglian, had to go.
The action against the officials of Guangzhou is part of a country-wide campaign against corruption in party and administration carried out by Head of State Xi Jinping.
The new top policy Li Yiwei had worked for an American company in front of his partner, which is the most unusual in the Communist Party of China.
Before his office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top executive in Fujian, where the car manufacturer VW built a large factory.
Frankfurt has officially entered more than a thousand city partnerships.
The connection to Guangzhou, which is 9000 kilometres away, belongs to those who are assigned by both sides, about a school exchange.
In the past year, the 25-year-old presence of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The South Chinese Metropole at Perflus is as strong as the whole horse with its economic power.
In the next year, they wanted to reach a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li reported.
The family of Joan Rivers "presses the dams"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious three days since her delivery to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter has now expressed the hope that the 81-year-old comer will recover from her illness.
"Thanks for your continuing love and support," said Melissa Rivers today in a message.
We'll press all the dams.
Her mother was subsequently delivered on Thursday after a heart attack in a hospital at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, in Mount Sinai Hospital.
The doctors keep them deliberately seated and under close observation until they are satisfied with their condition, which will continue to be described as “ernst”.
The reactions came from many sides, also in the form of a overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly dust cleaners and rising wages
For cars and vacuum cleaners who come to trade today, future environmental standards apply.
Like refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners from 1 September receive a label on which the buyer can recognize central data on a glance like the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, the "Euro 6" category of waste shall apply to solid carbon values.
In addition, there is more money for the hardware farmers: they receive a federally uniform minimum wage of €10.25.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON confirmed what information he had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a lot of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($990 million).
The announcement is surprising, not because no one had expected a quote from Twitch, but because it was strongly suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago it appeared as if the sale of Twitch to Google's video service for a cool billion things was decided, and cooperation seemed natural.
Twitch, which was founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their profits in games, a "Youtube for live games", so an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre, in which the best-known player (most elderly) plays to provide an incentive from memory science theatres, are already very popular on YouTube.
It's also that YouTube is often called if you want to describe Twitch, so the news was that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy, took a long time ago, an example of a established technical company that buys a potential competitor.
It is a clue why the deal with YouTube could not be achieved because the company was prepared to report, as well as to pay a lot like Amazon.
All we know at the moment is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We have decided for Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret is, honestly, the incredible success of Twitter.
For Snobs like me, who explain that they run more sports than to see it, it is difficult to understand the attraction that comes from seeing others in the games rather than taking control consoles into hand.
It's a thing to look at a friend about 3 o'clock in the morning while she's being shot at by resident Evil, and something else to look at a spinner about how he gets shot 20 times later in Call of Duty in the head.
All these games can be viewed right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games are today ego games, so without self-control, vision can be a good recipe for headaches.
I promise that the fast transitions in which the Roger Bannisters complete all the games in record time are consistent.
But as long as it's not a game or humorous, its Twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do you know about a sceptic like I already know?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the largest source of Internet traffic.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch will be integrated as elegantly in Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could easily have shut down.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who will be recruited as advertising agents.
As the president of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "believe both in the future of the game," and the media does not show signs of a fall, nor even - luck - as spectator sport.
At Hüpfburg, at the Burggartenfest, there was a lot of noise on the Sunnabend.
The concept of the organizers agreed.
Despite the strong rain on Saturday evenings, 1200 musicians came to the open air festival in Burggarten.
Time had to stop the entry.
"That was embarrassing," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzzedel l Light and fun.
Of two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
Because the open air in Salzdell Burggarten is supposed to reflect light on the day and night through various shows.
Well, the fun comes from alone.
This was already shown in early Sunday as the first visitors opened to the Open Air.
The organizers had promised a party for all generations.
And that was their achievement.
Around the supply conditions in the Burggardenweise, Salzdeler had also made guests from the nearby and further surroundings comfortable.
They followed the first live performances, waving with the foot in the cab, enjoying cold drinks - short: recreation pure and fun were said.
And that's what the generations do.
While the white sand on the extra-carted sand on the beach bar, others were resting on a quarter of wine in the Vinothek, the baby died on the hill, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even at the children's feast, the volunteers had the true meaning of the word to make all hands full to become the awe of the Lord and to impress fantastic creatures into the small faces.
The larger used the kickertics or participated in a Skateboard workshop designed by the Goodfoot Crew from Salswedel.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 17.30 a.m., he spoke to the visitors, especially the families, looking for the width and the dryness.
But the attraction of the festival did not break.
"It's more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "continuity on the whole line."
Therefore, there is no objection to a repetition of the great party in the coming year.
Despite the content and size of the event, Sam made it clear in the first balance on Sunday against the people's vote.
As a shame, he mentioned that the entrance had to be stopped in the meantime.
Obviously, the security firm was booked with very little strength.
The consequences: Some who had already paid were no longer on the ground.
The resonance would have been very good.
In a first careful estimate, the Salvadoran co-organizer spoke with about 1200 visitors who were gathered in the Burggarde.
There was a problem with Tontech.
The Salzedele Hip-Hop Band Blocks`n`Rox therefore delayed their performance.
The technicians were not able to create a semi-sound sound.
The planned Shisha-Longes could not be built because the cells could not be brought to Salszedel because of a rainpan.
"But in the next year they will be there," said the organizer.
The Amula Open Air premium was more than successful by the number of visitors.
And that's bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some errors that are still to be removed for the first time, but the second edition must be deleted.
In the social network Facebook also has to cover the organizers' criticisms.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you have just expected more," Melanie Meier says on the event page.
"I'm sorry you've taken a little too far," says Ele Zimmermann at the same place.
Others don't see the initial problems as serious.
I think it's very good that some not only stupid quats, but also really trying to put something on the legs.
Shut up!" wrote Stephanie Jenz to the Amula.
Now the organizers remain a year's time to dismiss these critical points.
New Radom in Berkum: Watchberg's signs are broken
It is not expected.
More is waiting for the existing component to be used in the marked construction.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the TIRA global observation radar is established, the hole, the so-called radom, will be completely renewed.
The new radius will be something smaller than the old one with a diameter of 47.5 meters.
But the size still remains world record.
The last step to complete the new hole is the cappentry exchange
The upper quarter of the old hole is cut off and taken off with a crown.
Then the last quarter of the new hole will be set up.
If the weather is playing, the action should start this week over the stage.
A participant in the Ice Bucket Calle deserves Kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from Britain cried so much when her iced water was poured over her head that she damaged the bone structure of her face.
This Ice Bucket Challenge became painful.
A woman was admitted to the hospital after she had been so drunk at the Ice Bucket Calle that she had removed the driver.
Isabelle Roberts, from Britain, grew so much as her iced water was poured over her head that she damaged her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I cried, and while I was doing, my liver just stood up," she said against The Mirror.
Eivasser is being protected over the 20s.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but it didn't go, the driver was injured, and then I realized that something didn't work out.
My mother and my sister saw that too, and they almost got into the house before laughing, but I had to get into the emergency.
The 20-year-olds from Britain were admitted to the hospital to allow the driver to re-enter the official course on Tuesday.
The Clip was linked to an Internet sensation and thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Do the bourgeoises soon see a beach again?
In the past, there was always a dispute between the two Wolffragshauser bourgeoises.
Now the Presidents are thinking about possible cooperation.
As an example of the reconstruction of the Wolffraghaus Burg, the deceased Richard Dimbath, former president of the Wolffragshaus burg friends, led the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the bourgeois and the bourgeois de Volfrachhausen.
Speaking in different ways, the positions to be taken up with the history of the Wolffraghaus Burg and a possible reconstruction have yet to be taken.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: talk about a common process should be held soon.
This is confirmed by the United President Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfriends) at the request of our newspaper.
"I have called Mr Piffl and proposed that we be able to assemble ourselves once," Sjöberg reports.
In his view, all members of the Union could be drawn back into a string in the future.
This would be the fastest way to record the results.
While the city's friends around the sudden death of Richard Dimbath had a reconstruction of the city at Bergwald, the "conclusion and survival" of the country was the first place for the Burgverein in Sjöberg.
Herbert Piffl, the second president of the bourgeois company, was very pleased with his own comments on the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he's been here with his friends.
A new president is to be found in a meeting of members in mid-September.
The Union is currently numbering about 40 members over the 74 years.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we started to relax the activities of respect." This "denk phase" was necessary to "extreme how it could go on".
According to Piffl, the new president is going to talk to the borough.
Until then, the citizens could also make a current vote within their group.
A candidate for the presidency is not yet available, says Piffl.
"But I'm sure someone will find himself." He doesn't want to apply for himself because he has his residence in Bad Tulz.
The new president is supposed to be a Wolffraghshauser.
The speaker wants to "but very much to continue to work" on the project.
The different positions in matters of reconstruction are likely to remain in the eyes of Piffls in the near future.
He deserves Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the city.
Two similar projects already advanced in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock.
Through a high participation of the people and by voluntary contributions from all over the world, they were a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "And I was skeptical at first.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it is worthwhile to move forward the project. It could create a "all-setting mark" for the river city.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be financially funded by EU grants, visitors tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"The idea of reconstruction, therefore, is not simply about boarding myself." He hopes that the bourgeoisman may move something at this point.
Their goal to document history first is "it's important and good".
Then you could go on.
Clevere Ways to Save With Uni Teachers
Since the cost of Uni-Teachers for many students is more than $1,000 per year, the fast-second master student Matt Schroeder gave himself a sleek sparidee.
He found a rental system for books from higher students and offered a nominal compensation to delay the sale.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A-Keks," said Schroeder, 19, who visited the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester had cost him $430, he said.
He paid out $120.
The college team shared that the average students spent more than $1,200 per year for textbooks and study materials, however, providing different cost-intensive options for the students.
Online countries and creative ways such as the Schroeders are increasingly the choice for students.
The rental of textbooks is more popular, and thus students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, who holds more than 250 university libraries, reported that the rental of text books has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in college books were rented last spring, said Neebos Vice President Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased according to the declaration of the Trade Association National Association of College Stores in Campus Books.
Here's the one time for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books are available online only a third of the price they have in the Campus Bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostettler costs nearly $290, but can be considered for $239.99 for the specialized textbook dealer Chegg.com.
Buy Used
If one does not make the notes of other or normal use trails, the books used are a good option.
"Calculus" is required to have on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, final student at Brigham Young University, says he has issued 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategical Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold again for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls advise students to ask their professors whether ex-posts are eligible.
Sometimes the updates for the seminars are not relevant.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be purchased for a fraction of the costs of the latest expenditure.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc is also a popular alternative to used books.
Notifications
The rental of textbooks is worth a transfer if you treat them well, think about it, return them, and do not want to keep the books after the course ends.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Please inform yourself about the terms of the transaction you are planning, as well as about the penalties, etc., for writing notes, underlines or use trails.
Adjusted renter: If you do not return the book, the penalties may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are rented de facto by providing an electronic license for a certain period of wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc...
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literary courses often find the best offers, since many classics can be downloaded today free of charge, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Look at every case.
Joe Gaul, 29, who is first visited by the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for price fixing in books, as it can be so safe to find the correct textbook.
And before an online order, you should check if the book is really ready.
He learned this lesson on the heart tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery time and finally paid the full price in college books.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" didn't become a casserole
"The Expedables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million in his $90 million budget in the United States, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" only $12 million in his $70 million budget.
The movie "Sex tape" on Cameron Diaz played only $14.6 million on the opening week, while children's films such as "Drinking made easy 2" were also released at the reception.
An article from the Telegraph Film Criticist Robbie Collin points out that the children's films of lack of quality could be the reason for the films themselves.
Collin referred to 2014 as "the worst year" so far for children's films and described "Drinking made easy 2" as a pure "functional" Fantasy translation.
However, in films for an older target group it seems as if the quality of the film is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic evaluation for each summer film start, which was shown between the American Memorial Day and the 20th July 2013 and in the current year at least 2,000 Leinds.
The results are based on the opinion of cinematographics and film critics and indicate that this year's films are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that the development of changing visual habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services as Netflix is to be carried back.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working in Disney's newly appeared Dschungelbook film, said to Hollywood reporter: "I believe the times change."
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the current weak cash output of Hollywood productions, netflix has recently produced sales with the streaming content of $1.2 billion, almost doubles as much as in the previous year, in which the turnover was estimated at $837 million.
In the last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on films of Comics and predicting a "Kernschmelze" Hollywoods.
In the light of the current outbreak, some commentators argue that his mysterious prophecy could contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cassettes expected in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in cash results as a simple "cyclical" and said to Hollywood reporter: "The next summer will be the largest summer in the cinema, and no one will worry about the business anymore."
A few years ago, when the second court-trial class was ordered to punish the lay integration, this was a step in the right direction.
The Deutsche Tischennisbund has now adopted an additional 3rd German flag in the programme.
The consequence is that whoever is not resurrected shall be raised again.
So Göttingen's top class team Torpedo in the Oberliga relegation has avoided the decline, but in the coming season only five classes.
Torpedos Damen, despite her great throughmarks, remained in the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo begin in the Lower Saxony, as well as the boys of the SC Wende.
The SG Langlern and the Torpedo Reserves take place in the new League, in the Landeslaga, no Gothtinger Clubs are represented anymore.
In the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the Verbandslaga, the Torpedo-Sweite in the Landesslaga.
What the composition looks like as a better district class is now the new southernmost region.
Here are TSV Seoulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Inbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, the FC Weser and the TTC.
In the district camp, regional representatives Dransfeld and the SC Wende play, in the district class of TTC II, Red-West, Bovender SV II and TTV Geismar II and III teams. The district sovereignty of the women begins at least in solar power.
Güntersen, TTC and TTV Geismar II are here with the party.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarhausen are starting in the region.
With your nine men
The SC Wende sends his daughters to the small district camp.
Even the regional level of the SCW boys - there is still Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Wende and the Bovender SV go to the season.
In the first season of the newly established regional bond, the two gods circled around with your nine men.
In the West stage are the Red White II, Bovender SV III, Lubuch II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Milenhausen and SG Langlern II.
In the east stage, there are also satenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landofshausen.
The queen-Kreislaga consists of satenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Heavens, Seulingen II, Tuspo Wende and the SG Rhume.
It's still better than in the oesterode circle, where there's no women's teams at all on the circle level.
Assuming that none of the six 2nd class of crisis can achieve solitude, this is where the innovative and dynamic circuit board will have to think once again.
Nato summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests against the Nato-Gipfel's enemies in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the center of Newport for an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people arrived in Cardiff before the city hall to stop a so - called confrontation.
Stephen Fairclough has followed the developments on the weekend and talked to demonstrators who have moved from Bridgend to Belgium.
Player fled from the Blue Mountains
Two young bus drivers were taken safely with the sailboat after they spent the night in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
DAS 16-year-old girls and the 19-year-old man recently arrived at Govets Leap in Blackhead on Sunday.
Protected relatives called the police about 20 hours after they were both not back home.
A search call from local police and rescue services occurred and the couple was found about 23 hours near the Bridal Veil Water Case.
The girl had hurt herself in the neck, and the man was beaten and his head had fallen off.
Rescue forces stayed overnight with the couple, and they were fired tomorrow morning.
They were delivered in a stable condition with a hospital car in the Blue Mountain Hospital.
Escalize government enemy protests in Pakistan
About 1,000 demonstrators were forced by soldiers from the PTV building, said Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid.
After a good half hour, the transmitter re-entered the radiation.
PTV director Athar Faroq said that demonstrators had damaged devices in the editing.
Deaths or injuries have not been reported.
The demonstrators demand the return of the Head of Government to which they propose elections.
The police shared that about a mile away from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, it would have been again on Monday to meet with some 3,000 demonstrators with security forces.
After hospitalization, a police officer was injured.
On the weekend at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured, as demonstrators tried to claim Sharif's residence.
They shall request the return of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military had called on a political solution to the conflict after a meeting in the army headquarters on Sunday, "without time to waste and use no violence".
The Communication further stated: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state."
The scalaring violence has caused concern over an invasion of the military, which has been more frequent in the past.
The protests launched by opposition politicians Imran Khan and the preachers Tahirul Qadri have continued since the day of independence on 14 August.
Sharif leaves a retreat.
Khan and Qadri had called their supporters on Sunday to quit.
"We won't go back without Sharif forced to return," said Khan.
Qadri was similar.
Khan suggests that Sharif have won the parliamentary election last May by a vote.
Qadri calls for the return of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and issue new reports.
More than 40,000 security forces are used to protect the government's territory.
The demonstrators had at first appealed peacefully to Parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them on the weekend to invite them to stay with Sharifs.
Hütteldorfer after the second season on three tables.
With 2:0 over Grödig, he took a bitter weekend for quick.
"The victory is very friendly," said trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intertwine on Thursday afternoon with the European League.
"The success experience was incredibly important," confirmed Captain and Torstoze Steffen Hofmann, who raised three in place with Green-West.
Schrammel-traumtor brings Rapid to victory streets Rapid with the second season shows the right reaction to the tension against Helsinki and goes with a success experience in the country game break.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said foreign defence Thomas Schrammel, who, with his great driving Volleyy from the sixteenth century in the 14th minute, made the candles victorious.
"I thought I'd clean up all the fruit from Thursday and cut it down under the bed," said the 26-year-olds laughing.
As a strike on 13 November 2010 last hit in a federal party, it was still for Ried.
This is why the first Master's visit to the Rapid Dress will remain in special memory.
"It's something very special for me, I'm from the rapid growth," said Schrammel.
Because of Mario Pavelic's short-term beckon-blessing, he turned his back from the left to the right side of defense and made his case very well there.
He has enough experience that he can exercise this position as well.
He has earned the tower, he has already read some assistants," praised Barisic.
Mania shows character Scrammel also delivered the bottle to 2:0 by Hofmann after a good hour, which finally made the decision.
Because before that, the guests could also have written.
"Thank God we've had some luck today," also noted the noise, which in the past few weeks has been on the show of performance and result: "The results have not been voted, but the player was always good compared to the last year."
Barisic even found that he had been "in many games better than today" - against "the strongest man who played this season in this stadium".
The first three points since July 26 have thus proved that the human being has been aware of the backdrops of the struggle: "Today my husband has shown that she has a character."
It's not less fun for him: "That we've finally played to zero again."
A lot of work during the country's game break also the situation with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavel, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl as well as Philipp Schöbesberger gave their boots, making the victory even more valuable.
"You can't forget that," said Barisic, who lost his wife three days ago and Pavelic players, "the ones were very stable in the past."
Therefore, the country's game break must be used to "squeeze holes and put a little bit in the body area", Barisic, who has five U21 outlaws in his ranks.
One who may be particularly present at the break is Captain Hofmann.
He's falling down for the man, he's going through pain.
Just in this difficult phase he has shown that he is a very important player for us," Barisic noted.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his conversion in 68. Minutes not only the structure, but also the second tower.
For the 33-year-old, who graduated his 350. Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: "Don't think it's all right now" "We've certainly had a little luck, but sometimes the happiness has to come back to us too.
Now it was the best time," said Hofmann.
He was free to work on concentrated work: "I can't always see it black and white.
We haven't played as bad in the last few weeks as it has been shown.
But we can't even believe it's all right now.
The importance of his role in the team could not be challenged.
But it's a very young man I can help very much at the moment.
They stayed with me at certain stages," said Hofmann.
Grödig-Ceach Michael Bauer had little to do with his men.
He regretted the quick encounter "from the category of Zaubertor", as well as the regular door of use in the 40th minute, which was announced by the judge of the court to the wrong.
The only thing I can do to the man is that in some stages we were not exactly enough towards the tower.
There are too few conclusions.
In defense of Maximilian Karner, it was similar: "It's just beginning bad, but then we've found clean and even made a tower.
There would have been more in the big and the broads.

We showed a powerful tribe on our summer tour series "My piece from the Rhöner Happiness" last Friday.
Several of these tree roots are still in the countryside, the imaged copy is the "sudden" over the subterranean brunt.
A narrow footway leads to about 600 years of age.
There are groups, basalt stone houses and basalt stone paintings.
A piece below the stone bridge from Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, where it stands.
Vital looks like the natural landscape, looks out over the other trees of the environment, and remembers with a range of over eight meters to an American motherfucking tree.
A small Buddha on a tree trunk indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
Despite intense research, however, there was only reference to the origin of names.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has also consulted the Bischofsheimer Archive and asked older people from subwhite bronchal to learn what connection it has with the geosurgery.
The results of his research remained the right next statement for the names.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the tigers were supposed to have moved their animals from sub-white to sea from the places where they could be driven and released from rocks.
At the foot of the tree, the animal shelters created from the rise should have been excavated.
In the meantime, the area has gained its importance back because it has actually spread back on the wires.
The area has also been declared to be the core zone of the bioosphere reserve.
However, in the presence of the stone collections, caution should be exercised, as the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular place for cruisers.
A walk leads from under-white brunt to the tree, but it is hidden.
Further ways are explained to climb up the slope and invite for extended travel.
Where's the watersburg?
However, a watersburg, which is sought for in our next assignment, is rarely found in the height.
The storage in the grave already has a good impression of the construction work, but we have some historical buildings in the countryside that could fit the construction interface.
Where is our "part of the Rhöner Happiness"?
My piece is good luck.
As in previous series of Main Posts in previous years, there will also be a return price if they have the right solution.
Anyone who likes to take photos of himself can do the same.
Under the e-mail address red.neustatt@mainpost.de, you can send us the solution as well as your very personal "Part of the Rhöner Happiness" under this heading.
The most beautiful photos will be published.
After a week of training, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, and former EU president of the EU, conducted the appointment of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as Head of EU Foreign Policy last week, following the British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers, as the government newspaper La Repubblica repeats, that the profession of Mogherini, also in the government team as a favorite, is to strengthen the position of social Democrats and their own in the EU.
He also expects an exercise for his "Reform package" in Italy.
At the same time, Renzi hopes to bring the desired left-wing base back to peace, as Mogherini will be appointed - even more in a balanced way.
With regard to the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Poland's appointed President-in-Office, Donald Tusk will be the President-in-Office of the Council, thus making a political comparison in Rome.
Because the EU Chief Diplomat will be co-rapporteur of Commission President Juncker.
The EU Parliament's strong consent is as secure as possible.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would have referred to the appointment of the 41-year politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) as a "important recognition" of the role of Italy in the EU.
La Repubblica expands optimism that the "great challenges" of the Mogherini, known for their honour, have been guaranteed for almost two decades by leading participants.
The jealous Roman is married and has two daughters.
Their participants started the promoted policy in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratic di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which joined in 2008 with the Catholic Central Party of Margherita to today's Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became the vice president of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Youth Zoist).
With the 2001 election in the Left Democrats' Party, she joined the High Party Policy, working in the Foreign Policy Division, whose leadership soon became her leader.
Its traditional focus on Italian foreign policy, such as the Middle East, was made known by studies on NATO's use in Afghanistan, where Italy is involved with a group quota, and the contacts with the social Democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, in which she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became a Premier in February 2014, he took Mogherini to his foreign minister.
If today the PD has a better relationship with the strong movement of peace in the country, which has contributed more than 40 per cent of the party's votes in the EU elections in May, then, as noted in the PD crisis, Federica Mogherini.
The situation in Brussels, which the new EU external mission has had little diplomatic experience, is therefore lacking in substance, is reflected in the PD.
In Brussels, in particular by Poland and the Baltic members, mistrustally realistic actors Mogherins will be persecuted for the crisis in Ukraine and will be diffusioned as "a foreign-friendly course".
It enhances the Pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian Gasprom, which is to be transported directly to southern Europe by the Russian company, which is also the power supply of Italy.
After Renzi became EU President in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow on her first visit to his country.
Photos that they showed with Putin at the Shake Hand were taken in Brussels with inspiration, as well as that they called the Kreml Chief for October to a country's economy summit.
In total, nine young people started their training at emz Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among these is Azubi, who has already completed another training in the company.
In four training courses, the new staff will be active in the future: electronics (three trainers), mechatrons (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All Azubi come from the country circle of Schwandorf: Tobias Brown and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidt, Johannes Beer from Neunburg in the form of the forest, Felix Domaier from Oberviechchtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Tenz.
The new trainees visited primary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, trainers from all annual courses, as well as trainers, travel to the Oberammergau team, where, among other things, a full day-to-day migration and routing are on the inside of the program.
The company numbers 435 in Germany and 950 in the world.
The number of trainees distributed throughout the year is 27.
The socialists in France should "keep their mouth shut and put France in order," said Francois Hollande's most important alliance.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided links to show "your love" for the conflicting socialist presidents whose office was being trained for misinformation at the large majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay on his side," he said with great applause.
As a disturbing gesture, the Prime Minister argued that his Government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite severe demands after the closure of the arrangement of the new Minister of Economic Affairs, Emmanuel Macrons.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande urged his mitsozialists to show themselves to the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the minister of justice, is struggling to win, in which she stands at a meeting of a more exorbitant socialist MEP, and the Socialist Party criticized her for taking the French 'the faith in their future'.
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Front, disappointed the ongoing civil wars of the Socialists and said that they could not imagine that the new Valley government would last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the Emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has no one to make them a new government if the old man has not survived a summer.
"And the new will not also survive the autumn or winter," said Mrs. Le Pen against supporters.
She repeated her party's call after Parliament's resolution and said that she was confident that she would stand up for the elections as a winner and be ready for the government.
The ruling party of France is experiencing a fall in the municipal elections in March and the national court-martial Front was in front of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of the French feel that the socialist party is at risk of falling into several rival groups prior to the end of the full-time Dutch 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the Sciences Po University, warned that the French would soon lose their patience if the new socialist government did not achieve an improvement in the economy and record unemployment.
"There is a small window for possibilities, but the public opinion must quickly feel that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could continue to worsen.
Norwegian Cruise shortly before a deal with prestigious cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third largest cross-border supplier, is leading, according to the knowledge of the industry, further negotiations on the acquisition of the competitor prestigious Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and its well-being customer while it is in competition with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (CL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could already be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the discussions could also end in vain.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) private equity company, also owns a 20 per cent share of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources are asking to remain anonymous as negotiations are not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a speaker for Apollo refused a comment.
The Norwegian Cruise, located in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenues amounted to $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, operates under the brand name Oceania and Regent, which operates together eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue of $1.2 billion for 2013, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cross-border industry is totaled at about $29 billion and in the coming years it will be expected for it because of the strengthening of the middle class in countries such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position these new customers as the best choice for cross-border suppliers.
Prestige Cruises asked the US regulatory authorities for the arrival in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder of the company since a $850 million deal 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise supplier owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a free time and casino company under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
In January 2013, Norwegian Cruise went to the Börzes.
Genting held at the end of June 28 per cent of the shares, Apollo 20 per cent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP held a share of 8 per cent of the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises are jointly available according to the original application documents for the release of Prestige Cruises over 82 per cent of passenger capacity in American cruise ships.
Pro-Hong Kong activists judge China on the day following the election decision.
A group of pecking-like groups swirled near the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a framework law allowing only two or three candidates for the Hong Kong leadership election in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority of the support of a nomination committee, which is intended to be composed of pecking-rooted members.
This decision will make it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be allowed to vote and the pro-democratic activists who were forced to do their work and to slow down the Hong Kong financial space with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China's party leader fears that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Paper, in which the Chinese Presidency was represented over Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an informal referendum on the election procedure in the Special Administration region, where hundreds of thousands were marched into the city's business district and organized a seat there.
Lis inquiry is organised by the Government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-President of the Legal Committee of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong Office and Macaus of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be interviewed during the day.
Student activists announced to gather in Hong Kong the following afternoon before the lead team office.
Until the end of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong, the UK saw no democratic elements.
Putin requires Kiev to take the "State Talks" with the Ostukrain
Russian President Vladimir Putin requested Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government set up a fight against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately take up negotiations on the "city" of the eastern region.
His speech, Dimitri Peskov, later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the territory of Austria, under the control of the separatists, would be part of Russia, but that his status would have to be redefined against Ukraine in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call on the Government to negotiate with the pro-Russian opposition, however, corresponds to the strategy that has been pursued since the beginning of the enlargements five months ago: Help for the separatists when entering territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to make the newly declared Novorossia region actually independent of an alliance with Russia.
In an interview with the state television channel Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for the return of the territories held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donezk and Luhansk, which were adopted in March and April, following Moscow annotated the Ukrainian peninsula Crime on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the unique area as "Novorossija" or "New Zealand", a term that reminds of the revolutionary splendor of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, during the campaign of Ukrainian politicians for elections on 26 October and while government groups attacked civil communities in the areas held by separatists, hope to be "caught in their illusions", reported Itar-Tass.
"We need to engage in extensive discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state of South Turkey, in order to ensure the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to statelessness in the context of greater autonomy should be seen, which has been discussed by the Kiev leadership for months, in order to spread fears in Russian-speaking areas, that their cultural and linguistic rights are threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can share the necessary autonomy in the eastern regions, Peskov said.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kremlin speaker on the correction of Putin's "failure interpretation" points to Russia's leadership claim in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east in contrast with the direct annex of the crime, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have been far more difficult to identify the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians, and questions from the time before the conflict resulted in a vast majority of the remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy spoken by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments of Ukraine the power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, and thus give Kreml de facto control over a region that binds the Russian state region to the crime.
The five months ago anactivated seminal in the Black Sea is the home port for most of the Russian sea as well as an important trading port and historical coastal region.
In addition, the regions between the Rostow region in Russia and the Crime are rich in mines, factories and pipelines, making important components for the Russian military.
In his speech on 7 June, Ukrainian President Pedro Poroshenko suggested that the Ukrainian legislation - after Neuwahlen - should be considered for the constitution, with which the regions concerned should be subject to greater control over their finances and the status of their languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast with those of the Kreml and the separatist rebellion, which is called for the arrest and imprisonment of Moscow.
Putin's last appeal to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders at the height of their eyes followed a further proclamation of the rebellion in the past week, after Russian troops and panzers over the former peaceful region along the Astows' Sea were introduced into the Ostukrain.
The separatists supported by Russia took action in the hands of the Ukrainian security officers, according to the first step of a campaign to take the strategic coastal region to Crime, the control of Novosowski.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have been launched to establish Mariupol, a steel industry with 500,000 inhabitants, located between Novosowski and the narrow access to the semi-crime.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and took urgent steps to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, an former Soviet republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We are just ahead of a point where there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign panzers are now located in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide to take concrete action which required further sanctions against Russia to take effect in the event of an undisclosed scale of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Lulowsk, after two Russian Panzer columns and 1,000 troops had been admitted to the Donzkregion last week to support the displaced separatists, said Colonel Andrij Lysenko, speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council on Saturday in Kiev.
The first 63 Ukrainian soldiers involved in the Russian invasion in Lulow were replaced on Sunday against 10 Russian randomists who were arrested a week ago in Ukrainian territory, Lysenko shared with the Sunday.
Photo channel for Australian promises and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no joke about his care for hacker, probably the birth pictures of his loved Gabi Grecko and a who is the one who stole the A-promiss from Hollywood.
The film city is excited after a series of detailed photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence in a hacking channel about promises on the Internet.
The hacker responsible may have more than 60 naked photos of Lawrence, Star from "the tribes of Panem" and Superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Leah Michelle as well as the actor Kirsten Dunst.
According to Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Greek from Melbourne, private photos were also reported due to a public iCloud-Lukke.
The list contains 101 promises.
The oldest one who had spent the last month with Grecko said to confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private letters and images should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and given to others.
Greckko, in New York time, reports from a news site said that the hack was "good" and that the victims felt "lost".
The hacker may have 30 images of Palmer with her ex-Freund Scott Speedman, including two recordings in which she is situated without a pool.
The Palmers film works include "Love is invisible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actor Browning from Sugar Punch were not available for comments on the hacked images yesterday.
A representative of Lawrence' said against TMZ: "It's a terrible breach of privacy."
Player Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "The hacked images from a phone are nothing but the sale of Hehlerware."
Pure justice should not tolerate the spread of stolen images.
Radlers, Joggers and wanderers were on the 8th floor of the Grand Feldberg and thus supported the "Help for Krebble Children" Association.
The tour, which was a tour, was an easy training for others.
In one, however, all were certain: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski may have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the chief of the Upper Brauhause was driven by the wheel to the Feldberg yesterday.
For good reason.
The small muscle catheter can easily be removed, especially when he has personally brought a valuable knowledge to him on 8th row on the Great Feldberg for the "Help for Cancer Children" (Frankfurt).
That's a great story.
"I know now that I can do it - great!"
Little swimming pools on the street in the apple basket?
No, if I had kept it, it would have been...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Upper City Parliament, many of the 718 participants gathered in the morning to mountains and came close to the creation, but fortunately on the platform.
On the other hand, it was easier to overcome the long route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The Green Politicians who took part in the Creestag - Red Dress, Red Bike - did something else on the ground floor at the start ("Every amount of profession, there is the goal!"), then proved to be half-profie in the mountain and went for 45 minutes without an end.
He has also conducted the street in a Rutsch, as well as Nina Kuhn, a press speaker in the city of Oberursel, who had taken his way with Frank Greeneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sports challenge: "This is about Charity, because we are pleased with it - we would have done an exercise today without it," says Kuhn.
On the way they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) was taken down to Oberursel in the morning to climb back to the same height.
The Frankfurt Florian Zierz had moved around 9 o'clock in the sattel in the morning to "make the Feldberg twice to roll home with fun.
It was fun, too, "Fritten-Toni".
For the head of the Overseasal Kultkiossk, bicycles over the Feldberg are simply there.
He's been playing with his 6.5-kilo racer for 40 minutes.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I like it," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained mainzer says he's a "ambiguous racer".
This must be him too, because he was on the "Fixie-Rad" route, which is also race wheels, but without turning...
Not only do the 20 wanderers who climb over the white wall and the foothills to the summit, but also a jogger who lifts an auto lift with weights on a cord.
Professor Volker Lischke, who was equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad with his team, said, "I know" from Frankfurt, who is trained for a special lock track, just to keep the lock on itself." So the man is definitely his own locker dog.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as never before - were sent to groups on the street in the morning.
The walker first at 9.30 a.m.
The first drivers and drivers followed it at 10 o'clock.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers released.
Bent Hansen, president of the "Radeln on the Great Feldberg", gave the startup command and wanted the participants a beautiful trip.
For the next year, he hoped that it would be possible to block the route to the Feldberg beyond the safety of the participants.
