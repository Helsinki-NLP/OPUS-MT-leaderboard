UN Chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict that lasts for almost five years and many more weapons would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The Head of the United Nations has again called on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unify and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said Wednesday during a conference that he intends to meet this month with foreign ministers from five permanent countries present in the US, Russia, China, England and France at the side of the Ministerial Meeting of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that the divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and the regional powers "have made this situation unsolved".
Ban asked the five remaining members to prove their solidarity and unity when they were able to conclude an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 numbers from surveys showing Donald Trump has real chances
Some have tried to label him as a 'flip-flop' politician.
Others called him a joke.
And the others are waiting for the implosion.
But regardless of the way some Republicans try to give Donald Trump out of the polls, he did not work (even).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys have shown that Donald Trump is leading a percentage of two figures and some voices are starting to question seriously what this means for the chances of the real estate molluscs.
Of course, it's still too late.
None of this says that Trump will win the race for the nomination of the Republicans.
Pundits shows that, during the same period in 2011, Rick Perry's advance made Herman Cain's place in the polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination course.
And the reasons why it would have been difficult to fight in general elections are numerous.
But external groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservation group Club for Growth admit Trump's power and start supporting him with money.
We continue to present a number of recent surveys that suggest that the real estate mollusc is not just a transitional thing:
The figures indicating the support to Trump have returned to 180 degrees.
Even before Donald Trump announced his application, in mid-June, a poll conducted by the University of Monmouth showed that only two of the 10 republics had a positive view of the real estate.
By mid-July, the percentage had dropped by 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Currently, six of the 10 Republicans have a favorable opinion about Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
These numbers are kept.
A survey carried out last week by Quinnipic in Iowa concluded that 60% of the Republicans in the region have a favorable opinion on Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the nomination course.
In a survey carried out last week by CNN/ORC, 67% of Republicans stated that they would be "intuismate" or "much" if Trump won the nomination course.
Only two of the 10 said they'd be "opposed" if Trump won the nomination course.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say it would be "intuismate" to 40% that says the same thing about Trump).
The closest thing about enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of the Republican voters claim that they would be "unmovable" or "absolute" if the favorite Jeb Bush won the nomination course.
The majority of Republicans do not consider Trump's temper to be a problem.
Although Donald Trump was strongly criticised for the insults and his bombing style, 52% of Republican voters at national level consider that the real estate mollusc has the right temperature to be president, according to ABC News/Washington Post's monthly poll.
We see the same figures in Iowa, where 52% of the Republicans believe that Trump has the right personality to be the leader, according to the order made last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% are of the opinion that it does not have the personality necessary to act effectively and nearly six of the 10 independent people claim that its temperature has nothing to do with the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are used to the idea.
When I take intellectuals into my mind, Republican voters consider Trump to be authentic.
According to a survey carried out last week by CNN/ORC, at the question of who has the most chance of winning the GOP nomination course, four of the 10 said that Trump.
The situation changed before the end of July, when four of the 10 would be equal to Jeb Bush.
Complete information: in the past, GOP voters did not read the future very well.
During the same period of the last elections, four of the 10 republics selected Rick Perry in the nomination course, just 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that the majority of GOP voters consider Trump’s campaign to be plausible.
Even if the Republicans have responded to another candidate, the trumpet is still in front of everyone.
Some voices say that the split situation will probably contribute to the victory of Trump, while support against Trump will be shared with more than twelve candidates.
However, a survey conducted at the beginning of September of the University of Monmouth shows that, in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from majority support.
Trump is 13 points away from Carly Fiorina, 14 points from Marco Rubio, 15 points from Walker, 19 points from Jeb Bush and, lastly, 33 points from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's almost equal to Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to win?
Ben Carson would beat the man with 19 points in an hypothetical confrontation from one to the other.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they made a decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll conducted Tuesday shows that over half of the voters supporting Trump say they do not change their vote option.
Of course, it can happen much in this sense and no one can say that they will never argue.
46% claim that it lets the port open the possibility of changing the option.
However, Trump's most important opponent is currently the Ben Carson neurosurgery, but it is twice as likely as voters who claim to vote with Trump.
Six of the 10 republics say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump has called immigrants in Mexico "violators" in the opening speech of his campaign, two months later, immigration was the main subject of the 2016 campaign.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombing style will lead to a disparity between the important Spanish voters and the Republican Party and will destroy the rebending efforts.
However, according to the ABC/Post poll carried out months, six of the 10 republics claim to agree with Trump on immigration.
So it seems that as long as the problem of immigration remains in the light of reflections, the same will be true of Doland Trump.
Frustration in the face of authorities reaches new peaks.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by nearly half of the Republican voters, largely due to their foreign status.
According to ABC/Post, six of the 10 republics claim that they prefer a political outsider to someone with experience in government.
People are also angry with the Washington authorities.
A survey conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three of the four Republics of Iowa are frustrated by the performance of the Republicans of the Congo, 54% declaring themselves "unmovable" and 21% "nervous".
Jeremy Corbyn takes the lead at First Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been waiting for a long time.
The new leader of the Laburist Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will later take the lead at First Minister's Questions, meeting for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions that he is entitled to shortly after lunch; his performance will probably be analysed near the mass media and the labor parliamentarians.
During the weekly appearances, he asked for “a little less theatre and more facts”.
He also stated that he could give up a number of participants and give them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test as a leader, after he called a "fathom cabinet" and after his speech on Tuesday at the TUC Annual Congress.
In the meantime, the leader of the Laburist Party's decision to maintain silence in the construction of national immunization during a job held on Tuesday afternoon at the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England drew criticism from conservative parliamentarians and held the first page of the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national flag drew attention
A spokesman for Mr. Corbyn said that it "kept silence in a respectful manner" and recognized "the heroism of the British Air Force in the Battle of England."
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's ghost cabin, Owen Smith, said for the two's Newsnight show sent by BBC that it would be recommended to the lab leader to sing the "independant" national immunization of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
About twelve ministers from the ghost cabin refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's front team, arguing by different opinions related to the economy, defence and external, while at least one half of the parliamentarian party supported him as leader.
BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant states that the political differences "committed" in the Laburist Party after Mr Corbyn's appointment in his position towards the European Union and limited benefits.
Mr Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Laburist Party would make changes by removing the whole idea of limitation.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, the Ministry of Labour and Pensions, said that the party "is very clear" in the exclusive opposition to government plans to reduce the level of "cap" from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth lab leader facing David Cameron at the court in the last decade, since he took the lead of the Conservative Party.
The Laburist leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says that he has ideas "in external sources" for questions to be addressed to Mr Cameron and that he has received over 30,000 suggestions.
Parliamentary Islington North stated that PMQs involves a level of confrontation too high and that it will depend on responses and attacks, with a commitment to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, Finance Minister, will take her place at PMQs when he can't participate - for example when Mr. Cameron moves abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to take the floor on occasion, saying that he approached the President of the Chamber of Members, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took the lead, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to give up the political style "Punch and Judy" associated with PMQs but admitted a few years later that he did not succeed.
Since the first transmission, in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of a leader's reasoning, how it leads the House of Members and its position among parliamentarians, although the criticism claims that it has become a character and that it needs a profound reform.
‘Carru in Joburg’: Young people without further benefit from photography courses
It's hard to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood found a way to learn a lesson and to earn their lives.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches young people to make photographs of the areas in which they live and earn money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
Chief JD Sports says larger wages could make the extension
President JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that an increase in the minimum wage in the British Sea could mean "a greater purchasing power in consumer potential pockets."
However, it is unlikely that the purchasing power concerned would exceed the higher costs for the labour force in the company, he said.
Costs could have an impact on JD Sports's expansion plans, he added, which could mean less new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis should be commended and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a colateral victim in the "furtuna" created around his friend, Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior deserves much praise and not criticism, in the opinion of President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the two talented so-called "Special Ks", was unhappyly disappointed in the light of the reflections by the scandalous background that Kyrgyos had faced by Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
In a short-distance contest in Cincinnati, the court had to intervene twice in order to disband Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison said, "Wawrinka should have put him on the ground on Kyrgyos, and I should have put him on the ground on this kid."
Although he was last seen making a prophylaxis after he had muscle cramps and rattling a possible US Open tournament, angered by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is now in Glasgow, where he fights Sam Groth for two to one place, after Bernard Tomic at the Cupe Davis seminar against England.
"One thing I feel strong is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little disappointed in the conflict," Healy said.
The truth is, he broke a rocket when he lost because he was accused of cracks in the US, but he's not the first player to break a rocket in frustration against himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he wouldn't be proud of it.
But to be serious, it's got very good in situations that's pretty provocative in the US with Harrison and so far and I think it deserves a lot of trust.
He's got an amazing team, he's got a wonderful family together, and I think he's been treated wrong.
He's a 19-year-old very mature, working hard and he's joined the team, had no conflict with other players, he's very respected in dress, he's trained in hard work, he's in an excellent way, he's a very balanced and mature young man, and he thinks he deserves to be judged solely on the basis of his qualities and his shortcomings.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account for the important resale game, which begins tomorrow, and described the "common decision" as the most appropriate for everyone, but supported the return of the original player from Canberra in the long term in the team.
"First of all, we want the team to concentrate entirely on the remix game and not to think any more of the controversy around [Kyrgyos]," Healy said.
And I think Nick ran very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray said, he matured under the public's wishes and made some terrible and worthy mistakes to be criticized, but we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions and believe he needs a time when he is not in the centre of attention to be able to reflect, good work for both the team and for him.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage towards Bernie Sanders has decreased to half in national polls
State Secretary Hillary Clinton continues to have a two-digit advantage in the democratic course for the national candidate, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins ground.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of the democratic voters (58% fall), while Sanders is on the second floor, with 27% (17% down).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will apply to the presidency, is supported by 15% of the democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the first elections, most Democrats say it is too early to say that they have decided on the candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are firmer in their choice than other candidates' supporters.
In front of the probe made by the CBS news last month, Clinton lost land in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percent.
Clinton maintains the advantage between women and moderations, but the advantage has been reduced.
Support among men has decreased significantly and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton's advantage among Democrats under 50 years of age has been evacated, now at the same time as Sanders.
Despite this, Clinton is still benefiting from senior voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders, with a percentage of two figures, among liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point advantage in this group.
About half of the Democrats at the national level claim to support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were chosen to apply in the name of the party.
One sphere would support it either reserved and another 15% would only support it because it represents the party.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
It may be surprising, the likelihood that Clinton's current supporters will be enthusiastic about their choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed with those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a sphere would support it with enthusiasm.
While 48% of democratic voters claim to support Clinton with enthusiasm, the number of Republican voters who say the same thing about the first class is lower, Donald Trump (35%).
When Clinton's supporters are addressed with an open question about the reason why they would like to win the course, the majority answer is that it has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this function (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these aspects and eligibility is also mentioned.
In view of the fact that the Vice-Presidents are taking into account a possible candidate for the presidency, 57% of the democratic voters would like to see him in the course - although a third believes he should not.
On the question of the second option for the representative of the party, Democrats call Biden the majority.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half said that Biden would have a second option, much before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to apply for the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Sanders grows from 20 points with Biden in the course to 30 points if he does not.
55% of the Democrats considered Clinton's candidate with the greatest chance of winning the general elections; but the figures fell from 78% last month.
Biden is located at a distance of two but the percentage according to which it is the most eligible to grow.
However, when they are asked what is the most important thing for a selected candidate, democratic voters prefer the problems instead of eligibility.
As last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate shall be considered by these voters as unacceptable as representative of the party in the presidential course.
Democrats or potential candidates are well developed with regard to some key features in front of their party's primary voters.
Most voters consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be complete and trustworthy and have strong leadership qualities.
Biden is seen the best of all three about integrity, while Clinton's strong point is leadership.
30% of the Democrats do not believe that H. Clinton is complete and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say this about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not have a view of him in this sense.
Democratic voters are also generally considered to have the same ideology as the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden.
With regard to all these aspects, about a sphere of democratic voters do not have an opinion on Sanders.
As questions persist regarding the use of a personal e-mail address and a server by Hillary Clinton when he was Secretary of State, most Democrats are grateful for their explanation of the subject and say that they have not affected the general opinion of the candidate.
But things are different with the American public.
Half of the Americans are now ungrateful for her explanation, while only about a third are grateful.
The public opinion was shared in March on this subject, shortly after the issue was settled.
Most Americans claim that their e-mail dispute did not affect their general view of Clinton, although 36% said that they had changed their opinion in a negative way.
In the main Republicans, more than six out of 10 said that they had changed their view of Clinton in a negative way.
Although democratic voters consider Clinton to be an integral and reliable one, this aspect continues to raise problems among voters at the general level: only 32% is an integral and trustworthy view, with 8% less than last month and with 15% less than in the past.
62% of voters do not consider it comprehensive and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of national voters do not consider it to be an integrated and trustworthy Trump.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Among the six evaluated candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush are first in terms of integrity.
The number of those who consider the integrated Sanders is greater than those who are not of the same opinion, as in Carson's case, many have no idea of him.
The error margin for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the kid's fraternity accused of killing the student in 1 year at the Baruch College
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during a holiday in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi brothers of the Baruch College in New York attacked Chun "Michael" Deng in September 2013 with brutal attacks on him during a ritual of initiation and tried to take him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say that the victim was tied to his eyes, placed behind him a 14 kg bag full of sand and was repeatedly burned while trying to get to a tight, frozen ground.
Mr. Deng accused his head pain after losing his knowledge.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi brothers did not call the emergency number after she left and claimed she would have been waiting an hour before she went to the hospital, says the police.
But they found the time needed to change Deng's clothes, look for its symptoms on Google and contact Andy Meng, the president of the brotherhood at the national level, to ask for advice, said police chief Chris Wagner, at a press conference.
"At this point, members have begun to hide their personal belongings and put the good news of the brotherhood before Michael Deng's well-being," Wagner said.
He couldn't be resurrected and died the second day in the morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated traumas to his head, knees and shoulders.
" Too many families have been destroyed by the fraternity rituals since 1970, at least one student lost his life every year because of the rituals," said Douglas Fierberg, Deng's family lawyer, in a statement.
The brothers and their members must be accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The jury of the Monroe District has recommended that the first five members be charged with murder at the third grade.
The other thirty and two members of the brotherhood, including Mr Meng, will also be put under charge of further and complex crime.
"We want to bring to the response not only the persons involved but, if there is an organisation that has authorized the fraternity, official or non-official, we will also bring it to the response," Wagner said on Tuesday at a press conference.
Baruch's faculty has banned the fraternity and the national fraternity and has withdrawn the affidavit with local representation.
Here's what happens when the Federal Reserve grows the profit rate
The profit rate will increase and the Bull market (the increase rate) will decrease, the profitability of the bonds will increase and the economy will enter the recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it will be and how long it will last.
In the economy, history offers few indications of timing..
After the first growth of the benefit rate, the recession occurred in only 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve to increase the rates of profits is often, although not always a determinant of the way in which the economy and financial assets respond.
Therefore, the U.S. Central Bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on the time when they start to increase profit and on the time-trafficking needed for normalization.
Actually, there are multiple variables in the game.
However, in the end, market players could find that all the aggression related to the growth of the profit rate has been excessive.
"The first increase in Fed's profit rate after the global financial crisis will be inevitably interpreted by some voices as a sign of the era's "Effect Banks", said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a customer address note.
On the contrary, we do not expect that the gradual return of the US profit rates to normal levels, but still little is the seismic shock that seems to all to be feared.
But it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
We continue to present the way in which several sectors of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
In view of the situation in which the market has been faced in recent months, predicting the growth of the profit rate can serve as a factor for a time.
But at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for capital profitability to slow down for 12-24 months after the first growth, which may again reflect the deficit of monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after Fed's growth.
More precisely, in the last 35 years, the market has grown rough - with about 14 per cent - moving towards growth rate, quite invariable in the 250-day period (meaning 2.6%) after which it returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by the New Asset Management's chief strategy.
Deutsche said that the impact on actions tends to become more pronounced later in the growth cycle of prosperity and benefits are beginning to fall.
Recycling is a reality of economic life, but growth in prosperity is often contributing to it.
In the face of the situation, Fed faces certain conditions that did not exist before and could speed up a recession.
More specifically, the gross domestic product will approach its historical minimum point for an increase in Fed's profit rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 gains rates since 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.
Even if the value in the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6%, at least the situation is expected to persist, the third quarter is only 1.5%, according to Atlanta Fed.
The increase in profit rate in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question "if this time is different," Deutsche said.
The players on the market have been preparing for an annual increase decision by Fed, all the eyes are drawn to this week's meeting of the Open Market Commission, which ends in June.
Although a number of strategies and economists believe that FOMC could approve an increase in profit rate at this meeting, transactions in the term indicate a probability of only 25%.
"In our study launched after 1950, all the growth cycles of the profit rate have so far been found in a super-cycle of growth of profit, the GDP is eclipsing the thresholds before the recession very quickly after recovery," the report said.
On the contrary, this was a sudden recovery after the most severe recession in the period under review.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by Fed from the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continued.
The fixed future was also volleyball since the market anticipates an increase in profit rates and the type is similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster in the case of obligations than in the case of actions when Fed changes policy.
In the case of obligations, it appears that the benefits change the immediate direction resulting from the first growth/down of the cycle.
At the end of the growth cycle of the profit rate, the profitability of the obligations falls immediately," Deutsche said.
The Charles Schwab strategies are of the opinion that these growth of the profit rate will determine the approach of profitability between short-term and long-term obligations, applying curves.
High-response obligations are better developed in such an environment, although "we are still careful about strengthening profitability", said Kathy Jones, a permanent analyst in the Schwab framework.
Interestingly, Jones is of the opinion that markets have already adapted to Fed's political expectations.
"In addition to the power of the dollar and the reduction of estimated inflation, there are some signs that the market has adapted to a more stable monetary policy," Jones wrote.
Short-term profit rates have increased, profitability curve is fairer, the spread of the credit average rate has increased and the volume has increased - all market characteristics when Fed stops politics.
In large lines, companies that engage in major U.S. activities will have won as a result of the growth of the profit rate and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with large debt will suffer because the increase in the dollar will lead to their products in the global market and their debt will be more expensive.
"History shows that "quality stock" tends to be more profitable in the last three months of an initial growth of the profit rate," said analyst Goldman Sachs in a report to customers.
Firms with strong budgets exceeded those with a weak balance after each of the gains rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital savings and low-voltility stocks have also exceeded similar companies with a lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points), respectively 3 (percentage points).
The debt will become an important problem.
Companies with a large percentage of floating debt have the greatest loss, says Goldman.
Consumers will also gain from the growth of the dollar.
Economicists may also have won, although experts do not agree on how soon this will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy after Classic FM, parliamentarian Andrew Bingham says.
Conservative Parliamentary Andrew Bingham criticised the radio post for "prosperity"
It says it's from what it's like to the commercial opponent.
He also took to the eyes of BBC Music Awards, claiming that they had beat the British prizes.
Collegiate Damien Collins attacked The Voice, claiming that this show is not original.
BBC Radio 3 "transforms into" Classic FM, said an important parliamentarian, stressing the fact that he does something that commercial jobs do not.
Conservative Parliamentary Andrew Bingham also sent BBC leaders that the public radio post "prosperity" is increasingly similar to the commercial opponent.
"I imagine Radio 3 "prosperity" - although I don't like to use the word - but I think it's turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also took into his eyes BBC Music Awards, launched last year in December.
BBC Music Awards, launched last year, seems to be Brits under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are the two examples that come to my mind that I do not only copy what already exists on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director-General of the BBC rejected the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is very much in front of its commercial opponent in relation to live music and public education.
I'm not gonna find out anything about the classic music I'm learning from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
"In addition, I think it is also important for Radio 3 to discover new music and the allocation of new parts," he said.
In the first part of this year, BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, stated that more efforts must be made to attract audience from the previous period because the British have less knowledge about classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only element under the BBC signal criticised during the meeting of the Committee on Culture, Mass Media and Sport because it would follow its commercial rivals.
Conservative Parliamentary Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC talent show purchased by Dutch producer Talpa Media for about 22 million pounds of sterline.
Do you understand why there is often discussions about the issue because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the show carried out by BBC1 - having Paloma Faith and Boy George in jury - be carried out "in a specific way BBC."
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "find a gold bowl in its own garage" next time he started a show of entertainment.
However, he refused to ban future adoption of new seasons from The Voice or spend money on licenses on other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales registered the smallest growth in August and the convicted could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
In the last month, the most recent growth from 2000 to now has been registered.
Online sales have advanced over three years, thanks to the use of the mobile phone to make purchases.
Specialists are of the opinion that the Black Friday of November could determine the reticence of costs.
For more than a decade, online purchases have exploded and transformed commercial streets from the British Sea into ghost cities.
Specialists say, however, there are signs that online sales decrease, the latest figures indicate an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
All the money spent in August has shown the smallest growth since 2000 to date, with only 5% increase in the last year.
Specialists say there are signs that online sales decrease, the latest figures indicate an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
"If we analyze the level of growth in previous years and return to 2000, there has always been a rationalised trend in time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, for Guardian.
He explained that online sales were advanced three years ago when buyers started using the mobile phone to make purchases.
Thus, it increased the number of people who could make online purchases and could do it in different circumstances, such as on the couch.
But now that it's slowing down, you could notice a decline (growth).
The name Black Friday, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
In the opinion of experts, buyers would be able to make purchases before the event takes place in the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers got stuck in front of computers to put their hands on the offer, leading to the spread of more retail sites.
Specialists are of the opinion that Black Friday, when buyers fought chilipiers, could determine the buyer's reticence.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium determined that at least 1 £ of each 5 £ is spent online.
In certain cases, such as television and washing machines, more than one third of the purchases are currently carried out through online stores.
At the same time, more than one area of people prefers to buy clothes and shoes online than to appeal to fashion stores in commercial areas.
Following the Sanctions of the Bin Laden family, Muslims bury the victims killed after the Macaral massacre in Mecca
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were transported to Muslim camps, the first funeral in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has partially defeated the giant in the construction of Saudi Binladin Group for bombing.
The Ministry of Health stated that 394 people were injured in total after the macara seizure
In the street tour ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a macaral trapped in the Mosche Sea of Mecca.
In white, those who cried their deaths joined in the street to express their condolences until the first death reached the end of the final journey, to the Al-Moaisse cemetery.
The mournful memory is preserved from the holy place, where just a few days ago a building map was dug through the mosque's ceiling, marrying believers.
The bodies were released for funerals after the Saudi kings Sanctuary Sanctuary of the Bin Laden family construction group for disaster, which also fought with 394 injuries.
In the street ceremony, hundreds of Muslims were gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a macaral in the Mosche Sea of Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great Manchester, found in his first childhood when the macara broke.
Mr. Akram is in the Moschee Sea with his parents before the beginning of the annual pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, thousands of people arriving in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left the arms of the macaral raised when the macara was not in operation.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, stated that the Binladin Group is partially wine-producing.
The information agency’s English service did not present the details, but stated that the company’s leaders had received a ban on leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman swore to reveal what caused the macaroni in the Mari Moschei court, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the irony that took place later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made statements about the macaroni repugnance and the Group's representatives have not been able to contact the statements.
The Royal Decree condemned the group because it did not use updated security measures and did not coordinate its activities with the meteorological authorities.
Ten of the Marea Moschee macaralas in Mecca, as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has a close relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and is undergoing major construction projects.
The last leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a "renegated" son who was expelled from the family in the '90s.
The siege has occurred under strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the government to participate in the pilgrimage, essential journeys at least once in the lives of every Muslim natural apt.
The authorities claim that 158 people remain in the hospital.
The authorities have decided that the victims' brothers committed to receive a million Saudi Rialis (174,000 literline liters) and the same amount will be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other injuries will receive half of this amount.
Benefits and disadvantages of credit conversion in Swiss francs
On the bank market, there have already been two offers of conversion into loans in French, the main advantages being the exclusion of the currency risk and the reduction of the rates.
Disadvantages can occur over a few years, when a double variable can lead to a higher rate.
The Bank of Transylvania has just completed the process of credit conversion in France granted by Volksbank, and Bankpost has announced the conversion offer for its customers.
According to the data collected by financial portal analysts FinZoom, Bankpost offers three years' fixed double bids to her, 1.5%, the smallest on the market.
On the other hand, the Transylvania Bank's offer of conversion was accepted by 83% of French credit customers due to two subsequent reductions: the balance was reduced by the value of the customer risk and administration commissions, and an additional 22.5% reduction was applied to the settlement in it.
Both offer reduces customer rates, the girl who paid equivalent monthly in hers before the conversion.
Thus, Bank Transylvania reduces the rate by 42.5% and Bankpost by 33% in the first three years and theoretically by 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of credit coverage in CHF is to eliminate the currency risk, the consumer being protected by future growth of the franc, and the recovery of the credit will be made in the currency in which the wage is exhausted.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that property reassessment is no longer required, additional guarantees and other evidence of income.
In practice, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of the credit and there will be no additional costs such as in the case of a lender.
Both banks also offer a reduction at the monthly rate, the girl they paid customers before the conversion, equivalent to her.
Recruitment
The problem is that the rate in the first year is more than doubled, and the customer recovers very little from the main.
Bankpost offer with a very small double in the first three years seems to benefit customers.
You didn't know how this two-year-old thing would evolve.
The margin offered to customers may be greater than 3.25%, so overall, and cost reduction is smaller.
A possible risk for all the credit in lei with double variable, is that ROBOR's index increases significantly in the following years (more than Libor - CHF's index).
For example, ROBOR in three months is now 1.44%, which reached 6% in 2013, over 15% in 2009, and in some days in 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, it is possible to raise other costs, not mentioned in the original offer.
Decision on the rate of benefit for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The world focuses its attention on the scheduled meeting over two days, Wednesdays and Thursday, when the U.S. Federal Reserve will make a crucial decision whether to grow or not for the first time after about a decade.
In a poll conducted by Reuters with the participation of 80 economists, less than half who thought last week the decision would be taken, I believe now that the situation will be longer and that profit rates will be maintained in the current range of 0-0.25%.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought the rats to zero.
For the first time, we are faced with a situation in which a major central bank could give up at the zero rate and start a process of normalising the profit rates," said Angel Ubide, head analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has evolved relatively well, the return of three million dollars in balance and generated a low level of inflation.
However, the Federal Reserve must not ignore the global situation below.
He warned markets to prepare for growth, but there are signs that even they think such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced Tuesday, 20:00 CET.

Player Luke Shaw from Manchester United is on the bar for a few months due to double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture at the right foot in the game played by Manchester United in the League of Championships, ending with a break in front of the endhoven PSV.
After the event that brought tears to the player's eyes and which will hold him on the bar for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The incident occurred after an unexpected intervention by Héctor Moreno in 15 minutes after Shaw broke off the PSV defense at the age of 20.
She received medical care for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before she went to the hospital.
Van Gaal declared: "A double fracture on the legs and is in the hospital."
He's gonna be transferred tomorrow or maybe he's gonna be working in Manchester.
It's horrible - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, faced with difficulties, then playing fantastic and now something like that happens.
He wore a mask of oxygen in his clothes.
She's crying.
I'm not a doctor, but the double fracture is six months and will not play in groups.
I hope he can play again this season.
It seems that Moreno was lucky and escaped from the red cardboard and the concession of a punishment strike.
Arbitral Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish Mexicans.
Van Gaal suggested the Italian officer was wrong.
You can judge by yourself when I say it's wrong and red cardboard.
It was a very harsh intervention with two legs.
A message on Shaw’s Twitter account says: “Thank you all for the messages, I don’t speak to express how weak I feel, starting to recover, I’ll be stronger. ”
Similar news: Manchester United hit by Luke Shaw's accident in the Gulf of PSV
The foundation of the English team has an additional reason to recover to play the European Championship in France next year in June.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said, "It's a terrible accident."
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an accident.
Our players are never going to happen to an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for Mexico's national against the Dutch national led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Championship.
"It's very difficult because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear that it's a very serious accident, it's not good," Cocu said.
I didn't see the stage.
I couldn't see except the minge, which turned in a different direction, so it seemed that [Moreno] touched her but I couldn't see the intervention on Luke.
In a statement for SBS6, Moreno said: “I know how it is, I know how difficult it is to get through something like that.
I feel so stupid, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player, Andrés Guardado, also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth's clearly risking England's mission, but it's still high.
Victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the selected team from England for the tournament, I do not take into account a repetition of the 3-0 matches in the test games.
I wouldn't remove any variant of a victory in the move.
Perhaps Alastair Cook's team has less experience than three years ago but has good players in the battle line and collective morality is strong; they will not be marked by events in 2012 but will have a positive young attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as spinner and Adil Rashid, even if it is unknown at test level, is an option for attack.
Similar subjects: Adam Lyth left the English team for the test games and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his principal coach in Yorkshire, it's hard for me to analyze the decision not to select Adam Lyth in the team.
He played the seven games against two good attackers, under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are judged after results.
There were no signs of questions related to Joe Root, for example, until the ads were made because -- and I said this earlier -- players are their own voters.
I wish 15 years and maybe Lyth would have extended the round, but his destiny is in his hands.
I hope if he does more for Yorkshire, he'll have other opportunities.
The main trainer of the English team, Trevor Bayliss, helped his attitude right away when performance was not measured by his ability and did not surprise me; above all, he is a team man.
It's hard to answer the question as long as a batsman is noticed in the test games.
Lyth had seven rounds--as did Sam Robson before--when Nick Compton had new.
Only Compton was lucky home and moving.
The only thing you could have done was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tournament - when Lyth was in the best shape - but the time spent in the past is the area of the past.
The team comes to Alex Halles, a batsman I'm paying him very well.
He's a cricket player who has "the X factor" and I noticed him early at Yorkshire this season when he marked 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
It should be at least the same opportunity as those before it, but this will certainly depend on the composition of the UAE team.
It was launched the idea of Moeen opening the battle with Cook, which would bring extra spinner saving at the same time four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a shooter couldn't hunt there and this left player already proved he's given the shit.
Maybe Moeen didn't make success in his district, Worcestershire, but it was number 3 for this, so the difference isn't big.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 matches test as the first drop before opening in 2001.
He's been dead for three centuries, and he hasn't seen it since.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team at the back-up spinner post and, although I had a limited contact with him, struck me that he is a very impressive young man.
People could judge his age - with an average of 31 in battle and 35 in minge - and might think it's a point, but there's not a bunch of spinners and the elections chose for teenagers.
He'll learn a lot from this tournament.
England has brought some changes to the training team.
The name of Mahela Jayawardene, a batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a master shot.
He is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that he played in any situation and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white-ball league of the tournament and will bring both energy and non-smoker ambition.
I always thought she was born to be involved in the international cricket, whether as a player or as a coach, and just like Mahela, she has intuition.
Sometimes, new voices in the dress, even if they send messages that have been transmitted and previously, can bring some air to the team.
Colly Durham's coach Ben Stokes relaxes for the games one day, Root got a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with this.
Although not all agree, coaches and elections do not make the programme.
And you have to keep, players' jobs depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
The Brexit tab could have won if the economy remained calm until 2017
The day before, David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to keep Britain's EU in even worse, even without choosing General Jeremy "Yes or No?" Corbyn to lead the Laburist Party or TUC brings serious criticisms to Europe.
The parties also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained the past days that - rooted in a crisis similar to that in the EU - not all of them being provoked inside - some Member States are fed with the British agenda of concessions and amendments to treaties, which most do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, the TUC decided that neither they would want this if social protection had been lacking.
We could even call it Dave and George's self-sustainment agenda.
The Minister and Chancellor participate in bilateral summits or meetings of foreign capitals, take a stand in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won foreign reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants a Great Britain abroad under the EU cover - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that more ministers and officials from certain capitals have reached a point where they don't care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor extremely cautious, is an ally who has been driving for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation gets worse, as happened with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who have been too much.
In 2017 the President of France, François Holland, will be real or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland could soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain one on the left.
It is hard to believe that they will help the English that are present, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving Britain - a thing which they don't want because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers may even plan to make an intentional comment that does not help, in the SNP style, in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"Renegotiation was fixed" and "Great Britain did not get any renegotiation values".
The Europeans know on their skin how well they can be Fleet Street and how sceptic they are the barons of the oligaric press that watch the EU with scepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our entry from 1973 to 2:1 report.
I may recall the vag of Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunity, who became famous at the beginning of the 1990s when he was president of Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mixture of tax-free puddings, foreigners who made phone calls and non-dome pseudo who hold most of the important newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them about the same way, and he realized that when you're locked in a box next to a nervous gorilla, you have to give them bananas to distract them from the thought of eating you at lunch and at tea again.
In fact, Miliband was more blarite than Blair in opposition to Cameron's referendum, considering that Blair had given a concession to the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, composed of French and Dutch voters in 2005, who offered him an exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for that.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who got me behind the moon in Westminster - I told him not to waste his time with me - seems to be in danger of adopting from one Murdoch's 80s, a mistake then and now.
It may take a long time, but it must develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose position at the BBC left her Sunday holiday.
Corbyn's official position in front of Europe is what I would call the evolution of indulgently.
This states that we would like to remain in a reformed EU.
Most of those who do not agree with "english" conservatives might agree with this.
This was said by Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on radio and TV this week, when the researcher from him struggled not to acknowledge that John McDonnell's appointment by Corbyn as Minister "in the room" on financial issues was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the 70s when his father fought on TV to be disloyal to his colleagues, without going too far and losing his job in the office.
Hillary's fight was more attractive.
But the fight to remain "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not correspond to what McDonnell said and not to what the JC said to colleagues and parliamentarians during the private meeting last night.
Regardless of the image Corbyn wants to transmit - you keep it, it made me aware of me - the discipline of messages remains important in the age of television and especially in the age of social networks, a fire of paranoia and betrayal.
It is appropriate not to grant Cameron a ticket of favor in Europe, allowing them to take good care of workers in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
However, McDonnell's and Corbyin's core summit on the quality of EU member - in accordance with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just an esoteric debate among the left-wing dissidents for which the Narcissism of small differences is a central doctrine.
As in his NATO-Tom Watson Sofiism he is silent about the fact that the JC will not campaign for resignation - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin lose political capital - and there are suspicious voters - for concessions to the British Sea when everything could be useless?
SUA is already quite disappointed about the weak military performance of the English in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government that pays the costs, as I recalled at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Mondays.
Specialists criticize the decision of the Department of Public Health in England on electronic communications
According to researchers, the claims of a government agency that electronic communications are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people, some of which are related to tobacco industry.
Specialists from the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet's publication in criticising the evidence used by the Department of Public Health in England (PHE) in its report on electronic communications.
The PHE published the "reference" report last month and described it as a "complex analysis of the evidence."
Some researchers, however, questioned the robustness of the data and showed the finger to the links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the medical journal Lancet attacked the "extraordinary Fragil Base" on which PHE based its main conclusion.
Two other researchers written in BMJ put their claims and their foundation on "solid land or on a migrating land".
Martin McKee, professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They stated that it is expected that the PHE claims that "current estimates show that electronic bonds are 95% lower than smoking" are based on a detailed analysis of the evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting attended by 12 people led to the development of a multi-point decision-analysis model (MCDA) that would identify their views on the negative effects associated with various products containing nicotine; the results of this meeting were recently presented in a research work.
McKee and Capewell or said that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company entitled EuroSwiss Health, which the Executive Director said would have received in the past funding from the British American Tobacco side for the completion of an independent study.
This also validated the public health BAT accreditation in a report on sustainability, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared the funding received from an electronic telecommunications producer but not the funding available to be received from the company producing telecommunications and tobacco, Philip Morris International.
The arguments were not provided on the basis of which the panel members were selected, but it lists several "front" known in the production of electronic goods, some of which even declare industry funding.
Other participants at the meeting are not known for expertise in the control of the tunnel.
At the meeting, the Chief of the Tuton Control Section also participated in the PHE.
The group's research "mushamalizes convincingly" that they lack "solid evidence of the harmful effect most products have on the majority of the criteria", McKee and Capewell said.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell stated that the PHE claims that "there is no evidence that electronic communications are a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of the Health Department of the PHE, stated that he has responded in the past to the claims of BMJ.
He said: "Electronics are significantly less harmful than smoking"
One of the two people who have smoked all their lives loses their lives because of this vice.
All the evidence suggests that the risk of e-health threats is smaller, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information that is growing and that does not grow in evidence, given in particular the high level of public confusion regarding the relative risks compared to the tobacco.
Each year, about 80,000 people lose their lives because of a smoking-related disease and the annual costs of the national health system due to smoking reach 2 billion pounds.
Explanation of current evidence - and of course, although the use of electronic devices is not at risk, they present only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we fulfill our national duty.

However, a separate campaign also led to the showing of a large number of posts in bus stations and metros that need a second look.
"An important announcement, travel with DLR between 15 and 18 September?" says one of the ads, using the fonts and branding of the London metro, the DLR line turns into a tank.
In September of this year, a lot of armament dealers will be placed on DLR Customers are asked to contribute to the end of the armament chain.
The 300 posts are made by artists who have exposed the works at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called the Special Patrol Group contributed to the distribution in London using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6-lit Allen key package that says "encourages access to about a third of the advertising space from the bus stations on the planet."
The Kingdom of Transport in London is not impressed by this "vandalism" in the form of a flight.

According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and conference at the University of Essex, artists ask more questions and seek to make the political works accessible to the public outside the gallery.
Many artists turn to co-operation with activists in protest movements, realizing that they have to go to the real world to make their art affect society.

The film made by Amnesty had more than 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP advertising agency that worked for bonus, and the graphic designer and artist who doubled the voice also worked free.
VCCP's creative director, Matt Lever, was looking for the silence of the advertising for the arms race - with a naked space in the ExCel calendar - and thought, "Let's offer them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with a more realistic announcement but "inspired with strong animations and colors, it was more shocking".
"I have done a great job helping us to increase our interest in selling illegal torture equipment in the yard," says Tom Davies, named Amnesty.
Now, it would be necessary for the British authorities to take measures and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally marketed and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative form of art on the theme of the arms race comes from the inside of the ExCeL, where exhibits offer fantastic eufemistic products.

Eight golden rules to live in the room

Violinist David Grimal: There were no world tournaments in Bach's time.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, artists and not commercial representatives.
French violinist David Grimal is one of the marine artists of our time, known not only as a soloist but also as the founder of a less common project, of his right to "circumcised", as he himself says, Les Dissonances - a orchestra formed by international soloists and talented musicians, who interprets a symphonic repertoire without having a conductor, and this makes it the least curious in the classical musical landscape.
Les Dissunances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two shows: a representation, Sunday, in which soloist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and a month, when violinist Xavier Phillips first met, the works made by Enescu were unlipped.
Both shows, painted on the Athens scene, showed the audience another way to interpret classical music.
Les Dissunances appeared on the music scene in 2004 and was then the only classic music collection in which no director existed.
The address is the most important musician for musicians.
It's true, some musicians need education either to become soloists or to become an orchestra - talking about instrumentists, and not composers.
They're trained as "specialized workers."
They insist that they need a leader.
On the other hand, for the public, all music fetishing is directed towards the director.
And so, business, musical industry, you make marketing.
So we're not talking about music anymore.
So, when we look at this world, we have some qualified workers, what's stupid, and a public who can't listen, but must look, what's stupid," he thinks.
The violinist tells us that this change in the way music is done came after "the music deceptiors" of his career as a soloist.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise all over the world with different orchestras, to win a lot of money and bring money and the music industry.
After 10 years, when I was around 30 years old, I found this very depressive thing, because I no longer found creativity and human fraternity in this system.
So I haven't found any sense to continue on this road.
So I decided to believe the Dissensions.
This happened in 2004, and at that time no one did anything like this without a leader: "The musical world, extremely conservative, didn't want such projects."
"How do you imagine to make marketing with a collection of musicians in which there is no more ego?" asked the artist.
David Grimal acknowledged that Les Dissonaces is "a luxury", stating that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra does not depend on the success of this project to live.
In the 10 years that existed in the assembly, the absence of a director has not proved to be a piece of music: "Surprisely, as we sing a more complex repertoire, as it seems more simple, because all musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not just in the role," says Grimal, adding to the Sunday show "there were 74 directors on the scene".
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is a "very brave" just because it invited Les Dissonances: "A extraordinary festival, where are the largest orchestras in the world singing and 3 times a day, and in the midst of these orchestras you invited and this strange group."
In a temple of Orchestra tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there exists the place and interest for something different, which scatters barriers.
Speaking of Enescu's work, the violinist recognized that Roman music of the Roman celebrity was such that he did not need a special approach when he introduced Enescu's works to the repertoire or.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, and this happens when we speak of George Enescu and Roman music, "for there is a George Enescu who made French music".
Grimal militosis for changing the way classical music education is done, considering that "the mass of music, as it is organized today, has a taste of death" and that "the future of music is music inseparable".
We don't need to make the world tour five times a year if it doesn't serve anything.
There were no global tournaments in Bach's time.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, organized concerts, festivals, tournaments, albums, they're all awesome, extraordinary, as long as they're in the music service.
If not, we are in a system in which creativity is suffering, it is no longer free.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave examples of Romanian products before and after accession to the European Union: "In Romania, before entering the EU, you had good legumes and meat".
In order to enter the EU, health laws which are not good for legumes and meat had to be adopted.
Production and agriculture have reached the service of supermarkets, as is the case in France.
The same thing happens with music, it's the same logic.
The Dissonances make roses may not be too beautiful, but when the taims are true roses.
In an ideal world, this music should be brought to the center and institutions and industries that manage this system should understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be involved, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
"If I think - as I do Koreans, Chinese, Japanese - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, I reintroduce her education in school, re-entering television concerts and through this education we would no longer need to sell music underproducts," Grimal says.
There's certainly things in classical music education that are very communists, that's all, it's very military.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician with a soldier, or if we form a musician who will sing to an instrument, being, first of all, musicians.
We speak of a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) must be in some way if we want to form a musician, it's something else.
According to your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?" asked the French artist zambind.
Crime shows that, for artists, the reward of another kind of music comes directly from beyond this status of "military", the passage of what "they think are their limits": "Musicns discover at a certain time that they are not soldiers, and that is why after the concert they come out of zambitors".
David Grimal spoke about the project or music and his vision of music and the artist in the "Idea Festival", a discussion with the audience organized at the International Festival George Enescu by the Aspen Romania Institute.

Cinema City Searches "Mimiles Voci Mari"
Cinema City launchs the biggest challenge for children: double-doubling two characters from the "Críasa Zăpezii 3D" superproduction
You have a super-talent and spontaneous kid, who likes the movies?
Give him the chance to get visible.
In September, during the newest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, the Dorniks to reach the future of the ages and who are between 8 and 16 years old, Cinema City is looking for "Mimiles Voci Mari", offering them an extraordinary opportunity to double two characters in a famous animation film.
If in classic drawings the emphasis is placed on approaching the voice of the actor of the specific character of the animated person in the last period, the creation of the story will be taken into account and those who will continue to interpret the voices, and they are usually very well-known actors.
Cinema City Romania wants to discover new voices and that's why we're making an Indian campaign.
We want to find the right voice and encourage parents to enroll their children in our competition.
They'll be part of a special experience, because the characters are nice and the relics are fun.
"The kids will have fun and have a real chance of becoming part of an actor's team," said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, on September 11 - 30 September, Cinema City organises a pre-election that will select 10 children (five girls and five boys) who will have the opportunity to give a test in a study of registrations with professionals.
All that parents have to do is access a mini-vocimari platform.cinema-city.ro, where to write the child to the competition and prepare him for voice test.
Finally, you have to choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is going to read and then, the child will record by interpreting his own double version.
Four films about friendship, bass heroes, magic and hope can choose competitions for support of the trial: "Pene Galbene 3D", "Mune: the Guardian of the Moon 3D", "Blinky Bill: Koala who knows 3D" and "Maya 3D Albinity".
In the end, the most talented two children (a girl and a boy) will see their vision full and double as a person of the super-production "The Snow Queen - Críasa Zăpezii 3D", which will have the prize in Romania in November of this year.
FedEx cash flows are mixed, tax forecasts for 2016
FedEx has declared dismal results for the last quarter, the supplier giant, reducing profit estimates for the year as a result of low demand for transport services and increased costs for its territorial transport division.
The company also stated that it intends to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
In the same period last year, FedEx announced that he would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The company's shares decreased by approximately 2.5% in pre-market transaction, 45 minutes before the opening bell.
FedEx Corp stated that it is expected to win between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May of the next year, with less than 20 cents, according to a previous estimate.
The analysts presuppose $10.84, according to a FactSet probe.
The low estimate is despite an increase in prices of 4.9% on average, with entry into force on 4 January and larger ceilings for the land transport of large packages or heavy loads, which will apply in November.
The company stated that it is still expected to increase the profits in the previous year as a result of the reduction of costs, larger revenues and the development of online trade.
President and Director-General Fred Smith stated that "the company is facing a much weaker economic situation than it is recommended, especially with regard to global production and trade."
The employment plans for the holiday period were announced one day after the UPS competitor stated that it intends to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, approximately the same number of commitments that it made last year.
In the quarter ended on August 31, FedEx won $692 million, with 6% more than last year.
The action charges were $2.42, under the average estimate of $2.44 for action by 12 analysts who responded to the Zacks Investment Research probe.
The profit grew by 5%, up to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in Zacks' poll estimated $12.23 billion.
The FedEx company has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, which has led to the suspension of income recorded by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online purchases has sold the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, the income of the base dividend increased by 29%, but operating income was practically stable due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in income due to higher base rates, while the income recorded by the free division decreased due to growth costs.
In the pre-market transaction, approximately an hour before the opening sound, FedEx shares decreased by $3.85 or 2.5%, to $1150.15.
You die at a low-end of 11% at an annual level and 17% against the maximum record registered on 11 June.
On the occasion of the most expected meetings in recent years, policy makers in the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week around a month of 27-footed Honduran mahon to decide whether the time has come to increase a key profit rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Above them, at the end of the central bank seating room, a wall painting of the United States will be interrupted.
The map is intended to remind that Janet L. Yellen, President Fed, and his colleagues must put the nation's economic interests ahead of anything.
The Central Bank has received a double duty from Congress: to maximize the employment rate of the U.S. labour force and to maintain price stability.
But since the major economic crisis, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be the factor X in a decision too difficult to predict, which will be announced in March, and which will determine whether the US economy is ready to be decomposed by the unstimulant at a short time of almost zero in force by the end of 2008.
Even if most data indicate a strong growth economy, recent aggrievement on global financial markets could scare Fed officials already careful to increase volatility by increasing the reference rate in federal funds - even with only one percentage point.
"Of course, the labour and inflation market will be the first and the main aspects to follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co brokerage firm.
"I believe, however, that if this would seek an excuse not to increase the rate of prosperity, the uncertainty of growth on the world market is sufficient to give them arguments to wait," he said.
There is no consensus on the decision that will be taken by Fed, which in itself causes instability on the financial market.
About half of the recently questioned economists from Bloomberg have anticipated an increase in the profit rate this week.
But the financial markets are expected to both, a key indicator showing that the probability of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a fall on the bridge if Fed grew the profit rate, except for those who develop policies that would slow the strike by promising that it would last a long time until the next growth.
Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial media ran 228.89 points, or 1.4%, up to 16.599.85.
The advance was announced by the expectations that Fed's decision-making factors will maintain the stable profit rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising for Fed to increase the rate of prosperity at this time," Lonski said.
If Fed's decision-makers would do this, "they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic on financial markets".
Other experts said that an increase in the profit rate would calm financial markets because it would leave the uncertainty associated with the moment Fed will act.
Only a month ago, Fed seemed to be able to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards slow recovery of the monetary conditions that would confirm the US recovery force.
Yellen stated early in the morning that it is expected to increase this year's prosperity rate in spite of the high liberal targets such as the need for more economic progress.
Although the creation of jobs ended in August, the growth of the labour market was strong this year.
The unemployment rate dropped by 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and nearly the level considered by Fed as a total employment force.
Payrolls have shown signs of growth.
And while inflation continued to not reach the annual target of the central bank, Fed's decision factors stated that a key reason was the temporary effect of the oil prices found in raw waste.
The economy "may face higher rates and needs them, since labour market tensions," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began to enter the fibrillations at the end of this month, after China devalued the currency.
Industrial media Dow Jones dropped by 16% below the maximum record reached in more, as investors feared that the Chinese economy would slow down global growth.
The market has recovered since this month, the Dow index is now approximately 10% below the maximum of more.
For Fed decision-making factors, market aggression is added to the complex calculation of the time of growth of the profit rate.
"Without what has happened in the financial markets and in the past few weeks, the Chinese economy would be stronger in the seat," said Stephen D. Oliner, an experienced researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and was official Fed.
Now, he suggests they'll wait at least a month to manage the best effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about the impact on the US economy and almost no data to be based on further events in China," Oliner said.
The improvement of the global economy is not one of the greatest interests of Fed, so it should not be taken into account in making decisions.
But, in fact, Fed has become world monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been tremendous.
In 2013, President Ben S. Bernanke simply argued that Fed could "inspire" monetary expansion had declared the global market collapse.
In a world in which markets and economies are confused more than ever, it is expected that Fed officials not only monitor the progress recorded in other areas, but also consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
His decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the Global Strategy Department of the Investnet Inc well-being management company.
Jeffrey Laker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., stated this month that "Fed has a history of oversized reactions to changes in the financial market which seemed to have nothing to do with economic bases."
Lacker, a member of the Federal Committee on the Market, a decision-making body, which supported the growth of the rate of prosperity, offered, for example, the 1998-99 decisions.
A financial crisis affecting Asia has determined Fed to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% at three meetings, "in the face of limited identification implications for US development," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials came back on their losses.
Fed should put the financial stability problem first only in the event of a major crisis, as was the market share in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, a member of the Bank of England's profit-making committee.
The last period of the attack shall not be raised at any level at that level, he said.
"We certainly do not want to get into the situation of fearing an increase in the profit rate due to the fact that the markets have been upset," said Posen, President Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act continues to hold the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in this sense, I do not think it should take any further action.

Seven's Sunrise dominates the polls, despite the attempts of the Nine Canal to transmit to Today Show about changing party leadership
The urgent move of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to transmit the consequences of the changes in the leadership of the Liberal Party has not led to a significant increase in the hearing for Today.
The morning show of the Nine canal was transferred from capital after Tony Abbott's fire in front of Malcolm Turnbull.
The competition issue Sunrise, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was held in London as part of a series of broadcasts delivered over the course of several weeks, including Dubai, New York, Cascada Niagara and Cancun.
This "crossing" of the distance did not seem to contain too much for the Aussie TV viewers, Sunrise having a hearing of 397,000 spectators in the five capital cities, facing Today with 339.000.
Today it recorded a slight increase compared to the monthly hearings (317.000) and last March (23,000) but the figures were smaller than the previous joys (343.000).
Today has made the difference between Sunrise and Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average hearing of 318,000 and Sunrise of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349.000 television and today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
This morning, Parliament is not only affected by the current change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

Critics wonder if Thomson is able to face a show alone, without the star of Rafters, Rebecca Gibney.
The results of the hearing last night gave a shocking answer that "yes".
The show X Factor transmitted by Seven has been maintained, with 1.136 million viewers, playing easy on the show The Block (838.000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven registered sutures and cobblestones on the second night he sent The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17:00 to 17:30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new moderate general culture show had an average of 446,000 television viewers.
The second half of the hour (17:30 to 18:00) raced to 633,000 television viewers - enough for a small victory in front of Eddie McGuire's show, Hot Seat (613.000).
Last night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia's show had an average audience of 550,000 spectators and the second half recorded a huge figure of 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average hearing of 620.000.

4 people and they lost their lives after the police took the bullet in protestors in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police had beaten the police with bullet wounds in the crowd that demonstrated against the new constitutions proposed by the country, said Wednesdays to an official.
Violence took place last night in Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of Kathmandu's capital.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, head of the district police, over 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police department, and some of them threw stones and molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said that the police used lacrimogen gas after they fired fires before using the rubber balls.
According to him, twelve police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber glands, which is known to be able to kill, are usually used as less lethal alternative, have caused so many deaths.
The massacre was the last event after weeks of violent protests in the southern Nepali region, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group said that the new provinces established under the new constitution would have a political influence.
There were also protests in Nepal, where ethnic group Tharus wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent massacres declared on 10 August,
when four important political parties signed an agreement to share the country in the provinces - a major step towards a new constitution but an extremely controversial problem in Nepal, a country dominated at central level for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution was postponed in 2008, but legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
This week, in Kathmandu, the legislators voted in favour of the draft constitution, and the officials said that the new letter could be adopted Sunday.

The weight reduction surgery could be useful in the case of mildly obese diabetics
The benefits of the surgery to reduce the weight in patients with mild obese type 2 diabetes could be maintained for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still too late to say if diabetes is mildly obese to live longer after the surgical intervention of loss in weight than those following non-surgery treatment.
"It takes a lot of time to centralize mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an obstetrician, as she wrote an article about a new study in JAMA Surgery.
Operations for weight loss, known as bariatric surgery, use different methods to narrow the stomach.
These reduce the sense of hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proved effective in type 2 diabetes treatment, but most of the studies have decreased in subjects with mild obesity, with a body mass index (IMC) 35 or higher.
IMC, a unit of weight measurement in relation to height, is considered normal at range 18.5-24.9.
The IMC value of at least 25 indicates that one person is superior and more than 30 persons with IMC are considered obedient.
You can calculate the IMC by accessing: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from the General Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used direct data after 2007 in a trial that compares two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and manipulative gastrointestinal disease - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes with mild obese people.
The average IMC in people who have had surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in the course of the study.
In the meantime, IMC in people who received non-surgery antidiabetes treatment remained close to the same level, namely 29.
Among those who suffered surgical intervention, diabetes had been completely cured by 36% and partly by 28%.
In the group treated by medical methods, the diabetes was compared to 1% complete and only 2% of subjects.
In addition, control of blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the surgical group", the authors concluded.
Researchers have also monitored the blood level of the A1c haemoglobin, which reflects the level of glucose at the time.
Researchers write that the optimal level of haemoglobin A1c is below 7%.
Following surgical intervention, the average haemoglobin level of A1c decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the drug-treated group, approximately 8% remained.
However, this improved "glycemic control" - reflected in improved levels of the A1c haemoglobin - did not reduce the mortality rate in five years, according to researcher chief Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgical intervention.
In the fifth year, compared to the group of gastrotomy in manoeuvre, the surgery group of Bypass lost more weight (18.7 faces 14.2 kg), recorded a more significant decrease in IMC (7.4 faces 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% versus 2.1%) and showed a higher probability of total diabetes remission (46.9% versus 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study carried out on people with great difficulty in Sweden that surgical intervention prolongs life, says Blackstone, from Arizona University, University of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obedient people who have suffered bariatric surgery presented a risk of approximately 29% lower death after 15 years, compared with a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a benefit in survival for patients suffering from surgical intervention, Blackstone stated that it is an optimistic aspect for IMC people under 35 stakeholders.
"This is the point where this work is critical, since it claims that this surgical intervention is safe in the lower IMC group," she says without increasing the risk of deaths or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that their patients and doctors should start taking their weight seriously when the IMC reaches 27-30.
"I think we're waiting too long to persuade people to take this matter seriously," she said.
I think that once these genetic changes have been accumulated, which have short-lived their bodies predisposed to obesity and diabetes, it is extremely difficult to return to normal.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not accept all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
Buddhist leader Tibetan sent an appeal to end the violence in refugee countries.
Dalai Lama spoke of the current problem of the refugee crisis in the speech he held at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for the Mercy of Oxford, dedicated to ethical studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the British Sea.
He stated that, in the present situation, the interests of humanity should prevail in the interests of each nation and even of each continent.
He also stressed that, although admirable, the response of the countries in the Western European crisis to the refugee crisis is inadequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama encouraged Germany and Austria's efforts to face the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to care for a few thousand refugees, but we must think at the same time about long-term solutions to bring peace and genuine development, especially through education in the Muslim countries," he stressed.
Basically, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force has never solved these problems," he added.
Regarding the problem of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following the terrorist attacks of 11 September, stating that the violent response from the US has generated an uncontrollable launch.
After the events of 11 September, I sent condolences in a letter addressed to President Bush and told him to solve this problem without resorting to violence.
I know his reasons were strong but he used force and generated unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have been infected with gloves in the last 4 years
According to the Georgia Anti-Fraud Centre, the US Anti-Fraud Centres reported an increase of approximately 400% from 2010 to the number of children under 12 years of age who have leaned hands with a large alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Anti-Fraud Centre, cases of birth of children under 12 years of age reported to anti-Fraud Centres were reported from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"The copies have more frequent access to these products and, unfortunately, one percent of them reach the emergency room," said Lopez to the CNN.
Lopez stated that some children were intent on detergent and others were doing it to impress their friends or to respond to social networks.
YouTube can be followed by films that present to adolescents such as a detergent drink to create cheap drinks.
It seems that adolescents have mixed the denture with hot water with alcohol to get a higher drink.
The younger children may be attracted to the attractive smell of the detector.
"A child doesn't think he's hurting him," Lopez says.
Many of the most attractive types (by hand detectors) are the perfumes.
Hand detectors with capillary aroma, strength, portocal are the most attractive for children.
Hand detector contains approximately 45-95% alcohol.
Especially for young children, only a few pregnant women can cause alcohol abuse.
"It's very concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Anti-Fraud Center of the University Hospital in Kansas, for channel Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So we avoid leaving a whiskey pair on the table, but people leave these hand-loss in accessible places and if the little ones get to them, this is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently enrolled in school, the equivalent of four hand-lossed powders, arrived in the emergency room to receive treatment.
She had alcoholism179, two times greater than the threshold in which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, a medical doctor in the emergency room who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was crying and he couldn't walk when he came to the emergency room.
The doctors monitored her over the night in a separate child hospital to identify signs of brain injury, because the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was exciting," said Ortoria Scott, Nahaijah's mother, for CNN.
He could've been dead.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use products or soft drinks without alcohol and no longer leave the child’s fingertips behind.
In addition to alcohol abuse, some detectives have been associated with abortions.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after they were infected with a detachment of hands containing a toxic ingredient, undeclared.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three students from the fourth class of the North New York were about to betray their "bad" teacher "by placing antibacterial products in the classroom", according to a police report.
The professor is very allergic to the dealer's hands and has banned him from his course room.
The police considered the plan to be "unreasonable" and addressed the disciplinary problem of the school inspector.

Hearts faced with the SFA regarding Nelson and Warburton's charges are cautioned about the January procurement that affected the team's unity
Dons grow the difference from Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's pennalization in the first instance brought those from Aberdeen a sharp victory in front of Hamilton to Pittodrie, making a difference between them and Celtic.
Griffiths demonstrate noise related to misunderstandings
There have been rumors of misunderstandings in Celtic, deposed by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team not be subjected to increased pressure in order to prepare to face the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we feel pressure, I think players just wait.
The absence of discounts in the course of the title makes them weak in the Netherlands - by Boer
The average number of Rangers and the former Dutch international player Ronald de Boer said Dutch football supporters lost interest in Celtic because they didn't fight for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, currently Ambassador of the Ajax, said: “In the Netherlands the summaries of the Celtic games are no longer transmitted; why?"
Because they're not the Rangers there.
Here, it's not just about the return of the Rangers.
It's about Old Firm.
It's about both loolant teams and that's where the interest is directed.
The tension is great in the old firm games and not only the discounts want to see these games.
I'll change the situation, promise Deila.
RONNY Deila admitted that Celtic is struggling in the face, but the Norwegian chief promised to change the situation.
The curse with Malmo and the further removal of the League of Champions were followed by the curse in front of Aberdeen that played in 10 people, now found in the top of the classification with a five-point advance.
But Deila said, "Celtics had a period before and they'll come back."
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what's going on.
We feel the same way - but we have to go further.
We need the support of Celtics because that's how players get better.
It's extremely important that we stay united now.
Warburton's wisdom regarding January's transfers
In spite of comments last few weeks that suggested that a number of targets would have been identified for transfers from January, the head of the Rangers, Mark Warburton is careful when the transfer comes, insisting that he does not want to affect the Ibrox team unit.
The head of Brentford stated: "The January transfer period is very different from the summer."
In the case of the players transferred yesterday, there is a period before the season in which you can be integrated, which you could observe in this season in our group.
The team's working very well.
Sometimes it's worse if you bring players that aren't necessary.
Celtic looks at Michu after withdrawal
Striker from Swansea, Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested that he might withdraw from the contract with Swans.

Hearts faced with SFA regarding Nelson's comments
Hearts led with 2-1 when Patterson was removed and lost with 3-2, but the red bottom cardboard was then cancelled - the third red cardboard cancelled in eight months.
Nelson notes his statements, saying: "I did not doubt integrity, I did not comment on performance."
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle
The Invincible Hibee was taken to the ground after he admitted that he sang a song with offensive verses about the former player from Hearts, Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014, in a village in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before a mine with Edinburgh in Tynecastle.
"It was Derby and was the enthusiasm of the moment," said the striker, adding: "I don't have to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I play for Celtic."
Tannadic Council trusts Dundee United - Donnelly Management
Simon Donnelly insists that those of the Dundee United Council still believe that the management team will change the situation - but it is agreed that the decline on the ground must be completed.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll bring the guys back in shape," Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy for "the dirty victory" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes acknowledges that the Aberdeen team must meet with hope of Hamilton Akces to win the seven successive victory in the league, which brought them five points before Celtic because of the first battle of the battle by Adam Rooney.
McInnes stated: "There is no team that has won something in the cup or league, and that has not won such games."
The harvest rate in Scotland remains unchanged as British Sea grows
RISKS in Scotland remain unchanged, being 164,000 in May, while the number of mines in the British Sea has increased by 10,000, reaching 1.82 million in the same period.
The rate of unemployment in Scotland was 5.9% higher than in Britain, 5.5%, according to the figures presented by the National Statistics Office (ONS).
In the meantime, the employment rate in Scotland fell by 12.000 over three months, the number of employees currently employed was 2.632.000.
The employment rate in Scotland decreased in the period from 74.0% - an average of 73.5 from the British Sea.
Scottish State Secretary David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The long-term plan of authorities laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It's almost a year since Scotland took the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, I have seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, the rate of employment of the labour force recording growth and the rate of unemployment.
Why I'm a witness at an execution in Oklahoma
In the course of today, except for a late legal intervention, I'll see how a man is sentenced to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be in a shelter for observers from the Oklahoma State Prison and see how Richard Glossip is executed by administering the lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation first came in January, through his best friend, and, although we were searched, I accepted.
As the day draws closer to the prize, I'm shocked.
So, why do I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of the capital punishment.
He'd offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists can be witnesses to executions in America, and because often the applications exceed the number of places available, there is a poor lotteries to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of places reserved for the representatives from the press from 12 to five.
Those who choose will look at the execution with impartiality.
I can't do that.
I'd stay with Richard Glossip's closest friends, in addition to developing my own relationship with him over the months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to have a wallet and a pix to notice what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the holder's story as much as he wants it, get access.
I cried to her.
He acknowledged that “it could have been better to make a statement, ” but he continues to think that I am wrong.
Richard Glossip didn't agree with some of the things I said and wrote them.
Don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't do it if I asked.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants to present an international report to write on the subject.
He thinks, if he dies, advertising will help move against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, reporter at Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to find out more about the case, listen to the media file series that I've done.
I'm not coming back here on all the details.
I can't be sure Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder make him guilty of complicity.
But I think it's very likely not to be guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify the sentence of death.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll watch him die from this perspective.
I can't pretend I'm completely objective.
For this, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll find out what it's like to see a man I love dying in vain.
Peter Moody claims the Stewards have tried to spy on him and threaten to withdraw from the course
Peter Moody said that the Stairs Racing Victoria or tried to infiltrate a spy at his graffiti last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the course.
He launched an attack against the Stears and of the Department of Integrity of Racing Victoria, claiming that he is pursuing a personal campaign against him, the painting that filled his eye with the removal of Lady Tatai from the course due to a treatment administered on the day of the course.
Moody said for Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for the field of courses and that he has been put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result of the test for the Cobalt of Lidari, because he has no explanation.
For 18 months, she had written the words on the spinal declarations and did not want to be like the "wolve that doesn't reach the strokes".
"I wasn't going to say anything about that, and I stayed a long time, but sometimes I got to a level of frustration so high that it's all over again," Moody said.
He knows he's gone.
Sometimes you react and you have to bear the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep quietly.
I want to go with my head up and I want the owners I work with to see that you're trying to offer them everything that's best.
From the time they start believing that this doesn't happen, I've got to give up on the trainer's job.
I'll have to think about what I'm going to do with my certification.
Earlier, Moody threw the bomb into a data interview for racing.com in which he said the integrity department tried to spy out their gravity.
"After eighteen months, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a cabin next to a man - whose name I'll tell him if they're asked - and they offered to hire him to provide information about the activity there," Moody told Racing.com.
Of course he thinks I'm sad.
If so, then he should give all his resignation because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of the RVL, David Moodie, current president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO Executive Director of the RVL, knew at the time and today.
Should I think it's personal?
Is RVL necessary to start having a vertebral colon and can it draw people out of the training for what is happening in industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
Is my influence on industry so bad?
Maybe that's how I see the others.
Maybe I have to take my license and give it to one side and I have no doubt that the statements I'm making now could decide to think about this variant.
But I got to the point where I don't care, and that bothers me.
I'm so sorry.
I'll put pressure on them and I'll decide to make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The trainer's furrow has grown once with a long investigation into the cobalt test involving Lidari and has decided to remove him to say that he could "put his license on the table".
Moody, whose name is most often associated with the training of the uninhibited Black Caviar campaign, has labeled the treatment rule on the day of the course as “ridicol” after applying to the hair legs a cataplasm with nymph or argyl, which hits the rules.
Click on the rules of the courses.
I have to take my full responsibility for this," he says.
One of my employees put him in the wrong place on his feet.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, what happened.
It happened on the day of the course.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the treatment of the day of the course consisting of applying cataplasm, for which the stewars opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand the need for rules but it has gone too far," Moody said.
The victim who struck and fled from the accident in Cobram was arrested
The police arrested a man after a collision with a bicyclist produced in Cobram at the end of the week and after running away from the scene.
The biker was transported with the helicopter at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, seriously injured after being hit seven morning by a car on the Murray Valley highway.
Police representatives state that the driver of the car didn't stop to help the injured biker.
Monday, a 50-year-old man, handed over to the Shepparton police.
It seems he'll be accused of running away from the scene, not offering first aid and other road offences.
The bicyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in a stable state.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, answers opponents in wrestling charges.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, named the criticisms brought to his team's gambling tactics as "denatured subjects" brought to the discussion of the two main favorites of the NRL.
Coach Sydney Roosters, Trent Robinson, said that the arbitrators allowed the players from Storm to "take them to the ground" team in the tournament won by Storm at the end of the final rating played last night in Sydney.
Brisbane Bronco's coach Wayne Bennett made a simple reference to Storm after the victory of his team in the Qualification Games with North Queensland Cowboys, played Saturday evening when he called the game a "demand" of the rugby league and said that the two teams in Queensland were not too valuable to wrestling.
Bellamy dropped in defense of his team's gambling tactics and said that players just concentrate on "contact" when they play.
Bellamy says he fell in confidence after two important trainers criticized the team, which means they were worried that Storm would beat them.
"And things don't stop here - I didn't hear Trent Robinson crying out of wrestling when they beat us with the score 24-2," said Bellamy Wednesdays.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything every year in our defense systems or techniques so much that in the last six weeks, I've actually put the emphasis on contact in favor and so I've changed the situation.
Trent is in this function for three years and obviously has a wonderful team so it's probably not common to lose and it was a shock for him.
We know how it happens all the time in this year.
Bellamy contrasted Bennett's idea of "the soul of the football", reminding his mentor St George-Illawarra Dragons of Bennett won the championship in 2010 playing "plictist".
Wayne's talking about palpitating football.
And he argued his opinion by comparing the game of Saturday night with our game of Friday evening and talked about how palpitant was the game," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St George received a lot of criticism because he was a heavy-duty team, and Wayne said he didn't care even black under corner.
But now he has a team that can play what I consider to be a palpitant football, especially because of the fast young middlemen.
This kind of game you want to do when you have such players.
He gave this argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his game style - not every team has two middlemen like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're somehow worried about the game with us.
Now six weeks probably didn't think about us when they were thinking about important games.
Bellamy also highlighted the fact that the game between Storm and Roosters was a closer bonded score compared to the game between Broncos and Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, didn't I see him yet, how long was the score?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, which means palpitant game?
Or the palpitant means you're taking a break and you're not going to walk?
For me there are plans.
If I'm talking about us, it means that at some point I could meet her.
Storm is free of this weekend because they won the right to play home either with North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks, at the end of the week's preliminaries at AAMI Park, the tickets were on sale starting in the next morning.
Stefan Hogg used the girl's phone to let the pedophile send images
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of abused children.
Stefan Hogg took the girl's phone when she went to bed and then authenticated in an online e-mail service where another user sent her a series of unusual images with children right under it.
The girl woke up later and noticed the disappearance of the phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while she was sleeping.
He looked in the phone and found the disturbing messages after which he warned Mom immediately.
After arrival, the police saw the five posts and then analyzed the computers found at the address and found “anxious” search on the Internet using terms to find improper images with children's subjects.
Hogg claimed he did it to "draw the pedophile" on the Internet before "he claimed he was a cop to scare them."
Judge Elidh Robertson said of Dundee’s court: “He said it was an addiction - it was up to people to fear.
He recognized that he was doing computer searches but he said he did it because he wanted to give himself a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations with the unknown person who sent the images to him and about the fact that he asked the person in question to send them more pictures.
He said he did it to join.
He said he didn't think clearly when he was drinking and he wanted to see images of violence and crime.
Mr. Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on the phone, she cried out her mother and tears and cries.
The girl saw the wrong images on the phone and the charge was challenged.
The girl was interviewed and told that the accused used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who seemed much younger than him.
Last year, on 14 June, Hogg, at the age of 23, domiciled in Ward Road, Dundee, accused the accused of committing or taking improper positions with children, and violated the conditions of release on 25 January this year and did not appear before the court at the trial on 24 March of the current year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be registered in the register of sexual offenders because it can be said that this offence "did not involve a significant sexual aspect".
Judge Alistair Carmichael extended his sentence until October, for reasons of social reports.
Hogg was released on trial in this file but remained in custody before other files were created.
It was passed into the register of sexual offenders before the sentence was given.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, sent the wrong speech to Parliament
At the beginning of the year, Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
But filming the fall has become violent on socializing networks.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also interrupted by representatives of the opposition who said they would have received anonymous threats of death, threatening him that he would not be able to hurt Mr. Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they invited him during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The head of the parliamentary movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonesse, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on mobile phones, warning not to interrupt Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent by a secret number but it is entitled "death", he told the journalists after Mr. Mugabe's speech.
It warns parliamentarians that immunity applies only to Parliament and once they leave Parliament, immunity is no longer important.
The head of the parliamentary group said that the party, led by Morgan Tsvangira, is "anxious" with regard to threats transmitted to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will make 30,000 availability
It is anticipated that Hewlett-Packard will make 25,000 to 30,000 available as part of the restructuring and cost reduction efforts of the service sector.
This year, HP will be divided into two companies, separating the division of computers and printing operations with corporate hardware and services found in exciting growth.
The estimated availability will cost approximately $2.7 billion, starting in the quarter, said the HP company.
"These restructurings will bring new Hewlett Packard Enterprises a more competitive and sustainable structure with regard to costs," said Meg Whitman, President and Director-General HP, who will lead the unit after the collapse.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP at present and will have a wide portfolio of business that will contribute to the transition of companies to the new business-reduction style," Whitman said.
Working as separate societies, we are better positioned than ever to meet the requirements of our global customer growth.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenue of over $50 billion and "will focus on providing integrated solutions without rivals" to companies.
A company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, which is the object of the production of electrical equipment and the garage in Palo Alto was called the Silicon Valley.
HP has gone through massive reorganization to adapt to the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The measure taken by HP, the second largest computer producer in the world and one of the largest companies in the US technology sector, is the most recent in the area, based on the idea that companies focusing better on a direction have a better performance.
FriendsFest: the series of comedy that taught us important lessons about friendship between men
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, suicide rates among young men reaching the age of 15 years.
In 2013, suicide represented the main cause of deaths in men aged 20 to 45 in the British Sea, and remained three times more frequent in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, the Campaign Against Unhappy Life Miserably (CALM) has appointed 2015 as the Year of the Man, wanting to make it a sign of culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the center of the fight to the success of this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students who presented symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is fed sufficiently by many friends "with a healthy disposition", his chances of recovery are doubled.
In the same way, for people who are not depressed, a search for healthy mental friends reduces half the likelihood of mental disorders.
Of course, for friendship to have an effect, it must first be accessible.
In this age of communication dominated by social networks, where emphasis is placed on style and not substance, the immediate nature of the response is often given priority before the meaningful contact.
Our digital worlds have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to entertainment and success, even if isolation is actually what dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call foreign values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of internal values - our internal desire for personal development and friendship - which affects our mental health and well-being.
The billionaire Inventor of a video game recently explained that money doesn't even buy happiness.
The Frustration of the Friends series was that he focused on this idea.
The people were not defined by the place of work but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The murder of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the moments when they look at the football in the comfortable photos and Ross' passion for Rachel came from knowing that men can associate with this situation, even if they tend to explore their feelings completely.
As a social worker explained to me: "My role in listening to people with suicidal and depressed tendencies has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference."
Often, people who call on us do not feel able to talk to their friends.
The old saying to exploit yourself is strong, just as the feeling of being understood as a weak person if you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to my mind when I try to offer more psychological adjustment mechanisms in the long term.
The series has highlighted the few moments of friendship between men.
While it is very helpful for objective, external intervention through phone calls, people join in the moment of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
So if you participate in this weekend at FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with the complete editing of film platforms to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, and better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and greet.
You never know what the difference might make your friendship.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - with #FriendsFest
Di Maria marches and helps PSG give Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matudii and Edinson Cavani after marking against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria marked March in his debut game at the League of Championships and helped PSG to stand before the Swedish Malmo team.
We continue to present you the history of the game and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani and did their duty, Paris Saint-German starting a series of games from the League of Champions, with a 2-0 winding victory against Malmo in the game played on Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria marked in less than four minutes from the start of her initial match at the PSG Championships League, bringing France's champions to the advantage although they missed a series of occasions before ensuring their advantage with the Cavani gol marked in 61 minutes.
Getting to Group A Joining Real Madrid and Şahtior Donečk, Paris needed a strong start against Swedish champions because the objective of the French team is not only to compete in the best but also to improve the path to the final spheres in each of the last three tournaments.
However, although they took the notes, Laurent Blanc's students were away from a perfect table, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who seized the chance of gol after he was replaced by the team from his hometown and the club where he started his wonderful career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win home or move to the League of Champions, so victory with 2-0 creates problems for our opponents and sets a comfortable difference with the following classes, even if there are more aspects to be perfect for them during the season," Blanc said.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and did it, though I'm sorry we couldn't give one or two more balls.
Ibrahimovic returned after the accident to one of the three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 remise obtained from Bordeaux's house in League 1 on the weekend, but Di Maria took the light of the reflections in four minutes.
Last month when it was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine average offensive was named the man who will lead the PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he landed at Marco Verratti's back behind Malmo's defense before he learned incredible about Johan Wilden, in the long collection from the right of the port.
But if someone expects PSG to get victory from his fingers, they have been disappointed.
Malmo, who won Celtic in play-off to reach this stage and entered the land with nine national teams, with a defense of five people and two middle-class defenses, was a powerful opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except by doing Nikola Djurdjic's ear that passed Kevin Trapp's post in 34 minutes.
Instead, PSG players have slowed the pace several times, giving some unnecessary steps and not finalising interventions, even Ibrahimovic who has missed at least five attempts only in the first time and was then replaced by Cavani even after the game is over.
Abrahamovic, however, proved much more valuable in supporting his colleagues, his pass being the one that Di Maria sent him to a street driven by Wiland over the gate in 52 minutes.
The second round was signed in a final after an hour of the game, due to Cavani, the urguyan who signed the season's gold chair after Ibrahimovic passed from Maxwell's centre.
This gol has eliminated the hope of Malmo's people that they will rebalance the score and only a great stop of Wiland from the distance for David Luiz's rejection kept the final score before the new Ezequiel Lavezzi entry cancels a round in the long run.
The Norwegian coach of the Malmo team, Age Hareide, further stated that PSG was with a class over and that "The last match I played in the League of Champions was last December."
Since then, I've only played in the Swedish league, which doesn't rise at the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Drop the hat for PSG.
They made a great game.
Glencore is $2.5 billion in stock sales
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by the decline in the price of stock exchanges, paid $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of a comprehensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore, quoted on the London Stock Exchange, said he sold new shares worth 1.6 billion pounds of sterling to cover the debt.
Following the loss of 57% of its market value this year, the company takes stock of the prices in order to reduce the price of goods, because the decline in China's economic activity influences the demand and causes disaster in the market.
The preferential right to subscribe increased the price of Glencore's shares on London's stock exchanges in the morning Wednesdays.
The shares ranged from 2.77% to 131.60 inches on the FTSE 100 index, which opened at a value of 0.69% higher.
Glencore discovered the sale of shares worth $2.5 billion as part of larger plans to cover nearly a third of the debt of $30 billion.
The company sold new shares at the price of 125 illingi per share, with 2.4% less than the closing price of March.
He dropped 1.3 billion shares, representing 9.99% of the group.
The concern over the rise in the Chinese economy in prolonged stagnation led to a substantial increase in prices in the coal mine, with approximately half, and coal, copper and other goods dropped by 20-40%.
Xi insists on expanding the global economy
Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a group charged with the reform that the economy must be extended to the outside world to feed growth.
"China needs to engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving opening policies," Xi said, during the 16th Central Steering Group Meeting for the Further General Reform (Central Leadering Group for Deopening Overall Reform).
Promoting openness and encouraging reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and will make economic growth possible, Xi said.
The management group has adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list of market access regulation, abrogation of customs control policies, encouraging state enterprises to absorb private capital and reorganisation of the resident registration system.
According to the declaration, a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and areas of activity in which investment is not permitted.
The system will be tested and improved by testing programmes.
According to the declaration, the measure is important because it will provide the market with a more important role in the allocation of resources, ensuring a business environment based on legislation and providing a wider market opening.
State authorities will also weaken controls on the powers conferred on companies by ensuring that these companies decide how to conduct their business.
China will also allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.

Then I'm sorry, I left a job behind.
That's what I thought it was good for me and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a picker, wasn't normal, I wasn't respected, I didn't respect my work.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation came with a preconceived idea, he didn't know me, he knew different opinions about me.
It didn't change me because it was very difficult at the time, with the results we had, plus it was the financial situation in the middle.
I kept working, everything was going very well and probably changed and he also changed his ideas.
So I wanted to go.
If you don't want to stop, I've proposed a deal then.
We have about 400 and a few thousand euros a year, so we have about 600 billion euros.

The activity report of the TVR driver, rejected by the Commission: Stelian Tanase risk
Parliament's cultural commissions rejected Wednesday's report of the activities of the Council of Administration of the Romanian Television Society in 2014.
In order to reject the report, 17 parliamentarians voted against the suspension (Sagan Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one withdrew.
The text of the report will be forwarded to the United Permanent Offices.
These will decide, probably next week.
The next round will be discussed.
"I believe that in view of this situation, it will be done relatively quickly," said the President of the Senate's Committee on Culture, Georgica Severin.
He added that "good sense age" as well as TVR driving should be presented at this sitting, provided that no representative of TVR driving was present at the meeting of the Cultural Commissions.
It was good to be presenting TVR driving because no one here was subjected to personal attacks or something like that.
The invitation has been made to the CA members since last night, with an hour or so close that we are not now, but today, after the meeting of the United Bureau, we have sent a fax to the TVR driving.
I think that at the moment you're called, you're budgeted, paid out of public taxes, and you're invited to a meeting of the committee meetings even if you don't like to live.
"As your duty is to serve, you are in an institution in the subordination of Parliament," Severin said after the meeting of the Committees on Culture.
He added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed during the session on the basis of the negative opinion of the Committees on Budgets.
The reasons we saw as they continued, came with the idea that this year would have been a day, but they didn't pay for the history.
"I remind you that neither of my fault nor of any of these committees has lost that deal with banks and taxes, there are clear management problems," Severin explained.
He added that after the activity report will be rejected by the plenary, the elections will follow for a new Administrative Board and will be elected by the Director-General of the Institute.
I don't know who's gonna be proposed for this job.
People won't do it.
It is important to make political decisions in order for this institution to function.
I'm not the man to lie, I'm gonna say there's gonna be a genius who's gonna sit here and hit.
I hope that those who decide, the whole of Parliament, by their vote, will choose with great courage people who will run TVR.
There must be people who know what's going on there, experience and have a lot of justice and respect for the girl of the institution and tradition.
I don't know who it will be, if you asked me what quality you should have - I feel good about the employee's attitude because it's a curse from employees, complaints, concessions.
"When you're also getting 50, 60, 70, something's scared and we're talking about the financial situation that's a disaster," the President of the Senate's Committee on Culture concluded.
Although he did not present to Parliament, the President-in-Office of the TVR, Stefan Tanase, sent a letter to the President of the Chamber of Members, Valerius Zgonea, asking that Parliament take into account a number of measures that could lead to the saving and guaranteeing of the independent economic and political power of public television, including the numbering and indexing of TV taxes.
In writing, Stelian Tanase requests, on the basis of the index of TV taxes, the modification and completion of HG 978/2003 on taxes for the public television service, in order to update the provisions on the level of technological changes on the day, as well as to regulate the control procedure in the field of TV taxes and the detection of contraventions and the application of sanctions and penalties.
He also wants to issue a provision which will provide for the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become SRTV's mandate for the collection of TV taxes by involving ANRE in the regulation of this activity.
In his view, it is necessary to establish a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission of prosecutors.
Stelian Tanase requests a reduction in VAT rate for specific public television activities and contributions to the CNC from 15% to 3%, but also a change in law 41/1994, in order to receive budgetary/finance allocations for the purchase of licences for major cultural and sports events - World Football Championship, Aur Cerbul, Eurovision.
He argues that SRTV will enter into the payment in the months ahead, in view of the worker's labour law being forced to execute the judges' rulings, even if they are not final, and pay entitlements are respected with priority due to any other obligation.
The TVR administration has constantly made efforts to reduce costs with staff and TV production.
"The transfer and other cost-generating activities have thus been reduced, a series of commercial contracts have been renegotiated and, at the end of July, the TVR News post has been closed," said the president of TVR.
Tanase appreciates that the devastating financial situation cannot be offset only by its own efforts.
"With the support of state institutions - Government, Parliament, the Presidency - Roman TV will be available sooner or later, in the inability to carry out the public mission," the letter mentioned.
The Head of the House of Members decided to send the letter to the Committee on Culture.
Vasile Blaga's geniuses, sent to court
The generators of Vasile Blaga, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, were sent to the trial, Wednesday, by the prosecutors of the Park along the Court of Apple Bucharest.
This is accused of tax evasion, in a file of approximately 600,000 euros, being subject to judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was arrested on May 22nd.
This created the Axis Corporate Security SRL, his mother's nursery in April 2009, one year after he married Vasile Blaga's daughter, Agathe.
The investigation revealed that, for the purpose of tax and tax relief to the state budget, representatives of a company specialized in the provision of peaceful services would have created an infractional circuit, a form of more commercial companies, through which fictitious transactions would have been demonstrated.
"In fact, the company's accounts would have been recorded for physical purchases of services, which, in fact, were not provided, the state budget being so damaged by approximately 600,000 euros," the Romanian police explained in a press release.
See that Sanmartean's table is stable.
The sixth Al-Ittifhad Club established the letter of middleman Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announces that Sanmartean's departure from Ittihad is imminent, printer Ladislau Boloni, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says this will no longer happen.
Boloni is very grateful to Sanmartean.
Lucian plays the title game games and does it well.
The Sections also realized that he was the best and that it would have been wrong if they gave up on him.
It would have been more option to bring another player, much better, but nothing went out.
"There have been more discussions like the one with Mbark Boussofa, but nothing has come true," Zaporojanu said for Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad at the beginning of this year.
Ilie Sarbu was voted Vice-President at the Court of Auditors
Parliament voted in favour of the appointment of Senator Ilie Sarbu, Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as Vice-President of the Audit Authorities of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes were recorded "for" and 108 abstentions.
The vote was secret, with flowers.
PNL representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, the Digi24 report.
On the other hand, the liberals criticized Sarbu's appointment in this regard and announced that they would respond to the CCR, under the conditions in which he has a DNA file, but does not have the necessary preparation and experience.
Ilie Sarbu is available for 30 days, according to law, to leave the Senate, because the new function of the Court of Auditors is no longer allowed to make politics.
The PSD Senator will act as Vice-President of the Audit Authorities of the Court of Conturi, the free branch following the revocation of Joan Anton, following a decision of the Constitutional Court in September 2014, which found that he was designated non-constitutional.
Surprise from one of the most sexy actors: I grew up in the kitchen
As Bradley Cooper continues to play the role of a boxer in the "Burnt" film, the actor made a disvaluation to which he should not wait.
In a recent interview, she said that she had grown more in the kitchen: "I've worked a lot of my life as a baker."
It's been out of value for 15 years, when it worked for a Greek restaurant, so then, in college, it's going on the same way.
The actor explained that his mother had Italian origins, so the entire childhood was spent with her Italian grandmother, related to ContactMusic.
Asked what plans for the future had in that period, Bradley Cooper said that he was never the type of man to make plans in five years, "not even two."
"It's not very encouraging for me to have a card," he said.
"I see, things you hate if I tell you," said he again, saying that what he wanted from childhood meant.
By the age of 40, the actor acknowledged himself to be seen in the near future ruling, following the model of Clint Eastwood, who had been shot by the king all over this summer.
Ponta, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational allegations
Foreign Minister Ungar Peter Szijjarto condemned hard, Wednesday morning, the claims of Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta as the Hungarian political decision-makers are "nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees have fled".
" Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, through his ironic statements, jognest entire Hungary," the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs sent him to a communiqué.
European civilised politicians don't say that kind of uncontrollable bells.
"His comments have one explanation: he lost total support in Romania's internal policy," added the head of the Hungarian diplomat, according to MTI.
In a Tuesday evening post on Facebook, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said that you would like to draw attention to and punish the conduct of top Hungarian government officials, who, in his opinion, "are a mess for the culture and values of the European Union".
I do not want to respond to the provocations that come from some Hungarian government representatives.
"This is a mess for the culture and values of the European Union; and in anti-semit attitudes, and with regard to the treatment of minorities of all types, and now during the refugee crisis," Ponta explained on Facebook.
The Romanian Prime Minister added that it is the adoption of rational and sustainable solutions in the case of the refugee crisis, considering that brutal and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Sarma gimpata, aggressive laws, closures and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, political decisions are better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees are fleeing!
"Trust in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and especially in European values - which we see in recent days in Hungary is in total contradiction with these objectives and values," the Romanian executive stressed.
Last Tuesday, Foreign Minister of Hungary, Peter Szijjarto, qualified for "simply lies" the remarks of Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta on the management of Hungary's refugee crisis, considering that these claims were inappropriate for a leader in the twenty-first century, according to MTI.
The head of the Hungarian diplomat also mentioned that the "extremist and false remarks" of the Roman Prime Minister have an internal political crisis in Romania and explained that Budapest is waiting for forgiveness from the Roman side.
Sjjjarto referred to a statement made last month by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I have said and say is always that I am against xenophobic talks the idea of closing the borders, like all those who come from some terrorists, are stupid of the Middle Ages and totally oppose this approach.
If we can get more, we'll get, the problem is our logistics capacity to treat these people like some people, not how it treats our magic neighbors, with battle and with inseria.
"That I don't agree," said the head of the Roman executive, in a press conference at Targu-Jiu.
On Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Government of Budapest had decided to start preparations on the ground for the extension of the border with Romania of the guard he built on the border with Serbia to make any changes to the route used by migrants.
Next, Prime Minister Victor Ponta stated that the Hungarian decision to raise a guard on the granite did not solve anything about the refugee problem and "escape Hungary from Europe".
What link exists between Osama bin Laden and the macaral abuse of Mecca
The Saudi authorities announced that the healthy giant Binladin Group, belonging to Osama bin Laden's family, is "partially responsible" for the abuse of a macaral, Friday, on the Moschee Sea of Mecca, an accident following the death of 107 people.
According to a commission of inquiry, the company did not "respect the security rules", related to a Saudi press agency (SPA), reports BBC.
The company's directories have received a ban on the landing of land until the investigation is completed in this case.
The company will also be excluded from our public contracts.
The construction company is owned by the family of the former leader of the Al-Qaida terrorist network, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father after 80 years and is now led by the former terrorist leader, Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for four years at Mari Moschei's extension, so he can earn more money.
The accident occurred last night, during a storm, when a macara, probably decalibrated by powerful waves of wind, broke on the eastern side of Mary Moschei's cover from Mecca.
After the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were wounded.
How He Locked the Contestants
Given the world's largest Roman footballist in history, Gica Hagi was labelled, after withdrawing from activity, as a weak trainer, which cannot be able to perform performance and in the new position.
After an unhappy experience with the national team, Steaua or Galatasararay, Hagi took over, after a year, the training role of the Constanta Vitor, the team whose patronage.
After a year of the team's occupation, the King showed that he was able to transform a team that was fighting for the rescue of the retrograde into a top.
Thus, after one year, the Future registered, with Hagi coach, 16 winners, 11 remixes and 11 infringers.
The balance is one of a top team, which is hit by European horses.
The events took a turn and better for the Future in this season, the team arrived at the second place in League 1, with 19 points, one smaller than the leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack on League 1 with 20 gold (like Astra), more than double than Steaua.
On the other hand, even if he brought more experienced players to the team, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and in the last period in the start team, names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea have appeared.
The club's policy has made a team follow-up for foreign teams from the Future, so that Hagi sold in this range of 1.5 million euros - Janis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 billion euros).
Steaua heights, the Future is the only profit team in League 1, according to data from the Commercial Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has so far played as a small country.
It's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as the EU's seventh.
The Great Lakes come with solstices for the entire EU, says Cristian Ghinea, member of the board of directors of the European Roma Policy Centre.
In an interview agreed by Zaire.com, Christian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and the media just politicians will not function in this crisis: "Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values that these people come with".
But there are masses that started and we can't go back to history.
Migration is a reality that we need to adapt as best we can and adapt it to us.
In Christian Ghinea's opinion, we find ourselves at an extremely emotional moment where politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After it is over, Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, so the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created at another time and was not adapted to the situation now."
Where are we in the refugee crisis following this JAI advice that has actually solved nothing?
It is clear that EC President Donald Tusk agreed that he did not want to raise a vote in the Council.
All the predictions said there would have been the necessary votes.
Before the Lisbon Treaty, the principle of uniformity applies to the JAI and any State could block any decisions.
Therefore, things were very little integrated in the area of justice and internal affairs.
According to Lisbon, the normal procedure, in which the EC has an initiative, and the Council adopted a 55% vote of 16% of the EU population.
The calculations said the votes were there.
But they didn't want to go ahead.
Because it's a sensitive issue, reaction to rejection has appeared even in Germany against the opening policy of Chancellor Merkel and they didn't want in many ways to appear like a "EU sending migrants to the head" reaction.
They have tried so much, but a serious problem because, obviously, this value creates a serious problem for the Schengen government and we will probably be assisting in major changes there in the next period.
So the mandatory charges were not really eliminated, but was the subject just let go further?
Yes, on the other hand, it is about a greater involvement of Frontex Agency in the management of external borders, which means a change in the individual responsibility of the members who are at the Schengen external border to the responsibility of Community agencies.
The Greek border with Turkey is also the border of Germany with Turkey, and this wave of migrants has given the boundaries of the old Schengen system.
Perhaps it will decline to the Dublin principle, according to the customs of migrants, is the responsibility of the state in which it enters the first time, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece succeeds, you can't say it's Greece's job.
Problem and common.
Just because the problem is common, is it possible to resolve without a specific mechanism, perhaps even mandatory, to share the first effort?
No one knows exactly how the mandatory charges will work, if they'll be reached.
To solve a problem: what do you do with a man who doesn't want to blame Romania or Portugal, but Sweden or Germany?
I don't think the European states will be called to take over migrants: you're going to X-ray or Y-ray.
It is likely that it will reach certain unique filter centres, either in Greece or in Turkey, where asylum applications will be processed.
It works on this kind of solvent.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
They're like those who have ten years of experience trying to integrate migrants, they're so inexperienced, like Romania, where migrants' problems will increase the xenophob current.
It is true that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who are in high-ranking camps and who have just started to go to Europe.
One estimate says that only 10% of them shot off, iron and hard to pass through the Mediterranean, but we were expecting the next year at a valley maybe even bigger.
What do we do with this guy?
My guess is that we're going to get used to this problem, we're not going to watch it so much as a media disaster.
Talk about tariffs with less or greater experience.
Do you think there is any place where it really succeeded in integrating large groups from an extra-European culture?
I look at the Maghrebs in France, the Turks in Germany, they're all trapped.
I wouldn't go to radical declarations.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than in other migration values, but this does not mean that they are not integrated at all.
It has created an integral part that creates major social problems in France, Germany, the British Sea.
But half the police won't work.
Let's create a strong Europe and an illusion.
The integration mechanisms in European societies must be included.
Here were some steps.
We need to be more careful.
Let us ask these people to learn the language, try to appreciate the values, not to marry a foot in Europe and one in their land of origin, bringing the rest of the family, including the host of the convention.
It must be separate from the immediate problem of these people in the long term of their integration.
If others have gone through long-term integration it doesn't mean we have to look at them as it goes in the Mediterranean.
Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come with.
And if there's an intervention in Syria, what I don't think, it doesn't mean it's going to rehabilitate her overnight and you can go back to her.
Before the sun shines, we see the strengths in Europe.
The granite is closed, the walls are lifted, the border is re-entered into the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project as well as the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built sufficiently minimal and making rules so that the pressure was too high on the plates in which these migrants put their foot for the first time.
He says we move freely from there, but each one has his own problems.
In front of such a wave, it can't be that way, because some aunts don't make the girl.
When there are also emotional values, politicians will show that they do something, but in the long term, it doesn't change much.
According to the warnings of France, we have no anti-terrorist legislation much more dramatic in the EU than we had last year.
It's a valley of public emotion that is installed in both senses.
And it's so unstable from one week to another that you can't make decisions on their basis.
We have a lot of talk, many Belgian statements from politicians at home under pressure to be violent.
And then, you have the dramatic case of the child in Turkey and the public opinion gets excited.
After the public's emotions pass, we'll go back to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for the good.
This is the only real European road.
And I don't think that Europeans will abandon this principle of freedom of movement.
That there'll be other rules and something else.
Schengen is now like an animal created at another time and was not adapted to the situation right now.
How has Romania been playing in this crisis so far?
As a little land, who thinks, if he pulls the sand on his eyes and takes his ears off, the theme disappears.
In view of the reality of the value of migrants, you can choose to be a part of the solution or to say it's not your problem with small land.
We have done this, it's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as knowing the EU.
You're not, you're not playing at the big earth level.
The large lines come with solvents for the entire EU, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality now.
That's how Poland did it.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of the Romans for Schengen will fall very much.
President Johnis says it may be good that we haven't come in yet.
So we're going through the opening of the entrance to a more pragmatic position, but the target is a branch.
There is certainly a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen as migrants to see us as an alternative route.
Which doesn't mean it's a reason we don't get into Schengen anymore, but we're getting more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but in the sense that external borders will become a common responsibility, there will be one rules to accept migrants, one rules of transportation for those who do not receive asylum, one rules for safe fees.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia moved his attention to Syria in Ukraine, no one died.
Is there a link between those two focusses, a game in Russia?
Russia has a frustrated power behavior.
She thinks it would be great power to bribe Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a link.
It makes the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, probably the Assad regime would have been ruined in the past.
And it's good to burn before the main or opposition to be the Islamic State.
For two years it has been a struggle between the Assad regime and the Latin and moderate Muslims, supported by the Gulf and the West.
Then the Islamic state grew up and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to be each.
Russia could make things complicated, but it can't take part in the solution.
It creates a focus of instability and chaos that cannot shut them down.
But you're strong only if you're sour.
The game on the off-side is just a strategy to win time.
Putin's probably waiting to be offered, push him on the buttons to solve the situation.
Offers do not come because the world is not convinced that he can solve in some way or other things created by him.
But I don't agree with the theories that say these people are manned by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin more powerful than he is.
What button will appear in the corner
Millions of Facebook users have become familiar with the "Like" button, and now representatives of socializing networks are preparing another opposition, the "Disclike".
Marti, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and executive director of the company, announced on the account or that this button will be available in the auction, reports New York Times on blog.
Zuckerberg explained that the "Disclike" button will show a deeper look at what a user feels than a simple option.
However, the ad or raised a problem that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wants to avoid the moments when someone puts on the account or an important event in life, and someone else will give "Disciplinary".
Network users, who reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long requested the opportunity to express their negative emotions or feelings with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg said it's not very comfortable that people give "Like" current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the case of a family member's death.
"You may not feel comfortable giving those posts like that," said the Facebook representative.
The variant of a new button on Facebook has not been received well from everyone.
"There is already enough hate on Facebook and socializing networks," commented Atiq Haneef from Afghanistan, on the Facebook page of New York Times, where the article was posted with this subject.
"You want to give 'Disclike' the 'Disclike' button," he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist from Atlanta, insisted that there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different views on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social media analyst at the eMarketer company, said it's hard to imagine that a single button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
More, it supports, the electoral campaign is approaching in America, and the "Disclike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary accepted only 70 migrants Tuesday, one of the thousands coming to the table at her southern border with Serbia, announced government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi.
Hungary has declared itself urgent during the day in two Jews along the border with Serbia because of the flow of refugees, covering a main point of crossing the border and announcing that it will build a guard at its border with Romania, DPA.
Measured back a brutal reaction from Serbia.
Even yesterday, they said they'd seal the granaries for those who want to pass, but not for those who want to ask for asylum.
"As you can see, this is completely different," said Serbian Minister for Refugees, Aleksandar Vulin.
Before the new immigration legislation was imposed, a number of 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, announced the police.
In addition, more than 170,000 immigrants from the Middle East and Africa had immigrated to Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and trying to reach the West, especially in Germany.
The "New" seat of the Judiciary Council is on foot.
Two builders, insolvent
Massive investments made here in recent years, in order to move the institution, are slowed down because they have been stopped several times.
Two important builders who worked here entered insolvency during the work.
The Jewish Council's seat on the road Vasile Aleksandri will be able to stand alone.
In one and a half years since the construction consolidation and refunctional work had to be completed, the work did not reach half.
A last stage in the construction era was spent the past days when the National Consequences Resolution Council (CNSC) rejected a complaint from the company that wanted to accept the contract for the implementation of the technical project for the work that is still to be carried out.
The initial project was launched by Impex Romcatel SA.
Following the insolvency of the builder and the interruption of the works, negotiations were demarcated without publication of an announcement of participation with Impex Romcatel, a signature to update the technical project and then to organise a new job bid.
"The negotiations did not end by contract, however, CJ, considering that the proposed form would have been weakened by the institution," Răzvan Timofcic summaries, representing the public relations in the CJ framework.
The CJ decision to interrupt direct negotiations was attacked by Impex Romcatel.
The exit court sent the complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it as late as possible.
This does not mean, however, that CJ may start looking for another projector.
Impex Romcatel has the opportunity to attack the CNSC decision at the Court of Appeal, just after a final sense of it, by taking into account the finding of another projector.
Thus, the building construction work could be resumed by the early next year.
Our intention is to resume the work as soon as possible.
In principle, the renewal of the technical project should not take much longer, but we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We expect to see whether the CNSC decision will be attacked or not," said Timofcius.
The consolidation work of the former Police case headquarters began in 2011.
A first contract of work was signed in April 2012, following the operations of 4.5 million people.
The tender was cancelled, the contract was assisted by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the firm entered into insolvency, and this contract was rejected, after payment of 1.5 million dollars was made.
The work has been done so far in proportion to approximately 50%.
Initial, consolidation, re-functional and maintenance of the building was assessed at 7.7 million.
"Come on, I'm telling you everything!" - a statement that could be criminalized by the former head of the Cadastr.
One of the employees involved in the scandalous file from the Cadastr Office signed an agreement on recognition of the facts, against amnesty imprisonment.
The most likely, his statements will criminalize the other accused, in front of the former chief Narciza Nedelcu.
A consultant from the Office of Disaster and Real Estate (OCPI) was accused of DNA in a corruption document and recognized it as a telephony.
The agreement on the recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Dascălu was signed yesterday at the Iaşi Court, which decided to give a solution in this case on 29 September.
Dumitru Daniel Dascălu was accused of continuous intellectual errors and agreed to execute two years of beatings with amnesia, as well as work in the use of the community.
With regard to Dascălu's important facts, the prosecutors stated that it, as a consultant of the Cadstur Office, together with other colleagues, "had failed to deal with more oral acceptance processes by selling contracts of service services in previous keys by O.C.P.I. Out with the administrators of SC Gausss SRL, SC Group Five SRL, SC Topo Euro Cad SRL, SC The Agency for Dastru and Topography SRL and PFA Lipsa Stephan, who denied that the services contracted were fully carried out, under conditions where they were not carried out and were not posted to O.C.C.P.I.".
The past days, former Chief of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, but also other former or current OCPI employees were sent to the trial in this file, the charges being sent to the aforementioned companies, although the work has not been carried out.
Before the trial, she's over 300,000.
Adventures in Stone Age
In the opinion of President FRH, Alexandru Dedu, Romania can only create a major handball competition in 2024, and the preparation of the National Women's Handball for the Qualification of the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
President of the Romanian Federation of Handball, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday, during a press meeting, that it is a great honour that our country has three teams in the League of Champions.
With regard to Romania's national team of women's handball, "the main goal is to qualify for the Rio Olympic Games, but for this reason it must be two stages of the winning race, first by the World Championship and second by the pre-calibration tournament," Dedu said.
We really want to qualify for the Olympic Games.
There are some fantastic demands on the part of the technical staff led by Thomas Ryde.
The staff that will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants a second trainer, a doctor, two coaches, a coach, a physical preparer, a head of delegation.
They asked us to get some things, more precise material for physical preparation, which I've never heard of.
All of this to get to the Olympic Games, and I'll do whatever it takes of me to have them.
We're talking about a massive investment, there's a lot, a lot of money.
But this is the way to make a performance.
Because at the moment we're at the time of preparation.
"The teams with which we beat us have these materials and they have some time," said Dedu, who said he was trying to get the sums needed to buy these products from MTS and COSR.
President FRH also referred to Romania's infrastructure and the possibility of our country to engage in major handball competition.
We don't have a room at Bucharest.
It is an infrastructure problem and it is crucial to be put under the flag of a European Gymnastic Championship.
Let's not forget that in other collections of the world, Olympics have been built all over a period of two years.
Before 1992, in the present Olympic zone of Barcelona was a bunch of gonoes, and now it has become a repertoire of beauty.
The same happened in London, where the 2012 Olympic organisation was successful in terms of investments.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can find a major competition," Dedu said.
He added that international handball agencies are willing to allow Romania to organise a major competition.
It is a priority for me to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Gaçu went civilized with a project, people made the agreement in principle, but they were very quick to say that the hall will never be built.
And I had discussions with EHF, we told them that we wanted to, that we were able to organize and they said that they agreed and invited them to the first game in the new room in Bucharest and then we discussed specifically.
"So we have all the openings, and at EHF and IHF, but we don't have infrastructure," the FRH official explained.
The big handballist has avoided assessing the chances of female teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach Final Four: "I have asked all trainers to be booked in forecasts, that if they don't fill up, they will be against them."
Good way to the World Cup
Romanian Russians start on 23 September, against France
The captain of the national team of rugby, Mihai Macovei, said, Tuesday, at a press conference, that all the components of the Romanian castle are ready for the games from the World Cup in England, where he hopes to get two winners: "We are ready".
Both me and my colleagues are with engines at maximum speed.
We were trained to give the best date in the four games.
Everyone will have great expectations, because our goal is to win in two games, against Canada and Italy.
All groups are gray and ours is the same.
Let's take it easy, first time with France and then we'll see.
But certainly, if we win with Canada, the game with Italy will be our end.
I can't describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, it's the celebration of so many years of work.
I don't want to disappoint anyone in the gang and come with good results at home.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like the ragby in Romania, representing the tricolor pride," Macovei said.
Romania's national team electorate Lynn Howells, who is in first experience as a coach at the World Cup, hopes to make Romanians proud of the rugby election: "It's a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup."
I'm sure players are ready to participate in the tournament.
It's an amazing experience for me.
For me it is very important that every game make the Romans proud of the national team.
The President of the Romanian Federation of Rugby, Haralambi Dumitraș, believes that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in recent years in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made on the national team.
I want the athletes to succeed, and I'm sure we'll be at the end of the event.
"These guys started playing in the Romanian teams at the age of 18-19, so there's cohesion, it's a band of friends that has fixed her to make a dream," Dumitraș said.
At the World Cup of rugby in England, Romania will evolve in Group D, having programmed the following games: with France, on 23 September in London; with Ireland, on 27 September in London; with Canada, on 6 October in Leicester; with Italy, on 11 October in Exeter.
The competition begins tomorrow, at the Twickenham Stadium in London, with the game England - Fiji in Group A.

Iasel, made of RATP controllers and a plaintiff.
Patience of a tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iaşi to visit him, but the trip ended with a terrible promise.
After the experience, neither I nor my wife will ever be able to climb into your city again.
Without it, they were struck by the irony information from the floor, by the neglect of the RAPT controllers and, bonus, by an amendment "if the law so says".
The women arrived in Iaşi a few days later, settled in a hotel in the Centre and asked for a tourist vacation.
They also received a complaint in which the RATP tracks were passed.
"Incarceration" with these papers, the wives visited Yasúl.
But two days later, found in Copou, they wanted to get to Palas Mall.
Since it was not tonked with tickets in the station near Parcul Copou, they were based on the information printed on the plate: that I can take the ticket via SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer exists.
Inflammable passengers, they moved into a bus and tried to send SMS after the instructions were given.
Unfortunately for them, he made the appearance of a team of RATP controllers.
They said there was no longer service for 2 years and that it was announced in the press that it was cancelled.
THE EU OF A LITTLE AS I KNOW WHAT IS written in the local press, am I coming with the night before I visit the city?
I talked to the controllers, I told them the situation, they said they didn't care, it wasn't their job.
The attitude was very challenging.
They said that all I can do is give us one change instead of 2 (my and my wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to shut up the day of my regular visit to the yard and I don't know what you're saying there," Ovidius says.
In conclusion, the family was amended as a result of the information generated by the plaintiff and the controllers who "implemented the law on blood".
It's not right, and I've made a seat at RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about money, I'm not exaggerated by many, but the idea is that I feel isolated.
Ghinion for Vaslui's rapists.
They had an accident and remained in a preventive arrest.
The process of the seven rapists from Vaslui was moved to the Court of Appeal yesterday.
Outlaws have tried the first term of trial in a non-public sitting in which seven young people accused of beating an 18-year-old asked to be released.
Before the very beginning of the trial sitting, one of the judges who had been assigned to the file, Viorel Munteanu, made a request for arrest, which was approved by his colleagues from the court.
The judge was active until Friday this year at the Vaslui Tribunal, where he was the president of the Section on Nale, who, on 9 April, approved a questionnaire prepared by four of the defendants, having their arrest at home.
At present, the file is judged by a whole of which is part of the Maricica Mittellu and Geta Sandu.
Previously, in the file he had written a statement by Judge Dan An ton, because his daughter was in a relationship of conjugation with one of the rapist lawyers.
The two judges decided that the Vaslui rapists would continue to remain in preventive arrest.
Your niggers will remain in prison for at least 30 days, when Jews who will re-examine their chances of being released.
The final judgment will take place at the Court of Appeal of Iaşi on October 6th.
Before reaching the Court of Appeal of Iaşi, the dub with which the violators were transported from Vaslui was involved in an accident produced in the Pacuriar, the car entering Yaşi on the corner.
The Iveco car with which the seven rapists were transporting hit a Volks van car that came out of the Canta road, and the driver tried to turn to the left.
Double circle in the end of the Easter.
The car entered Iasi here because the employees of the Prisoner Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Iasi to Grajduri, then on the corner of the centrifugal.
They've cut the road a few miles away.
Immediately after the impact, the escort of the arrests called another transport to take the hostages.
Recently, at the scene, a car was sent from the Supreme Security Court, which took the seven detainees and carried them to the Court of Appeal.
After the accident, none of the arrests were injured.
To transfer them to the other two, the guards turned the back of their cars, and the arrests went out fast, two and two.
"The incident has not been reported to the police, because the drivers of the car rental have come to terms with the damage to be paid," said Commissioner Mádălin Tăranu, under the IPJ.
Migration Marile
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what will follow.
What about Europe?
I am saying from the outset, clearly and rescinded: neither the 7000 refugees who should and should be naturalised to Romania is a significant number, but I would rather be compared to the capacity of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of approximately 1500 souls, is far beyond the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Surely, if these migrants will even agree to establish themselves in our communities, the chances of rapidly integrating them into Romanian society are extraordinary.
I'm sure they'll be the first to lose patience.
Parasite of interlops and parallelized by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves to be indispensable in all areas.
The idea of putting them in chains is just a simple example.
In addition, governments of any colour were unable to absorb European funds, make roads, buildings or schools, provide decent medical assistance, stretch the streets, create decent paid jobs, or keep their young generation home.
Why would refugees be established in another country where they are fleeing?
But what produces a lot of ambition is the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is dealt with.
First, we are struck by the whiteout of the strong EU states, which gives maximum generosity when it comes to sharing problems with smaller countries.
Then comes the terrible hypocrisy of the Romans who, although they have millions of rubies spread all over the world, do not yet accept it in another language, another religion, another blood.
Probably afraid not to steal any national property.
Finally, there is also a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although calling for only the horrors of the war as a cause of departure, do not accept the destination of the exodus other than Germany or the Nordic countries.
Or, not all refugees are Syrians, and in Pakistan there is no war.
In addition, the simple way in which the crisis is analysed can only be taken into account.
The causes must be eliminated, support one another and, focusing strictly on the political justice letter, seek peace and investment for countries of origin of migrants.
But in Romania there is peace and even more, from time to time, some foreign capital in the national economy - but this does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why are they leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has appeared to us to be anjaculated, debilitated and overstated construction.
I was disappointed that Romania is not able to invent a country project, but here the EU does not have any future plan.
And improvisation and threats do not help anything.
What, then, does the EU use, if the only advantage that Romanians enjoy - the right to free movement - could be discussed because of the values of refugees that cross borders as a flag?
At some point, the war in Syria will be over.
But not the crisis of migrants.
In the coming decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource abuse, etc. will bring millions of displaced migrants from Asia and especially from Africa to a better life.
With politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what will follow.
Seven thousand euros per year to rent the Pogor Club.
Destination, practice, tax
The tender for concession is for a period of 10 years.

EXCLUSIVE: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At 20 years he received a brave but courageous: biological parents
Lost in a hospital in the dark of the '90s, when it was only two months of life, small, sick and uneducated, and then adopted by a family established in Italy, in the same year when the adoption was regulated, an exhilarating young girl, now a blonde and beautiful girl, met with biological parents in a courthouse, after almost two decades in which no one else knew anything else.
Crina will fulfill these 20-year-old days, and her adoptive parents from Palermo thought to offer their beloved daughters a gift of parenting and courage: a visit to Romania, to Iaşi, to get to know the dark past.
"The Iron of Iaşi", which has witnessed the efforts of the family to find the origin after a few extremely vague indications, has been witness to these meetings that practically break your heart.
The reporting of reporters, the emotions of the moment, the declarations of those involved, their reactions are of moving and complex right.
The story of Crimea starts 20 years ago at Ruginoas's exit site, when she was only two months old.
Then, because of a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized in the city.
At home, there were disagreements between parents, and Mother had to leave home.
He's decided to keep the girl, and I'm supposed to be sent home.
She stopped the girl, and I haven't known anything since.
"When I found out he was in the hospital, it was too late," recalls Alina, the biological mother of the girl.
Crina was taken in with her grandmother to the local hospital in Pascani, and yet the daughter's father, Costa Rica, went to work in the city of Alexandria, Judge Teleorman.
Their veins had to disappear definitively.
They haven't found Crina in the hospital.
After the entrance, Crine's father went to work elsewhere, and returned after six months.
In the meantime, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iaşi, and the father, when he came back, found her no more.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"She would have thought she'd been abandoned," says a family fool.
Because of the financial problems, my grandmother couldn't come with Crina to Iaşi, and the girl remained in the care of doctors.
Because no one had any interest in the child's sister at all this time, she was taken by the Directorate-General for Social Assistance and Children's Protection, which then put her in the care of the Center of Plasament in Bucium.
It was years when the resignation and adoption were slightly more regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Centre was found by Italian Salvador and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but did not succeed.
They fell in love with Crina's blond place, and after some time she would definitely move with her in Italy.
The small case has already been committed for nearly two years, as long as adoption formalities have lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt that she was our daughter.
"It's like my wife would have given her life," says Salvadore, the adoptive father, while he's caught in the palm of the girl's hand.
In the country, the parents of Crane, Alina and Costa Rica continued to separate their search wherever they could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginoas, but he didn't get any answers where his child might be.
The police then sent her away as she could, but the parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I looked for her here, they told me to the Tribunal that she was taken to Italy, to Palermo.
And the conditions for looking for her were no longer me.
We prayed to God to be good.
I've been thinking about her all these years, but it wasn't possible for us to move, find her.
"It's hard," she tells us tears in the eyes of Crine's biological mother.
However, even if years have passed, the parents of Ruginoas have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvador and her wife explained to the girls where she came from and that her past was a link to Romania.
I was small when I found out.
I think I was five or six years old.
I reacted as a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to get to know my parents in Romania," Crina smiles.
And her vision is going to become reality.
In March of this year, Commissioner Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Advice Antidrug Iași, was contacted by a knowledge from Italy, which explained Salvador's desire to find the biological family of Crimea.
And the search only started by a name.
After the request we had from our Italian partners, we started the first time.
We just got a name, Balkan Costa Rica, then the locality, Ruginosa.
In the short time, I had an activity with the Prime Minister there, and I could ask if there was locally the name received.
Then they gave me some clues, just that the person found wasn't even looking.
"It lasted for about a month until we found the biological father of the girl," explains Roman chief Ichim.
In total, three months better have taken the authorities to find Costa Rica and Alina, especially that each had the house in another location.
We started the demarcations somewhere in March, and in June-July we ended the identification of biological parents and discussions.
"Then I decided that in September there was a first meeting to take place," added Romance Ichim.
In the weekend last, Alina and Costaca saw for the first time the girl lost her daughter on the hospital halls of Iaşi, 20 years ago.
The father, excited, could hardly master his tears, and his hands were shaking him unhurt.
He just changed a few words with those around him.
With a week before the meeting, I couldn't sleep too much.
It was all excited, my dear.
"To see your child after so many years, it's something," she tells us a little, she and Costa Rica from Ruginosa.
Meeting with mother and biological brothers
In his discussion with his daughter, who is going to study at a well-known university in Italy, Costa Rica Balkans told her, among others, that if she ever wanted to come back to him, she would come quietly: she could give her something, she cappulates, to find a boy from the house and to encourage a family.
Mom is and she's excited, crying, and she finds it hard to believe that such a thing can happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I didn't think something like that could happen.
I've seen such cases on TV, I've been thinking about these years, I've hoped, but I didn't think I could be like that.
They're very big emotions.
If he could forgive me.
I hope to visit us in the future.
"I hope we can keep a bond," she tells us with great tears on the works of Alina, the mother of Crine, while a servant holds his hand.
In him he hides his tears more happily, because soon he will see her daughter after such love of time.
On the other hand, Crina, who's gonna fill up over just a few days this month, 20 years old, tries to relax like an emotional child.
She doesn't know what to expect, but she got a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they're young, but now he's trying to get his thoughts together, because he's got a lot to say, but nothing to say.
My parents are two moms and two dads.
But my parents are up to the end of those who raised me.
It'll be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope I have a nice memory with them, because now there are so many things to say," Crina congratulates us.
First family meeting in Yaši
In the Union market, under the start of the fall, the Ruginoas family reunite with their daughter in Palermo.
Crina is now 20 years old, finishing her school, following the Italian school model, but she can start a new chapter with Alina and Costa, her biological parents.
No more borders or lands, just a barrier: the language.
Through which, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in the center of Iaşu has passed through easily.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first event of this kind, and that, in the future, if the occasion is more open, they will do it again.
It's the first event of this sort organized, of also emotional load, and I'm glad to be successful.
We, at the Centre, have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution dealing only with consumers, people who depend on drugs.
But we're trying to save society something good back.
"If I'm still asked for such an event, I'll do it with great honor," says Roman Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Advice Antidrug Iaşi.
In his back, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, separates.
I understand: they have a lot to say to each other.
Armistice at the foot, yesterday, at the PSD.
Everyone throws his soul
The boards from the East PSD branch have closed a gun-armed armchair.
Following subsequent rounds of discussions, held from Friday to Sunday, first being and most tense, PSD leaders agreed to suspend the hostilities temporarily.
Pressing the Executive President of the Party, Livio Dragnea, to present a single position, the outgoing social democracy will send him a full list of potential candidates to the functions of the party.
Apart from being finished, the internal war in the party seems to have taken only a break to allow the combatants to draw their souls.
The dragon didn't give a finale.
He sent a very simple and very current message under current conditions: try to find a solution to not endanger the party.
On October 3, we have a party election.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," said the prime interimar, Mihai Chirica.
The two days of the weekend discussions only led to the conclusion that nothing was established.
In the October elections, a sharp competition is expected for the role of the president of the PSD judicial branch.
The short list of potential candidates for the main function of the party's executive branch is the State Secretary Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazăr, Judge Vasile Cátea, and interim President of the Judicican Council, Victor Lupu.
This could also be added to the Prime Minister of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
A variant taken into account is also the candidate of the PSD judge councillor, Cristian Stanciu, where Lupu will no longer be enrolled, sources from the party claiming that it is not interested in function.
The only name that has been mentioned by none of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is the former branch leader, Prime Minister Gheorghe Nikita.
List of candidates is open.
According to the statute, including on the election day, candidates may be sent, and they would not look at anyone if it happened.
"It's important that we remain united, and we will remain after 3 October, when we have a new Executive Office, a new Judiciary Permanent Bureau and all the new leadership structures," Catea explained.
Until the internal elections are organised, the leadership of the PSD judicial branch will be ensured by Victorl Lupu, a close friend of Nikita and Stancius.
However, the Lupu is granted until 29 September, the preparation of the elections following practice to be ensured by the Executive Secretary of the branch, Judge Mihail Popescu, located in the network of Nikita Hospitals.
Phone contact, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the discussions in recent days as leading to "participal consent".
There is a wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
It reached a partial consensus, in the interest of the support of a Uniting Team to deal with the case.
"We, on the other hand, have more options about the candidates' intentions for the PSD Iaşi presidency, the list remains open," Stanciu commented.
An exit judge rejected the files of the rapeists in Vaslui for concubinage
The seven young people in Vaslui's court condemned for violence come to the Court of Appeal today.
The prisoners sentenced to imprisonment between five and eight months and eight years and four months will present their arguments for their release today, after the Court of Justice of Vaslui has determined their imprisonment immediately after the sentence has been pronounced.
The file was registered at the Court of Appeal last week, Judge Dan Anton making a request for a petition of resignation, approved by his colleagues.
Anton called on the fact that one of the prosecutors, attorney Bogdan Luca, is his daughter's conjugation, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca protects Silviu Ovidiu Burada, the one who received the greatest punishment in this file.
How the Sentitors Reasoned
At the end of the last week, the Judge of the Vaslu Court who condemned the seven young people moved the sentence.
The judge argues on the challenging reaction of the perpetrators, but also on those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation within the public opinion.
"The Court finds that, after the time of the imposition of the preventive measure of judicial control, restrictive measures of liberty and not privacy, under the influence of the attitude of the perpetrators, families and local supporters of them, a strong sense of indignation at the local and national level as regards the fact that persons accused of serious facts are judged under a less restrictive measure," states the motivation of the Vaslui Court.
In addition, the magistrates have also deposed the main defence of the seven defendants who during the trial called for the fact that the girl they had raped would not be "a door of church".
"The Court underlines that the moral quality of the convicted person is not relevant, the aspect of which the offenders wanted to demonstrate by their defences, since a person's physical and sexual freedom cannot be violated under any pretext," it further states.
Corbin, Brexit and the future of Europe
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed in the last ten years cannot continue the same in the following years.
By 7:00 a.m., maybe a few people in Romania knew who Jeremy Corbyn was.
Even today, even after he became the new leader of the British Navy Laburist Party, many ask what measures can affect us to choose a politician who, after all, is not in a position to make a decision.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical left-wing leader of post-war workers.
Marxist, an anti-monarhist (and then Tony Blair, then prime minister, asked him to expel a royal family from Buckingam Palace), an anti-American ferocian and a sympathetic Vladimir Putin (he was also invited to comment on political events by the Russian television channel "Today"), and of the terrorist movements Hizbollah and Hamas, he wanted the British to give up nuclear weapons and escape from NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who at that time considered Osama bin Laden's murder to be a true tragedy, ISIS is almost preferable to the United States.
According to the model of all popular democracies, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things like those he said and promised them and Tsipras in Greece until he gave up on the real world and economic legitimacy.
The economic programme of the new Laburist leader provides, inter alia, massive renationalisations and the printing of money as a solution to the financing of development projects and to cover very generous social benefits.
Of course, some might wonder why the solution to the printing of money is not unanimously adopted on the globe, I then have a global prosperity! but who will stop such details.
Of course, we can avenge their blood on the banks, you become a kind of enemy of the service of the left, but as it has been seen so often in the past, not only in the former Communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of Mitternand and Holland's mandates.
The additional amounts are quickly absorbed by generous promises, without covering, made by popular demagues.
As Margaret Thatcher well drew attention, "the problem of socialism is that at some point the other money ends."
At least I'm giving Jeremy Corbyn the real chance that he'll ever reach prime minister.
At the beginning of the 1980s another left radical leader, Michael Foot, who at any rate was not as extreme in beliefs as the party's leader's predecessor, failed to vote.
And then there is still a working class in the British Sea, in the classic sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were more influential than they are now.
Under the new industrial country, in which services are dominant in the collective labour force, and extensive automation has made it necessary for the industry to have a mass of highly qualified work, Corbyn's return has limited appeal.
But even from opposition, it can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In its final financial number, Corbyn's election increases the chances of Brexit, respectively, for the release of Brittany from the EU.
The new Labour Leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership in the Union.
In the eyes of Brussels radicals, it is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalization that has imposed the austerity of the poor.
When you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by radical right, with anti-immigrant rhetoric and look at the crisis of refugees who disappear from the EU background, you reach an explosive mix.
And not just for the Great Britain.
However, if the British decide after the referendum, which would take place by 2017, to leave the Union a symbolic loss of capital for the whole European project and the deep gaps created within this Euro crisis and therefore the refugees, between the North and the South, between the East and the West, leave room for the most worrying scenarios.
As much as for a whole series of Member States, London was a counter-attack to the French-German axis (in any case Berlin becomes the dominant actor).
It is true, the British business environment, City, are powerful lawyers of the country's stay in the EU.
But Europe today is no longer the last one.
There are many sensations, which grow in intensity even in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, I've just recently had a sample in Jean Claude Junker's speech, tends to make major decisions on the head of the majority of Member States by consulting just a few European powers, especially Germany.
And this happens under conditions where electoral support for anti-system training, anti-immigrants at the same time, and Eurosceptics, is growing spectacular throughout the continent.
In other words, the emotional climate with negative charge has reached levels higher than in the past.
From where and the conclusion that financial Times draws it when assessing Brexit's chances.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that leaves national interest.
If the voters will make the decision, then the British Sea will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in current politics.
But Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we will be involved in a more pronounced integration of the euro area, which will push most of the countries in the region and the environment of interest and at that of the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Siriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States feeds its popular retort of the frustrations accumulated in Western societies.
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed in the last ten years, the general social benefits can no longer continue in the following years.
Under the explosive pressure of the double crisis, the euro area - immigration, both caused by harsh decisions that have not been taken in the calculation except for integrationist political ambitions, not and the ability and availability of European peoples and governments to respond to such challenges, continent-wide disturbances, internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and may affect Romania's situation.
And it's hard to exclude something from the point of view of the possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to face such complex situations.
Constantin Brancusi, hell of a country.
Rockefeller, "How can I help you?"
Brancuus, "Take and destroy the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to be famous, to hear about him all over the world.
But behind his fame, something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories are delivered, networks for success in life.
That thing has a name.
It's called "work."
What do you write about Constantin Brancusi?
What else is to say, actually?
His picture appeared on the banknote.
And, recently, a known bank in Romania hired an actor to play it in a advertising clip.
Whites produce and deliver money for nearly 60 years since it's no longer within us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and bulevards that bear their name.
Also, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he gets out of the garden, he hears the following instructions: "We're going to the park, to the Brancusi."
The country is replaced by its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known from such a world, from children, to adults.
The capacity to infiltrate Brancusi is enormous.
Nor did the communists succeed in putting him out of Romania's memory and culture.
Its cities today cover the Internet, with hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And, then, again, what else would it be to say, to write about this man?
Visiting from the pile of books and articles that try to rebuild their destiny, Brancus's life seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
You know, these are the people who tell you that, if you didn't have the chance to be born in a big city and in a family as strong as it is, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
Brancusi's life is a perfect example.
And maybe here would be a key.
Maybe we should start the next text from here.
In a sense, they're any more disgusting than they are.
Look at the real success stories, which are delivered daily in newspapers and on television.
Watch this man's face carefully.
Do you want to know how to live, how, today, he heard a whole map?
It's simple.
He worked his whole life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin Brancusi was born on February 19, 1876, in Hobija, a small village in the municipality of Peštişani, Judge Gorj, in the Carpathies.
He's the fifth child of Marie and Radu Nicolae Brancusi.
Although it comes from a family of supported countries, Brancusi leads a modest life, but one of them had to work together the reindeer that will guide his art vision later.
Recalling the childhood and the places in which he grew up, the artist had to witness, in a meeting with Peter Tuucia from Paris in 1933: "By then life was beautiful and harmonious."
Of the thousands, people went, happy, a patriarchal life.
Everything went quiet from one anomaly to the other.
And you know why things changed?
The civilization of the great city has reached us.
But Brancusi's childhood was far from an idyllic.
One of the moments spent in these first years of life is extremely suggestive for the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future of the sculptor years spent in the native village.
The moment is played in the work "Brancusi. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantine Brancusi was three years old.
In the fall of that year, when the term "the house", followed by those who cut the liquid to see if the process is being carried out properly, Brancusi takes a moment of general neglect.
Fill in the search of the palm trees and drink unspoiled.
He fell asleep almost instantaneously.
The first people watch just a few minutes.
Mom gets in panic, then she gets pregnant, believing her son's dead.
In the evening, when the father, Radu, comes back from life with tears, he sees the desperate signs of those waiting for him with his breath in his mouth.
The party is turning into a jäle immediately.
Dad's already thinking about the funeral.
However, someone finds that it's good to call Baba Brendousa, Bronchoa, and Brancusi's servant.
Brenduša checks the baby's breath, then puts it under the horse-ball nose, gathered from the front.
The baby's strong.
The world's falling apart.
While the boy is allowed to go further away from drinking, with joy, the party with laurels continues with more strength.
The second day, the father and the son meet by live.
Radu Brancusi put Constantin to collect some new ones and bring them.
The father is like his son with his head down and, with the bridesmaids brought up by the boy, beat him to keep his mind in mind.
And, while he feels the noise of the strikes, the little Brancus has the revelation that the world can be seen and from a different perspective and that the things around it can appear tense.
In particular, the position of the sun, different from that of the well-known one, makes him wonder how old he would be if no star himself would participate in his suffering.
Was the sun just as troubled as his father of what happened to them?
At present, the city does not function
A parliamentarian calls politicians to remind themselves of those who voted for them.
Independent Member Viorel Blăjuț called on PSD and PNL to stop internal wars and to redirect their agenda to the election.
What we now see on our political scene is a great disappointment and so on.
I haven't seen any of the 2012 USL projects that will continue.
Nor the highway, nor the Regional Emergency Hospital, you see only how politicians debate their wide range of concerns.
Let's get a little out of politics, get together and talk.
At present, the city is not working.
"If you're occupied with the internal war, you don't have time for those who have chosen you," Blajuch said.
He appreciated that the current political class rejected the outgoing electorate, the result being a very low presence in the future local elections, around 30%, representing practically the faithful electorate of the parties.
The honourable Member also considers that voters will all go to traditional parties, expressing themselves to new political initiatives, as is the "Pentru Iaşi" party that will be launched today.
The local parties have very little chance and will do nothing but break out of the right electorate, not the PSD.
This kind of game is based on active civil people, who are usually right.
"It's also more fair, which's not good for anyone, nor for PSD," said Blajuch.
He stated that he was not interested in a candidate at the future local elections, letting his vote on his intention to attend the Spring.
I said I don't want to run any local functions.
I'm still wondering if you're going to continue as a member in future terms.
I tried to appeal to the unit for Iaşi and in the debate on the floor with the other parliamentarians, and I was accused of wanting to make an image.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this anymore.
"If people voted for us, it doesn't mean they're stupid to vote for us if they don't see anything," Blajuz said, who appreciated that the main reason that the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the voters.
A colleague from Tatarashi said he's not getting his money and he's got to go with the bus.
Let's not be hypocrites.
It's not a little money.
Sometimes it's hard for me to raise money from the castle.
At the end of the term of office, I will report on all I have spent, outside the salaries of the staff members and their maintenance.
It happened to rise in a month and 30,000 shens, with all the transportation, housing and others.
"To tell a parliamentarian that I don't get the money is a clean hypocrisy," he concluded.
