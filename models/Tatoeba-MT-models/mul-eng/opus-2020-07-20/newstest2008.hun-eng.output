European inflation has been cut down in food
The rapid inflation rate in the euro area is mainly due to the rise in food prices.
The price increase in November was higher than expected in the 13 countries of the euro area, with a 3.1 percent annual inflation recorded after the 2.6 percent of October, according to the Union’s Luxembourg statistical office.
The official announcement confirmed only 3 percent - said Bloomberg.
Unlike the European Central Bank (ECB), the United Kingdom and the Canadian Bank did not want to be based on the base, saying that the reduction would lead to the creation of an inflationary spirit with increasing profits and unemployment.
The ECB has two percent, but it would like to keep the rate of inflation close.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in its second chapter: "You must speak up" inflation so that it will not have to take action later on this subject.
In Germany, the November inflation rate is 3.3 per cent for 12 years; in Spain, it increased by 3.1 per cent.
Eurozone inflation has been high in the food and energy sectors.
The deadlines have increased by 88 percent, and the price of the term has been the highest since 1973.
Food and dairy products should also be paid more substantially in 2007.
The world price for oil has increased by 52 percent this year, and in the past month, it has grown to almost $100 a quarter of gold.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 rose by 2.5 percent from 2.1 percent of the time, but by 2009 it has fallen to 1.9.
The 12-month inflation rate is estimated to be around 3% in the next 3-4 months, but the average annual rate will be 2.1%.
At the same time, it is expected that the ECB will double its thresholds during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
The Fides' support circle has grown significantly since the beginning of December, so since 2002, there has been the largest team, while Gallup has not yet reached this low, 13 percent socialist support.
For certain parties, the difference - due to the greater diversity of opposition voters - would mean more than two-thirds (71 percent) aid against MSZP's total (20 percent) aid.
MDF and SZDSZ, according to the survey, are under Parliament's auspices: two percent of the aid in the whole population is available.
There are more than one hundred supporters of both teams among the votes cast.
The economic gap is still high in terms of the previous midpoint - it has never been as high as 41 percent of those who have been judged to be extremely poor in terms of the country's economic situation, while another 46 percent say that the situation is likely to be worse.
The family’s own material situation is now being judged in a more pessimistic manner after the more desperate and desperate appearances of the sheep and goats.
For the next year, the larger parts of the population will be reduced by further rotation and only ten improvements.
In December more than any earlier survey by the Gallup, 71 percent of the respondents considered that the Prime Minister was worse than the Minister's job was done well.
In Yarksány Ferenc, 13 percent of the respondents are trusted or very trusted, while 38 percent of Orbán Viktorn's supporters are supported.
In the head of government, 54 percent are not trusted at all, 27 percent are in the President of the Federation.
One indicator of the political situation is how many parts of society think it can be dealt with without a change in government.
As long as 35 percent of the government and the head of government have maintained their wish after October's arrests, this rate has now been only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) has only seen the solution in the new elections.
It is of interest to the referendum that 60 percent of the respondents answer the question of the question of participation in question, which would certainly go away and another 20 percent would say it would probably go away.
As a comparison, only 55 percent would participate in a "separate national election" and another 15 percent would be likely to participate. The outcome of the referendum would not be a question on the basis of current interests.
The studies were 74 people, 79 visits, and 84 percent told me about the hospital's Sunday.
If we are sure to see participants in the referendum around the same rates, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters will be required to introduce students, nurses and hospital staff.
The most precious of the Auchan, nearly five times the Tesco.
In the Bulgarian trade trade, the hypermarkets maintained an average price increase of 16 percent, in contrast with the fact that the prices did not increase this year.
Article of the Economics of the Day
This year it also increased by 16 percent in the Buddhist trade three times to the traditional Christmas cup of the Napi, but in each hypermarket, there has been an increase of over a thousand forint.
Since prices in food stores have already been "sustained" in December, so there has been no more than a percentage of a dramatic drop in prices for the former high base.
However, it is obvious to the consumers that what they could do well during a total of nine thousand for now is not even worth ten thousand.
In the case of the Napi, at least 91 for the abovementioned hypermarkets, the limit was exceeded by 10 fortnight.
And the highest score was 10,573.
(In 2003 the cart was moved to 6800 fort.)
The price of Unicum and the living death was almost at the top of the tavern, but he was deeply attracted to the pukyamelle, the diocese and the mace.
KSH's data were followed in the shops at the bar and at the market price, we might have found a kilogram test for 139 for the Auchan.
The competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 fort.
At the same time, it was surprising in this business that the double-repudiation pancakes Coca-Cola price was under 200 fort, so with its bets, only 257 Forints were requested for the product.
Together with this, however, this year, Auchan showed himself to be the most sweetest in the sunglasses of the day, while Cora was the most expensive.
According to our estimates, the average Christmas prices are the Cora 15, while Tesco and Auchan increased prices in the Napi basin by approximately 18-18 percent.
The lowest rate and the lowest rate of time were 12 percent of the difference, while the lowest rate of time was 21 percent between the highest rate of time.
In Forint there was an average of 1480 growth.
The average price increase was due to 1206 fora, so that during the past Christmas season, it had an effect on the prices of the price increase.
In fact, this process has led to trade, which appears to have not been able to convince businesses how much prices they use for a product, which would have been able to calculate the impact of the change on consumption.
(If a product's marketing speed is wrong and the trader is planning a serious advantage in the price adjusted for marketing incentivation.)
The price was so high that the price price for the Napi basin was higher than the 2006 price for 1720, while the lowest was only 844 for the price difference.
This was not shown today because the most expensive 1630 was more than usual, and the lowest was 1284.
In combination with the two Christmas season, catastrophical prices increased by less than 30 percent over 20 months, the daily consumption items in the hypermarkets were expensive.
(In other words, this does not necessarily verify the data of the KSH: more than 30 percent increase in prices for certain essential foods within 12 months of the statistical office.
For example, in addition to the leaves on the eggs.)
According to the daily rate, this appears to be almost improbable, as the average price price of the product is probably higher than that of the lowest case of almost 10 percent.
Liste transporters, according to the signs, are in a stronger position than the farmers, the dramatic increase in prices has also been achieved in many.
In the trade fair, the hippies don't complain, they're constantly counting on a good year.
We have found that in the three companies requested, prices are no longer of interest to the buyers.
They're buying lots of money from everything. They're taking the long-distance food.
Before noon, all three shops were set up for the money because the number of visitors grew rapidly.
But we know that in rural areas, more and more people are complaining about the fact that there is more to the research firms that the income will remain, not just food, but sustainable consumer products.
In many places they're spraying on the wound-proofing tools
More than a thousand infections have been registered in hospitals, mainly due to the misuse of antibiotics.
The health conditions of hospitals, the frequency of beds, the prevalence of personnel are not preferable to the prevention of infections, is the principal doctor of the National Epidemiology Centre.
There's a lot of places to store on the wound-up tools.
A recent MRSA infection was diagnosed in the János Hospital Traumatological class.
A man infected after a serious accident has been shown to be an antibiotic bacteria.
The patient was separated.
A similar infection occurred at the beginning of the year.
A serious car accident was allowed to come home from the hospital, but it was soon to be returned with an MRSA infection and has not been able to perform an important operation since the bacterium in its body.
This year, from 10 December to 1094, a multi-resisting hospital infection was reported to the National Nosocomialis Survey System, said the National Epidemiological Center, Böröcz Karolina, head of the National Epidemiological Center.
This means that these multiple-resistance patients have definitely registered the infection in their hospitals, which they do not know about.
For approximately two-thirds of the infections, MRSA, namely Methylline-oxacillin resistance, caused Staphylococcus aureus.
Staphyloccus aureus (SA) bacteria are spread by humans without one third of their skin in order to cause the disease.
The infections caused by SA (e.g. torturing, mandating, skin infections, infections) are well reactive to antibiotics, good medicine.
However, if antibiotics are used in excess or inadequately, a highly antibiotic bacteria that is highly resistant to antibiotics are developed, which quickly spreads among inappropriate medical conditions.
In most cases, the immune system may cause serious medical infections in patients with mild, age or low body weight, such as infection or bleeding.
According to the medical director of the János Hospital, there is nothing special about the MRSA infection, such infections are associated with day-to-day practice in hospitals.
The infection must not be combined with the virus, MRSA just isn't there, said Nyulasi Tibor, where they don't study the presence of the disease.
Immune antibiotics
"We separate such patients, the disabled person sees the patient in rubber and mask, and they have appropriate antibiotics for their treatment," said Nyulasi Tibor.
Patients entering the hospital are being tested to see if the MRSA is present in their organisations, but it is not always possible to cause infection.
You don't admire the pattern.
Most of the hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but current home hospital conditions and conditions do not favor the development and spread of multi-resistency patients, says Böröcz Karolina.
After this infection has occurred in hospitals, in elderly patients, patients should be monitored for implants and patients treated with MRSA should be immediately separated.
In Hungarian hospitals, however, there is no magic with microbiological samples.
This also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these studies.
In most cases, if there is a significant MRSA infection in the patient, he told the principal doctor of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine and home guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapy, i.e. microbiological studies, should be carried out to prevent resistance to medicinal products, but hospitals do not keep this at all times.
The microbiological models are even more rare in the diagnosis of the disease, or in the background, published by Böröcz Karolina.
Spores in the Wetlands
Scientific evidence proves that MRSA is one of the patients, usually by directing health personnel to the other.
For this reason, the use of handwashing, the use of masks is very important, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals.
However, it is not always possible to distinguish patients who have been infected from patients who have been infected with MRSA, who are in contact with you.
In fact, patients should be at least 1.5 metres away from each other from their beds, often very close to each other.
Unfortunately, the experience has also shown that Böröcz Karolina has been exposed to infectious diseases in hospitals that are in poor material conditions, with fewer livers, many patients, and even more likely to develop infections.
According to Böröcz Karolina, where appropriate precautions are taken, there may be less such infection or may be an additional spread of cancer.
Government program against MRSA
The treatment of the MRSA infection causes serious expenses to health assurances, so they fight against each other.
In England, for example, the government programme included the prevention of or reduction of MRSA.
According to the signs, the program is successful, based on public data, showing a reduction in the trend of MRSA infections in England.
The priorities of the European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) include the establishment of multi-resistance patients (including MRSA) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by such patients.
He wasn't part of the head of the police officer responsible for the murder.
The official expert opinion was drawn up on the death penalty caused by the Chief of Police of the District of XXII.
It can be said that he would have been led here or in a state of emergency by the local police officer of the 21st century, who had himself been killed by a lawyer, told Morva Attila, the Chief Justice's spokesman, after having prepared an expert opinion on this matter.
The expert opinion supported the initial investigation result, which already established that the former chief of police had not used alcohol before sitting behind the table.
In the 21st district of Kossuth Lajos, the head of the capital of the capital of the province of XXII, the head of the Akori district, took an interest in a 55-year-old man who did not want to cross the road on his own behalf.
(The latter, because the driver did not pass through the bridge, otherwise an unfavourable situation, should also be given priority by the driver.)
He lost his life after being transferred to the hospital.
As a result of the incident, the local police officer asked him to leave his post and ask him to remain calm, according to the police report, because he was so upset.
In the case, the Republic of Budapest has continued its investigation.
Morva Attila also found that the former chief of police cooperated with the investigation's investigations from the outset.
More than EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Three, with a total of EUR 400 million, education, transport and environmental infrastructure and a credit agreement supporting energy, have been signed in Budapest by Veres Janos Minister of Finance and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
The European Development Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental protection projects financed from cohesion support in 2006, from which 100 million credit contracts have already been concluded by the parties, the now signed contract on the use of EUR 200 million remaining.
The education-related projects also serve to finance the budget agreement of EUR 150 million.
The EIB has granted total EUR 300 million to Hungary for this purpose, the use of the remaining EUR 150 million later, may result in the extension of the credit agreement.
In the area of innovation, EUR 50 million have been signed by the Parties, which are primarily used for the Debrecen Union research development project.
The conversation also took place on the 4th meter.
They agreed that when Hungary completes the details of the metre financing with the EU, it will come back to whether and how the original contract should be amended.
According to Veres János, this can happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has co-financed 113 projects with EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The EIB shall grant credit to EURIBOR with an 8-year duration and availability without prejudice to its obligations.
Bulgaria EU Property Paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market - the whole of Europe's attention to the Balkan country mentioned earlier.
What, where and who buy the EU is still the most expensive but quickly expensive market?
Analysis of the division of the Re/Max Bulgarian.
In addition, Bulgaria, with cheap apartments and seaside houses, is now the most important destination for the purchase of Eastern-European real estate.
Among the mountains are the most beautiful areas of Bansko, Borovec, Pamproto and Vitosa, and Albena, the "Aranypart", the "Napospart", the ancient Szopol and Nessebár, but are still looking for property around Kavarna and the Baltics.
According to the analysis of Re/Max Bulgaria, the central part of the country will also raise the interest of investors - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and will also buy more and more in the cheap Russian environment.
The capital city, Sofia, has a high level of opportunity, commercial and office services promise the highest recovery.
Bulgaria is the best route on its way to become one of the most prosperous European golf paradises, so it will be a long-term road goal in addition to the summer and summer season for the other two years.
For this reason, forward investors are already buying large enough, for example around Banszko.
Researchers say that buyers who buy property in Bulgaria live the same way, and they also spend their lives changing our way of life.
Most buyers are English, but they come from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
The capital and Cypriot investors are also present, and in the Black Sea and the Siparadics there are usually many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers can be divided into three groups - says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
The entrants or refurbished properties are purchased at between EUR 50 and EUR 100 thousand, or destroyed by old houses for EUR 5-15 thousand, and will be reimbursed.
They require good proximity and communication opportunities, important to us as a city, business and usually the local doctor's approach.
The second category is the skirmisher (Bulgaria set out in December for the first 10 German holiday destination list).
The third group is set up by the business target investors who purchase in favour of medium or long-term valuation.
The destruction of capital property is ongoing, as the search continues to grow stronger.
In the European Union, the largest in Bulgaria is property, but in the last five years, 21 percent have grown.
The increase in the assets is essentially beyond the pace of the payments.
Fodor and the six hundred Hungarians
According to the Minister for Environment and Water Affairs, Mr Fodor Gábor said that experts would like to conclude their negotiations on the post-2012 international climate crisis negotiations after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from the 192 countries of the world will discuss the Bali Utitervre, which will be available for efforts to reduce the time limit set by the Kyoto Protocol by 2012.
There is now a debate on this in the developed and developed countries.
The United States has also indicated that it does not currently want to deal with accurate figures, although it is the agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 percent by 2020 compared with the 1990s.
Another big question is whether developed countries are involved in reducing emissions, in addition to providing both material and technological assistance to developing countries.
The agreement was also drawn up on the support granted to the developing countries.
The support base on which the Kyoto Protocol provides will be managed by 16 members of the Governing Council, expected to be read in the Market and profit of the ENSZ Global Environmental Protection Foundation (GEF).
Hungary 6 percent
On behalf of Mr Fodor Gábor, Minister for Environment and Water Affairs, the EU is supporting the EU's efforts to preserve its role in global climate protection efforts and to promote the establishment of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU is able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % by 2020, regardless of the success of the post-2012 Convention, and is ready to undertake almost 30 % measurement, if the world's other major developed areas and developing countries are also willing to fulfil their responsibilities and capabilities.
Fodor Gábor pointed out that, in 1997, all countries contributing to the Kyoto Protocol had a 5.2 percent reduction, with a minimum of 8 percent in the EU - then 15 more Member States.
Hungary's 6 per cent greenhouse gas emission assessment is due to the period 1985-87 to be carried out at home. - Remember the Department of Environmental Protection's press release.
In fact, Balin has to be underpinned for two years by a long-term international climate agreement, and in particular its entry into force after 2012, in this case, the reduction companies under the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately follow the new international emission reduction system required by the IPCC in its latest report on climate change, the ENSZ Nobel Prize, and the international scientific bodies.
This reduction in emissions would be delayed and would prevent an increase of 2 Celsius above the Earth average, which, according to scientists, is due to extremely serious and irreversibly adverse consequences.
Welcome to YouTube
They publish recordings of Iraqi and Afghan actions by British military units, which make themselves popular.
Firstly, British Air Force (RAF) received YouTube: special features in Afghanistan have been videotaped since March 2006 on their anti-talibo actions - the BBC reported.
They are being checked by the Air Force Commander of the Miniature, which has been prepared with a love camera, and will be sent to London, where their homes are sold on the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
More than 75 of the aircraft's troops have already been posted in this form on the Internet, and their "crowds" have been viewed in this way.
The British Ministry of Defence, "defenceheadquatters", was registered in October 2007, and all Iraqis, all of them in Afghanistan, have videos, while the British Ministry of International Affairs and the International Security Council (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Entry into Afghanistan
According to the original purpose of the air carrier, he set up the videos for heating, and according to the Ministry of Defence, it is also good to know the real purpose of the military's foreign presence with the general community.
At the level of propaganda published in this form, there is nothing to do with traditional television broadcasts - the BBC's defence expert Gordon Mackenzie has announced - but it is unlikely that some political message will be delivered, as it is in its own form that it demonstrates the existence of military actions by the government.
The Americans made a game
Soldiers are also concerned that, in addition to carefully adjusted, censored recordings, amateur videos are also directed at the division, which also portrays the death of soldiers: the little representative, "principal" propaganda films are the same as the purest talk about the losses, but they do not show the blood side of the fight.
A number of videos have already appeared on the Internet from the Iraqi and Afghan army, which has been made available on live inputs, but the British army has only recently received it.
The Americans are in a somewhat different way, free-of-charged America's Army with shooting games, which can also fall into the skin of the soldiers under a more-than-life symphony.
Will be a prize for heating and cooling in the ministry
The Minister of Labour Lamperth Monika does not seem to be sensitive: he will have a yearly job interview instead of a Christmas party for his employees, who can thank him for his coffee and coffee since 2007.
For you, a ministry where life will be brought to an end, you'll have a Christmas song with a symbol and a coccicence in the hearts of officials.
Buli, Christmas music, concerts and swindles - so is power.
They're ready for Christmas, too.
The largest regular Ministry of Christmas party is held by the defence team this year, but the HM is not expected by the Ministry's employees.
In Czarvák, the children of the wounded soldiers receive a gift, and the families of the soldiers serving in foreign missions are invited to the mission, but they are also conducting media acceptance.
The target is 25 million to the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NIF) and the Ministry of Economic and Monetary Affairs (GCM) shall be responsible for other matters.
The GKM budget is held in the Future House, totalling 4,320,000 foreclosures, and the six hundred ministerial workers are expected to receive three hundred guests.
At the party, they'll be stuck in the Christmas ring, but they'll be thrown in the bells and bells.
The NFU’s prize was 4,700,000 forts, and the National Service Council (OIT) was also held on Sundays and on Saturdays.
The earthquake took place at a million times, and more than four hundred invitations were spent on the remaining part.
We know that one of the NFU's classes is also official for another Christmas event: this is a bidder company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre, from the EU budget.
For this purpose, the building of the House of Commons was built.
The information on the MAG Zrt was not confirmed because we failed to achieve the mission.
You don't have to wear clothes
The ILO building not only visited the NFU but also the Ministry of Justice and Management, which held Luca Day instead of Christmas on 7 December.
They didn't ask for money for the use of OIT terms.
Five hundred people took part in the ball.
The party started with the Minister's thanks, and he could dance in front of the evening.
[Origo] was informed of the question: the ball was not obliged to wear night clothing or clothing at all.
The health, work and government business are being held in Puritan district.
The Ministry of Health organises workshops and festivals in its own building for 400 000 for workers.
However, the Minister of Labour, Lampert Monika, is officially not a Christmas holiday, but is looking forward to working for a year's end.
Hundreds of guests are told that they will only get coffee and cheese at the press station, bringing the party out of 350,000.
On the other hand, the Minister of State of Bajani Gordon is simply going to work with his staff under the Ministry of Government and Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is in its own large territory with 436 employees waiting for it.
Every weekend there are 2500 Forints for the Christmas party - in the amount of a protective reception and a coccient man.
Amióta Veres János is the minister who celebrates PM's work every year.
But it will not be Bulihangula, not only is the Minister speaking, but it also strengthens the day-to-day.
On 20 January, the field of agricultural production was renewed, the Ministry's Christmas remains.
The reception is held in Vajdahunyad, Városligt, and according to the report, they have 1000 Forints per head of the 100 guests.
According to the press, this will be a very simple adoption, for which only foreign diplomats accredited to Hungary are official.
They begin with the Minister's short-term approvals every year and end with a re-examination.
At the same time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture did not hold a Christmas party - they announced it to [orgo] in their own media.
The price of the official Christmas Christmas in the environmental area could not be explained on the press.
In each case, more than four hundred men were invited to attend the festival held in the Museum of Art.
The strengths of the giant strikes together
On Friday, the Joint Committees of the League of Trade Organizations and the National Association of Labour Unions will be formed to coordinate the weekly, non-permanent, time-limited strata.
Szombaton holds a large meeting, on Monday - on the day of the closure of the health insurance law - and begins with the cancellation of work.
The operation will certainly result in a significant delay in the transport, since the rail transport will be fully stopped and will be withdrawn by the BKV for up to 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the Union's trade unions will know the details of the weekly strata organized together with the National Federation of Workers.
The LIGA - MOOSZ Strategy will also be launched, which will coordinate the weekly actions.
Szombaton holds a large meeting, and from a week to a week, organisations that join the streets are forced to work for an hour without a decision if they cannot reach agreement with the government.
This means that they did not mark the date of the end of the initial strikes on the day of the parliamentary vote on health insurance law.
If the National Assembly has not yet adopted the Health Insurance Act, the organisations shall immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
However, if the legislation is adopted, the Committees of the Regions will join and decide to proceed.
On the basis of the weekly calendar of the National Assembly, it is also possible to imagine that the health insurance law will only be voted in the late summer, perhaps at night.
There are significant delays in transport due to the beginning of the week's strikes: work on the train is delayed for an unlimited period of time, while a part of the Cuban mass movement can be stopped before the end of the week, more than a part of the Volanian governments.
At the same time, there will be a number of sidewalks in the country.
A number of organisations and civil organisations have been associated with the call for aliens, and their list is constantly updated on the day of the League.
Some organisations have been marked for an unprecedented period of time, others have been forced to leave their jobs.
Up to the south, the Free Trade Organisation (VDSZZZ) has not been able to stand up for sufficient service, and they are on their way closer to Christmas celebrations.
According to business reports, between 7 and 9 in the morning and 9 in the BKV, four introductory strategists of the LIGA Villamos and Héernergia-industrials, 2 and 2-8 hours at the Pedagogues and the Pedagogues Democratic Services.
The Hungarian Medical Association has a second warning strategy for the Health and Social Sector for the SZEF in a country with a changed time frame.
The four requirements adopted by the League are the most important for the government to restore the extension of health insurance reform and to forgive social debate for a new concept.
The second requirement is to progressively introduce a new method of accounting for the coming year.
The third is to ensure that high-risk pensions are already available before 2010 for the possibility of access to the system by relevant employers.
The fourth point is that the Free Trade Organisation (VDSZZ) of the Russian Federation does not accept the offer for rail sources by the Ministry of Economics and Transport.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard has increased the risk of the country
With the support of Mr Mozgalom for Hungary in August this year, the activities of Magyar Guarda also increased the political risk of Hungary and the area according to the Political Capital Risking Division (Rish Analysis Division).
The company's "risk warning" wrote that, in connection with the Hungarian Guard activity, the biggest political risk is that "the existing ethnic tension between the Chinese and non-Cycian communities of Hungary can be reduced to a short period of time, with even strong ethnic ties."
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy, in the view of its policy strategy, has led to the research institution to promote such action.
As it has been written, all Hungarian political actors can return to the top: "the public debate in Rome has been handed over to representatives of radical and extensive political groups who could build a policy strategy against the cycanist propaganda".
This deepens the problem, prevents normal conversation, strengthens the gap, and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activity of the Magyar Guarda for the impact of major home and international media coverage "was significantly affected by the foreign image from Hungary, mainly by the country's stability and democratic development".
It was recalled that since 2006 there has been a growing public and well-being reorganization of the Hungarian radical and exploding groups that have become part of Hungary's reorganization of more and more "national self-defence" groups than in Hungary since 2007.
"The joint appeal of these massacres to define themselves as a civil organisation while their members are openly reporting on the preparation of defence tasks (catastrophophobic, defence, defence) to the police, the military, or the state's inadmissibility" was added.
It was noted that all of this is in accordance with the method which combines the different political elements of society's political and political resistance to civilisation.
The emphasis on civilisation and the uniformity of the form of the judicial record are therefore not only a matter of rejecting the legal texts of the Court of Justice, but also a political strategy.
According to the study, the activity of Magyar Garda is also a risk factor in relation to proximity.
"In the last few months, several neighbouring countries have also turned into potential sources of danger to the Hungarian Guard, and some neighbouring countries want to prove their own anti-engagement policies to the Hungarian Guard.
Everyone can take the political stability of the territory," they added.
According to the research institute, the restructuring of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique feature in Eastern Europe, so political risks have increased in view of the whole area.
As it was written, for example, the operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, which were notified by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
Under the Bulgarian guard’s attack, there are numerous Roman prisoners who were released in one of the four districts of Sofia (Krassa Poljana).
The BNU decided to use this to build security, saying that the organization aims at "national self-defence".
In the last 17 years, we have seen the same "cigarette terror" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained uneven and uneven - the political capital remembered.
They added: the initiative has become a subject of debate in the Bulgarian public.
As it was written, the increase in the risk of ethnic groups indicates that certain Bulgarian Roma organisations have reported that opposition is causing their own burden.
Since the Hungarian Guard's educational activities show similarities to the operations of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not surprising that the Hungarian Roma respond similarly to the threat of self-defence - can be read in the warning of the political capital risk.
Juhás Attila, the Political Capital Research Director, told the Office of the District, that the risk assessment is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they shall issue their risk assessment annually and, if they experience the impact of the risk change, they shall inform the address as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Not everywhere is the red letter on the holiday
In Hungary, the law clearly identifies the days of the red text and has become a general practice around the holidays, which will be less than in the future.
In the EU and America, the festival is not unique.
The Hungarian legal system is different from the day of national and state ceremony and workday.
Workdays are often linked to church holidays, marked historical events.
We will also celebrate its new year: the last and the first day of the new year - the last time just to get rid of them.
All year round, we've got a whole dozen red letters.
The national anniversary of the 1848 revolution is also celebrated on 15 March and 23 October, and the 1956 anniversary of the revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate the construction of the state, on May 1, and on November 1, and on November 2, we remember our friends.
We also have two days of feasting for the meat, the doughnuts and the Christmas.
Since our public, national or local religious holidays are rarely at the end of the week according to the calendar, the day-to-day accommodation has become practiced in cases where we work only one day before or after the red festival.
Yes, the price of the extended weekend is that we don't stay away from the workplace in previous Saturdays.
The Minister of Labour shall set out in a separate regulation for a period of years from the date immediately preceding or following the date of the meeting.
The legislation shall be extended to all workers and employees employed by the public, public and public servants.
However, it does not apply to non-repetition companies and institutions operating in the working days.
Today, only about the end of the year is changing at work: from 24 December to 24 December, life in the country, as the experience of Christmas and Christmas has shown that most people use their freedom for this purpose.
In the future, we will celebrate more than half the week, and the end will be less than this year's workday.
First, the day's work is spent around the festival, and then all of a sudden, the workers will be home for four days.
On Saturday, 26 April, it will be working on Friday, May 2, on Friday.
The second move will take place on 23 October: on 18 October, Saturday will be held instead of 24 Fridays.
At the end of the year, however, it can remain unchanged for the future of the festival, as it holds a nonstop at all times since December 24th, even if it belongs to the silvestere host.

E-mails that we forgot to send, audiomails that we never get, innocent lies that we're not aware of: they're "sin" at work every day.
Ask yourself whether you are dealing with minor inconveniences or taking over the dividend, and you are aware of situations that can be confusing and damaging to others.
Hey, guys.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to say I was looking for a marketing class," says one of your colleagues.
So how did you stay out of a meeting?
In the best case, he apologizes and tries to do the right thing, perhaps calling the marketing company to tell him he forgot to deliver the message (the least common solution).
Most of the time, it's about an apology.
Before you face a challenging test, it is good to think about what you can get to your peers for less than a minute, and be aware of how to avoid it.
Do you borrow something that's not yours?
There's no more alarm when you hit a letter, an office, or your phone, and it's nowhere.
Remember that you put your fire machine on the table yesterday, but you had to walk in the morning?
Maybe you'll get some of your colleagues to write down what you thought was lost?
Don't take anything away from your colleagues without asking 'cause they'll be just as angry with you as you're going to get rid of your property.
Don't be stupid about your office frauds, your mails, because it might be inappropriate if it takes time, and you'd need it right away.
Are you complaining about your own company?
There's no good way we can stop the already spreading lung.
Who, who, what did he do?
Where and why?
Do not rely on your own understanding (your own feelings) of your colleagues.
If one of them shares his secrets with you, don't come back with confidence.
Put the audience in your hands, and don't talk to your workmates in the distance, even if others are aware of your actions.
Do you mean the Indokolate patient?
When you call the office and report a stroke referring to the head of an officer, because your conscience is bad, or you feel worse that day; think that your work, your non-fishable workers, will have to be done for someone else.
Don't mess with your colleagues.
If you know in advance that you're not going to get into the office next day, or something you need to stay home for, tell your colleagues and don't miss them tomorrow.
Respiratory, thoracic, phone
Did you get involved in your work, but you're making it hard for your colleagues to get away with it?
You've become an unsolicited reader of a phone conversation that wouldn't have been better to hear?
Do not interfere with your work with noise, music, loud speech (which you keep above your head) or with foot-and-mouthing, continuous injury, loud insatisfiedness.
All of these may be disturbing, even if you are not really involved in a project (in writing, planning, organisation).
Do you blame others for your mistakes?
If there's no time for it, you forgot to send an important letter, a message, don't make any difference to your privacy.
Don't mention the crash in the office if possible, the loudspeaker's colleagues.
You know, if you've made a mistake, and that's what's behind the other one, and you're gonna get your ass kicked out.
Ask me how you can make your mistake, get the pardon.
Are you feeling too close to the office?
Maccónadrág and pope: a comfortable ride home, but it's not in the office!
Then don't take your comfortable vacation if you let your work.
Don't be shy, your colleagues, and respect yourself by wearing a weekend dress - if you're doing your work, pretty, maybe you're going to the office.
If you want to answer, you're no longer interested

There's something special about the radio: a loud voice that affects electronic effects.
I'll make the sound better.
The music has become a stage and the old sound is coming in, the bassy, and the female choir is actually connected.
The number of Zagar Wings of Love on mr2.
The life of home music has not greatly enriched us with a good quality electronic pop.
But now it looks like it's all different when you're listening to the new Zagar.
Yonderboi's appearance, a few new and exciting productions from the home digital base have slowly changed in the form, and a lack of diva again the gypsy garage, the home electropop also proves: it's new during the Day.
Judge Balázs was away from Pécs, and you were playing in Yonderboi's music until - perhaps because two of them didn't walk into a cricket - he was on his own trip.
With its project (Zagar) and its music, which the jazz, electronic dances, the pop elements, were intertwined, but it started to interrupt when film soundtracks were asked to compile (e.g.
Török Ferenc Season).
At the beginning of the younger clubs, he knew more about the public when the first albums of the Wan2 magazine of 2002 were filmed among the five most important domestic albums, and in Yonderboi, he published a series of home trends that appeared to be uniquely marketable.
Without a doubt, Zagar and his music became "trendi", but of course no one asked them if they were willing to take the note.
The singer responded as you should: he's prepared a new, better poem.
The Cannot Walk Fly Instead can now show you new paths, even if you want to create the title continuity with the first five years.
It's the same Zzászer Balázs as an Ottan, one of the old musicians.
We'd be in the air with air traffic, but in addition to the air quality of music now appeared - according to the spirit of the time, according to the trend - the more sound guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
In this article, at the Prime Minister of Lemme Millenárisbeli, the current singer of The Puzzle music in England, Ligeti György showed himself.
The album also produced a real radio player, Mr2 Petáfi, who played popular music from the next morning to the evening, started to tap into his mind with the six-year-old "Underground Divas" set up Wings of Love.
It's all right, then.
Hvg.hu Zzzeger Baláz asked.
hvg.hu: This new slogan now raises the question: How long have you been riding on what you're playing?
Judge Balázs: The determination to slow down doesn't mean too much to me.
I think there are two kinds of ease boxes; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but business and honest.
So-called alternative, earth-based music can also be pianos, no words, and so can be made for empty sale, which makes them commercial.
But with a good pop you can learn from the real start.
The attitude of the host also works in this spirit regardless of language and national boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the opening of Hungarian and foreign audiences to music?
Zs.B.: In the outside world, most of us have more traditions of ease.
It's not only the 10-hundred-and-a-half-year-olds who go to concerts, but the older ones.
It is much easier to pay attention to the changes that are making in the environment, because it is also part of the art culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how much they listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course, it feels good that they're getting more and more to our concerts.
But we never made music on the market.
We're looking for the music, not for the purpose of it, but for some kind of birth.
The role of the public is much more sensitive to concerts where each other's influence is already at work, but it is only temporary changes.
Still, I noticed that if you want to obey the public, you're no longer interested.
hvg.hu: How many plans do you plan to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He's actually working, and he's built his career in a quieter way than we are.
Zs.B.: We're not really going his way, regardless of how they sometimes try to explain it in our music.
We're better teammates who trust the presence of the other song and let it out.
Of course, it was inevitable that our work was compared to Yonderboi's music, since more of them came out of his music and we walked away another way.
hvg.hu: The Wings of Love is the first place on the top of the mr2 Petófi.
Many of these numbers have first heard the name Zagar.
Did you know that you opened the most popular style on a larger bed?
Zs.B.: We didn't plan to write a slager, so we sold the lemme.
This is about more.
We're looking at the end of the album, which we've tried to solve the music we've been playing and the most difficult themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six songs?
Why exactly - what was the lead?
Zs.B.: The idea was to be a gospel-like choir.
It was then that the idea was that this choir should be made up of the sound speakers of our own home music scene.
So the sixth circle - Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judy Jay, Peterfy Bori, Hodosi Enikő [Neo], Németh Juci - which we then crossed through the Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you design or design girls like this?
Zs.B.: The number is already in a long-term instrument version, then when the substance was collected, we thought that this number needed something else.
I've made a deal to make it my way of singing.
Even that night, I noticed the detail that the girls later learned.
It's the first and most exciting thing I've ever seen.
I remember, it was very bright, but of course they had to add the Divák.
My voice wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: All the songs, all the concerts seemed to be behind the girls.
There's no words (except Judy Jay's short words), they don't have their own part, they're totally together and they don't sound like music, so music doesn't just try their songs.
They're back on the stage.
Is that appropriate?
Zs.B.: Being behind was just because of technical problems.
However, we know we wouldn't have been able to share speech.
The number also tells us to forget a little bit about where he came from, where he lives, just let those certain sources of love come over us.
I'd like others to feel the euphoric state we felt when the dog was born.
hvg.hu: What was most of the work with?
Zs.B.: In fact, not one of them was more difficult than the conversation.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, where I'm playing in a contest hall, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work for long, and then he sat down like a ball game.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number of new songs?
Zs.B.: It's always changing with the concert and "I've already released" the poem.
Now the Prophet is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The expendable broker is at risk of billions of dollars because of its low-priced sense of urgency
Unsatisfying.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the French Sociéte Generale Bank, was known as the appellant, Jerome Kerviel.
He lost almost five billion euros due to the same demand.
It seems, however, that Kerviel was no more than a big player who wanted to end up with his colleagues.
In contrast to the other banks, he recognized the American market crisis.
"A lack of spirituality," he heard from the police's reporters.
However, the French Le Monde reported that it paid EUR 1.6 billion out of its sales last year.
Elections not only in America
"I just wanted to look for money for my bank," he claims.
In the morning, he's looking for half a billion euros in the US crisis.
He promised the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, it was reported that problems would be caused by subprime indicators for low-income or late-term clients.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe this and did good.
Last year's profit was EUR 1.6 billion.
"Even when I asked for the first half billionaire, I didn't know how to get in," Kerviel knew and added that he had nothing to do with it.
In his confession, he admitted that he had failed his reports so that they could not be dropped out.
He was able to overcome his bosses, even when he was interested in the business he had started in Eurox.
The risk was a result
Did he ask how everything was going to work out?
Not anymore.
"I thought it was just the fact that I was looking for the bank for 1.6 billion, that would calm them down."
Where'd his acararet be so dangerous?
He's getting his position further.
He has been working at the General Bank of the Society since the completion of the Lyonian University.
The annual payment has moved around $111,000.
Two years later he was already a broker, and his own broker became a $90 thousand in 2005.
In spite of this, he knew that he would never find as much as anyone else.
"In 2005, I knew during my first conversation that they were looking at me bad.
I'm finished, because of my professional and personal progress," Kerviel told the investigators.
It wasn't long after he entered the first big success.
Thanks to Allianz's shares, he sought for half a billion euros for the London bombings.
And he wanted more.
As long as you're looking, let's leave it alone.
"It's like the nurse," he said to the police.
But his bosses probably knew about everything or were better trained.
"While I was looking for money, my eyes were lost."
It was the beginning of the year.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
One weekend she wanted to know about it in mid-January.
By the time he got to work this weekend, he wasn't working at the bank anymore.
And the bank announced a few days later that it lost five billion euros.
And how did they get there?
He became suspicious of his freedom.
"In the last year, I only took four days out.
The broker who has no freedom, a broker who doesn't want anyone to intervene in his reports," Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic for the purchase of 365 billion
The Czech Government's ministers have all signed nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, from which the Czech Republic can receive EUR 14 billion (about EUR 365 billion) in the coming years.
The total amount available from the Czech Republic from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
There are about 125 billion Koreans from the seven operational programmes in the regions.
Chechnya companies can get some 100 billion crowns from the Innovation and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money, 150 billion kroner, for transportation.
The Transport Programme represents the largest operational programme and 22 percent of the tools available from the foundations to the Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the State base for the Transport Infrastructure, which will be invested with 90.8 billion crowns for the future.
The Business and Innovation Programme will help businesses and companies to achieve tools for innovative enterprises.
Companies should also be provided with resources for the introduction of new technologies, industrial research, and more efficient organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful countries in achieving EU funding from the EU.
The ex-President of Nicaragua has been sentenced to five years in prison by the Court of Justice
The Nicaraguan Court of Justice granted a hundred years of imprisonment to Arnold Alemán, the president of the country, who was sentenced to 100 million dollars (at least 1.8 billion dollars) in 2003.
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived in a house - to - house camp near the capital.
The fact that the former leader of this Central American country between 1997 and 2002 is going back after the races is not clear, according to the AP News Agency.
According to the President of the Court of Inquiry, Ileana Perez will depend on the prison leadership whether he is allowed to be detained in Germany or to return to prison.
Four years ago, the Court confirmed to Germany that it had regularly used government funds to account for foreign companies in Panama.
These firm companies and their accounts were, in fact, their clients and their closest supporters.
Some of these funds were subsequently completed on a basis based on the funding of the 2001 German electoral campaign.
We've lost our budget.
That's right.
They've accepted the state budget.
What's special about this budget?
This is a budget without the support of the majority of the co-operations set up by this first government.
This time-to-year meeting went through with the support of the Social Democrats, as the Minister of Sobotka and the Czech Social Democrat Part were unable to accept the rejection.
In contrast to the question of the lack of confidence in the government before the vote, there has been no drama at this time.
The House of Representatives has generally taken this into account, although it is the most influential law.
It's a certain opposition.
All governments start and end on their own, whether they like it or not.
The budget is a key element of policy, but the government and the opposition are hidden behind the powerful fighting.
That's more grateful in the media, so there's a lot more attention in the media.
Political debate is much more interesting for the public than empty numbers.
The Government of the People's Democratic Republic of the Congo has been struggling with three shortcomings in government budgets, which are unable to solve the 2008 budget once:
The first of these is the high level of the law of compulsory expenditure, not only pensions but also social benefits, which are agreed by the silent "coalition" of the ČSSD and KSCHM prior to the elections
Second, as a result of the first deficit, deficit growth.
The third limit is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the costs of cities and railways.
However, the greatest risk is not the deficit of the state budget.
It is under public and relative control.
The deficits of time-consuming bombs for urban and railway budgets.
In addition to tax, income, and bank accounts, many mayors have been able to earn money for other investments, often for which they have been sold without charge.
In recent years, these assets have been achieved by the massive sale of the shares of energy and other distributions received from the government from privatizations.
Now they don't have such a source.
If we support only official and verifiable facts, we shall establish that:
Our economy has been going through the growth phase for a few years like the rest of the world, and the Czech Social Democrat Part continues to fight.
This was a unique opportunity for governments to arrange public funding.
Instead, the country has been given more responsibility.
Other countries with two exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have been made much easier and easier.
It's mainly a horrible shame of the old governments.
We belong to countries that are at a global level at the lowest risk of poverty.
For example, there is no need for strong social programs, which have, unfortunately, been quite similar in recent years.
Although this year has succeeded in eliminating the share of intelligent populist expenditure approved before the elections, even if in the near future it will not be possible to set the deadline for retirement and reform, any policy in this country will actually end, and anyone who governs it will be a official contribution.
A little too little can be said that most of the government's taxpayers are usually paid for pensions and social benefits as mechanical distributors.
It is therefore not possible to convert the temporary budget, but only to stop the reduction of the normal expenditure by binding expenditure.
The $70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be completely offset if the previous governments had not exhausted everything that might have been possible in the past few years.
If we do not really want to be able to become empty officials from government politicians, we need to be patient and we need peace to prepare for further reform laws, not too strong, with a clear coalition government that the State can only give as much as it can from taxes and resources.
These only make it possible to increase the achievement of the balanced budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Central Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the Great Britain, Sweden and Canada central banks have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
This is how money markets spend hundreds of billions of dollars on garbage.
The bank will increase the tax rates for which I'm willing to spend money.
For example, U.S. Fed spends four billion dollars on your wallet and makes more money available to the European and Swedish central bank.
Following the 17th attacks in September, the central banks of some countries are currently in a coordinated process to prevent or reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This step should solve the biggest problems of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free capital, which banks could pay in exchange," wrote his client Bernard Baumohl from the Economic Outlook Group consultant.
"The coordinated action of central banks in the United States has reduced the likelihood of recession from 65 percent to about five percent," Baumohl reported.
Banks have already lost six billion dollars in the United States for unpaid loans.
Analysts are still counting on billions of losses.
"Central banks can really keep track of what can happen even if they have decided on such a procedure," said Kieran Davies, the AbN Amro president.
Looks like it's really bad," he did.
The central banks are afraid that if your banks can also find it difficult to get married to their clients, they will also give their clients credit cards in a much more expensive way.
This would reduce the need and sustain the US economy with the possible consequences of global economic growth.
The central banks then decided that it did not succeed. LibOR, a reduction in the average supply level of the London bank, which is used for money laundering on the central bank market.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of money laundering, despite the fact that the central banks of the United States, Canada and Great Britain had sometimes reduced their payments in real terms.
"This will have a similar effect as a further reduction," said the Reuters Agency Greg Salvaggio from Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not think that the central banks' approach is contributing to the crisis because it does not have the basic problem, the collapse of the US real estate market.
Klaus: The Indistinct Topics of Ecologists
Global climate change poses the greatest threat to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again expressed his opinion on the problem of global warming.
The International Conference on Climate Change held by the ENSZ Balin has so far been criticised.
A book named Céc, not the green planet, presented in the Bécs, made the ecological debate impossible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the Conference unacceptable, but it is also the fundamental difference between rhetoric and reality between government and civil organisations.
"The debate is absolutely without the structure, it's just a struggle with words that are the key to solving current problems," Klaus said.
During the presentation of the letter of the Czech President, he stressed the importance of his subject, which is why he was so committed to this subject.
He expressed his satisfaction that the book also appears in German translations, because, as he said, "I'm often just meeting with my own ideas."
Therefore, the interested parties may now read their unconfirmed opinion.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he believes that he has sufficient basis for writing such a book.
Because you have been able to examine and judge professional studies as a capable academic in statistics and public administration as well.
At the end of the book, it was pointed out that climate change is constantly changing, i.e. normal and that there is no consensus on the evolution of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious, so they do not pose a risk, and that the costs of climate change are too low, ineffective and unacceptable.
Moreover, as a person with experience in totalitarianism, it is unacceptable to share unconfirmed opinions with others, which I feel is a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He once again explained to the current issues that "the environment is not against reasonable protection, but against military environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and users."
Klaus spoke on the same subject two months ago at the Hayek Institute in Bécs.
600 failed to implement their rights
Six percent of the driver left the deadline and did not have the time to cancel the old license that will expire at the end of the year.
This is the last day of today when they can still ask the court to be able to establish a new bill by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that a hundred passengers would travel after the re-election without valid legal certainty.
According to the authorities, the legislation was not first broken down by those who no longer wanted to lead.
While the imports concerned the interest rate for the beneficiaries, the main city officials were listed with questions relating to the interest rate for which the interest increased this week.
About 2,000 clients will be received by the Chief Commissioner every day.
It's gonna take half an hour for him.
In Prague, about 14,000 passengers have not broken the bill.
A new license will last for a couple of days.
However, the new authorisation may also be required for a shorter period of five days.
In such a case, however, the driver will still have to pay plus five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who are unable to carry out their duties by the end of the year, and who are illegally travelling, are at risk of being punished by January.
The offence shall pay a maximum of two crowns.
However, the police are also conducting the investigation.
In the case of an administrative discharge, the penalty shall be 2500 kroner.
On the basis of the information received from the City Hall, a court may also be held that does not travel anywhere.
He can pay up to $30,000.
The Ministry has previously urged officials to be vigilant and to regulate the punishments of at least one thousand crowns.
According to Karel Hanzelka, the head of the Ministry of Transport, however, no one is threatened by dozens of cases.
He thinks the lawyer is a law that people want to accept or not.
This is not a personal certificate that everyone must be responsible for.
Those who don't want to run anymore should be told about the lawyer.
It is sufficient to proceed to the appropriate office by mail or by email.
By the end of the year, I no longer have the rights granted between 1964 and 1993.
However, vehicle drivers need to be increasingly affected by the other type of justification.
For another three years, those with the publications between 1994 and 2000.
The validity of the authorisations issued between 2001 and 2004 shall be suspended only in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million more laws.
The Court reduced the punishment of the investigators in Berdyccel.
Josef Opava and Petr Konyrik were police officers who had been charged with David Berdych's crime, for thirteen years and ten years of imprisonment.
The Supreme Court of Prague has finally decided on this, which has thus reduced the punishments of one of them, one of the masculins, for two years.
The investigation of the crime department of Prague served as a threat to the prison for 14 and 12 years.
Today's decision can no longer be brought into force, the review can only be requested by the Supreme Court.
Noha Berdyche is suspected at the same time, but he's only waiting for the first sentence.
In other procedures, he has been sentenced to more than 16 years.
You can't get it anymore.
In January, the Supreme Court first found 19 persons involved in arrests, including 16 of whom today's Supreme Court has dealt with an increase.
The majority of the defendants charged the charges from the start of the investigation by stating that they were speculative.
According to the Central Korean Senate, the police members of Berdyccel, in addition to the agreement, took the offenders out of police sources with information, hid some arrests and helped the gang avoid criminal liability.
That's why the gang gave 30 percent of the arrests to Opává and Konyřík.
The case relates to the crimes committed between 1999 and 2001.
First of all, there are kidnappings that have suffered a lot of serious health damage, but it is also a violation of international law and illegal arms trafficking.
Because the police found illegal guns, explosives, lasers or machine guns during the investigation.
The gang, according to the charge, has made tens of millions of crowns of slavery.
In one case, the court had already found out that Berdych was guilty of other arrests and a lot of others.
Other members of the Berdych environment also testify in other proceedings before the court, some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The first negotiations were still prohibited by Tomáš Putá and Maroš Šulej, who are in pre-trial detention in the country where they are awaiting a final decision in relation to the costs of the Czech Republic.
Account for the child cell: 12 million
The rights of the injured families of children born to birth, Igor Veleba, 12 million kroner from the hospital of Threbic, is subject to additional court charges.
Mothers have three million heads, two million fathers and one million children.
The hospital offers more than 200,000 children as a parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondréj Friendal Vele, basically, did not understand one.
"We've come back to follow this, because it's too much," said Dostal after the interview today.
"In order to deliver an opinion on the opposition, we need an expert opinion drawn up by the opponent.
We'll find out if there's any value to be used at all.
But we maintain our opinion that this will be possible for everyone in hundreds," he stressed.
He believes that the amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč to four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the jablonov family wanted a million crowns every month until he called his own biological daughters.
Her brother served as an expert judge on the basis of criminal proceedings, which was conducted by Motol University Hospital in Prague.
Children have suffered from a variety of mental and psychological disorders and depressions, according to psychologists and psychologists.
The stress situation was better handled by the men, even if they met with such a look that they didn't stop the rebirth.
Women are getting worse by updating the past trauma and what's happening right now, you've taken the contents together.
Veronica and Nicole were born on December 9th.
Last week the children returned to their parents from blood - Nikola Čermáké to Pribyslavice, Veronica Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanov to Jablonov.
At the end of October Miloš Vystrčil, the director of the railway station, gave the families 100,000 kroner through their expenses, which were due to the failure of the Trebian hospital to run the railway.
All Czech hospitals are subject to penalties under the law.
In the event of delay, the container shall be placed in the container, except where the foundation is required.
Courts have still left a relatively low level of damage to people, some hundreds of millions of old-age tables have been counted, except in case of a few million cases.
Polivka lost the kingdom of Valaisko
Bolek Polivka lost the dog that started for the title of the kingdom of Valaisko.
According to the Ostrava Court of Justice, he first used the name of a king, but he worked with a team of Tomáš Harabiš who worked with the film for many years.
Polivka didn't take part in the negotiations today.
However, according to the legal representative, the case is probably not over and the client will be more involved.
"The debate is that Mr. Harabish and the team will live in Bolek Polivka's population," said Polivka's lawyer after the press.
He thinks the Valachi kingdom's words make everyone feel like the Chinese come to the stage.
This opinion is shared by Harabish.
"We've been after almost ten years.
The search for money and the detection of actions," he said.
I think it's worth the money.
"Over the years it has been found that the project is successful and can win something from it.
They want to get out of our work," he did.
Future business
According to the court, the name of some king was first used by Polivka in television.
In 1993, Radoslav Brzobohetý crowned him.
At that time, however, this did not depend on the purpose of building a permanent kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish developed a concept of issuing certain routes.
The original educational action was created by business and income-generating business activities, followed by the creation of the society of the Kingdom of Valaisko.
By showing the name and signature of the agreed Polivka in 1997, these owners were on their way, in fact when they visited their proposed farm and cinema.
Who's gonna lock him up?
Today, the judge also pointed out that Harabish used only the idea that Polivka had made to the public at hand.
"The generality of Boleslav Polivka has helped some of the Valachi kingdom project," said the judge.
However, he added that the project was a spirit of the Arab and an intensive team.
The cooperation of the parties already united continued until 2000 when Harabish Polivka organised official co-operation in Vsetín.
Since then, however, controversy has raged between Polívka and Harabish, who have been involved in the overthrow of "King Boleslav, chosen by all."
In the kingdom, he took the lead in the beginning of Harabish to Jarmila Šulák as a queen.
After 2002, Polivka Harabiš and his companions submitted a court case against which the court was returned today.
The debate could lead to a war against the throne and the queen, planned by the Haribish.
This war should be a new king.
He still didn't want the details and the date.
"We don't want anything to get caught.
This should be something like the Slovak royal trial.
The king should be chosen for a certain time.
Mr. Polívka can also report quietly," said Haribish.
207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot test: different requirements
Honestly, I never liked Peugeot 206.
There is nothing special about the property, the quality of the change, the direction and the production.
But the market's already behind it, Peugeot 207 is actually better.
And the gun called SW goes on with one more ball, so it's not like I think it's better for me to think.
When I tested Peugeot 207 classic hackback, for example, I complained at the back seat of the head left.
This is the end of the complaint, because the van car accident means that in this regard, the two-metre high horoscopes are no longer suffering.
Fürgen in the World
I'll be right back in the inside, so I won't repeat myself many times.
It's a very successful design, where I'm alone with the poor console.
Here, I'd appreciate more designer invention if the outside of the car is so elegant.
Meetings are comfortable, and there are times when we complain about the short part of the meeting or the carpentry.
The page guide has also been significantly improved against the 206 model.
What is the area, here you can also feel the increase in the size of the corrosion.
After the battle, the head is missing a small place that has already been mentioned.
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders
This vehicle is the main part of the package.
I need to assess this very well available (and also thanks to the possible rear-beams) and a complex area.
Empty spaces are equipped with containers that are ideal for compromises.
They don't have any roads, cans, and even more difficult subjects.
But let's stay on the ground for a while.
On the basis of this table, 428 l is the basis for a higher average level of competition.
However, in the Czech Republic, it is not the most skilled car in this class - against Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW to the new product of the young boeslav generation, then we're determined that Peugeot will stay well after 52 litres.
This value is already critical in terms of foreign nursing or infant feeding.
But if I have to remove the positives, then I have to mention the level completely equal to the bottom of the second line or the very low slope.
120 litres in four rows
Our test vehicle was equipped with 1.6 litres of land, with four electric motors of 88 kW.
And contrary to the truth, you should look at the one-hundred-and-a-half of the family hackback.
Cendes, little consumption and first-hand meat.
If we compare each other to Scotland, which is six times six, as if there were a lot of holes in his pocket, then I'm just gonna be happy.
Say the price
Car prices aren't cheap.
We need to remember, however, that we tested a car equipped with a very good internal circuit and engine.
The four-wheeled foreign engine is still going for 329,900 Kč.
The car's starting with 410 990 Kč, which is already a lot.
The tested Premium equipment is supplied with another 80,000 Kč.
It's like we're still developing, our automatic climate, our automatic abbreviation, our backlights have also been electrical removal...
So the car goes to 531 900 Kč with a toll.
It's a lot, but it calculates Fabia's additional equipment, and it's a very similar result.
So you don't stay behind like the March decision.
Failed integration of Slovak students into British schools
In British schools, there are still more Eastern European children who have become concerned about the further development of local school.
The integration of Eastern Europeans leads to a number of obstacles.
Britain’s schools have already recorded cases when disputes between immigrants and the children of immigrants became violent.
The problems related to the integration of Eastern European children are well illustrated in a north-west corner where there are growing disputes between local and Slovak immigrants.
The bond between the students and the bond between the parents is already a sign of parental relationship.
The situation was so bad that in Chatham, he took a Slovenian woman who had told you a ten-year-old student.
The crime is protecting him from being hurt by the boy's racist jokes.
The police had to take action even after two 12-year-old girls were attacked by Slovak immigrants.
The girls were apparently armed with racist remarks and chased by the men.
"When we were staying home, a boy went up to the bus stop and started to pick us up.
When I told him to leave this behind us with tears, tears, and circles, he opened his back and forth," the Slovak student's mother wrote down the most precious case for The Times.
There's both sides of the complaint.
One of the local residents has identified the issues of survival for Eastern European immigrants.
The cases mentioned above suggest that in British schools locals and immigrants began to be divided.
In Great Britain, it is clear that there are 70 thousand Slovaks looking for work.
About 30,000 Slovak students are attending British schools.
Cuba's highest mountain in the Caribbean
For visitors, freedom is indeed the rule of freedom.
Whatever you're waiting for, it can be fulfilled if you choose the right answer.
The golden and white beaches, high valleys, or sea, calmed like a fish.
Palmafés and including parton pizzas, pastry or cotton cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roll.
You can find this in a more comprehensive and more economic classification on the Caribbean Seas.
In one island, however, more can be found, and this is Cuba, the largest and largest island in the world.
During the Spanish years, Cuba was a stronghold of American conquests.
Columbus called the most beautiful place he's ever seen in human eyes.
In the morning, it became a beautiful and attractive place for Spanish people who were deported to America and transported to Europe.
It's time for the American season to follow.
The National Hotel was built by the end of the 20th year.
Lucky Luciano, one of the heads of the U.S. mafia, built because everything that was considered a crime in the United States was welcomed in Cuba and supported drugs, luck, prostitution.
They were among the guests, for example
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In the morning, towers were built, and cars were transported into the streets of the past 50th century to be a symbol of culture.
Ernest Hemingway bought a beer in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and he had his own jacket in Cojímar.
The Bodeguita del Medio logo is drawn by the signatures of American business stars and politicians.
And today?
You can see the moon's Bodeguita wall with your hand.
The expensive National Hotel offers you a cup of coffee in whatever way you want.
And in the 1950s, cars are now transported to Havana today because the once exported bicycles and young people have already landed in this salt and salty air.
Although, first of all, the oldest part of Havanna has been significantly damaged, however, there is no other beautiful colonial memory than there is.
Other places are still worse than Trinidad.
In view of the fact that foreign trade provides the necessary money, development has taken a green path.
In the last decade, not only new hotels were built in Havana, but also in Varader, on the part of Holguín, and on such islands as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another unique advantage in the world, which is primarily valued by the stakeholders.
From their extended seats, your sugarcane has been transported into the sugars with gas and motorcycles.
Motor parks have not been refurbished for decades, so they can be seen by operating machines that can be seen only in museums.
Where are we going?
Most of Cuba's visitors won't get rid of the most famous places.
So there's no need to write too much about Varader or Havanna.
Maybe we'll just remember that there's a museum at Hemingway's already mentioned, and whoever likes the writing, you don't have to quit visiting this museum.
Cuba is one of the most celebrated parts of the island's quiet part of the island.
She's a woman from the vegetarian vegetarian.

At the end of their form, they may meet at the time of their visit to a railway undertaking.
Some may also find it interesting to find out that there was a breach of Captain Zeman's Chilee episode.
Trinidad
It's a city that has not been established much after Spanish ice-colonization.
The slave trade and the sugar trade brought fame and beauty.
The economy is a body that has been killed in the beauty and monumental beauty of not too large a city.
There was nothing changed in the four centuries of the later French trade-in-the-art construction of Spain.
The Escambray is so remote between the flood and the sea that there were not even in the 50th century those roads that would have been linked to other parts of the country.
Some anxiety has helped him to stay awake.
Nothing was built there, so they didn't break down, everybody was happy that he's got a roof over his head.
If a person has more time on the south side to Trinidad, he will look at the interesting places around him, like the Playa Ancón party or the Sugar Mountains.
And this is like going to Casa de la Música, where you'll be in the dark after the dark, where the music just sits down in the morning.
Baracoa
Some cities located in the eastern part of Cuba are located in the largest.
You must be affected by this opinion.
Both Guantanamo roads have to cross high and narrow mountains, leading to almost the nature of human activity.
Cuba's eastern tongue was added to the World Heritage List by UNESCO thanks to its unusual nature.
Here you can find the best chocolates in the church, the Columbus (prepared in fact a hundred years after the ship of Columbus) and the cave where the once-a-waited hotel is located in El Castillo, some of the most famous tables are the El Yunque.

The way they say right, it's better to see it once.
Afghanistan's allies are passengers, Americans are standing
A small army and lack of necessary equipment also affect the scope of the United States Afghan mission.
According to the Minister for Defence Robert Gates, NATO should undertake specific plans for the following years.
The Afghan mission is not represented by the imagination, the leaders of the countries in Edinburgh, Scotland, which have units in the southern part of the country.
In addition to increasing opposition to the Taliban movement, the eight participating countries also advise on the further plans and coordination of the alliances.
While the United States Minister for Defence Robert Gates was more active this week, NATO teams, Great Britain, were considered to be the first to strengthen the Afghan government and strengthen development assistance.
"The Afghan development can be seen, but the military force can only be part of the solution.
The other allows the population to encourage further economic and security development," the BBC Minister of Defence Des Browne said.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels, according to US government data, has been the strongest in the last five years.
The number of violent acts over the past year has increased by 27 percent, and in the southern Helmand region by 60 percent.
NATO has some 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, mostly their own in the south.
However, according to the United States, the alliances have also reached their limits in the organization and equipment of the teams.
In particular, additional helicopters, soldiers and experts were asked to join Afghan teams.
"We have to think very much about the specific goals for the future and ways to achieve them," Gates said.
He spoke in a similar vein today, Jaap de Hope, and NATO chief.
"I am not happy what is in Afghanistan on earth and in the air.
We have around nine percent of the soldiers and equipment we need," said the Reuters Bureau De Hope at the end of a three-day discussion with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Passive
There have been discussions among participating countries over the last few months whether all the alliances provide the maximum in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for passing.
"The Germans are quite large in my life right now in Afghanistan.
However, they were captured in areas where the minimum force and military requirements are not so high against them as against us in the eastern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The sun's brigade was called the German soldiers this week.
"The Afghan days have taken place: the Germans are playing while our sons are fighting," the Sun wrote in a photo of the German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bill was opposed and published a photo of his gang in the southern part of Afghanistan.
In 2009 the government reached a balance sheet
It's a total of 84,000 kroner's government.
By the end of September, the entire debt reached 842.7 billion kroner.
The government is planning to buy 159.2 billion dollars this year.
However, at the beginning of December, the ministry has reduced this plan by 152.8 billion korona, thanks to the better development of public budgets.
By the end of September, the Czech Republic had reached 842.7 billion kroner.
During the nine months of the present year, it increased by 40.2 billion kroner.
However, since June it has decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Finance has thus confirmed the official data from October's arrival.
Every one of them has more debts than 84,000 crowns.
On average, the state has paid more than 11 billion dollars a year.
"In the past it seems that, thanks to the lower deficit of the coming year, we could only be over in 2009.
In the next year, the debt will move around 900 billion and around a billion crown," said the IHNed.cz server's Patria Finance analyst, David Marek.
Similarly, you can see this next financial analysis, Vladimir Pikora: "In 2009 we can pass through a billion-dollar average.
That exactly when it comes to the next unknown budget.
If you were to confirm that the political situation would change, politicians would be willing to do more to do so by 2010.
But I don't expect this change," he said.
Increasing Duties
Publicity is created by the central government's responsibilities, which is primarily due to the reduction of public budget deficits.
Publicity is financed by financial notes, government loans, direct loans or, for example, by the European Investment Bank.
The internal sales of the State increased by 38.5 billion annually to 719.4 billion kroner.
The foreign debt of the State has first increased to 1.7 billion dollars to 123.3 billion crowns.
By the end of September, the so-called possible sales volume had decreased by 803.3 billion kroner and by 13.7 billion kroner from June.
The average incidence of pregnancy increased by 6.5 years.
"The whole year's debt increased by 13 percent in the first quarter, which is actually a lot of money for the economy.
It is interesting that the increase is mainly generated by loans, where the increase is 20 percent.
It's bad that a woman's duty, but on the other hand, it shows that she's going to trade when the pension reform comes here," Piko said.
Better than expected
It is clear from the financing strategy and the government's 2007 management that the government has planned to buy 159.2 billion dollars in exchange this year.
By early December, however, the ministry had reduced the plan by 152.8 billion korona, thanks to better development of the state budget.
The amount is primarily the deficit of the state budget, which is likely to reach the estimated $91.3 billion instead of $76 billion.
In addition, the Czech Consularisation Agency has planned a maximum of 13.3 billion kroner resources, ten billion dollars for the payment of pensions, 43 billion for State loan financing and 1.8 billion for loans from the European Investment Bank.
The teacher today stands before a cartoon court because of the name given to a plysmackon
On the night of a court hearing, the court sentenced the British teacher in Sudan to 15 days in prison and to expulsion from the country because of the loss of Islam.
The British woman was accused of allowing students from 6 to 7 years of age to name a plusmatic cat called Mohamed.
Such acts may be punishable by torture.
The 54-year-old British woman who was a teacher of the Carthaginian Unity High School was detained on Sunday in her own apartment. Under paragraph 125 of the Swedish Penal Code, she was charged with the loss and harassment of Islam after her students' parents repeatedly complained against the Swedish Ministry of Education.
The story began in September when the teacher asked 6-7 years old students to choose their name for the class plusmatics.
"All eight names of the children were proposed: Hasan, Abdullah and Mohamed were among them," for example, school director Robert Boulos.
At the end of the vote, 20 of the 23 children chose the name Mohamed.
Of course, Mohamed is the name of Islam's prophet, but he is also a very common Christian name in Sudan.
The kids then made a joint day with his maco photo and the "My name is Mohamed."
I didn't make a note to the mackerel with that name, but the problem is that any description of the prophet is like the loss of Islam.
Gillian Gibbons, one of his colleagues at the same school, said that he knew him well, and that the teacher would never have done anything to make any religious agreement. He thought it was just "an innocent mistake" saying, "I'm sorry that he had voted for the children."
The teacher's many students agree with this opinion. We think the teacher "is very good at dealing with the children" and "he never talks about religion in the classroom".
Let's not forget that the second most common cross name is Mohamed Great Britain, and there are 14 different ways of writing in English.
This is one way of expressing respect for the prophet. (The family's first-born child is usually named after him.)
But what are the rules regarding the use of the name?
Can you get that name, for example, a game?
This is obviously a question of understanding.
There was no agreement on the future status of the vessel during the last Saturday fiscal negotiations.
The conclusion is, you're wrong.
Without the proximity of the positions, the debate between the Serbs and the Kosovo Albanians will end in the sixth and last talks on the future status of the separatist province in Baden in Austria in the morning.
"Unfortunately, the parties failed to agree on the status," said Wolfgang Ischinger, EU diplomat, in a press release.
The U.S. mayor, Frank Wisner, stressed that in the region, peace is "in danger of danger", and urged Belgrade and Pristina to keep the promises of peace and dialogue after negotiations.
"In the near future, there must be no violence, but very difficult times follow," he added, stressing the "expression of obvious discrepancies."
Done at Brussels, 10 December.
Last Saturday he visited Serbia and Kosovo, the European Union, the United States of America and Russia.
In the 90th century, the future of Albana can be clarified after Ischinger, Wisner and the Russian Central Bank, Aleksandr Bocan-Harcsenko report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
In the vicinity of Bécs, the discussion in Baden announced the sixth and last session of the negotiations, since the ENSZ spoke again in August on the troika.
The Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation tasks will be completed on 10 December.
The Russians who have already been accused of Kosovo's independence in the Security Council have insisted that negotiations should continue after the deadline has expired.
"Russia was committed to Russia, and it remains the negotiating solution, along with compromise," said Bocan-Harcsenko.
A declaration of independence?
After 8 years in Kosovo under the leadership of the ENSZ, the minority authorities believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristine said he was willing to report his independence if the Security Council decided not to do so.
Your Belgrade would continue to support greater autonomy.
"We have not succeeded in reaching agreement" - the Kosovo independent president, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced in the Baden Hotel, where "the last opportunity negotiations have continued for a week".
Hashim Thaci, the Kosovo High Commissioner and the Deputy Prime Minister of the province, expressed regret.
He added, however, that the idea of Belgrade's autonomy would be "to pursue a life of crime and deportation".
Domain-Effects
The Serbian President, Boris Tadic, thought that compromise was still possible and warned the majority of Kosovo's subsidized citizens about the consequences of independence.
Belgrade holds the same "domino effect" because of its nine-year-old independence struggle in an unstable area.
"This does not prevent Serbia from opening up the possibility of compromise," Tadic said.
The Serbian delegation also welcomed the decision to be the Security Council, where the Russian Federation had the right to vote.
"The Kosovo Parliament will be the last word"
"Serbia can only accept a solution approved by the Security Council," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"The negotiations lasted for two years.
They must reach the same end where they started in the Security Council."
Fatmir Sejdiu announced to the journalists that "the Kosovo Parliament will be the last word". He added that the elimination of independence from Albanians is based on "consistency" based on peaceful powers.
Bush's quick agreement between Israel and Palestine
President George Bush welcomed the opening of the International Peace Conference held in Maryland, Annapolis, and announced that Israel and Palestine had finally agreed to sign a joint declaration.
According to Bush, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmúd Abbas have agreed to start an endless debate for the final settlement of 60 years among their peoples.
Bush, in the presence of the two Presidents, promised to support them in all possible ways in order to sign the "repetition" in 2008.
In time, Palestinians had to calculate the "terrorist networks" and Israel had to abandon their manufacturing activities - Bush said and reminded both sides of the commitments to the "petition plan" adopted in 2003.
The leader of the White House stressed that Abbas led the Palestinian Authority’s negotiations between Israel and Israel’s "a signing of a peace agreement, which is a problem of all relevance, including the central issues".
These are the last of three serious problems facing the Israeli-Palestinian debate: the future of Palestine, the situation of Jerusalem and the Arab tribe who were living in the territory of the State of Israel in the period of the conflict in 1948.
After the American President, Abbass said that future negotiations would be "global and deep-rooted", and they would understand all areas of regulation, such as "Jerusalem, exile, borders, colonies, water and security".
Then Olmert, who is in charge, promised that future negotiations would "be slow and ongoing", and he will be satisfied that they will "be completed in 2008.
By the end of 2008, Bush set fire to the implementation of the Palestinian and Israeli "the vision of two states".
Saudi Arabia declared that he had received a promise from Bush before he agreed to participate in the conference.
With the support of all Arab countries, São Paulo-Arabia (who wrote his mother-in-law to Washington as a success) has launched a plan that guarantees peace for Israel if it comes out of all Arab territories during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis "will be elected in the history of the Middle East, especially because of the problems of your peers and focusing on the central issues" - says the Duke of Saudi Arabia at the interview given to the Saudi owner of the Arab daily.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is usually the case with such signs, the official position and speech are opposed to each other.
How did the accident happen?
According to the first investigation by the National Police Authority (IGN) on Sunday, a police officer was sent to Villaers-le-Bel on Louise-Michel Street some 17 minutes later.
"The driver was driving, so he didn't take part in the action. 40-50 km/h, without a siren," we knew from the police source.
The two pieces were carried at a green "very fast" with no speed, "the official registration is not available, so it is not possible to use in the road market" (see below) with Kawasaki brand engine.
"Because they didn't keep the right-hand rule, the engine hit the left-hand side of the police," said one officer.
The result of the alcohol test performed on vehicles was negative.
It's good to show the strength of the hit, that the driver's head is stuck, the protective star is stuck in the shape, and the driver's leg is broken.
In an extraordinary report by Marie-Thérèse de Givry yesterday, he announced that he had relied on the Val-D'Oise Federal Security Board to investigate the investigation that was initiated "on the grounds of the lack of human dignity and assistance".
In the course of the afternoon, the prosecutor said in a press release that the police's responsibility could be eliminated at the current stage of the IGPN investigation.
According to the prosecutor's report, the three-year-old officer who heard the accident on Sunday night confirmed "the police account, which says the robot came from the police's left immediately."
The day before, from a moment on which the prisoners had no doubt walked along the road, they showed that the two vehicles had been assembled and a ship was sent together until the officer was able to sleep.
The vehicles were taken for technical examination.
On the death of the two victims yesterday, a medical examination was carried out.
What happened right after that?
As a runner yesterday, Williers-le-Bel said that the police quickly withdrew from the scene without providing help for the two young people.
In this regard, the IGPN is careful, but it excludes the police from following "any serious mistake".
"This investigation is the easiest part of the investigation, which is even more thorough investigation and requires increased caution" - we know from the police source.
Liberation met with an eyewitness who counted a few minutes after the accident.
One side of his apartment is looking right at the place.
"My cousin, who's a hospital nurse, we're going to find out immediately that we're trying to rebuild them" - for example.
"But we couldn't do anything."
Then he noticed "a police officer who was completely disturbed and convicted.
The other two tried to revive one of the young, and the fourth was on the phone."
Around the present time, the gap has increased, as the two young desperate situations have become apparent, so the coming police have moved their colleagues out of the scene by car.
At the same time, we know from the audience that the nurse came "about 20 minutes after the police were expelled."
They also used heart rate, but they didn't.
"I wouldn't say that the police didn't try to help young people.
Young people have received their own help.
The firemen came to the scene right away.
They did everything to save them" - the prosecutor stressed.
Women in Pakistan
On Monday, the Pakistani police stopped the first briefings that were made two days ago, after the arrival of President Musaraf.
In the eastern part of the country, around two of the measures taken in Lahore, according to the authorities, have been brought to justice by the fires used by the regulatory forces.
They've been shot in response to police officers who have been more injured.
At least 350 lawyers were made.
Similar events occurred in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where the police attacked and burned them.
More people were created.
In his essay, the Supreme Court referred to the general prosecutors of the Supreme Court and reported comments on the arrest of about 500 opposition members, human rights fighters and lawyers at the end of the week.
In order to prevent the assembly from going, the roads to the Supreme Court were closed in the morning.
In the central part of the country, there were more attacks in Multitan and northern Peshawar.
Since the week, the lawyer's movement has also been supported by the great Muttahida Mailis-e-Amal Association, which has multiplied religious parties. "But the leader has encouraged the people to send flowers to judges who do not understand the need for one, and to those who did so before Musaraf."
"You promised Mosaraf you won't be valid anymore"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan shall directly affect the exceptional measure notified on Saturday night.
The Court shall declare on 6 October the case-law of the re-election of President Musarraf on the following days.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from his dignity and was replaced by another.
"Mendaz, who we are witnesses, is illegal, illegal and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court," declared the President's newspaper The News.
President Pervez Musarraf promised that he would leave the army for the purpose of completing the civilian president's role and "loss his office" after the necessary report had been introduced - he informed the Minister of Information, Tariq Azeem.
As of 15 November, Musaraf, the first president's term of office, had to be replaced by a military unit.
The Ministry of Information also confirmed the report on the suspension of the January elections.
The Pakistani Government, on the other hand, has spoken in its own country, which would have indicated that President Musarraf was a member of the President's delegation.
No more than one third of the commitments were planned
This result includes unwanted (24%) or unplanned or unplanned burdens.
Even today, more than a quarter (36%) of the burdens are not planned - it is said that four years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, the French National Demographic Institute (Ined).
This result includes unwanted (24%) or unplanned or unplanned burdens.
According to Ined estimates, different methods of absorption such as tablet or muscle are still present in 5-6% of cases.
However, according to the Authority, the liberalisation of adoption has made the "birth regulation" more effective. The study notes that between 20 and 44 years of age women still have only 5% of the film-coated tablet in 1970, but this rate has already been 60%.
They've already planned eight out of 10.
Every fifth couple of months plan exactly, and if possible, you know, because this is the most difficult year of adoption for the child.
Visual correction in the mirror
Scott Parazynski had to work for more than seven hours on the brain to implement the scientific improvement of the station without delay.
This hazardous waste was also reported in several respects: the repair took too long, very little time to design, and it had to be carried out with "barked" parts by the miners away from the housing modules.
The problem was well reported when the surgeons moved from Discovery to Harmony. This is an element of a huge wave that will soon be the site of European and Japanese scientific laboratory activities (see section requested).
This module is the same as the laboratory mode.
However, it is necessary to take care of their prices.
The second task of poverty was, therefore, to move to the final location of an electric charge with the aid of 17.5 tonnes of paperboards, which was already in the ISSS.
Then the poverty began to open the module’s 76 meters wide tables of journalism.
He then placed one of the tablets in harmony with one of them at a distance of approximately 1 meters.
In order to avoid further injury, the opening of the table was not continued.
The surgeons initially had the task of making a control path from the Discovery helicopter, and then adjusting a different, defective solar system. Instead, they had to spend their full time improving the damaged solar system.
Scott Parazynski was chosen to perform the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of
He's one of NASA's best "intellector".
It's strong, powerful, extremely sensitive, too high and has a long career.
Therefore, a 46-year-old doctor had to "megoperate" the "damaged" daily table.
After thoroughly weighing the wound, he removed the wrong cable, and some "sin" fixed the damaged area.
In his work, he helped another "smoothing" who stayed close to the safe transition, and from inside, including the captain of the poverty, Peggy Whitson.
The instrument used by it, a mini yiabot, which was seen with a rise of hundreds of cuts against the sunglasses, the station's surgeons were framed out and "braked" together.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited until his colleagues opened the table completely, and only then he needed his records and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon the guards held half a day's rest, and today they returned to Discovery's helicopter to begin their planned departure.
Decrease the price of EADS shares
The price of EADS shares is high on the Paris Stock Exchange after the company has announced that the increase in A400M aircraft development will result in EUR 1.2-1.4 billion.
The price of EADS shares is currently EUR 21.96 after a 4% reduction.
The company was obliged to review its forecasts for the 2007 business outcome, as A400M engine development is in progress, which is clearly due to the delay in the installation of the aircraft.
The delay in the transfer of the air carrier, which was reported in October, will take place between EUR 1.2 and EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than 1 billion is affected by the Airbust' means the mother of the European EADS manufacturer.
As a result of the introduction of these expenditure, the EADS should publish new plans for the outcome of the 2007 business in the future in the context of reporting the quarterly results to the company, but did not publish any further figures.
The company group also indicated that it took account of the emergency delay in the preparation of its new budget assessment.
In 2006, EADS’ business performance decreased by 86%: this was largely another programme, which was due from the delay in the development of A380 rice, which could lead to a large financial burden on the company.
The company originally planned to transfer A400M aircraft to the French army in October 2009.
Set Status to quintuple
There is no great surprise in the Sunday elections: the great majority of Russians will vote for the party of Putin State, Russia.
In these Russians' stability, the need for self-government is shown after a highly manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before Parliamentary elections, Russian President Vlagymir Putyin is talking on television to the voters that have already been set, but the content is still secret.
Putyin leads the Kremlin Support Party, a list of Russia's signatory countries, which is expected to show the first victory in the elections.
When foreign dignitaries arrived yesterday, there was nothing wrong with the attitude of the head of state: he had just set up a new quiroha against the intervention of the developing countries, which was his favorite theme during the campaign.
"We know what price is for true democracy, so we would like a fair, absolutely transparent and open choice without any legal basis," he added.
The opposition says I'm not early in this situation.
The opposition is spreading the campaign that we believe the voters have been subjected to pressure.
The leader of the Communist Party, Gennagyij Zjuganov, says that "there was not even a fiscal election in Russia at the time of Jelcin".
After the last week's beatings were carried out, Garri Kassparov was sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized interrogation, and his lawyer is still unable to see.
"You still think of Russians as "homo soviecius"
The quantifiable selection results raise two more obvious questions:
- Who's next Puty in the state department?
In the Official Journal yesterday, the date of the first round of the election, which will take place on 2 March 2008, may indicate the reasons for the initiation by 23 December.
Since Vlagymir Putyint was elected in 2000 and 2004, its mandate is no longer extended.
But you don't have the other side of the scene.
- What role does Putin play from March?
Will you be the Prime Minister?
Or will he decide on the government and the Presidency as leaders of all the possible United States of Russia?
In any case, the remote power will prevail in both Parliament and the presidential elections.
This has become an act of betrayal.
"The Russians still think of the 'homo soviecus' method: they don't feel like they can run the race," says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada center.
The history of Nykolyi Koposov, the St. Petersburg Union, is even more different: it is thought that the country was a Christian five centuries later, so it is too late for civil society to develop.
Following the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutyin turned back to the model of patriotism, which was perfectly respected by the people. More than that, because this new kind of patriotism was not confused, but was accompanied by some economic prosperity," says Maria Lipman, a worker in the Carnegie Foundation.
In our day, the Russians are "inspired of personal responsibility" which has been demonstrated soon after the Soviet invasion.
"Why should we think?"
The presence affects all levels of society and even the business world.
The management body was interested in maintaining the current situation: 65 heads of government in Russia's local lists of 65 leaders from the 85 regions of Russia.
Freedom imported from the country often attests to the chaos, as it happened in the 1990s.
The public opinion is in favour of stability.
In this spirit the Russians don't vote for giant parties.
Tamara Cserednicsko, 54-year-old teacher, said: "Why should we think?
The people in power are not so bad, why should we destroy them?"
Explosive memories
After more than 60 years of secrecy, my archive of Bad Arolsen became public, documenting the series of 17 and half a million victims of Hitler.
The 47 million archive documents, which were taken at Bad Arolsen, 27 kilometres deep in the Hessen Valley, were still researchable for "humanitarian" purposes, that is, only for skin victims or their victims.
In May 2006, researchers and historians from Germany, France, Israel and the United States agreed to open my archives.
After all the States ratified the Convention, the archives were opened on Monday.
Confidential information
The opening of Bad Arolsen's letter makes it possible for historians to carry out research "in relation to the transfer of the infected population and the health situation of the camps" - explains Reto Meistern, director of the archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
To date, many States, including Germany, have rejected the publication of the documents, as they contain their names and thus provide reliable information.
For example, this may be the condition of homosexuality or spiritual disability of certain deported victims.
The lists of concentration camps and the detention orders issued by the Gestapo began to be collected for practical reasons after the war. The aim was to investigate deported or forced civilians on the basis of them and, if possible, serve evidence of their internalizations, which could be used in criminal proceedings.
In Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent workers are currently engaged in the processing of the ten individual needs.
However, the opening of the Bad Arolsen archive is not of great importance to the scientific community.
"These documents do not contain any novelty," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Centre for Anti-Semitism in Berlin in 2006.
EU and India would sign a free trade agreement in 2008
The trade in bilateral trade in India is now approaching 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is the first trading partner in India and gives 18% of foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign the Free Trade Convention in 2008 - Peter Mandelson announced the European Trade Safety and Kamal Nath Indian Trade Minister.
EU Foreign Ministers have already agreed in April to begin negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of South Asian Nations (ASEAN). The annual trade in Indian bilateral trade is now close to EUR 60 billion.
The EU is the first trading partner in India and gives 18% of foreign trade.
In addition, the EU is the largest foreign investor in India, but India is only the EU's most important trading partner according to the European Commission's figures.
Peter Mandelson explained that "a free trade agreement could have an economic impact on both sides", and "India could thus increase its presence on a productive market of 450 million people".
Ten of the most important products exported by India to Europe were the first or second importer of Europe. In the two watches, Europe and Asia each year, "47 billion worth of products" and "10 billion worth of services" were sent out to each other - the chairman of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi. At the same time, he expressed regret that bilateral trade "has still not fully understood its potential". In the EU and India, in New Delhi, New Delhi, the eight-billed Euros Service and the 10-billion-euro-valued service, he reported on the week of Danièle Smadja, the head of the New Delhi Commission's delegation.

Choose your concerns: the Bank of England offers 10 billion pounds for the money market for five weeks
The Bank of England would like to ease the lack of credit conditions, so it announced in the Chamber that 10 billion English pounds are pumping money markets, which, unlike the basics of 5.75% and the usual, are available for five weeks of running time.
"We would like to ease the concerns that, in particular, the financial market conditions will be worse at the end of the year, especially if the banks could plan their liquidity positions for this period more safely, which is why the Bank will provide a significant part of its assets in the framework of a fifth open market operation from 6 December to 6 December," says the Bank's statement.
According to the bank, 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December, at 12:15 p.m. on local time. The offer will be valid for my bank base and the refund deadline will be 10 January 10.
This is the first time that the Bank of England apologizes for five weeks of liquid money in the context of open-market operation.
It's usually a week's runtime for such operations.
In its press release, the Bank of England added that "there are further measures to be taken" in order to prove the bank’s central credit to the basis of the bank record.
The current central bank rate was 5,829% on Wednesday.
The three-month drop was overstated on September 18, which is currently 6.6%.
Since the start of the financial market crisis, the Bank of England has calculated significant amounts of money marketed, which has resulted in the return of banks from their purchase.
According to the speaker, (which only strengthens the price flow of the font to the euro) they would have been much more pleased with the resources provided by the European Central Bank, which would have been able to achieve better weight and greater discrepancy.
UMP and NC are not willing to examine the socialist proposal relating to purchasing power
The UMP and the Nuveau Centre Group have condemned the discussion of the articles of socialist legislation relating to purchasing power, which are equivalent to the rejection of the text.
Ten measures were taken by the national socialist authorities at their meetings, including an increase of 50% of employment rates, the return of industrial workers, the introduction of travel tickets and the reduction of foreign charges.
Since the UMP and the NC 180:115 voted against the examination of the articles, the government party and the opposition were finally reluctant to speak in live words at all times. It was only a few hours before a television interview with President Nicolas Sarkozy.
The head of the socialist mission, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that his group would re-submit all proposals in order to amend the appropriate financial legislative plan, which will be delivered to the National Assembly's agenda next week.
They're born in a new festival
A number of speakers were interviewed in connection with a new philadelphian music festival organized by C3 Presents. However, the event was announced that Melvin Benn Brit producer, in cooperation with the Festival Republic, will be held in New Jersey at the Vienna music festival.
"It is a compliment to us that we work with a man who is the founder of today's American festival movement," declared Charlie Jones from C3 on Billboard.com.
The C3 organizes the Chicago Lollapalooza festival and the Austin City Limits music festival.
He's having a party in New Jersey, and this is how he's gonna be sleeping.
The festival is held between August 8 and 10, in a private area of approximately 500 square miles [40 sq km] from Philadelphia.
The director of the Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the most respected festival organizers in the world.
In 1989 he started his event with the British Reading Festival, which takes about 80,000 visitors every year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn further expanded his palace by organizing the Leeds Festival, and in 2006 he invited the Latvian Festival to live in Henham Park.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has participated as a partner in the production, licensing and organisation of the Glastonbury Festival. This festival has now been available for some 177,500 people.
The C3 worker, Charlie Jones of the Glastonbury Festival, called the "most inspiring event" that he once participated in. He added that the company and Melvin Benn work in parallel to the region's holding a European style festival.
"We have already chosen the Philatelphian site, and we worked hard together with the Fairmount Parks Commission to organize this in the center of the Festival Philadelphia," said Charlie Jones.
"We have continued to deal with the city, and the Commission has shown great concern for our plan.
Sadly, however, because of the political leadership of the city, the organisation has failed," continued Charlie Jones.
" Luckily we could talk about this with Melvin Benn, and now we're preparing to organize a huge festival in another isolated place, with the interests of the Philadelphia people in the final season."
The C3 Presents was reborn in 2005 at Lollapalooza in the Chiangoi Grant Park, after he had already demonstrated the ability of an exceptional festival organizer by the Austin City Limits festival.
The gross entry into force of the two Regulations in 2007 was 9.8 million and 11.3 million dollars.
You're both at a festival in the city scene.
"Melvin Benn's European concept is building a rural festival while our festivals are usually in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to sort out the two models in some way, and with this, we've created the European rural landscape, and we've created a city life experience in America."
It is located around half a mile between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"Vineland population, the mayor also actively supports the event," says Charlie Jones.
Although it does not refer to the details of the agreement, it is therefore clear that "the conditions are sufficiently favourable to allow investment in such an arrangement to be made in an area where it is likely to be extended to the festival for a long time".
According to Charlie Jones, the festival will be “sorious” in size, with a high reception capacity corresponding to the capacity of the movie Bonnaroo in the tennis festival for 80,000.
The meetings have already received the invitation to the agenda, but nothing will be done at the time of the publication.
"Vineland is going to be a rock festival, but we're planning a change of music offer to find everyone who likes it," says Charlie Jones.
Jones and two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles Attal, form together the C3 company, which the latest Billboard Touring Awardson received the recognition of "the best independent organization".
Montreal facing the Terminal
It's not easy to get Hollywood officers to Montreal when you have to deal with the Terminator...
The "debt" is part of the duties assigned to the exhibition.
The mission "politically difficult" comes because the California government, Arnold Schwarzenegger, opposes the sale of its own productions abroad.
Is it really hard to put up a fight with the Terminator Commander?
"We need to be careful because the filmmaker decides which one is the best place for you.
If you find that you like the conditions in Montreal, you'll go there.
Our task is to provide the best possible conditions that we have decided on the basis of our decision," Schwarzenegger says.
Competition for the festival
Denis Turcotte, however, is now more focused on making Canadian films more popular.
The same competition started for Oscarok.
The aim of the more Quebec film presentation and popularization at every American film festival is to be either Sundance Film Festival or the Denver, Seattle or San Francisco Film Festival.
The film, called L'Ége des December, was held in a few weeks at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
The Palm Springs International Festival will be held in January.
The Shake Hands with the Devil film is presented in Santa Monica and on November 30th at the Starz Denver Film Festival.
Québec also represented himself with four short films and four games this month at the American Film Institute Festival.
Will it be a year's final rally in the trash?
Nearly five weeks before the end of the financial year, investors are already putting on the plates and are almost waiting for the end of the regular year.
However, it is not clear to experts today whether this is really going to happen.
According to Banif, "statistics are generally positive in December.
However, merely statistical background signs are not necessarily present, in fact, the uncertainty in the current situation indicates the market, at least in a short distance."
Experts are early to share the end of the fiscal year, although they say that "the tax-de-paid company retains the presence of liquidity, giving this opportunity for investment because there are no alternatives to the guarantee, in particular the fixed amount to which it is negative to go to quality securities, as long as it is short away".
Thus, we say that there will be no more direct movement on the ground than volleyball, "mostly because the effects of the Fed camadab reduction are unknown at first, the price of winning is the same as the high and threat of inflation".
Javier Barrio, the BPI's sales responsibility in Spain is agreed with this, i.e. it would be dangerous to state that it will be rare.
According to experts, "the situation doesn't always get worse."
The loss of Ibex is approximately 4 percent compared to the highest values recorded on 8 November when the index is closed at 15.945.7 points.
In spite of everything, not all experts are so aggressive.
Juan Solana, according to Intermoney's analysis, Ibex 35 to 16,000 points can also close the year due to the reorganization of the archives and payments to the regular pension fund.
On the other hand, the expert adds that some changes are expected this week, since the second week of December is due to the long weekend of the Act of Accession.
The measurer is unlikely to influence market trends.
Federico Olucha, an analysis by the Inversis Banco, is close to the technical level and "so we can experience the return of the trash index, which can also increase the impact of US news on the consequences of credit market developments".
The examiner trusts them to be favorites.
The analysers agree on what will be the securities aimed at achieving the new maximum quotas of Ibex.
Solana, from Intermoney, stresses that "but there's a lot of paper on the line."
The expert would put two large banks and some construction companies on the list, "as the electricity sector is already going to be very expensive".
Federico Olucha from Inversis Banco notes that growth is thanks to the banking sector and the industrial sector.
The construction companies can be positive at the same time as the rally, of course.
"The ACS has been trying to recover its positions for several months, and we hope that Ferrovial and FCC build companies will follow this path," says the expert.
cyclical consumption will be a major part of the coming year due to the increase in sales to be made during the Christmas season.
On the other hand, experts say that technology companies can be good at their level, although this field is not too high to represent in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, only twice in December has occurred.
At the end of the real year, we could see the rally in 2003 when the drug dealers were exposed to the crisis caused by the explosion of technological bubbles.
In this year, when Ibex was corrected by 35.17 percent, 668% of the population were registered in December.
So it is still open that 2007 will be a five-year profitable year after each other (currently Ibex 8.36% has shown growth since January) and can result in the final rally.
Banko Popular Spain opens a boy from 200 a week to 12 a.m.
The Banco Popular Spain has decided that most of its capitals will be reimbursed.
This is a total of 200, Spain's most commercially involved parties.
Those guys are running under the name of Popular Max, and they're making a big difference to the bank.
However, for the other Spanish institutions, this is the first group to be held by their heads on a regular basis from the evening of 20 a.m. on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 20 a.m. on Saturday.
The other group, the BBVA, which has several times heard that its heads plan to open up longer, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
However, it is currently being prepared to agree with its professional organisations, which would close 75% of its heads to make it clear in one afternoon, even though it is not for the public.
The experience of the Banko Popular in Spain will be crucial to the other institutions, and will decide on the same basis whether they will be involved in a more favourable opening initiative.
This is the goal of the Banco Popular Spanish project.
I would like to target private persons, small and medium-sized enterprises, individual entrepreneurs and local businesses.
The Bank of Spain would like 200 boys to work for 18 months with the above-mentioned openings, not the same as a new opening scheme, but the existing transformation.
To this end, the institution will modernise the branches found in trade routes, according to the needs of individual street customers.
In this way the extension of the opening time will try to rethink the character of the boys, modernebb, more colorful design.
Ángel Rivera points out that there is no need for a large investment in trade banks, but it is necessary to employ more than eight or nine employees per head of the current six.
Boys who are also given seats for SMEs are not going to sell non-financial products.
Illustrating Experience
The Bank of the People's Republic of Spain has already implemented the initiative in three Madrid branches.
According to Ángel Rivero, the experiences were pleasant.
The election took place for boys in the streets of Madrid, Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía, and according to Rivero, the decision was proved to be correct.
The Bank of the People of Spain currently has 2,500 boys.
More than 60 are working under the name of the WorldCredit, which is special to immigrants and has a very favourable opening order, even on Sundays and holidays.
In those units, PopularMax does not apply the BBVA model where some boys offer the wide range of non-financial products.
"We don't want to create competition for our clients," says Rivero.
They will immediately be able to stop and sell mobile phones using external personnel.
Telecinco first doubles and doubles the value of Antena 3 cartridges
"We did it."
With this statement, Paul Vasile, the Advisor to Telecinco, expressed satisfaction at the closing of the market yesterday, when it became evident that the TV channel led by him had doubled the value of Antona 3.
But one thing brought him joy: "It's just the pain that it's not because we've increased more, but because we're smaller."
Even so, it was a big blow to the weak market that "we're a little lower."
Telecinco closed with 254 percent force yesterday.
This growth represents the annual loss of 15.66 percent.
52% of the company's Mediaset, 13% of Vocento's, according to Bloomberg's data, EUR 4,488.88 million.
Rivalisa, who lost 1,52 percent of Antena 3 days ago and has been able to write 40,5 percent of the cases since January, thus leaving her wife for 2,193,46 million each day.
The other listed communications companies are estimated at 3,571 million in Sogecable; in Prisa (Cinco Días's publisher), 2,518.53 million in Vocento and 1.779 million in the case of Prisa (Cinco Días).
According to Vasile, the comparison between Antena 3 and 3 can be found in two companies.
The question is just how much we can do on the same market as the costs and how everything is covered.
Last week, Telecinco announced that he wanted to become the first brutal 1 billion advertising TV player, said Giuseppe Tringali, the Councillor appointed by Telecinco and the Republic of Spain.
If the reported fact is true, in the financial year 2006, 965.4 million of the revenue from advertising will be estimated at 3.6 per cent of the TV industry in the financial year.
The net turnover of Antena 3 increased by 1.6 percent in the first nine months of the financial year (up to 734.4 million), while the net price of television increased by 0.7 percent (630.4 million).
According to the analysts, one of the factors behind Telecinco Tzozsdei's position is the high pay out of the company led by President Alejandro Echevarría in 2006 to share 100% of its shares.
Vasile says - even if it's too early to decide - this rate can be changed by 33% after taking Endemol's parent company, with Mediasetel.
"We're hoping to guarantee 50% of my minimum payment, although we've always divided up a lot more.
I hope this will be a good time with our shares, as we have already enjoyed them with the conviction of 33 percent of the Endemol."
According to the analysts, the market is currently experiencing some difficulties.
The Lehman Brothers recently reduced their contributions to Telecinco by 7 percent in 2008 and 2009.
According to them, the estimated price increase is 8.4 percent in 2008 and 5.5 percent in 2009.
According to the same company forecasts, Antena 3 profits decreased by 4.5 percent in 2008 and 7.5 percent in 2009.
Opinion 3
It's the first time I've ever seen.
Ibersecurities: it proposes both purchase of securities, mainly due to high profitability and long-term long-term sustainability potential.
It's not like I'm here.
Caja Madrid: you see Telecinco prefers (purchasing) as the "multiplicity" and business strength of Antena 3 (containment).
It's not like I
JPMorgan: In both cases, the emphasis is suggested for "a similar risk" (a market environment and a more favourable economic climate).
Congress approves the transfer of MiFID into force on 1 November
Parliamentary case - which has closed today's amendments to the Senate - has initiated the government's social dialogue on the rule of law that both can still live before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups unanimously expressed their efforts in negotiations and agreements between the representatives and the senators, which served to protect investors' best normative development and detailed rules on the activities of companies for the effective functioning of the market.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, makes it possible to modernise monetary markets, while strengthening investor protection, broadens the rights of the Spanish National Securities Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various European Union supervisors.
The new Directive makes it possible to provide financial advisory services for specialized companies, but also natural or legal persons, as well as securities trading companies, securities companies and portfolio managers, to create a new financial service company (ESIS), namely financial advisory companies (AFIs).
In addition, the law increases the number of systems applicable to the execution of financial instruments, thereby contributing to the regulated secondary markets the internationalisation systems for multilateral trading platforms and the performance of trusts, which are in competition with current credit players.
In addition, it is necessary to provide market information on the aspects, risk assessment and risk management methods identified by the investment services, as well as on all operations carried out in order to facilitate the control of CMMV.
The Congress's Committee on Economic Affairs has tabled a number of amendments. It is of great importance that the securities are treated as a "complex" currency and also because of the high risk reported to the investor.
On the other hand, the transposition of the Directive was also used to legalize the operational environment of those with economic and business performance, all 30 years after the entry into force of the Royal Regulation, which was adopted in 1977 by only the public authorities.
The Senate also proposed the creation of new players in the financial sector, such as the brokering agent who works for another account, does not need the authorisation of CNMV and can sell products or buy customers once more for several investment firms.
Consumer Árindex increased by 0.5 points in November and reached 4.1%.
This indicator, which will be taken into account by Eurostat for calculating the rate of inflation in the European Union, shows the rise in Spanish prices by November.
The public contribution is consistent with the strategy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank to provide data that can be compared with data coming from the United States, both in terms of time and character.
The first indicator number shall be used in the same calculation method as the calculation of the United Árindex, but the statistical modelling method differs from the evaluation of information which is not yet available at the moment of bringing to the public.
The Statistical Office has stated that the first indicator number is merely information, so it can be distinguished from the final data made available to the public on 14 December.
"Consumer's Árindex still shows a relatively high value."
Pedro Solbes, one of the government's vice-presidents and the Minister for Economic Affairs, stated that the increase in the Consumer Price Index 4.1 % on November was only "time-marked", but pointed forward that the price index is expected to show "very high" values in the coming months.
In the course of Parliament, Solbes confirmed that "although my indicator number is not really interesting", the Spanish inflation rate in the monetary union remained at least the same level in recent years.
It also added that November was "a little less surprise" than the previous month when the government did not count on such a large increase.
"We expected about 4% of the value" was recognized by the Minister for Economic Affairs in relation to the data brought to the public during today's period.
You'd like to get 42 billion euros through Northern Rock for Virginia in three years.
More than 50% of Northern Rock's assets are returned and currently only 12 billion points (16 billion Euro 800 million) have been issued since the crisis took place and an urgent loan was received from the English National Bank in mid-September.
There was still a record number of more than 25 billion points, which has been significantly reduced over the past two and a half months due to customer credit loss, despite the fact that the Government has promised the bank a percentage guarantee by the end of the crisis.
This unit will be operated by Virgin Money under its own financial, commercial name. The Virgins will have as much as four of the British banks' incomes in the next three years to earn the remaining 18 billion pounds and thus achieve 30 billion targets.
Richard Branson's group, known as a large advertising campaign in England, became known as a large audience of businessmen, is the reason that he spent about 50 million pounds (that is, EUR 70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve the desired goal.
The Northern Rock offered the Virgin Consortium this week more than the most difficult thing to replace your chair. Three other companies are creating the Consortium with Virgin.
The mayor of Totana was arrested for a alleged corruption case
Today, the Czech Republic has detained the mayor of the town of Totana, located in Murcia, because it is suspected that he was involved in the corrupt urban botany of the week.
They arrested one of the guards of Városha and the police chief of the settlement.
Former city representative José Martínez Andreo took over the position of National Representative Juan Morales, who could be head of the corruption network, according to the official organizations of the SER radio station.
The police continue to investigate the city's offices and the Város Development Council, and cannot prevent further arrests from being expected.
His attorney, Juan Morales, was also under investigation, as he suspected the head of the corrupt corruption bottled in the week.
According to the SER radio station, the national lawyer Juan Morales was arrested when he was evicted from Morales in his file concerning corruption.
According to police sources, the investigation was the conditional response received by Morales to the fact that a Galician construction company signed a city development agreement over 200 hectares.
There are currently eight persons under arrest.
Bono accepts the PSOE sign in Toledo and the President of Parliament if the elections are won.
The former Defence Minister, José Bono, accepted the head of the government and also the head of the socialist party, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero's offer to lead the next list of PSOE in the next parliamentary elections and to include the President of Parliament's honour if socialists win the election.
This was announced by the PSOE Service Secretary, José Blanci at a press conference, and he also confirmed Bono after a talk with Zapatero in the party centre today.
The Head of Government urged the former Prime Minister to choose "the best we have to count" in politics, and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he added that "probably" the mancha political will be the socialist party to the honour of the President of Parliament if socialists win the next elections.
Bono would take over the position of current Parliament President Manuel Marín, who announced on 15 November that he would not be able to face up to the next elections and political careers in a more scientific way than he would then fight the climate change.
The former Prime Minister acknowledged that the Government has continued its efforts to return to the political scene since she was admitted to active politics two years ago.
It also added that since the voters are aware of who will be the Economic Vice-President in the case of the socialists' victory, the party would also want to inform them of the "evidentity" of who will be the President of Parliament.
If Bono is really going to fill in the post, he would like Parliament to be "honor and not abuse or kidnapping" and to be better compared to the home of the citizens.
"It seems sad at the time that Parliament is the only place in Madrid where it can't be talked slowly, it has already occurred that the Head of State has divided the speech 26 times into fear in the Senate."
At the same time, he commended current president Manuel Marín, whose "choice work" he did not want to present himself as a president, so that his opponents would be "sustained."
A campaign for climate change
Since climate change is a non-lethal movement, it must be very strong against both the signs and those who participate in political or social decisions.
Indeed, you have to set up a political leader such as Governor Zapatero, who says that the movement is more important than the fight against Islam against terrorism, and declares that "we need a new agreement with our Earth".
However, this note raises the question of the extent to which the activity or inactivation of the Government has contributed to the fact that Spain is living within the Union in the absence of the Kyoto Convention.
Who are responsible for not complying with the Convention, which sectors are concerned, and why has the Government failed to do so?
In addition, it should clearly explain to Spanish what measures are being taken to increase climate change.
What companies will be affected by these measures, what habits of the population need to change, what level of energy efficiency we need to consider, and what economic consequences will this have?
So who is to make a sacrifice and pay for saving our planet?
But we didn't get it and we won't get an explanation for these questions.
That's because it's about sacrifice and money.
The measures taken by climate change, the actual measures, are not always popular.
Costs, reliefs and expenses are available to all companies and to the population.
Even the use of PSOE would have indicated such a lack of popularity before the elections that Zapatero would return soon.
Back then, we have to save the Earth from nothing, from empty propaganda texts, empty, actual consequences.
Agreements, committees, protocols, new honours.
The agreement with the Earth, says the Head of Government, who speaks so well of the election campaign, does not demand, does not oppose, indeed enhance electoral assemblies and weaknesses in us.

Totana's mayor and chief of police were arrested for a alleged corruption case
The Police arrested the mayor of Totana, the town of Murcai province, the local police chief José Martínez Andreot, the local police officer, the housekeeper and a visitor company for crimes related to urban development, and reported to the police today.
The mayor was detained at home, then transferred to Városha, and there are now several police officers who are investigating the government agency responsible for the administration of the Város-Development Council and the Iparties and Housing.
The three arrests were preceded by six arrests in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia last week on a case in which a total of 2 hectares of agricultural land could be established in order to allow 4000 residences for the Galicia company after the leaders were illegally paid during their previous duties.
Two other persons have not yet been arrested, but they are under investigation according to the information provided by the Court of First Instance.
The first six arrested persons were handed over to the court.
According to official sources, the former Mayor of Totana Juan Morales, who is under investigation today at the level of independent Parliamentary Representative of the Netherlands.
The former wife, who owns a property agency registered in Totana, is studied to the extent that she, like the former mayor's current girlfriend, lives in the centre of Murcia.
The manager and owner of the Nuaria Group, Manuel N.A., was detained in Nigrán (Pontevedra), together with the manager of Suelo de Inmonar, Pablo José M.G., who is also a member of the Nuaria Group and is subject to the cancellations.
The investigation shall be carried out by a group of offences committed at the national level by the Central Operating Authority, whose members are members of ten households outside the detentions, primarily of companies operating in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Ponteverrá, Las Rosas (Madrid) and Totana.
In general, one person was detained: the owner of a well-known company dealing with barothe products in the neighborhood, who could play a central role in the case.
The Nuaria Group would have built its largest park in Totana, with 5000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels.
The company has acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana, which was overestimated. The project would have doubled the current population of 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group is owned by companies such as Autesa e Inomonauur, Vigo, Conycase, which is responsible for handling Coruna, Venezuela and the Catholic Ferdinand Parks, and for the sale, promotion and production of Hogar and constructions.
Things that go wrong
I'm sorry.
If they agree, we're a little afraid of the Honop Book, and we can look back at some philosophical knowledge and wisdom.
I've already been equipped with a device.
People, the constant change in life.
Of course, everyone can figure something out.

Our Finnish scientist found this comment in one of the largest pages of Finland: (the PISA report on the world's level of activity is probably in the life of PISA), in Helsinki Sanomat, following the criticism of the Blackburn book on 18 November.
"Philosophical teachings were brought to the public after the tragedy of Jokela gymnasium.
The killer, in his messages to the students before his death, wrote his letters to Plato and Nietzsche.
The Teaching Council of Philosophy, Pekka Elo on the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper, requested students to examine Plato's teachings critically, and then added that Nietzsche's knowledge of the basic philosophy of secondary schools is not necessarily important."

One of our colleagues informs us that the Criminal Code includes a complaint concerning Internet downloads:
A. Loading a number of music is a crime, and in six months it can be punished a year.
However, if you steal less than EUR 400 in a package, it is only normal (Article 623.1).
B. If you run at a value of EUR 1000 in a round, the thief is already guilty, but the penalty still does not apply to the level of a minor penalty in the case of online download (Article 234 BTK).
C. If you steal a car, but in 40 hours, the penalty will still not apply to the level of a minor penalty in case of online download (244.1).
D. You can count on a lower penalty if you're in a fight than if you split the CDs.
If you take part in a multi-stakeholder transaction, you may receive an annual spreading sentence (Article 154), but the CD-ROM will be sentenced to six months of a two-year extension penalty.
(CTK 270)
E. According to article 184.2 of the BTK, sexual harassment at work is not as serious as downloading a DVD film.
F. The sale of copyrighted films is more serious than the sale of pornographic material without contributing to the authors.
If my colleague's right, someone's got a lot of things to do.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I received an article from my house doctor about foreign research, entitled "The cause of money's mental activity, especially if others are less concerned".
So the workers' feelings of pay day depend on how much others get.
The experiment was carried out in the Bonne University of Magnetic Resonances with a tomography, and the results were also published in the latest issue of Science.
The author of the study and the director of the German Life&Brain Nuclear Engineering Group, Bernd Weber, said: "We measure the stronger activity when the participant responded correctly, but the company failed".
The researchers found that if both of them were given the right choice and received the same amount of money, the brain activity was measured, but if one of them received a double amount, the activity also increased.
I don't know why he needed so much science for such a simple conspiracy.
The Balcanese main concern
Carla del Ponte has been free of charge for eight years for the war crimes of the Balkans in the Hague, and for the investigation of crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia by the Criminal Court.
The mandate comes down at the end of the year, and Carla is leaving with a little quiet mouth because of the Srebrenica's responsibility for the Srebrenica bleeding, during which 8000 Bosnian Muslims have been defeated, namely the Soviet General Ratko Mladic and the Serbian Serb leader Radován Karadzsiks are still free.
Their name is on the list chosen by the Swedish director Marcel Schüpbach as the name of the documentary: Carla's list (2006, Spain has not yet been shown). The film follows the work of the Swedish chief prosecutor from Belgrade to New York as he tries to pressure the governments concerned to cover the crimes committed.
What kind of insurance do I have?
The insurance of a vehicle, which is a security of the owner of a vehicle, is a significant expenditure against the various damages and depends on several factors, such as the date of the purchase of the vehicle, the family status, the type of the vehicle to be provided and the nature of the use.
The purchase of a car is just the first step.
Actually, the choice of appropriate insurance is much harder than we would like to know what kind of car we want.
First of all, we need to be clear about what's going on.
Car insurance is the insurance company and the agreement between the insured person.
This Agreement has killed a body in the form of an insurance contract, which states that the insurance company is liable to fine the damage in the event of an accident.
The amount of the insurance fee paid in practice for the insurance, which is determined by taking account of different factors, such as the date of the purchase of the licence, the family status, the type of car, its use and others.
The insurance companies are based on statistics on the insurance fee, i.e. a higher amount of the payment of the higher risk.
That's why women over 25 years of age or less pay because statistics indicate that they are less likely to be more careful.
Similarly, according to the evidence, insurance companies have concluded that married people are less likely to suffer harm than single people.
The frequency of the vehicle type of use is determined.
The possibility of the occurrence of the accident is more commonly used.
When the insurance fee is fixed, the insurance authorities shall take into account a number of factors.
Therefore, the owner must be considered on the basis of the choice of the best form of insurance for the profile.
In the following, we will show the most important factors in the selection to make the best use of the guaranteed requirements and to produce acceptable prices.
When the insurance contract is concluded, a number of frameworks for 25 years should be calculated, such as the lack of leadership experience and the lack of legal certainty.
Even if we are most vulnerable to all risks, there are even more economic solutions.
The more careful drivers may need full insurance on their own, thus ensuring that they are safe against all risks and that the price can be paid.
In such a type of contract, the secured payment is part of the damage.
"The amount of self-sustained by the insured depends on the insurance fee; the higher the price, the lower the self-sustainment," says Luis Noguera, the Spanish Director of First Europe's Internet Insurance Manager.
Another option is to provide increased liability to third parties when the client provides himself against the damage caused to others, but not against the damage caused in his own car.
Besides, it'll be safe to steal, fire and car damage.
A good councilman.
If you are not 25 years of age, be careful and you may face the risks because this is an opportunity for the bonus and thus you can reduce the amount that will be paid in the future.
Bonus is named as the beneficiary of the benefits granted under the insurance company's basicity.
And we call it a punishment that was calculated for basics, and we call it a fraud.
"The size of the bonus and the salary depends on the insurance company and its profit.
If the company was a good year, it would allow you to increase the bonus's size" explains Nogue.
If the 25-year-old age has been exceeded, the owners will be able to make it easier to ensure that the risk is reduced because of the experience gained over the years.
Then we advise them to take full care of themselves.
"In general, young people are not able to properly apply their experience in a single accident, not even in leadership," says the Director of the European Insurance Society of Spain, adding that most of the accidents follow the lead in the second year when leaders are already in fear of beginners.
If the insured person is already a woman, but he still has no children, the best if he has complete insurance, of course, if his financial options allow it.
Insurance companies hold children's households at the lowest risk for clients, so the payable price is even lower in their case.
In this case, the best way to ensure full self-insurance (not to reach EUR 300) or, if there is a higher bonus, the vehicle may extend the insurance from the third year of the other injury.
"They lead slowly, while their buyers are larger and allow themselves to be higher in self," Luis Noguera says.
In the case of pensioners, we offer the full insurance willingly (about EUR 150) or in the case of a higher bonus.
Vehicle insurance is very important, not only because it means protection in the event of damage to the owner, but also because it means a large expenditure, so it is impossible to choose a person's insurance form accordingly.
He wants to get the Celtic point in Milan to get into the eight-year-old.
Milan and Celtic have a pleasant measure of strength at San Siro Stadium to get the missing point at the Bajong League closing. The Italians can be the first to do this, and the shoes can qualify for themselves.
The Italians have all ten points and have already provided the transmission in the fifth round with a Portuguese decision, but Celtic has nine points, but one should be to the six-point Shakhtar, who will fight the four-point Benfia, not forward.
The two sides of the D group will be held one week before the end of the sixth round, since Milan will have to play in Japan at the World Cup, where he will try to draw the forward to decision 16.
With this group D will soon close down as the others, and even though the most likely result at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium will be decisive, the two teams will be able to win because the Italians don't want to stay home, and Celtic can first move from a better place to the eight-year-old.
Gordon Strachan's team still has enough to qualify if the Shakhtar doesn't win, but can't be sure, because if there's accuracy, the victims will continue to be lost in Glasgow (2-1), but won the next set (2-0).
The Italians are going to spend the night of the shoes that they want to go to the eight-year-old Bajnokok League twice after getting out of the Caka in a final extension of 0-0 in the previous year (1-0).
The victory of the "Rossonerik" would be most happy if Shakhtar lost his Celtic entrance into the eight-year-old and stayed in UEFA.
In spite of the fact that Benfia is currently in the last place and is unlikely to remain in the European Union, it is still possible to obtain the third place with a victory that would play in UEFA.
20,000 people went to Vancouver to participate in the first concert of the Spice Girls tournament.
Spice Girls started his tour in Vancouver, Canada, and they've been up for 20,000 viewers now since they broke up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) were announced a few minutes before the concert organized in the Vancouver GM Place that was held in the form of the joint "goods".
About 20,000 people have turned to be there at the concert, where a video film has also been shown about the combined success of the 1990s.
Together with the reconnaissance and the tournament, a new album was also placed on the market in Spain, the EMI, which is the largest players and two new songs on the "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
The Spice Girls is five members of the "Push Spice" husband, the British fociist David Beckham in his box.
The athlete was also there at the GM Place's zoo, even though Victoria stopped him a few days ago.
When the show started, Victoria Beckham said that the British football star "I haven't seen the drummers yet, so I'm curious about what you're going to think about the show".
'Sporty Spice', was the reason that the joint played two years after he stepped out of the band in 1998 "because the members didn't understand each other." He also appeared nervous during the press release, which was held two hours before the concert.
"I've always been.
I was angry, but I saw that people's feelings for Spice Girls changed.
I thought why not? Now I'm glad I made this decision," Chisholm said about the co-operation that he had been involved nine years ago.
The singer also added that in time, "the things were settled and we love each other very much."
But a lot of things have changed since Spice Girls arrived in 1998.
According to CTV TV, Virginia Airlines has come to Vancouver in particular.
At the airport, a group of baby sitters were waiting for them.
They've all got seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the team took place in California (USA), then in San José (December 4) and in Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
In Madrid, on December 23rd, our actions will be in progress.
Other fears about the Russian gas pipeline
Between Ukraine and Russia, the gas supply, which can also affect Russian fuel transport to North-European Europe, has been introduced.
Much of the Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) is carried through Ukraine and the issues between the two countries are always taken seriously.
It stated that if Moscow grows the gas paid by its citizens, they will also be able to provide Russia with a higher transit cost.
One, as a result of a much deeper debate between the two countries, the EU's accession to the EU decreased.
The most recent debate between Kiev and Moscow is on the ground gas monopolium of the Ukrainian Government and the Russian state owned by the Russian Federation, which is the subject of an attempt to reach an agreement on the gas price paid by Ukraine in 2008.
The Gazprom stated that a 50% increase in greenhouse gas emissions from neighboring Turkmenistan should be carried out in relation to the 2008 agreement with Ukraine.
According to the analysts, this could mean a 40% increase in the volume of transport from Gasprom.
"It is important for us to respect one of the most important transit countries in the negotiations," Anatolyj Kinah announced to the Reuters Bureau of Economic Affairs.
"The changes in greenhouse gases should be combined in any way with the discussions on the cost of transits from Ukraine (and from North-Eastern Europe) to Ukraine."
As a result of the most significant gas prices between Moscow and Kiev, in January 2006, the gas force in Ukraine was closed.
This has resulted in a dominant reduction in exports to Western Europe, which has raised prices to a great extent.
The Russian gas is one of the main sources of gas burning in the European Union.
Russia has the world’s largest natural gas stocks, but most of them are still undisputed.
As a result, Gazprom's own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian countries is completed with land gas.
NHS "Necessary to Control Foreign Workers"
The committees of the Scottish NHS should improve the monitoring of the criminal record of workers from outside Europe - a supervisory body announced.
The proposal was made by Robert Black's chief accountant, following the fact that a foreign state doctor in Scotland was brought into contact with the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that NHS Scotland does not have accurate data on the number of seafarers.
At the same time, the report, through a sample of five health authorities, also referred to key checks carried out accordingly.
Following an attack against the Glasgov airport, the accounting officer verified the list of applications that had been withdrawn outside the European Economic Area.
The 28-year-old Bilal Abdullahot, Royal Alexandra Körház, located in Paisley, was then detained at the airport for a dsp of the main terminal of the building.
Abdullah was one of the three doctors who were heard by the Old Bailey Court in October in the case of a motorbike bombing trial carried out in the United Kingdom.
In the case of NHS employees coming from the coastal countries, the NHS Committees must verify the skills and skills of the employees concerned before the start of their employment and the necessary authorisations for employment in the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Health Committees have applied Disclosure Scotland in order to verify the possibility of criminal registration, the Agency has not been entitled to obtain such significant information from outside Great Britain.
The main accounting report has suggested, inter alia, that the Commission should include a guide to the Criminal Reporting Office, which facilitates the monitoring processes carried out by different sea-country countries.
"Although we have found evidence of such checks among the personal records, they are not carried out on a regular basis," the report states.
According to Black, Skot NHS performs its own pre-employment review process at such a high level, adding: "Our report sets out the areas of the system that can be developed in order to provide us with updated information on the number of personnel from the NHS Sea. "
Dr. Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, said "very unlikely" that we could identify potential NHS users who can follow terrorist actions in the future by means of pre-employment checks.
"The report states that the pre-employment checks currently applied are working well in NHS Scotland, and the value of the proposals is not yet transparent," he added.
According to health authorities, the current number of seafarers present in most of them is 1161.
However, the main figure points out that numbers are likely to be higher, which is part of the explanation that the Commission has a problem with identifying applications for unlimited freedom.
The investigation also showed that the checks carried out in the Ayrshire and Arran areas, in the Grampian, in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde areas, in the Lanarkshire and in the NHS authorities in Lothian.
These procedures have been issued for the control of travel, employment permit and professional records.
The Scottish Government is also currently examining the directive and guidance for controls on the employment of NHS users from overseas countries.
Nicola Sturgeon, a health secretary, declared: "I am very pleased that following the attack against the Glasgow airport, I was able to carry out this task.
He added that the Scottish Government, in cooperation with the Health Committees, will take note of the proposals contained in the report and will ensure that the full-used guard, including seafarers, will also be informed of the best practical application of the plan to publish the updated change in the following month.
The Joy Division takes over the digital film
From Joy Division's song, Ian Curtis's biopic, the "Control", five prizes have been won by the British Independent Film Diary – among other things, the prize for the best film.
He also received the prize of the principal, Sam Riley, who worked in a factory before the creation of Curtis, as well as the director of Anton Corbin, and the deputy member of Toby Kebell.

The Dutch photo, Corbin, which was previously known for the preparation of the U2 "Joshua Tree" album, still has two prizes, with the best organizer and the best beginner.
Another award for the event placed rock music in the center; Julien Temple Joe Strummer, a film about Clash music, took away the award for the best documentary film.
The best player's award was Viggo Mortensen, who was organized by David Cronenberg, to build a triller in London, as the leader of the "Cyrillic Promises" mafia.
Ray Winstone, reported on the role of a pregnant boy, participated in Richard Harris's prize for the great contribution to the British film industry.
The five-year-old dancer, whose name is Scum, "Ehkopon" and "Sexa" films are also featured, is currently participating in the production of a film called "The Kingdom of Indiana Jones and the Christian Cup".
Winstone is proud to be able to take over the lost star of "Camelot" and "Harry Potter" in 2002 named Harris.
"People like me have opened doors for people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney," said Winston.

In Saudi Arabia, 208 people were arrested in connection with terrorist attacks
São Tomé and Príncipe announced that 208 terrorists were detained in concentration camps, who were planning to attack an oil facility, as well as several church personnel and security forces.
According to the state television of the world’s largest oil exporter, one generation wanted to cross rockets.
Al-Kaida's supporters launched a campaign against monarchy, which has been carried out as the United States alliance since the 2003 Iraqi invasion.
According to TV news, eight main salts of foreign nationals led by a foreign public will launch an attack against an oil plant.
After an attack by Al-Qaida, the world's largest oil processor in Abqaiq in 2006, Saudi Arabia launched a 35,000-performance effort to protect buildings.
According to the Prime Minister's statement, 18 of the detainees belong to a seed which is an illegally passed by a person who specializes in interrogations.
The report also reported that the warriors tried to destroy eight arrows into the realm of the kingdom.
In the 22nd of these, plans were made to follow up on attacks against church leaders and security forces.
The government has called on church leaders to expand the Saudis associated with Iraq's war against the federal forces and the US's good support against the Muslim government.
The Al-Qaida wars are considered to be a significant part of the church leaders in Saudi Arabia, as they have been involved in the support of the government's royal family policy.
The organisation's wars - fueled by the leader of Al-Qaida's Saudi mother, Osama bin Laden, were aimed at the attack of foreign-based settlements, government buildings and energy-intensive facilities.
"The security forces have made powerful efforts in the past...five months" - a deputy minister of state television.
During the arrests in Medina, a 16-year "mediation" was also held, aimed at spreading "takfiri thought". Takfiri's thought is the ideology of the Sunni Muslim radicals, which supports strong action against the unconfirmed and believed Muslims.
The arrests also included 32 persons charged with the financial support of the militias.
The Earth’s Sky Can Focus on Earth’s Future
According to the findings of the scientists yesterday, Venus was once able to provide an adequate standard of living.
A European orbiting planet's data suggests that this planet is much more likely to look at Earth's vast crust than we believed before.
The Venus is the nearest planetary speech.
The size of the two planets is similar to that of their rotational wings, although Venus is a little closer to Naphos.
According to scientists today, billions of years ago, Venus could be subjected to very similar conditions on Earth and even housing conditions could be granted.
However, because of high greenhouse gas emissions, climate warming caused atmospheric erosion and a lower rate of trade in the planet, Venus has developed a different developmental approach in a mine.
The water has already been depleted from the globe, the temperature of the surface is quite sourced to the rescue of the floor, and it is destroyed by strong walls and flashy winds.
The findings of Venus Express of the European Agency for the Environment, based on a study of the planet for a year, draw a striking picture of how catastrophic climate changes can occur on Earth.
Fred Taylor, professor of the Oxford Institute of Physical Science, who is one of the leaders of Venus Express's mission, told the following: "Start to explain why Venus's weather is so large from what it has experienced on Earth despite the fact that the two planets are quite similar.
"With the help of our new data, it has become possible to produce a marketing document with the Venetian billions of years before it was created with conditions similar to Earth.
Police arrested in "dignified gold"
A round radioactive substance - the alleged uranus - was arrested by the Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
According to one police spokesman, three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The speaker did not confirm whether it was from a smoked uranium, but stated that the substance could have been given for $1 million (480,000 pounds).

Because Romany says that it is not worth calling a presidential election to answer questions that arise from a hero.
The president's presidential elections, however, joined in a debate on YouTube, which included questions for weekly voters and forwarded them to the candidates.
On the evening of November 28, none of the questions raised on the night of November proved to be as dramatic as the hero who asked the Democrats about global warming in his debate on the other party on YouTube.
However, the questions and answers have sometimes well reflected the situation of the Republican party approaching the next year's election.
Firstly, it was not known that the CNN producers involved in the financing of the dispute had chosen the YouTube clips that were distributed to them.
The first half of the debate dealt with the most complex question of immigration.
This issue is one of the most expensive items of the Republicans.
The CNN raised a number of unconfirmed votes that, if there were a delay in the number, they would discuss a number: the medium-term high-level agreement when the candidates were forced to make a statement on the question of the limits.
The worst and worst debate arose between Rudy Giuliani, who lived at the national level, and Romney, who was leading a decisive role in the elections held in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to change the picture of it, as it was too easy to deal with the illegal immigration issue under the mayorship of New York.
He accused Romney of setting up illegal immigrants to build the house.
The relationship between the two became particularly narrow when the questionnaires were interested in the support of the "amnestia" (which would ensure the possibility of permanent status and citizenship for illegal immigrants).
A few, less-vote representatives - for example, Duncan Hunter, California and Tom Tancredo - were able to look into the subject properly.
And even if none of them count the possibility of staying in the competition, it may be explained that they have begun to fight the noise of immigration.
At least a broad understanding of the immigration issue can be observed among the candidates: a common goal of strengthening the borders and a difficult step towards illegal immigrants.
This theme - whether the fear of Chinese measuring games and other relaxing factors coming from abroad - will help the Republicans within their ranks to achieve or minimize the division between liberals and Christian conservatives.
However, when other topics were discussed before, the debate was most inappropriate.
Giuliani had to deal with the question why he supported the gun control earlier.
John McCain and Romney raised the question of whether the symbiotic water supply is suitable.
Another question was whether the signers believed all the words of the Bible.
At the end of this discussion, Giuliani was able to point out that even though he viewed the Bible as a favorite book, he may not have understood Jonah’s account.
Another question arose as to whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, the first of the iowa elections to be held, who was able to respond to the expectations that the death penalty would be painful but needed.
When questioned whether Jesus should receive sufficient support, he said that Jesus would give more wisdom than he would go through the choice.
The competition is still open.
Huckabee's romantic marriage to iowa is connected with the liberal Ron Paul's collection of money and the evening after him.
The immediate advance of the two signs can explain that the couple's two sources have not yet been able to establish a common signal among the more familiar and more traditional aspirants.
In 1980 and 2000, there was a sign that united the party, who, in time and with conviction, fought a victory message that proclaimed America's greatness, and that the party found the common voice with both sources.
Now, however, the party is divided, and its consequences are invisible.
Workaholic pain
Other sections heading ahead of Gordon Brown; the driving path is unchanged
The British political botany don't seem too tender at this time.
No one has given his credit, no one's political service accounts, no one's got a box outside of marriage.
However, it was discovered that in the name of others, a rich businessman had spent more than $650,000 in excess of $1.3 million in excess over the last four years to the British Government's Labour Market, and that the party had not reported any of the things that had been done without the surrounded Gordon Brown.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister rejected the election, and when he made a statement - as the public opinion studies did not influence the outcome of the decision - without thinking about the ability of the British to understand, people were still hoping that Brown would provide a strong and effective government.
Instead, as Vince Cable noted, the leader of the liberal Democrats' increasingly inspired remarks, the once-populated Brown Stalin was transferred from Mr. Bean.
The late bank named Northern Rock made a bid to rescue the regulatory deficits and the lack of judicial capacity.
The proposals for changing the tax law encouraged business interest groups to meet with the government.
25 million people are affected by personal data, and the loss of tax authorities is an unimaginably large administrative failing.
In the House of Lords, three peacekeepers were accused of reducing military budgets, stating that the position of the Defence Minister was part of employment.
And now there's David Abrahams' secret gifts; Peter Watt, the Chief of Staff (former administrative director) has already been released.
These accidents don't mean Brown couldn't get back on the way back to the exit.
At the same time, governments can find a point that could then be ignored by the management.
People don't like politicians and don't trust them, but when a new group comes to power, they usually depend on their credibility.
As it becomes clear, however, that the Prime Minister is unlikely to be able to do so, and may not remain in his position for a long time, the end of the alleged mistrust will end: the civilisation army will begin to dispossess, the cabinet ministers will look at the media after the bad news; and the government will start protecting and be able to focus.
In a sense, Brown is in particular in a difficult situation, because he does not count "fresh blood" against other political leaders.
Whatever you'd like to have a relationship with Tony Blaire, it was still the best.
For example, the problems of Northern Rock and the tax statements are linked to decisions made during the Brown Finance Ministry.
And although the Blair-type interventions - such as the "moneylessness" case and the political party financing investigation - have not been directly involved, voters can rightly provide for the contrary.
Although Brown's situation is extremely unpleasant, it's not as bad as it looks.
The chasers are not as light as the tortoises show.
As for Mr. Bean, no one died, no one was directly sent to him.
And the torture - even with pain - can be the creation of guidelines that have always been promised by the Brown Stalin: a reliable, reliable, and small-scale government.
For example, you're a good example of a good deal about political donation.
The patriarch Abraham, who likened his gift to a gift of kindness, declared that he did not want to favor the public.
It may be, however, that the decision was not part of his influence.
The law prohibiting the anonymisation of large political supporters is clear and clear: the population has the right to know who is responsible for the leadership of the country.
Watt, who, according to his own report, knew about the measure Abrahams was illegal, but he was not aware of the illegal nature of it, but will certainly all be exposed during the hearings; as was Jon Medleson, the founder of the Labour Party, who was informed in October of the severe donations.
But to Brown, first of all, there are no lines: there's nothing behind it that would have been able to learn about these events, not even the fact that the payment of the great amounts was made after the arrival of Brown's office in June.
Until then, the Prime Minister has performed his duties.
The party's legal assessment was made as soon as possible, however, to strengthen its stability as a known instrument has been completed; the investigation - for the sake of security - entrusted a pension committee and a committee operating with the leadership of a judge.
In this case, the "learning Leak" wasn't too complicated.
The police are competent in case of an emergency.
In addition, Brown should arrange for other matters, such as the appointment of the Chairman of the Independent Committee on Rules of Management, which is not in operation for six months, or the prior approval of the effective reform of the political partial financing.
This would be in favour of the difficult work force for cooperation with the players and the separation of special financial relations with the communities - this would be a difficult challenge for Brown.
But he should look into some of the party's facts.
According to the surveys, conservatives are currently making serious progress; Brown has two years to restore the votes behind him; the only way to achieve the victory is to overcome the unbiased incompatibility and strong competence.

Is it threatening the US credit card market in the secondary market crisis?
If blood goes into the water, it's natural for cats to be present nearby.
Now that the US housing market is weakened, traders are focusing on the country's credit card market.
The Goldman Sachs analysts believe that if the crisis in the face of the crisis affects other forms of population credit, the loss of the credit card market can also be estimated at $99 billion.
The signs of disability are clearly visible.
The rate of the description of all outstanding loans has been increased and the rate of cancellation of the excess payment for 30 days has been increased.
HSBC reported $1.4 billion losses last month in the U.S. Consumer Fund, partly due to the financial deficit of card owners.
At the same time, the panic is early.
The rate of descriptions and late payments remains low.
Moody's credit rating institution calculates 3,89% of the late payment rate for the third quarter is less than a whole percentage of the historical average.
The reduction of the rates can be explained by technical factors.
The change in the U.S. rules of non-payment in 2005 resulted in a rapid reduction in the number of respondents to the insolvency and at the same time a significant loss in the credit card market; the increase in the number of claims (and this description rate) is expected, regardless of whether or not the total of the terms of the credit agreement is Romance.
The rate of payment, which shows the level of the monthly credit loss of consumers, is stable on the market.
In addition, the confidence in securities covered by the credit card is likely to be strong, despite the lack of structural funding in other areas.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup research company is estimated to be higher than 25% of the 2007 emissions volume.
The signs of the market crisis are clear on the credit card market: consumers are preparing a debt on credit cards to lose their residence.
At the same time, card issuers primarily take into account the cash flow and not the assets, so it is not likely that residences will be able to change the credit quality of creditors.
The situation of the creditors can be as beneficial as it is.
If the property is less than the price of the ticket, consumers will be encouraged to reduce credit loss; as a result, the repayment of debts in credit cards will take place in the priority line.
By changing the thresholds or the credit limits, card issuers may be able to apply the changeable conditions more quickly and more easily to the signatories.
This should be expected to reduce the risk of rapid recovery of the instruments.
"It's not likely that one day we'll wake up to fully appreciate the credit," says Gary Perlin, the Financial Director of Capital One.
If a subprime-significant crisis is less likely on the credit card market, the risk of increasing return is much higher.
If the prices of the reduced housing market and the return of the credit are reduced to America, the industry looks forward to the future without any doubt.
It's important to take care of those rapists.
British bankers accused themselves of committing crimes in the case of Enron
The three British bankers, former financial director of Enron, committed serious crimes against the court in order to investigate their role in the family that was held by Andrew Faston.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were declared innocent in his weekly family case, which states that they cooperated with Fastow in a private court held in 2000, which they wanted to finance at the expense of their employees.
Their negotiations began in January.
But in a court hearing, the U.S. District Court, Ewing Werlein Jr., recognized the crime committed in the courthouse.
Three former users of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group Greenwich NatWest became known in Great Britain during the two-year driving procedure.
The conclusion of an investigation of the case initiated after Enron’s summary of 2001 is still expected in the United States.
The first complaint against them in 2002 warned Fastow that he was one of the aims of the government's investigation to determine Enron's fate.
According to the charge against them, NatWest was arrested by three brokers in 2000 in order to prepare the family with Fastow and Fastow's best hand with Michael Kopper.
Fastow, who was responsible for designing an countless castle that belonged to Enron, was also the daughter of Enron, to whom the Greenwich NatWest invested.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had no knowledge of the participation in the subsidiary, but three British men knew that the interest had to be high.
A company managed by a Kopper purchased the bank’s share of $1 million in the subsidiary.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 to take part in this company.
According to the case, Fastow had recently informed Enront that the energy company would buy 20 million dollars of its value by Greenwich NatWest.
In fact, 20 million dollars were sold by British bankers, Fastow and others.
The charge is that the bankers are 7.3 million while Fastow, Kopper and the others are worth 12.3 million dollars.
In January 2004, Fastow admitted his double crime because of his role in Enron's conspiracy.
The British were detained three months later.
Fastow is currently sentenced to six years in a state federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper was sentenced to three years and a month in a teharcana prison.
Three English - speaking men were able to travel to the United States in the head of a $1 million prize.
Enron, the largest American company ever reported in December 2001, after the accounting stamps used for years could not continue to be removed by the millions of people who died as a debt or by the recipient, but in fact loss companies.
As a result of the merger, jobs fell to them, the market value dropped by more than $60 billion, and the value of pensions decreased by more than $2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, Enron's founder and former manager, Jeffrey Skilling, were sentenced to a trial for their involvement in the company's crime.
Skilling is currently spending more than 24 years in prison.
Lay's total murder, murder and other charges have been dropped by the man's death last year.
No Poverty in Moscow
A Guffstream G550 aircraft equipped with Rolls-Royce engine starts at $54 million, which will make a tank without interrupting the journey between Moscow and Los Angeles.
But this amount counts only for some Russian rich people.
Dan Firer, Guffstream's representative.
"I don't have anyone to make such a deal, because the machines are bought for private families or business leaders."
Mr. Firer counted the visitors for the four-day, exclusive, Milliomos in Vásar, which was held in powerful exhibition halls around the city.
In addition to the Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury items were delivered on the exhibition, hoping that the Russian novelties would be interested in everything, from the mahogany drilling jars into the diamond, 50 cents of heating.
Mr. Firer looked around at Porsche, a light orange set up at the station next door.
"A nice car, but it doesn't touch the pressure of our products," he said.
"The largest market in Russia is after private aircraft in the United States."
Looks like the Russian capital is sitting in the money as Dallas did in the light of the oil spill.
"We went through a similar process in the 1890s, when some American million went to Europe. These Americans were considered to be the materialists here," said Marshall Goldman, the promotion of the Davis Center for Russian and European Studies in Harvard.
In the 1970s, the Russians are now the most popular exchangers in the world, just like the Saudi Arabia and Japan in the 1990s.
The most legitimate luxury brands follow their share of the gold medal.
In another Moscow conference organized by the Luxusipar, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, LVMH shared its opinion on how to sell high-value products in markets similar to Russia.
(The conference was organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
According to Forbes, the list of top people in Russia is 53 billion lives, totaling $282 billion.
In addition, the number of Russian millionaires in the second half of the year is 103, totaling $670 billion, a study conducted by the Department of Economic and Monetary Research in the area of the former Soviet Union.
(On the basis of the World Bank's data, in 2005 there were 15.8 percent of the population living in Russia during my absence.)
"More than a hundred million lives in Moscow, that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a London sales and marketing representative of David Morris.
Nicole first participated in the purchase with the Russian trader, Soho Jewerry Group.
"The women are all unsatisfied, and the men are truly precious."
In the summer evening, two property market agents, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, all of them owned millions.
"I looked at the cars and I'm trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said young Yumatova, who was in his special emergency design suit, as if it had already been added to this release.
The purchase was first arranged for the new owners, those with brand-oriented Russian buyers, who were willing to travel for hours in the trade around a huge, digitally decorated place where they can find Cadillac Escaleds, platinum bags, Mvöenpick ice cream, regular billions of chairs, Dubai apartments and Gund Plus maces.
For the average people, the income will be EUR 30 ($44.57).
"The Russians like to know which brands are the most precious and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who took a home-looking position at the Dutch Porcelain producer, Royal Delft, in front of a falsifier, hand-drawn, painted with a blue cap.
"The Russians are certainly more interested in the things that appear."
In fact, the sellers here said that the old (based on the Russian tradition of 10-15 years ago) rich Russians had already been separated from the closed logos for markets in a limited number of markets that would not be made for a commercial sale.
Yet, thousands of people, including millions of people, millions of people, and tourists, spent their day in the ministry.
And some of them were bought.
On the first day of the show, Roman Ershaw, director of the King Koil's clothing company, told him that day two, $70,000 worth each, prepared from cement, cassmium and cotton, with a large gold mine.
On the first night of the day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, an A1 Moto salesman involved in the supply of high-density cars with modern tyres, calculated that the company sold Porsche for $170 billion for a Russian million.
Andrei Karapetian, the luxury car manufacturer for special purposes, L.A. Connection, sold three refrigerators on Friday afternoon to Rolls-Royce Phantom. The roots are similar to those of the chain chains and are worth $55,000 each.
The reporters also showed the instruments prepared for the owner of a Russian casino, which, according to Swarovski, led by Christians to see a roulette cross.
A four-pound price: $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire, who has been made from glass, and his wife's face, wants a picture of a circle of risk, will not be able to use these things too." Karapetian said.
"He's got 30-40 cars in his garage to protect them."
Despite the fact that many Russian customers are wealthy, Karapetian says that the "Russian million" expression today does not mean a great deal, but rather an increase in the wealth of the acquirers.
"He who bought property in Moscow four and a half years ago, he said, "Today is likely to be a millionaire if not in money, but at least a paper."
"There's more than you'd think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least have made the economy appear before the Russian company Alliance Continental.
The company has built four English-style telephone lines that have been destroyed by millions of dollars and counterfeits.
That's Karryev, the company told the marketing manager, the team printed 500 thousand fake notes to the millions of people in Vásar.
Many of the visitors stopped playing with the money, made lots of photos on their cell phone like cash chains, or just making a few million smugs.
"Look, in Moscow, everyone can feel themselves," said Karryev.
They're suspecting of a murder in New Jersey.
The day before the event, Ronald Livingston had looked at the "Just a Little Healthier" restaurant on the table and saw a nurse sitting on Cape Cod with two doors on the West Scott Avenue.
Not long ago a police driver arrived.
Then another one.
"Then I saw him as his doctor's car stopped," said Lord Livingston, one of the supervisors working in my restaurant on Sunday.
"Then I knew someone was dead."
The authorities found out that the dead woman was 41 years old, Olga Arroyo, who used to work as a assistant to the director of the network police.
The investigation is currently under way to establish whether the death caused by an intervention by an unidentified cosmetic seizure by the police without the permission of a person working under the West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet been able to determine what caused Arroya's death, but they hope that a few weeks later the toxicology tests will provide a light for this secret murder involving the high level of the network police.
Arroyo, who has been well-known in the department since September 2006, has worked as an assistant to the Director of Police, Gary F. McCarthy.
"He was loyal, brave and trustworthy," declared McCarthy Arroyo in a Saturday interview on a phone.
"He was my housekeeper.
He was my protector."
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was a former newak police officer, currently his wife, Jimmy Arroyo, who worked on the Czescipari Products Supervisory Committee, and two, a 14-year-old and an 11-year-old boy, and a young woman, left behind.
Eileen Walsh, the Union's lawyer, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the investigators were working on a statement that Mrs. Arroyo was a victim of an unauthorized seizure.
"It's a good chance," said Walsh.
"The test is still going on."
The authorities are reporting that about 3 hours a day they're going to be there at home on November
Mrs. 21 and Mrs. Arroyo were found on the couch.
They've already been declared dead on the scene.
More than a week went by and the police first sold very little about the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't tell me if the detectives had heard of Castro.
In the study, participants are investigating whether the house was functioning as a part of the medical system.
No one opened the door in Castro's house, where he was standing in the middle of the small front and a light from the back of the house.
At the front door of the pen, the car is equipped with an empty container with Etil Vanilin, which is used for the replacement of vanilia in foods and perfumes.
Two mountain bikes from Campoque turned to a narrow side.
McCarthy took over when she first arrived in Newark after 25 years in Newark by helping her to join the new city in her unusual and undisclosed political culture.
"He always said, "You'd better take care of this and that."
"He was always here when I arrived in the morning, and he was always there when I woke up at night.
He was in trouble."
The expectations of Fed's fraud lead to the destruction of the world's share markets
On both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, participants were welcomed yesterday, after the presidential statements of the Central Bank's reconciliation increased their hopes that Fed would be able to ease investment opportunities with further distortions.
The participation markets in both London and New York and Europe have been hit after Donald Kohn, who said that Fed President Ben Bernanke's best hands, had to respond "slowly and pragmaticly" to the continuous lack of flexibility in the financial markets.
In addition to the clear objective of Kohn to mark the new life credit mark on the markets, he stated that the current slowdown "partly restored the growth in the market at the end of September and October".
He said that if the increased disturbance continues to persist, it could increase the possibility for further restrictions on the credit conditions of households and companies.
In order to stabilize the credit conditions, the investors explained that Fed is ready to inject fresh capital to the US markets or even further cuts.
The reports were also a welcome influence on Wall Street, which is now more negative news about the US economy. For example, it was also a negative record of the number of American housing companies.
It also reinforced the impact of the investment report by the Bear Stearns Investment Bank, which allowed 650 employees and 4 percent of the global labour force to be paid for losses incurred in the sector of secondary-market dwellings in the United States.

In New York, the Dutch Jones industry averaged 331 points, increased by 2.55 percent and closed by 13.289.40 points, while the larger S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index 165.5 points, increased by 2.7 percent and closed at 6.306.2, and with this more than 39 fonts, it prepared the value of British blue-chip companies.
The German Dax 2.6 percent, while France grew by 2.3 percent CAC40.
The credit market default was renewed after the large auction organized by the European Central Bank of three months of interest, which had not been seen in the three-month run-off paper since April 2001, at a large rate of 4.7 percent to the European banks.
Following a similar increase in the English Central Bank, Libor reached the highest value since September, 6.59 percent, and the Bank of England was increasingly under pressure to follow Fed and the ECB, and to allow the London money market to be sold by the Dutch.
The decision is followed in England between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
He gave two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other.
Who's the English team to be active in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And in relation to the first test against Sri Lanka, who's even less important to make the decision?
The last question is in part new because David Graveney, president of the electors, who is temporarily carrying out this particular task, is helping Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan in the decision. On the other hand, because the head of the English chief executive, Hugh Morris, is beginning to deal with requests for a national, or at least one single electoral post.
Of the two players, it's the shortest one that doesn't get the sixth floor, but as it is known, life, and especially sports is often unfair.
It's never easy to tell how a person's reputation gets out of it, while there's no way to go beyond another lower level.
It's not just the cricket that it's hard to choose - a multi-subjective choice.
Did the time come for Bopara to make progress?
Is it fair to see Shah when this happens?
The same question can be asked in other areas of life, for example, when we say John Edwards and "Tubby" Banerjee, with two clear, excellent conclusions, would set the business before the decision-makers, while only one of them has a place.
Who can tell what level a cricket is without getting into deep water in a more serious competition?
Of course, data have a great impact on the decision, but the same is also important.
In a group, the player must take the captain's view at the right time in the cricket gate and get a regular chance for a passenger if he wants to become a big player once.
The voter's appearance is much more complicated.
For example, James Anderson played better in the last season, but he certainly counted the team on the first test, despite Stephen Harmison's being in good shape and very good for him.
Anderson, the first class of 32 was shot down and 33 ransacked his part in the tournament.
Chris Tremlet was only 29 years old, but both of them were already successful at the highest level, and they hope that in the future they will be.
Whether Shah or Bopara will play at Asgiriya Stadium, then this will be adopted on the basis of their opinions.
This decision may set up or disqualify any career, but it may also result in no special impact on the future.
Four years ago Sri Lankan Garreth Batty played all the same test and performed well with five caps and 40 useful rides, yet Paul Collingwood, who had been an outstanding and decisive test critic, who may even be underestimated today despite having acquired a double percentage point against Australians.
It is likely that in the Asgiriya Stanion, listening to the conservative experiences of Graveney, Vaughan and Moores in their conversation with the young Bopara, and dynamics, Shah will be able to give more experience.
They both say yes.
In addition to Shah, he has completed his four-year-old light and successful debut in the 88th Bombay test. His seven-year-old brother, 22-year-old Bopara, who also appeared in a series of cataracts, was the first 32th century.
However, the fact that the Middlesex player Shah was home in May, in Lorda, in a test against the West Indies, only 10 of you ran against the West Indies, and that the fighter Vaughan, who fought in the next game, seemed to have fallen into immediate opposition to the election that was still clearly seen in Bombay.
In contrast, Essex's universal power is a life-threatening and unsurpassed player.
Nothing can be done with the cricket ball, but it was well marked by the behavior outside the ball when a show opened up on the team's car station with a four-point Volkswagen.
He got smaller injuries and got a lot of it. Nevertheless, the legitimate thing he did was to take Vadaphone's (naturally sponsored) phone and call his remote guard, Alastair Cook, to ask him, "Did you see this?"
Bopara is a better professional player with classics. It produces good dolls for her moderate steps, and she's self-sustained and busy.
Choosing the right person is one thing and another is the right moment.
Maybe this is the true art of selection.
I'd personally give Bopara the chance now, which doesn't mean that I don't think Shah would give a big deal if - how the ceylon teas are hanging, - he would be the one who plays at the weekend.
Buses transport the passengers home to work and fight Al-Qaida
Since yesterday, the first buses from Syria come to Baghdad with the Iraqis who have taken their money or lost their visas, or with the reality of those who hope to return the order to the city.
There are also those who have come back to fight with the soldiers who have taken them away from their homes.
The Mansour bus station was already full of 800 passengers from Syria and Jordan who arrived from a Damascus busloading thousands of buses.
"Then I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," said Dr. Sabah al-Qubaisi.
"Today I went back because I saw what happened in Baghdad on TV and in the news and that the city is now safe.
"It is said that Mahdi's army has stopped killing people," he added, following Moqtada al-Sadr militia leader, who has now set up his own army.
A 38-year-old teacher from Amaryiah, who lived by the super-sounds, Qassim al Atwani and his two children were home because he couldn't renew the visa and because the Italian race prevented the Iraqis from doing business.
The neighbors of the Arab River called him and urged him to go home, saying that with the help of the American teams, he was able to get Al-Qaida out of his home in the capital.
One of the first arrivals from Jordan was a Soviet and peaceful tribal leader who fled from a border attack from the home of the northern Bangladeshi Sleikh, after his citizens began fighting Al-Qaida.
He came back to fight.
"Two days ago my friends called and said they had created an anti-Al-Qaida militia in Sleikh, and they needed my support and my son.
That's why I came back today" said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many have been told that the peace-enforced American troops in the capital has been defeated by armed civil forces who have been working with the United States since the invasion of the United States.
But they were even more forced to return from Damascus because of visas and material concerns.
51-year-old Salaam al-Samarrai gave voice to a wide-ranging look among the refugees, according to the Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's request to the Syrian government to direct the visa request for refugees to complete their home.
It is estimated that more than two and a half million deaths in the country have been reported to have been reported.
"All was fine until he did not make a visit to Syria to al-Maliki, and he did not pressure the government not to give them more visas for students, in order to move them home," said the Soviet peacekeeper.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who broke my house after I left."
One of the reasons for the decline of the forces was that the settlements were removed from the coastal areas, while the rivers were removed from the inhabited areas. As a result, the drought was reduced in many fields.
Many insist that the sudden appearance of refugees rejuvenates the tastes that can lead to even more wars.
Small Saar Videos - high-level training
The leadership of the smallest federal institution has played an important role in vocational training, which is based on international orientation.
In just one educational area, the Saar-Vids fight the same as the rest of the country.
"I explained five times yesterday in a Saar video that we are not French" - from the application of the 50th birthday of the smallest federal record.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the Saar's education system, which can be decided on the basis of the survey by the German Institute of Economics (IW).
In this way, higher education institutions - now only because of their traditions - work closely with neighbouring countries.
The Saarbrücken University was founded by the French in 1948.
The students here are now closed with two, actually three diplomas.
According to this, 15.6 percent of your foreign audiences are high.
However, most of them do not have high school performances in primary schools and universities.
"Saar video uses the opportunities for vocational training," explains Axel Plünnecke, a German Institute for Economics.
Young people have more than one fifth of their continuing education rights in school, with Saar videos more than seven percent of the federal average.
The possibilities of vocational and vocational training have also been well developed.
The infrastructure that serves two studies is the population's number in the second place in Germany.
In spite of the increased interest in training and training, however, the number of final sizes has decreased by yet another third in recent years.
The Ministry of Education of the Saar-Saar has therefore committed to marketing the higher education institutions, which are at the centre of the metrics.
"We started a number of reforms in general schools after the first Pisa study," said a spokesman from the Ministry of Education.
As a result, the government carried out comparative tests in its country.
In order for children to start learning early, it is the last spring's free year. It's a model that in time began to divide the other federal bonds.
If the performance of the students is steadily improved, only future comparative studies will be given an answer.
According to the Pisa survey conducted in 2003, the rate of risk-related students rose from 29 percent to 20 percent.
However, the overall performance of the Saar Views has not yet improved as far as the rest of the Union's content.
The buggers are getting better.
In the Pisa analysis, the main concern of the Saar-Vids is that the knowledge of foreign languages could, in the opposite case, be shown to be different in this area,
because neighbouring countries have a binding subject in their gymnasiums - even if the Saar-Vids are not French.
Head transfers the hours
In Venezuela, the clocks are different in the near future than in other parts of the world.
On 9 December, the President of Hugo Chávez will restore time limits in the Latin American country.
In the meantime, Chávez became a subject of controversy in Spain.
As Venezuela's official newspaper has announced, in a new law, Greenwichi time is reduced by four and a half hours.
In this way, the South American state will be part of a period that is not used in the world in any other country.
The U.S. opponent Chávez, among other things, made his decision that the United States forced the clocks based on all hours of the world.
In addition, on Sunday (as a local time) Chávez announced the termination of relations with neighboring Colombia for a reason.
The Nordic nationalist stated that while the conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, neither he nor the Colombian government had relations with the head of state.
"I can't do this because of my own dignity," Chavez declared, who advocates a reform of the Constitution on which the citizens of Italy have to deliver an opinion on a referendum Friday.
The reform would significantly build power in the country.
The disputer's choice was Uribe's decision to withdraw his mandate from Chávez to negotiate with Colombian Marxist torturers.
He bought Venezuela with his decision on Thursday, Chávez.
He's talking about everyone in Spain.
In the country, a new mobile phone call came up: "Por que no te call" (Why don't you get your word), - so that's what you've already spent over half a million people on the Internet.
The statement comes from János Károly, the king of Spain, who was so well-informed at the latest in Latin America that the rulings of the Balodian populist were so popular that he was willing to make it.
In 2007 the reduction in beer poses a threat to Germany
According to a forecast, a real-life reduction threatens Germany's workers in spite of the strong concierge.
The prosecutors have supported their psychiatry's advance with excellent intentions.
According to the figures of the Hans-Bröckler Foundation, in 2007, users could actually be counted less than in the previous year.
"This loving development, the increase in the general commercial tax, and the rapid increase in food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the "Bild" newspaper, the Macroeconomic and Computing Institute.
In the case of unemployment insurance, new burdens may also be imposed on employees.
The Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück announced in his statement to the newspaper "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the reduction of decent and fair unemployment insurance by 3.3 percent would take place in the new year.
In any case, the German Federal Labour Agency must not make it so difficult to proceed to the Union for credit or support, the German Social Democrat Party, the SPD's policy.
It was well known that the price of food and oil products has resulted in the highest inflation for 13 years.
In the annual comparison, prices increased by 3 percent.
The Venus for the Earth's Snare
In spite of the difficult weather, Venus is more like Earth than it has been supposed to be: in the vicinity of the "Venus Express" of the European continent, and in the wild, it has covered the surfaces of the earth as it is in the earth.
Nearly three decades, scientists estimate that Venus will be extinct.
The "Venus Express" European Army has been providing evidence of an electromagnetic cloud in the atmosphere: The vegetarians of the vegetarians of the vengeful vengeful vegetarians of the veto of the venuszon can spread over the surface at a height of 56 kilometres, known as Christopher Russell of the Scientific Journal of the United States of America.
According to the famous "historic theory", candles have been introduced to the evolution of Earth's life: according to the theory, the vocalists have initiated reactions in the ocean leading to the formation of the amino acids, the building blocks of life.
This is not the case with Venus: "If there had ever been life there, it could have been in very early times," explains Sean Solomon from the Washington Carnegie Institute.
Currently there can be at least a living organism on the surface of Venus: the circle is hundreds of times larger than the Earth, and the temperature levels sometimes reach 500 degrees.
"It may be that Vênus is a criminal on Earth, but still a criminal on earth," said Russell.
The main question of the Esa sentencing is why you are on a completely different path of development in the volume and size of the Earth.
The beginning of the Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone in the Venus research, because since the beginning of the 1990s, there has been no time left to explore this planet.
The latest research results already shown in the article "Natura" are not merely proof of the uniqueness of the Vénussian Sun.
"It is also shown that the neighboring planet's similarity to Earth is greater than we had previously assumed," Esa said.
In addition to the well-known North-West of the North-West, researchers have discovered a much faster superpower in the South-West.
The present reminds us of the aircraft of the Earth's Southern Hemisphere, the research group conducted by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Astrophysics Spaziale e Physics Cosmica.
The second largest planet in the solar system is almost the same as its Earth, and it is nearly as large as the Earth.
The so-called Esthian star also celebrated Christmas for almost 225 days.
However, it is much slower to turn around its own coast: one Friday takes 243 days to land.
Although the temperature of 460 Celsius-focused at the pressure of the Vénus 92 bar is almost as low as the Earth, scientists conclude that both planetary conditions are very similar.
Both of you got water, which remained on the Earth as the ocean, while Venus was gone into the world.
And as long as the earth's carbon dioxide is bound to the carbon atoms, Venus is a major part of this atmosphere.
Takes Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lamá
Köhler, the German President of the Federal Republic, follows the conclusion of the debate between the parties, which is about the adoption of the Dalai Lama office of Chancellor.
In a related way, he criticized the SPD for attacking the Chancellor after September's adoption.
The President of Germany, Horst Köhler, is concerned about Germany's view, and has recommended that the higher education be completed in the context of the ongoing debate about the adoption of the Dalai Lama.
"In this matter we should not show ourselves as a divided nation to the outside world," Köhler announced to the Tradesblatt tab.
Köhler also expressed his understanding that Angela Merkel had adopted the Dalai Lama in September.
"Human rights are equally applicable to me even if I respect the differences between cultures," Köhler said.
It is clear to all that Germany needs to deal with the political balance of foreign policy, the President of the public, but Merkel has been protected from the charge of pursuing a new Chinese policy by the Chancellor.
"The federal office has not broken up with the traditional "a Chinese" policy.
This is also clear in China," Köhler said.
By means of the French-Walter Steinmeier Minister for Foreign Affairs (SPD), the Dalai Lama's adoption of a vote was overstated and therefore became the target of attacks in the Union.
Steinmeier, among other things, complained about the EU's demand policy on foreign policy.
Following the adoption of the Dalai Lama Chancellor Office, weeks of disturbances took place in the German-Chinese context.
Thus, the Chinese leadership not only invited the German Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD) but, according to the SPIEGEEL information, the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the two countries also opened.
Wen Jiabao, China's Head of State, has now referred to Angela Merkel's Federal Chancellor as having failed to accept the Dalai Lama.
China rejects that when European politicians officially accept the Tibetan religious leader, it has strengthened the Chinese position Wen Jiabao.
The Dalai Lama's actions and words indicated that he was trying to break up Tibet from China and other parts of the Tibetan region that are also included today.
Schäubl from prisons similar to France
Utcai mergers with police, shootings, loud cars: Wolfgang Schäuble from prisons similar to French.
All must be done to prevent social dissatisfaction in Germany from turning into street forces, following the Federal Deputy Minister.
Barcques were beaten, randomized with a series of gunpowders for the police: following serious arrests by young people in France, Wolfgang Schäuble, Federal Deputy Minister of Defence (CDU) in Germany, is following similar developments.
"We have to say that we have the social bomber, and don't break into force.
We really need to get this thing done," he announced to the newspaper "New Presse" in Hannover.
Not all young people are convinced of the rapid change in social truth.
Associations, departments and communities are currently working intensively to solve the problems, Schäuble said.
It's not just the integration of immigrants.
"From the integration stage until the Islamic Conference is closed the first success will be demonstrated."
But it's too early to solve the threat situation.
Schäuble at the same time pointed out that there are no urban and sociological problems in German cities such as France.
In the city of Paris in the north, young people fought heavy street fights with the police during the last few nights.
Cars and public buildings were also rented in Toulouse.
In view of all of this, the Head of the Federal Government, Kenan Kolat, the leader of the German Türuk Communities, has been more active in the area of integration.
The French prisoners warned Kolat about the "dangerous dangers."
Although the situation in Germany is not as comfortable as in France,
It's still necessary to act.
Kolat said that the unemployment rate is "higher than average" around young people under 25 years of age from immigrant families.
You should take care of more education in front of everyone.
He said, "We need to give you a perspective for young people."
However, the leader of the Török Community added that "social care within the family" is much more visible in Germany than in France.
Many young people who come from an immigrant family do not want to ruin what their parents have built up here.
Kolat warned, "We must be part of this."
Young people need to "as soon as possible to be able to work and participate in education".
At the time in Paris, in the city of Williers-le-Bel, there was a complete silence during the night.
Hundreds of police were ready to enter, covering the area with a helicopter light.
The competent authorities made a report on three guards and a number of abusive frauds and car accidents.
Since the report, a security unit of over 1,000 head of the train is concerned about the delay.
The police are always ready to intervene until necessary, after visiting Deputy Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie in the city.
During the late spring night, 80 police officers were injured in the aftermath of the Viliers-le-bel detentions.
The next night, the prisoners were transferred to Toulouse.
The injuries were due to a traffic accident that cost two young people their lives on Sunday.
According to the Court's first findings, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
High-ranking Angela in the office
The attempt by the Chancellor to prove that the coalition is over - and there is no hope for it anymore.
In what country does the federal office actually live?
In the general debate of the Bundestag, it must be determined after a general and non-discriminatory action: not here - not in the country where the government would be.
Yes, he sent back his accusation, Angela Merkel, which said he was too focused on foreign policy.
It's provincial, it's the answer, and that's the way it's just a statement that you don't want to understand what critics are talking about.
In the Association of the Society, he made it clear to everyone how much views they find.
At the time, neither particular interest nor empathy could be felt about the country's problems.
Instead, High Commissioner Angela: a politician who is driven by reality, who goes into foreign politics, and there is only uncertainty.
The example of climate protection: The Heilidendam Decision does not take into account itself, but it listens to how climate goals should be achieved in the country.
At the same time, with regard to suicide - such a degree of intolerance would not have been allowed two years ago by the President of the CDU.
Now it's possible in the phrase that prosperity has become a positive influence on people.
The good news thus gained as a pragmatic personality is worth a lot of money, giving the dictionary a solution to the problems instead of the words.
However, the internal political problems in the Office of the High Commissioner are only a few things.
The problems of poverty and low income?
It's just a few seconds worth it.
It's a lot to tell you about how hard it is to follow language when it comes to family marriage.
On three occasions, Merkel has to force him to combine a half-and-half-a-half of the building's statements.
If it's about concretes, it's in foreign fields.
Roham County
During the debate of the Republican presidents in Youtube, the two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, have been subjected to a difficult transition - and now they must be kept from a different sign.
The complexity of the characters has already been highlighted on the first subject.
Because Romney's against Rudy Giuliani, he made New York "for the rescue of illegal immigrants."
In contrast to his own serious facts, he said, "I would say that his own home served as an illegal alien in the absence of his own home," he returned to Giuliani, and that many of the former rulers of Massachusetts had been employed as an independent person.
The candidates go to Roham: As the Republican team continues to have no uniform support, the eight presidents are willing to use the debate at CNN in front of everyone to undermine his faith.
Internet users send their own 30 second-per-per-minute videos via YouTube, almost more than short-components.
"We have come to Hitler's power with the sort of insulationism," says John McCain under the opposition, Ron Paul, who follows the immediate exodus from Iraq alone.
Romany's head is also fundamentally empty in the valley of Vietnam, when he tends to refer to the so-called Waterboarding, the method of listening, which stimulates the flow of water.
That the campaign's important themes are still too prominent in Iraq and the persecutions, the reactions of the Florida public of St. Petersburg are shown.
Hangos taps occur in the area when conservative values are discarded and the future tax exemptions are refused.
At the same time, the weaknesses of the two signs will be further demonstrated.
"I've been wrong," says a criminal, Romney and asks forgiveness before the supporters and television viewers because in 1994 he dropped his voice with a heavy blow.
On the other hand, Giuliani is upset when she asks for an explanation from the Bible.
Musharraf first as a civil ruler
One day after his return from military service, he was sent back to Pakistan to take over as President of the effective Musharraf.
This is the end of eight years of military service in Pakistan.
Mr Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, was brought to trial for a further five-year term of office.
The Pakistani television from the capital, the Islamic President's palace, delivered the ceremony.
Musharraf is committed to the law, and his people are doing good.
He handed over his trusted military commander, Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus allowed international pressure from the United States in front of all.
After eight years of indiscriminate control of the former courts, the government is now in the first position a civilian state.
Musharraf's return as chief commander of the armed forces led to the pursuit of peace and resistance.
Further important requirement is the abolition of the exceptional situation announced on 3 November by Musharraf.
According to Major General Muhammad Qayum, Musharraf will no longer be able to eliminate the extraordinary situation that fulfills another requirement.
The Supreme Court of the country in which Musharraf, after the declaration of the exceptional situation, held sympathetic rights with him in early November, refused to object to the re-election of the State on 6 October last week.
At the time, in the northern part of the country, he lost five soldiers and four more wounded in the aftermath of a battle against a military force in North Washington.
According to information published by the military spokesman, the bomb is on its way to the Afghanistan border.
Krauttrick's dads return.
You were once again the German superhero of the week: Harmonia's three bandits have re-enacted his voice until the end of a Berlin concert.
With the reconnaissance application of the lights from "Live 1974" there is a desired recording.
They were better known abroad at the time.
The reported sensation killed the body in the person of three agreed men around the dinner table.
For everyone is his own voice, his own lips, and his own buttons before everyone.
Dieter Moebius is the 63-year-old white man in the middle of the throne.
On the other hand, young Michael Rother, who is 57 years old, has been experimenting with a laptop and guitar.
The public is looking better at 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedellius and concentrates on the console.
We're all making some noise, including one-time rhythm.
And sometimes it's almost like a traditional song.
However, you don't seem to be particularly disturbed.
It was a great surprise to the Krautrock singer's favorites that you were in harmony with Harmonia again.
What we can now say: As a result of a proper follow-up, we can determine that the name is passed on to the collective populace, but in no case has left any remaining traces of this band to be painfully missed after 32 years.
But why can't I celebrate the lives of the Germans for a few weeks?
Most importantly, what we call crautock is always more valued in England and America than in his own home.
When the singer, who was still alive together with his fellow members, gave the Echo prize for the instrument in 2003, the German pop forms were on the ground.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers were released, even the La Düsseldorf and the New! colleagues said thanks, the surprise would be infinite.
At the concerts, Michael Rother was hit by Red Hot Chili Peppers on his stage.
Homelessness and foreign acceptance are at the same level as two sides.
The memory is already overemphasized by harmonia because the trio has only existed for two years, and during this time, it has had less effect than others have had in the past.
Moebius and Roedellius had already played with Conrad Schnitzler in his art with the many promising name Cluster.
At first, they played at the pool under the Berlin Schaubühne.
Then, in Düsseldorf, they have a loan financed by the church from economic considerations.
He's been helping Kraftwerk together for a short time, and in this way he's probably the most gratuitous German band that's got his reputation as the Neu! guitar.
After 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster music in their singing in Weserberglandi Forst.
There, in Alter Weserhof, they lived in a 16th - century Roman city as communists.
Less ideologically than in the I. communism, where Roedelius was still concerned as a babysitter.
Our life is more of an art.
It's probably from his eyes that the harmonia Ottenstein Dalarda has been found in this way to be their art.
Some of these things have been determined by Harmonia.
The first album is entitled "Music von Harmonia" and the next "De Luxe".
Despite the song of the lasa and her lover, she suffered a material need at the same time.
The collection didn't ensure that they found themselves alone.
The "Live 1974" CD was taken up in a concert held in Greece, before a record number of almost 50 in front of the audience, so someone remembers.
The harmony and regular practice of hormonal violence was the idea of Rother.
For Roedellius and Moebius, it's a moral requirement.
The gang reported a breakdown in 1975.
Rother was tied up with the esoteric and held up from the albums like the "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster has been reborn in the eighth century, which has been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
Thanks to the Greek live album Herbert Grönemeyer.
His audience, known as Greenland, set fire to think of Krautrock as a German personal gift of his life.
In this context, Neu! has already been presented in the same way as Roedellius' speech.
Harmonization of Berlin’s Cultures is taking place in the House.
Of money, within the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, the author of the manual entitled "Krautrick Sampler" and the British archipelago.
He's also in charge of Loveparade, and Dr. Motte.
It's all about the effect of Krautrock on the next popzene season.
In this regard, the Harmonia provided the supersede with an adequate location.
Brian Eno's conclusion, along with the most surprising sound, goes into the space: "The only true song, his future."
They're pictures of the producer in a parachute room with Harmonia.
Adding additional black-white lights from hair-adhesive equipment will serve the final construction.
In the past, the three vets are re-engaged with improvisation.
This only makes it possible to set microphones to the organ and to dodge with the ability to detect sound effects from the system itself.
It looks like an electric sound today.
Three, you're a big bartender in technology.
Not even the housewife has changed anything.
Barbara Morgenstern's lead is warm and soft, and sings "Aaaaaaaah!" in a beautiful part of the experience.
Because the Krauttrick was always very english.
He never talked about rock.
The students were less sought in the blue than in the major art schools (Can), in the technical knowledge (Kraftwerk), or in front of the artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
If someone's got '68' out here, he doesn't go in the wrong way, and the Harmonia doesn't even let himself out of rest yet.
Even more valuable than yourself is the bottom line of their thinking.
Where does the music begin, and where does it end?
It can strongly influence the person, or it can be provided with moments of exceptional happiness.
Richard Gere simply isn't Chinese enough
Two films are replayed with the Balkan war through "The War" and "Mörderischer Frieden."
But not one of them is convincing.
The basic idea or too much towards action and shooting, or too sensitive.
You don't even help Richard Gere in the "Probation."
First of all, the good news is: Although the two war criminals, Karadzic and Mladic, still hiding in the Balkan mountains, still there, were found in the Bosnian war's dark backyard again to the dancer Richard Gere.
In recent years, we have lost sight of the greatest man in the eightties, as the role of a number of women's sensitive films and a number of press conferences on Buddhist themes has also taken our pleasure in getting to know them.
And I mean, immediately Richard Gere's biggest idea is that maybe we'll still see the film "Breathing" c.
Wonderful, refreshing design: In addition to Simon Hunt's design, the artist who was created by Gere could have become what would have become if the series and filmmaker had not been so hard for him: A man who had spent most of his years behind him in the past, but his painting was still an important part of his former beauty.
However, this week's production of "Mörderischer Frieden" of the film and at the level of the film called "Balcan War" will continue to continue, despite a number of donations, only the final series of films about the Balkan war.
The film "Mörderischer Frieden" should not be lost much: The film about two German soldiers serving in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who have saved a Serbian woman from Kosovo's doctors, and one of them loves her as soon as possible.
While welcoming that this is not the time to portray the organs as all the wrong reasons, a film about the content of the television shows is too quick to be taken in shooting and event events.
"Cobra 11" is a box with a car instead of a war.
In this respect, for example, in the case of the "Courage" it is possible to examine why there has not yet been actually one really good film about the Balkan war.
The three U.S. reporters' history, who are excited to investigate the war capital of the Serbian army on the name of Roka, with other organizers and other vendors (in both Richard Shepard's personal union) may have become a new "Apocalypsian now".
Because history shows an amazing similarity: In both cases, small groups tend to take the forest to the end of what the army is unable to do, and in both cases the journey is going crazy.
One of the reasons for the "Creation" is that you simply don't let Simon Hunt be the Chinese who's listening to his heart as you first show him.
No, and as a result of the marketing book, he also spent a romantic relationship with a Muslim woman who was murdered in later times.
The "Courage" will end when the reporters arrive in the format of the last five minutes of the film, which was not possible for Nato, CIA and the whole world for five years: they will take the war crime and deliver it to the Mohamedan Bosnians for the sake of justice.
It's so bad that a person would become the most popular in the Hague International Court of Justice because of the crimes committed against the logic of music.
And the film's goal is to be a deep human.
It is appropriate to state that Karadzsic and Mladic are still free and that it suspects Americans and the French (which is, in fact, still extremely united) that they do not proceed in an intensive manner due to secret political affairs.
But good and bad are sometimes so similar to people that a famous Brecht verse comes into the picture.
In this report, the following is written about the famas of the Asian demon found in the writing table: "In the face of fear of the plague, which tells us what the plague is. "
Films such as the "Creation" have the same masks of human hair, but they show what kind of pressure it is to be.
This problem is not limited to the work of films about the Balkan War.
It was recently announced in the newspaper that all the Hollywood film about Iraq was so loud.
We can add: There's not yet one good movie about South Africa.
I'm just saying it's always valid: if a star is caught in the world's crisis zones or aquariums, then anything comes out of it like "The Treasures of Freedom" with Patricia Arquette, "without Borders" with Angelina Jolie, or "The True Child" with Leonardo Di Caprio.
It is possible that these conflicts are just too close to time.
Because they had to be removed for decades while Hollywood was able to film a good movie from the Holocaust with the "Schindler List" film.
Some movies are probably still being played - because today’s Chinese war has become classic, such as “The Snare,” “Apocalypse Now” or “Full Metal Jacket” films have not been celebrated in their lifetime as a single masterpiece.
But imagine that today, when all mass murder is real in time, there will be two regular cameras coming into our home, just too much about the world's conflicts.
And this removes the books of commerce from ignoring the truth that would be needed to tell good stories.
Because at the end of "Lenny or not" or "The dictator" they succeeded so well because Lubitch and Chaplin didn't even know how terrible the nation is.
Maybe you don't have to do the right thing if you want to make a good movie.
Maybe we should put Lawrence Norfolk, the regenerator, into a very far-reaching artistic view.
When the historical kingdom "The Lemprière-lexicons" and the war between the Balkan war got him confused, he replied, "It's just because certain things never change.
The big cities will always be terriblely dangerous, people will always be killed in a fair way, and wars will always be fought in Yugoslavia."
Von Beustot is being criticized for dropping the Olympics
The determination of the mayor of Hamburg to organize the Olympic Games has turned to a high level of criticism in political and economic life.
Many still want to fight to organize the water games.
However, Von Beust warned the facts in the course of the opportunity.
Hamburg's Chief Trader Kamara, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described the referendum as "unfailing to the economic environment".
No other project has recently released such powerful motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this objective, we could not maintain a level playing field."
Schmidt-Trenz pointed out the signal not to push the project, but to work on a long-term initiative, "which starts from modified time coordinates".
Ole von Beust, mayor of the city, has been quoted as saying that the ambitions of Hamburg for Olympic games are not real until 2028 at least.
"Not Hamburg decided on the Olympic bid, but the German Olympic Sports Association," declared von Beust to the WELT Online.
He called for a decision by the Sports Federation at the beginning of December on the proposal for the Olympic Games for 2018.
"To this end, our participation means so much to us that our general thought is not going to be real in the 2028s."
However, we don't finally give up the dream, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) has expressed its regret over the reports of von Beust.
This made the impression that Hamburg does not intend to play the Olympics in the next 25 years.
"It's too early for us to break up an opportunity by breaking our plans now," announced Sunday Günter Ploß, president of the HSB.
The return on request shall be contrary to the statement made by the President of the Senate, who accepted at the General University of Germany at the meeting of the General School of Sport.
The offer made to the University of Von Beaut Hamburg in 2015 was the same as that of the Hamburg Olympic Games.
The University of Sport has only started last week as a candidate city in Hamburg.
The SPD’s civil group urged the senator that he had left no valuable time for the hamburger building.
"The development of Kleiner Grasbrok has been on the horizon for years, because it has been moving along with the Olympics and opposed the building," declared two SPD representatives, Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD continued its launch in the case of Kleiner Grasbrook, along with an integrated plan for the integrated use of the Olympics and the later residential uses, the CDU placed the volume, on the one hand, on the other.
The 2012 bid for the Olympic Games in Nyári Olimpiai has changed a great deal at the time in Hamburg.
However, Hamburg went to Lipcs.
They're not Warhol's wings.
The one that connects Sweden's beliefs with each other, Ikea, and you don't think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently produced in Sweden, dark colors are added to the list of Warhol works.
The nine-year-old "Stockholm Type" Brillo Box is a lot of counterfeiting.
After a couple of months of doubt about the origin of the Swedish tab "Expressen" by Andy Warhol of 1968 Brillo Boxainak, the result of the internal investigation of the stockholm Moderna Museum came to an end: The bridge Hultén, a former museum director of the moderna Museum, in 1995, was awarded the sixth Brillo Box - and with a high probability of hundreds of additional "Stockholm type" boxes in the international art market.
The history of long and complicated, artistic and curatorial patterns is a barrier to the chain.
Warhol founded the first Brillo Boxait in New York in 1964 - the Black-Brillo Black-white-shaped cardboard of the "Brillo" flag box.
Their work in a exhibition held in Moderna Museum in 1968 - with the agreement of Warhol - set out hundreds of Brillo files from the map: They were not from Warhol, but were transported directly from the Brillo Carton.
It wasn't about works, it was about soap operas, it's just a showbook.
At the same time, Warhol granted permission to manufacture some Brillo-freedom in Sweden, which was not established in the Moderna Museum.
The modern witnesses are now talking about dozens of stories that were duly confirmed as the Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box under the "Stockholm-type" heading in the art and sale history.
Some of them were sold for over 100,000 dollars.
The problem is, however, that Pontus Hultén, the legendary museum manager of the latter, falsely claimed that in 1968 hundreds of cows were produced and set out in Sweden, which he then left Warhol.
In fact, Hultén 105 vessels were manufactured in Malmö only in 1990 for a St. Petersburg exhibition.
However, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, founder of Moderna Museum's main art studio in the museum's property, also examined a box with six Brillo Box in its own possession, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: the printed pages were first laid down and discarded, and then the white olives were removed.
Unlike the other structures of the 1990s, it is claimed that the paintings were directly drawn up, without foundation, on the market board, not on the oil, but on the acrylic.
"The artist did not confirm these faces, so they should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo Boxainak," says Lars Nittve, Director of Moderna Museet: "If the New York 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' does not decide otherwise, moderna Museet will be listed as a second/affixed material in its collection."
