The Czech dragons invested more than 31 billion vehicles in modernization.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the last six years, public transport has invested more than 31 billion kroner to modernise vehicles.
A third of the vehicles are currently equipped with air conditioning, and half of the trains have a new closed WC system.
The amounts for modernization in individual years with the exception of 2012 are still gradually declining.
In the last six years, Czech roads have invested more than 31 billion kroner in vehicle modernisation.
A third of the vehicles are currently air-conditioned, and half of the trains have a new closed WC system.
The money spent was shown to reduce the average age of two years in trucks and self-employed units and six years in classic cars.
Most of the investment has given transport to regional transport, with 60 per cent of the money reported, and 40 per cent of the company has invested in the reconstruction of long transport vehicles.
The average old truck and unit are currently 19 years old.
Modernised older vehicles, however, are counted as completely new in this indicator.
If modernization of vehicles is not calculated, the average ageing age of COD vehicles would increase by 10 years.
Some older people are in the middle of a personal train whose average age at the start of modernization is 23 years old.
If only years from the date of production were taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
Classic fittings consisting of wagons and trucks, however, in recent years from Czech and international railways are progressively mixed and are replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the train was killed from 280 to 223 buses, similar to the number of classic cars from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the half of the year.
In particular, the transporter was driven by old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening during the journey.
From January to July, the transporter had to collect 110 of these vehicles.
From the investment that is planned for the vehicle park in the near future, it is possible, for example, to purchase 50 cars for speed up to 200 km per hour, which the carrier plans to install on the international line Praha - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for purchases of electric units for Turkish speed trains.
The contract shall be counted with a total of up to 30 motors and 20 electric units.
The authorities of the fourth year are aware of illegal advertising, unable to get rid of it.
We're simply powerless, they admit.
For the fourth year of the online edition of the newspaper Actually.cz follows the story of the billboard in southern Czechs, which now loves motorists to visit Lipna, where there is not only a tourist interest in the roots of the trees, but also an Olympic park.
Remote managers know they're right there, but they say they can't do anything about it.
Similar ads are hundreds, maybe thousands, throughout the country.
According to officials, there is a court law on wine which is not possible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
They need a complex bureaucratic package.
In the meantime, the company changes the name and the office is short on it.
Or it's enough to place a few meters of advertising and the official process has to start again.
The direction of the train and the distance four years ago acknowledged: in the main mind of the Czech Budějovic in Lipno, the advertising billboard stands on our ground in the state train.
Three months, however, officials were not required to remove unauthorized transfer structures with a fine inert poster.
It's like no one's gonna mind that they're standing right next to the vehicles in a ten-foot protective belt where there's nothing to be done for safety.
Drivers claim that billboards can't be used simply because they're legal.
You need to put him down and take him away.
"We can't just let it happen," says the spokesman of the Leader of the Railways and the remote Nina Ledvinov and refers to the complex bureaucratic package that the removal of the billboard has to pass under the law.
The case of this particular billboard, whose judgment started online now.cz details on the fire, is not unique and points to a general problem that cannot be resolved effectively and quickly.
Only in the southern Czech Republic did the edition count the dozens of similar mobile ads placed firmly against the rules of the vehicle or in its vicinity.
It's similar to other countries.
"We find it difficult for companies to get rid of refugees," confirmed the head of the Committee of Transport of the Czech Republic National Authority Jíří Klas, whose similar experiences solves.
According to the Class, it's a wild law that officials are bound by.
Firstly, the owner of the billboard has to celebrate the announcement to leave.
Only the chief companies are often inadequate or know the fine that has already been described in the past when the problem has begun to become more detailed: enough mobile station with advertising to place a few meters and officials can make the previous call to remove the black hole into the basket.
That's because the office has to specify exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
"If a person fails to agree with her and her associates immediately, she will be taken into consideration as a new device and we must re-examine the owners," explains Jiří Klas.
The new law can't help.
The amendment could bring about a new law which, from September of next year, prohibits billboards in the distance and also restricts them in road I.
Critics point out that the rules for violating illegal and easily transmissible advertising will remain the same as they have so far.
And the authorities don't like it.
Companies can still make tens of millions of dollars a year on rentals and no one can afford them.
For example, the billboard hanging on Lipno belongs to the Commerz Billboard company.
Officials know her well: the Czechobudjevic Master of the Czech Republic is currently conducting three management procedures for the design of the billboard.
The company is at risk in every thirty-one operation.
It's about more ads that were not allowed to be placed in the protective belt of Class I train.
The proceedings are not over yet, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the Committee of Transport of the Cheskobudjevice Magistrate.
Advertisement, which is currently interested, does not yet represent these cases, but will soon arrive with the highest likelihood.
According to the RDD, Nina Ledvin's company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case would be received on the table by the national authorities and most likely by the Magistrate officials.
Commerz Billboard belongs to those suspicious companies that are unable to contact.
He doesn't need mail and the official seat on Zizkova was canceled more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the company went to the South-South businesswoman Anton Fischer, who had made a sharp contrast with the head of the Czech representative of Hyundai.
Fischer, whose company Euro Billboard is located from the Comerz Billboard and offers it to investors, but in the past he refused any connection.
This year on the market, when the RSD began to take an active interest in the advertising on Lipno, Fischer allowed state officials to send a letter to the secret company Commerz Billboard to his pension, where the company is definitely new.
Even from this address, no administrators have so far been called.
Fucking fight.
Similar drying or non-visual changes in seats are not unusual.
One firm, we passed two million rounds a few years ago.
She just changed the name and the ICHO and it didn't work out.
The executioner returned the case, the ads continued, perhaps elsewhere.
We are too weak against similar companies and their business practices.
It's like a war with windmills, recognizing anonymity under the condition of keeping one of the officials.
No one's gonna solve the new law in this regard yet.
Currently.cz spoke to several Members who had a problem.
They haven't had any activity yet.
On the contrary, the Members who wanted to extend the deadline for the retaining of billboards in main Czech communications appeared.
The government has denied it.
Billboards are not only for the whole country but also national and current policies are very sensitive and some of the subject of self-defence.
On the one hand, he knows about the company demand after their restriction, on the other hand, he needs it himself because of the insers in the pre-emptive campaigns.
I don't stop the idea that if something doesn't work, we need to change the laws.
Farmers lose less crops this year, but more fish and mother, estimate statistics.
According to the Czech Statistical Office, the rate of harvest this year will be 6.7 per cent lower than the moon.

On the other hand, this year there will be a gap between the fish and the mother.
The pests are 3.9% more than a year ago when they received 1,256 million tons of lead.
The annual level of motherhood could be 2.5 percent higher than lower.
The expected decline in the production of cereals is due to a reduction in hectares of 3.7% to 5.71 tonnes of hectares and a decrease in personal areas.

This year's most significant increase in Czech wheat is estimated to be 3.3 per cent lower.
The farmers then moved her to more fields.

This year the farmers sent him 35,543 hectares.
By 2008, when the cat in Czech had grown to 70,000 hectares of record, it was half the size.
As a result of the expansion of personal areas, the annual cycle of motherhood will become richer.

Two men were accused of assaulting a knife and a catacomb, the court sent him to jail.
The police charged two attackers who attacked a knife and a five-year-old man on Tuesday in the center of Olomouc.
"Because the attacker tried to escape, he was subjected to severe and serious injuries that required hospital treatment and other treatment," said police spokesman Marie Štrbák.
Both of them obviously kept the police immediately after the attack.
The complainant submitted a proposal to the court to take them into custody, and the court dismissed him on Friday.
Both men are under three to ten years of imprisonment.
The police accused two prisoners of assault of a five-year-old man in the centre of Olomouca with knife and sword.
The attackers caused him severe and serious injuries, and he ended up in the hospital.
An incident took place between the two groups of people who took place on Tuesday in the right Sunday at the Freedom class, introduced the police.
The pachaters ended up in the fight, informing the Ooman police spokesman Marie Štrbák.
A group of two families played in the garden area before the top level of Tratoria in the immediate vicinity of the center of Olomouce.
After the aggressive verbal attacks, two attackers were attacked with the help of a five - year - old man.
Although the attacker tried to escape, he was subjected to severe and serious injuries that required hospital treatment and other treatment, the police spoke.

The mace was used in the centre of Olomauce during a mass battle of attackers also five years ago, it was then only ten feet away, before the disko of Varna in Riegro Street.
The police then reported that the group of ten foreigners was attacked by a host of companies who were standing before the fire.
According to the police, they had knives, holoes and cats.
After two attacks by foreigners, the court was sentenced to a conditioned torture.
Free and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You'll be surprised, maybe you'll walk around them every day.
One of the most exciting examples of an unused and empty house is the construction of an existing IPB seat in the middle of the Senovážnáz.
That was supposed to work as a hotel for a long time.
It's still nothing.
That there's a need to build new and new apartments and offices in the Metro?
And what is the use of existing, often valuable and protected architecture?
Right in the centre of Prague, in the centre of Václav's uninterrupted area, there are a number of busy houses, which, through their status, size and often even memory protection, are only empty and they are empty.
The property in the centre we selected with the help of the project Prazdnödomy.cz, which maps long-term empty property in the territory of Česka.
Houses are usually victims of financial problems of their owners, invisible relationships between companies or belong to a state that cannot or does not want to be rescued.
Empty houses are more than homeless in Czech.
If their owners pay special taxes for them, they want an initiative

Clinton's husband's loan was $10.6 million.
The body refuses to publish its tax admission.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, president Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
More than a million dollars were paid for Clinton's charity.
Most of Clinton's revenue - over six million dollars - is for their performances.
The crowd of its tax admission is refusing to publish.
American Democrats' candidate at Hillary Clinton's presidency published his tax statements on Friday, increasing pressure on his Republican rival Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, president Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year, notified the AP agency.
The majority of Clinton's revenue - over six million dollars - is for their performances, mainly from the period before April 2015, when Clinton launched his campaign against elections.
The tax report showed that Clinton’s husband had taken the federal tax from income tax to up to 34.2 per cent and then the tax from income to state and local level by up to nine per cent.
So they paid a total of 43.2 per cent of the income.
However, the storm has a similar problem, and it has not yet agreed to publish the tax admission.
It's possible Donald Trump doesn't pay any taxes, he wrote Clinton on Twitter a few minutes after his admission.
Clinton is returning to the secret around Trump's incomes, except for other reasons to raise doubts as to whether her rival is really as rich as he claims, the AP agency indicated.
The name of the drum is estimated to be billions of dollars.
The lower profit would damage the reputation of a Republican candidate as a successful businessman.
Senator Tim Kaine, who, in the tandem with the former vice president's first house, has now published a report on his tax rulings in the last ten years.

In Nigeria, the defense was reopened.
Islamists from Boko Haram protected the rest of their expectations and the doctors killed them.
In Nigeria, cases of child abuse have occurred again.
In the northern part of the country, the government has announced extraordinary expectations, for here two children have been charged with this abuse.
The vaccines brought the vertices there.
In the occupied area, the Islamic terrorists from Boko Haram, who protected the expectation and even killed the doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there was an undetected outbreak of the virus.
In the northern part of Nigeria, there is an extraordinary expectation of children against the back, as two children who have been subjected to this disorder were protected there.
In Africa, the defense was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government announced that in the state of Borno, there will be a million children and four million others in the surrounding countries.
The Nigerian military fighters on Friday, according to the AP agency, soon brought vaccines against children back to the infected northern part of the country, where they are causing Islamic terrorists from Boko Haram.
The World Health Organization (WHO) indicated that the virus has been undetected for many years.
The extremists of Boko Haram in the past protected the expectation and even killed the doctors.
Their attacks also failed on Thursday so that doctors could reach the area where children had been found.
Both of them arrived from the passageways in the part of Nigeria, again released from Boko Haram.
The head of the WHO section, which is responsible for the removal of Michel Zaffran from BBC station, said that expectations in Nigeria will start next week.
In the state of Borno, the Islamic radical group Boko Haram has long been behind it.
The area was made available by international organisations and government until the beginning of the year when Boko Haram in this part of the country became a major way of weakening.
The Nigerian Ministry of Health Isaac Adewole acknowledged that the new cases of detention were a major deterioration for the country, as Nigeria wanted to announce next year that the defence had been removed.
WHO pointed out that it is possible that although the disease did not occur for two years, it spread among the children.
The expected children are now under five years of age.
In 2012, half of all cases around the world occurred in Nigeria.
While the defence was still in 125 countries in 1988, it now remains only in three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and northern Nigeria.
The pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the stories of the fallen women.
Pope Francis met with twenty former prostitutes who, thanks to the police, were separated from gang gangs.
The pope listened to their hard life stories and called them to look to the future with confidence.
Frantisek wanted to warn this meeting of dealing with people and call for an increase in the fight against him.
Pope Francis met in Rome with twenty former prostitutes who were released by the police from the power of gang gangs.
The head of the Catholic Church listened more than an hour and then called for the Vatican to look to the future with confidence.
Among the former prostitutes who visited Frantisek were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is about 30.
All of them, according to the Vatican, were exposed during the forced prostitution by cruel physical violence.
The visitor, Frantisek, wanted to pay attention to dealing with people and call for an increase in the fight against him, introduced the pope's speech.
Frantisek often draws attention to people’s judgments at the end of the company.
On Thursday, for example, he met Syrian refugees who arrived in the Vatican this year in depth and in June thanks to his personal invitation.
France's going to hit the Jahadists.
Without the help of Muslims, it won't go.
France is fighting radical Islam with the aid of Muslims themselves.
In addition, the government of Prime Minister Manuel Vallese is making major changes in the functioning of mixed and spiritual education.
Since last December, we've closed 20 museums and prayer.
And the others will follow, the Minister of the Interior has announced.
There's more than a hundred Jedi productions in the country.
"If Muslims do not help the state in the fight against those who violate public freedom, it will be even harder for France to guarantee that freedom," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
In particular, to ensure that in museums and prayers only there are persons who have been educated in France.
At the same time, he wants to stop the financing of mixing abroad.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money comes from abroad to build new museums, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and the country of the Persian Gulf.
And that's why they're going to get in the mix, and they're gonna be able to figure out radicalism in France.
"Our country must show that Islam is consistent with democracy," added the prime minister.
The key to achieving these objectives will be the new French Islamic delegation.
This should work as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more foreign money.
In the country, France is now making a donation for Islam, which was established by the former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin in 2005.
She had already contributed to the review of the financial flows between the towns and the countries to which the building was financed.
Only the institutions soon stirred internal disputes and rivalries.
"It's a total failure," observed Walls recently.
In the French political scene, the debate on a new institution that is not going to pay off the unfunctional commissions has already erupted in January 2015 after the attacks on the magazine Charlie Hebdo.
All of this has resulted in further terrorist attacks in France, which have been carried out on behalf of the Islamic State.
The French Minister of Interior Bernard Cazeneuve had recently heard that a new assignment would take place this year in October.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mixed household resources and also to monitor property.
At the same time, it is not clear where money will be taken not only to build new museums, but also to various educational centres.
But it's a couple of suggestions.
One of them is a special fee or tax on the food chain.
In practice, the sellers would pay for food, which is to provide certification.
Some of these money would travel right into the supply bag.
The contribution of ten to twenty euros (270 to 540 kroner) could then be paid by French poets who come to Mecca.
Each year, they go there on a traditional route to South Arabia, which is about 30,000.
And that's not all.
According to the Prime Minister, only indicators that have passed special educational programmes at French universities should be carried out in museums in the future.
This should ensure that the sentence is in accordance with democracy.
We'll close the radical mix.
The French government is at the same time fighting radicals.
And the others will follow, the Minister of the Interior has recently announced.
In France, there is no place for those who voice hatred in cities and do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
In the country, according to estimates, there are approximately 2,500 mice and prayer.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are affected by radical Islam.
Since 2012, the authorities have hosted a total of 80 persons and in a few decades they consider this.
Not all of them, but they think that the government's steps will be able to deal clearly with radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize do the same.
Not even in museums, young people are radicalized on the Internet, said Severine Labatov, an expert from the National Research Centre.
Dr. Kelemen lost his 1st wheel with star Bauge.
The Czech driver has to fight the process of the eight-year transition.
Paul Kelemen's driving cycle at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro after the process of qualifying the race between the best of eight won in the 1st round with the French Great Grégor Baugé, the champion of the past in London.
The procedure for the eight-year-old must be fought in the proper way.
At the beginning of the royal discipline, 27 runners were set up and the best Czech driver at the time had signed the fourteenth best time.
Two hundred and twenty-nine seconds with a year's start.
At the main stage, he was expected to qualify for the fifth Bauge, which already has Ria bronze in the team's front.
Keeleman finally reached the tested Francoise, but he watched the process.
A great performance of the goldsmith Jason Kenny.
Eighty-five-year-old Brit won the third fastest half of history and qualifications won in the Olympic record 9,551.
Then, according to expected, he also consulted with the latest German Maximilian Levy.
It also happened to the British quarter in a meeting with Bradley Wiggins, which held a new world record of 3:50,570 and moved into the final.
The maximum reach (3:51,659), which was four years from the Olympics in London, improved more than a quarter.
Young doctors press: They want fresh air in the area
The representatives of young doctors met to accept new steps in their debate on a new contract.
The Youth Doctors Council (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) must request the full Council for the support of further round-up activities from the beginning of the session.
JDC says that ministers have failed to resolve the issues concerning the contract.
The young doctors and medical students in July voted against the refusal of BMA contracts.
58 % of its members who participated in the elections were rejected.
In a letter to members published on Thursday night on Twitter, JDC Ellen McCourt stated that the government remained "and still silent" on questions, which were relevant to the termination of the contract.
She said: “In this light, the competent authority of JDC has decided, by voting, to completely reject the proposed new contract and to request a new formal hearing on all questions."
In response to a complaint by the government today, the Executive Board of the JDC formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council with a view to approving the current programme of outstanding whaling operations from the beginning of the session.
Sport led young doctors this year to report to six stages, including the first general stages in the history of NHS.
The leader of young doctors in BMA, Dr. Johann Malavana, rejected the decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by BMA.
BMA members at meetings before the vote of 54,000 young doctors and medical students said the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health said that the contract would mean a burden for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: "unexpected" mergers?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce the formal end of eight months of long-term war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimír Putin welcomed the Turkish opposition in the overnight palace in Petrohrad, I had the idea that Ankara wants to complain more about this reconciliation.
It's been hand-handing, yes.
But Putin didn't smile, and he barely showed up with it, and according to his appropriate standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, however, repeatedly spoke about his "dear friend" Mr Putinov - five times as one of the reports says.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only return to their level before the crisis, but they will be even better.
The next day, one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan was acting like nothing bad ever happened.
According to me, his humour revealed the exact opposite.
But the persistent cold that came out of Putin showed that the Russian leader didn't forget anything.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening statement: the shooting of the Russian warplane Turkey at the Syrian borders.
Moscow's reaction was harsh at the time.
Putin broke his wounds around him and accused Ankara of killing Moscow's knife in the back.
The damage was bigger than it came from a good friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
The state controlled media in one month led a massive campaign against Ankara.
It just seemed like the Turks could do anything.
It was more serious than the high-level state representatives' charges that Erdogan's own family had benefited from the illegal trade with oil in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
This one's gone a lot.
But the official message came in Petrohrad that it was time to move on.
At the end of the meeting, only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the results of the statement are quite clear.
In the first row, Erdogan was almost free of power during the last month of the unexploded strike, and therefore he needs all his friends.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also been reported.
There is also economic motive.
The Russian sanctions had a serious impact - especially the destruction of charter flights that carry several million Russian tourists on Turkey's coast every year.
This figure has been reduced by almost 90 %.
As far as Russia is concerned, the tour of operators and charter companies here will breathe when it comes to the restoration of the years.
They work on the Mediterranean road at the end of the season.
Even this week's state television promised more light fruit and vegetables until the Turkish agricultural commodities were re-imported.
"Tourist there, lunch back here," as reported in the Vedemos newspaper.
The visitor, however, had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is evil in the West for what she thinks is a coffee reaction to trying to convert.
In addition, the long-term non-destruction of long-term talks on EU entry and Putin's entry - which extends beyond the possibility of using the facilities and crossing Turkey's bridge with the West.
The Russian leader certainly got the bonus points when Ankara asked for help from the elected authorities after the shooting.
You have to understand that for Moscow, which has a deep rooted fear of changes in the regime, it is given.
So the summit in this semi-collateral, direct-seasonary palace of Russia and Turkey enabled me to predict what one of the analysts described as a "uncompanied link": how two countries that feel rejected and used in the West.
Nevertheless, despite the public show of mutual reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between these two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently became a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey stand on opposite sides.
It would be said that after almost three-hour initial talks, both the presidents at the press conference indicated that they had not mentioned this question.
The Turkish President responded to the question of differences between them, while Putin decided to resolve these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which both States could find a common point in the matter of Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of a single disaster when a NATO member of Turkey shot a Russian warplane - it is certainly better that both leaders speak again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside of Scotland
According to the Executive Director, the sign of RBS should be attached to the role of the office.
Royal Bank of Scotland will lose for customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the sign RBS was linked to the global banking ambitions.
She disappeared when she was almost eight years old and had to be bought out of debt.
At that time, the strategic brands used RBS to protect the other brands of consumer finance.
Millions of people left behind for sponsoring international sport, from the Six Nations Raspberry Championship after the Winbled Andy Marraye Championship.
Now, however, it was decided that it would be better to get more out of the national mark.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used in Scottish customers, but will not allow new businesses.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of the centre and encoding of the stock on the bridge, will be changed to NatWest.
For customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, Ulster Bank is already used.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that will get more ahead - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During the trip to customers and employees in Inverness-shire McEwan answered our questions about Ross McEwan.
The BBC Scotland Station said: "The RBS sign will cease to be our investor sign and sign for which our employees are working because we are now becoming more and more banking sign."
Because the bank itself became a global sign, it became a global sign and RBS.
Now I say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have efforts focused on the home scene.
Each of these signs will mean something completely different in their own communities and our workers will work under these signs.
RBS has already indicated that it will not continue in its sponsorship of the Six Nations champion, has prepared a profile of individual brands of sport sponsoring.
"It has been a good time for us to move to the bank because the basic question (which we are recording) is how to focus on becoming a better customer bank?" said the Executive Director.
Three years ago, it would be very cynic if we were to say we're going to become a great bank for customers and they're showing these signs.
But together with the way we focused on the needs of customers, not our own, I think there's a lot of change.
We can recall these signs again, I think that the right time has come.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket on horses Pred selection has led to the goal of 3000. win
The Dettori is excavating the Spanish post that the second victory in Newmarket brought to him 3,000 victories
I'm looking for Frankie Dettori on Friday. He won 3,000 won in Britain in Newmarket.
This lover came to his second victory at night on his local trail - on the Pred selection horse trained by John Gosden.
The fifteen-year-old Italy is a six-year-old who has achieved such a result in equivalent gains.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Edery and Willie Carson.
A three-year-old champion named Dettori, who once won the Ghyyar horse, said: “It's unique.
I'm very grateful because my family is here too.
I'm so glad it happened to Newmarket because I'm here 30 years ago.
It's not a massive action, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a Friday night on earth with 20,000 people.
I'm tired, and I'm very grateful.
Dettori collects gratuities when he brings the Predilection after victory
Two jockeys of this milkman arrived in the intermissions - the champion of Richard Johnson and the 20th-century champion of Sir Anthony McCoy, who led more than 4,300 winners to the goal of their careers playing records.
Lester Piggott, Nineteenth Winner Derby, 4 493 Winners in career
Frankie is one of the best joggs of modern times and is not surprised that he reached a milkman who only met a few drivers before him.
He's strong and strong, but he's just his tactical fissure, which separates him from the other drivers in the station.
He's a fantastic delivery ambassador, his promotion and charisma have been contributing fans to this sport for a long time.
A few weeks ago, I told Frank in Epismo that if he didn't eat just for weeks and big enough, he'd already have 6,000 winners!
The truth is, Frankie's won in Great Britain for most of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
He has a living attitude, which is good for British achievement sports, but more importantly, he's an incredible joke.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his historic summer jacket
From the years after the summer season - Frankie Dettori was the result of two decades of British equinoxes.
It was like a ride on the mountain road.
The inevitable number of winners of the big race, including his known "great seven" in Ascot. He survived but also the plane accidents and had a ban on the launch of drugs.
Three years ago, he first stood up when he returned after six months of command to start, but showed incredible inner strength, and he returned in the best form to all doubters.
And maybe it won't be the last time - Dettori already said he'd like to continue in the race for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin missed the head of the presidential office of Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly abandoned Sergey Ivanov on Friday as head of the presidential office.
Ivanov was one of Putin's closest associates after many years.
Ivanov was appointed Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin "brought Ivan out of his service by the head of the Russian Presidential Office," but there was no reason.
His place will be taken by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov's representative since 2012.
Forty-four-year-old Vaino was a diplomat before.
He was born in the main city of Estonia in 1972, promoted at the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked on a mission in Tokyo.
The websites (in Russian) indicate that the head of the presidential protocol and the presidential office were later made.
He said to Putin, “Thank you for your trust.”
I believe that the most important administrative role is to support your state-run activities in the context of the proposal for laws and control of the extent to which your instructions are complied with.
Putin told the Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov asked her to leave the post and recommended that she be compensated for Vayno.
A smile witness?
This step completely mysticized Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest associates of Vladimir Putina and also Putin worked for the KGB.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was watching state television, both men announced that the head of the presidential office would proceed to his own request.
But the smiles into the camera convinced only a few people - especially now, in front of parliamentary elections.
So it's about the consequences of a fight?
No one knows that yet.
But the official claim that the man who was once considered to be a potential president is trying to bring Russia's environmental policy together met with a great lack of confidence.
The comments made on the Kremlin pages are quoted by Putin, who says: “It is true that in 2012 I asked you in conversation to have this very important post, even if you could say a problem post, believe in four years.
I've been the head of the president's office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took the post in December 2011.
Previously, the position of the Vice-President of the Government and the Minister of Defence has been suspended.
He was a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the Committee on State Security (KGB).
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was a member of the Russian Federation's Federal Security Service (FSB), which was replaced by the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his representative.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of his five closest colleagues.
In fact, Ivanov was even speculating that he could become a successor of Putin in the head of the state after his second election period, because the third period would be counterproductive for Putin.
This post, however, was taken by another close companion of Putin's colleague Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin went back to the presidential office three and a half years later became prime minister.
Thomas Gibson, star of the series of crimes thoughts, was released after the director's consent.
Gibson was involved in physical exchange of views on the scene last month in Los Angeles.
The TV stations ABC and CBS produced by the series were notified in a joint declaration of its release.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his release.
There's been creative differences in the scene and I don't care.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in a statement.
According to ABC and CBS TV stations, the details of how Gibson’s status will disappear from the series following the experiences of the FBI's agency team are later.
The four-and-a-half-year-old heretic, which celebrated the main role of the Dharma and Greg meeting, has been in the series since the first series in 2005.
"I love the thoughts of criminals and for the last 12 years I gave them heart and soul," Gibson said in his statement, which he published on Friday.
I was hoping I'd be in it for the rest of my life, but it won't be possible right now.
I would still like to express my gratitude to the authors, producers, heroes, our wonderful team and especially the great fans in which this show could be expected.
The return of the series to the twelfth series is expected on September 28.
In Banff's town, they finally got caught in a fishing garden.
The man from Banff town asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain is thought to have 75 pieces of fish can be the sandy wings left there by the water.
Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, on the Periscope channel, published a short film of his invention in the belief that someone could help him explain how about five centimetre fish were obtained on his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: Currently connected to Fife
The project for 1.35 billion pounds should be completed by May 2017
Engineers spread the northern plain and Queensferry Crossing and the crossing - then the bridge is now connected to Fife.
So it's the first of the four conclusions between the “believer plates” that are now almost complete around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 tons of iron.
The project for 1.35 billion pounds should be completed by May 2017.
Economic secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the fortress to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment of the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
In this project, we are all witnesses of how construction engineers actually used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to construct this part of the bridge.
Despite the mass size and mass of the bridge, the conclusion of the bridge between the viaduct and the flat bridge of the delicate operation required an extraordinary accuracy.
In its place there are now more than 79% of the total area of the bridge, concrete for the last part of the area is now moving to Rosyth, so the whole area is ready to be lifted to the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: “The first conclusion of each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this conclusion is a glimpse of the earth’s position.
After installation of the last part of the railway space and its connection to the expanding North Tower space, we had to close the last line to the north - towards the vertical direction.
We've done this by crossing the north approach 700 mm south.
This was massive and at the same time very delicate surgery.
Massively because the transducer is 222 metres long, it weighs about 6,000 tons and it was necessary to withdraw it by approximately 3 %.
Delicate because the tolerance with which the team worked was very small - only a few millimetres per direction.
Everything was going very well.
Saved in Moelfre Bay: Three men are "happy to be alive"
Three men are “happy that they are alive” after the flood of water from their fishing boats in England.
Moelfre RNLI's rescue team announced a strike on Friday at 13:20 a.m. in the British summer after the incident in Moelfr's army saw.
All three men tried to swim safely, while their crew continued unhindered.
"We saw how their members surrounded their neighborhoods and attacked us most," said coroner of surviving member Moelfré Vince Jones.
"The strong wind took her away from them before we came out," he added.
Two men saved the local fishing boat, a third man in his 60 ’ s was found without a protective vest worn out as a fighter holds.
All were transferred to the flag of the coastal rescue member and carried back to the rescue officer station
Jones said: “Three men are happy that they are alive and without harm.
The engine of the ship had a bow for emergency discharge, but somehow it came to its connection from the person who led when it came to conversion.
Someone's screaming over those hills holding a protective hand.
The court refuses to solve the case for the Tluchoro woman.
Petr Tluchoř is one of the three MPs who, unfortunately, had to get from the Prime Minister of the Time and his former head of the office of Jany Nagy's political traffic, thus a lucrative post for political performance.
In 2012, the tax package was approved.
Schnajdr, Fuks and Tluchor made it possible by their resignations.
Then they showed up at the influential posts in the state companies.
And that's why they also raised suspicions about the pay and ended up fighting for a month.
According to the court, the damage was estimated to be almost 2 million kroner.
The burden now stands as a witness, and this is according to the Supreme Court.
His wife works in a court building on the fruit market and solves civil disputes.
Nevertheless, Judge Helena King wants to be careful (responsibility of the criminal case - Mr. Red.) and to make possible claims.
The case will obviously be brought to the attention of another Persian court.
The King's army has already released the guilt of Jan Nessow, before Nagy.
It was about the alleged abuse of military intelligence to follow the first wife of Prime Minister Nequés Radky.
In this case, Tluchor did not represent.
According to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, it's a rather complicated reaction.
I believe that impartiality cannot be expressed in such a way that the court can be ruled out if the witnesses have a wife or a relative to the court.
I'm afraid there's nothing to be judged at all.
"I think it's sweet," he added.
In the case of political traffic, he was also accused of Roman Boček, former officer.
According to his lawyer Petra Toman, however, a random object would have a chance of success.
The Court of Justice for Prague 1 heard a complaint on 13 June by a former chief of Prime Minister Petra Nezèse Jany Nagy (Today’s Time) and other accused of abuse of the Military Report.
There's no time with the husband to the court.
The abuser was supposed to solve the issues about Perutk.
For example, the wife of the exposer was to judge President Miloša Landa's case on democratic prime minister Ferdinand Peroutk.
The Earth said he was sympathizing with Adolf Hitler.
One of the schools is already dead!
The girl apparently disappeared during the plane crash of connective forces.
She and her two old friends went to Syria, along with her husband, to take a vacation from the London airport of Gatwick.
The British Ministry did not comment on her death report inside.
The young Londoners who fled the house were secretly transferred to Syria across the Turkish border by police.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana were targeted by the media for their next former associate from London's Bethnal Green Academy.
In the case of the moon, there was a huge wave of attention and also tension in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security reports estimate that about 600 British Muslims have already traveled to Syria, from about 50 young women and girls.
A number of them joined the ISS radicals and other groups.
Those who come home represent a terrorist threat to Britain.
Dream work for hundreds of dollars.
Great paid job you don't even need a high school.
So it looks like the first look at the work of the daughter.
And often on the other side.
The exit is not only an extremely high fee in Czech terms (in Prague you work in IT up to 180 000 Kč), but also extreme benefits.
The reason is the vast lack of IT specialists.
There are thousands of specialists missing.
According to estimates, almost 20,000 IT specialists are missing in Czech.
The most recent are the statistics of the staff agency Grafton programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
The candidates can choose between several job offers.
So they do not support candidates for a job position, but jobs for a candidate, comments Jitza Souchkova, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
High school isn't necessary.
Higher education is not necessary for girls.
Higher education is a good foundation and is a comprehensive indicator of the intelligence and educational skills of a candidate, but there is often little common knowledge of development.
Developers must continue to learn new things, which one day a high school won't build, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
It's going to be in Prague most of the time.
Dogs are moving too high across the republic.
They'll come to Prague and Brno for the most money, and in the regions there's no such emergency anymore.
"The weather conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague," Kubačka confirms.
They'll get to the top of the class by the technical director.
In Prague and Brno they can come to 120 000 - 180 000 Kč.
In other regions, the pay is lower, but not less than 80,000 Kč.
The requests are also IT project managers.
They can make 60,000 to 100,000 Kč.
The fight is about graduates.
While in some professions it must often be equal to the office of employment, it is not paid for by the priests.
If I take over and reimburse a professional from another company, I would like to congratulate the graduates.
They can still keep him on their own.
They won't promise without language.
The skills of a foreign language take place in every profession, but there is a need for minimally sound English.
The knowledge of at least one foreign language is in some IT positions of necessity.
On the other hand, we are dealing with a number of cases when companies are looking for a highly educated and experienced person and are satisfied only with average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, the employer controls more foreign languages, it is interesting for his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, the Director of Kubačka will provide them.
Good in Googlu, there's a paradise.
Only quiet can often work for employees in Googlu.
Of course, for them it is a time of work, the possibility of work from home or various short-term opinions, not just for mothers.
"Innovated fathers, the company provides four weeks' leave after the birth of the child," says Martina Jonek, Google’s spokesman.
The treatment also provides health care for employees and family, nutrition, transport, training, wellness or massages directly at the workplace.
Whoever wants to learn, has a green one and doesn't care what a new one wants to learn.
But that doesn't end the benefits.
Such a full refrigerator free of charge is certainly not to be taken for granted.
Healthy meals (in some places and breakfast and dinner) are available on site every day.
Moreover, in all the offices of the so-called microchip, where people always find a healthy meal, the speakers express themselves.
And if nothing comes out, as soon as it goes, it goes into a box that employees can take home tonight.
And the reason for these in Czech terms of incredible benefits?
Create creative and motivating environments!
"It is not important for Google to sit in an office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, promotion or development, ideas and innovative solutions," adds the speaker.
The UN has been critical of Bulgaria for the criminalization of refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, UN Commissioner for Human Rights, accused Bulgaria of systematically violating the human rights of offenders.
The Bulgarian government's official strategy "causes serious concern over Bulgaria's non-compliance with international law", Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein warned in a statement.
He pointed out that "it is particularly disturbing to be a witness of how important and influential public figures express public support for criminal armed conflicts, which, on the one hand, organizes them at the border between Bulgaria and Turkey."
"One of the most important problems is that almost all the people who pass through the Bulgarian territory in an irregular manner are automatically caught," Zeid emphasized.
And what's worse - they're often punished and imprisoned - for years or longer - if they're trying to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone has the right to leave any country, including their own, under international law.
Bulgaria has held 14,000 migrants this year, while the same period is 21 000.
Pokémon Go - health and happiness that will be paid
It's fascinating to watch how the world changes.
Many people in the last decade complain that teenagers and children are no longer playing outdoors and prefer to spend free time in front of the screens.
The Pokémon lifts people from the back and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of the screen was originally spent on television, later on video games and latest on smart phones.
It's great to see that technology and activities outside are not mutually exclusive.
Of course, I'm talking about the mode that Pokémon Go is, the applications are based on sets that first appeared in the video games at the end of the 1990s (later a series was created, playing cards and more).
As in many cultural phenomena, this new game came before it was introduced at the beginning of July in the USA, Australia and New Zealand to lose interest.
The introduction in other countries was then postponed due to the possible interest which led to overload of servers.
In a few days, Pokémon got more users than Tinder and almost as many users as he has Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players on the smart phone are going out looking for Pokémones, who are following GPS help, and if they find them, they can "take" (through screenshot on the phone) or "get".
Manie was attracted by the generation that played the game at the age of age, raised her from the seat and the woman out looking for Pokémon.
In the United States, this game has resulted in a significant increase in the number of steps that a "mean" person will do every day.
The Cardiogram application for smart clocks from the Applu, which monitors 35,000 users, recently for Washington Post reported that within two days of the release of the game, the number of people who have been watching each day for 30 minutes has risen from 45 to 53 per cent.
The company has no information about who's playing Pokémon Go - sees only rough data about level exercises.
Many public campaigns aimed at “finding 30” people“ getting out of the garage” and “being active every day” fell on unofficial soil, because most of the messages focused on public health are comfortable and certain to people who do not look good.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in controlling weight, high blood pressure, sugar and a long list of benefits that we cannot complete here.
But the beauty of Pokémon's game is starting to make people go out and do something they're interested in.
You cover three health pills - movement, fresh air and sunglasses, and fun.
Some people even get new friends when they're on their heels.
As it is, they will find themselves, of course, humble patrons who are looking for any excuse to make themselves miserable.
And yes, someone can enter the door.
What, like?
It's been half past midnight.
In their time applications for smart phones like Fitbit should have been able to monitor our activity, but they didn't give us reason to do something like that in this game.
The news is being watched and interested in it will begin to appear at a certain time.
All thanks to the success of Pokémons, there will be other games that will combine applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world and help a number of people in the struggle for activity, health and better form.

Simone Billes got gold in more women's gyms
Forget the pressure.
Forget about breaking up.
Simone Billes is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the skip.
No clothes on the piano.
They're all on the simple side.
It's amazing in everything.
And now finally the Olympic champion.
The 9th-century American gymnasium went on Thursday to a straight road for the title in the multi-storey and the other on the full-line window under the Olympic reflectors.
The overall result of 62,198 was clearly confirmed in front of the silver medalist and member of the "final five" team of Ali Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliyou Mustafin.
Simone Billes (USA) on Thursday, during the graduation at the final competition of individuals in the sports gym at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American in line that won the most, and fifth in total, when she confirmed her story of the best prizes of her generation and perhaps the best at all.
When her total final score was on the table and her long way to the end of this moment, she appeared in tears.
This success leads to the same league of individual athletes in his time as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to his sport:
Biles' sport has dominated her last three years, won 15 medals on world champions - including 10 gold. Her catchable compositions are mixed ambitions and precision and an Olympic champion from 1984 named Mary Lou Retton's "best prize as she's ever seen."
The last test awaited her in Brazil, not even between Billes and the rest of the race, but between her alone and the burden of too much expectations.
Anything other than returning home to his family in Spring, Texas with a hand full of gold medals, would be considered a defeat.
Simone Billes (USA), left, and Aly Raisman, are concerned with the victory of gold and silver medals in the finals of a woman's majority at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Brazil, Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
The first Biles got Tuesday, when she was a runner in the celebration of the national team coordinators of Martha Caroline.
Billes insists that during his long trip to the top, he never looked forward, which is not so completely true.
Part of its composition in simple - the one that contains the typical three-saltos with a double twist - is based on the Latin song that would just walk home to the street outside of the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not an accident.
The girl was adopted by her cousins as a ball and her talent was revealed by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman's journey to the zoo where Boorman's training took place and where he gained strength.
The competition has not been won since 2013 - it is a victory that can continue as long as Billes will want.
Even though Mustafin's taking the lead for a short time thanks to the two rounds, it was just an illusion.
Kladine and simple - where Billes defends the world champion - are waiting.
She got back to the top with 15,433 points for the piano - and finished with 15,933 points in plain.
Raisman was very angry when he was waiting for a final score - only formality - and around three-thirds of the green, white and blue walls, Billes' tears appeared when the request, which she once wrote into the ring, was fulfilled.
Raisman's execution was so little paid for the Olympics four years ago when it was a third story with Mustafin, but it was a bronze because of the count of three best sets.
This time, the twelve-year-old captain of the team, who the Americans call "baby", was quite ahead.
After her simples, she sent a gift to the air bubbles, given back, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
For Billes, the contribution that this nine-year-old athlete has put this week on Twitter, where it became a simple hit, is completely new:
Police: Three victims in the case of a serial killer shot after singing in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and girls died at the age of 12 during the most important ten-year attack, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot when they were sitting in the car, talking and listening to music.
The authorities announced that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellisov and daughter Ellis's Maleah were shot in a car parked on the highway on June 12.
The report states that the armed man stood on the side of the driver and fired eight shots from his handgun and then jumped into another vehicle.
According to the police, it is not a triple murder because the attacker didn't take the money, nor the amount of $2,900, which one of the adult victims had.
The speech police in Phoenix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said the investigators found that the shooting had no connection with any of the previous four attacks.
In two major Spanish neighborhoods, a total of nine attacks took place in four months, where seven people were killed and two others were injured.
"It's happening in the villa quarter before home," Howard pointed out earlier this month for the side of KPHO station CBS.
The police believe that the suspect used several cars, including the Nissan storm from the late '90s, the Black BMW from the late '90s and the White Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to reveal the evidence that the attacks were related and were committed by the same murder.
Ellisova (33) was transferred to a hospital where she later suffered from her injuries.
Liner (31) and Ellis's daughter Maleah died on the spot.
The Witness told the police that it was not unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, with an empty delivery only half an hour before the three-way murder. The police are supposed to have been the source of this serial murder.
The inspectors found the boots and the rest of the ball in the seat and made the ball under the roof of the engine.
The mother of a six-year-old child with a microcephalitis: "His attitude improves"
Edmund Piccito, like most children of his age, loves music, toys and of course also his mother.
But unlike their species, they suffer from microcephalitis, which is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Piccito, did not know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, like the first time I thought I couldn't do this.
I can't handle this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - clearly you're ready for it," she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, learned that Edmund might never know and that he might not even pass.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in the facility.
"My first reaction was that I thought people wouldn't do this today," Picciut explains.
Edmund's on his way with a walker.
By the time he was three years old, he couldn't sit down or sleep, and he's still not talking.
Some of the limits are already being met.
He's coming with help and riding on his bike.
He also loves playing with his two brothers and loves music.
Elizabeth introduces a significant word, using which Edmund says "please sing to me".
"We're teaching him a sign," said Piccitov for CBS News.
But it's not a common sign saying - it says that Edmund has invented some signs himself.
Microcephalie may arise from a number of different conditions: genetics, as in the case of Edmunda, and after infections in the pregnancy caused by viruses such as fever or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis can be eliminated in a major way.
It's too close to telling us how much Zika's virus will impact on the lives of those who are infected.
Piccito reminds us of the quote tax that will determine the uncertain future.
I keep asking, "What's going on?"
What's next?
And it's still not sure.
In fact, I never asked myself what the whole prophecy is because I don't expect anyone to ever tell me.
But Piccito has an encouraging message for the mother of all the children who suffer from the wounds caused by Zika.
It's getting better.
You know it'll be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rain and floods required rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
The heavy rain and the vast floods in Louisiana were able to report the emergency situation on Friday. In the state, another amount is expected on Saturday.
The National Meteorological Service (NWS) announced that, after extreme rains, the river flows to the south of Louisiana and in southern Mississippi would emerge from its shores and dangerously vast lakes.
Governor Louisian John Bel Edwards said that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on the way to the reached areas.
Mike Steele, the governor's spokesman for national security and preparedness in the crisis situation, said they were receiving requests for vehicles to ride in water, crews and sandbags.
Steele said he just asked Tangapaho's cross for ten thousand pieces of sand.
In most southern Louisiana, the pipelines will remain to work for Saturdays.
The meteorological service in the declaration indicated that it could extend beyond the sea by about 8 to 13 centimetres.
In southern Alabama, there was a driving guard in preparation on Friday when the rains continued in the area of the city of Mobile.
According to the predictions, the Committee on Baton Rouge and Amite on the weekend has been established by Denham Springs.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said that both said they could swim a number of houses in the local areas of Baton Rouge.
He further pointed out that the danger is that ships are flying in the Ascension zone, when these liquids are to land on Maurepas Island only slowly.
Tickfaw, says something south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, has reached the highest level of local time by Friday at 9:00 a.m.
The rescuers continue to bring people out of the water supply in the village of Amit and Wilkinson to the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife, and his own son were already five years old among Gloster's survivors.
Hansford (62) said that the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 metres from his home, stopped fast overnight.
He said he had warned him of his next own son, who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water drew closer," said Hansford.
We had her to the trap.
According to his wife, it's the tallest grain she's ever had in her last 48 years.
Hansford said he and all his family were hit and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford indicated that the crisis workers saved all three large commercial vehicles in military style and moved them to the gas station in Gloster, where they remained hidden on Friday.
Krautmann said that with the continued flow of waste, the flood is rapidly spreading, and the authorities consider evacuation.
According to Krautmanna, a observer recently reported that from midnight to Friday morning, there were 35 centimetres of raindrops.
Krautmann said that the ground is very dry from the middle.
The authorities indicated that the extensive rain and paid roads required the protection of residents from their homes during the Tangapaho period and the cancellation of education in five school districts.
The rest of the WWL station CBS reported that 200 houses were flooded according to the size of Tangapaho.
Citizens were evacuated to two churches, both of which are now flooded.
The old town of Robby Miller reported that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets, which the high water provided.
In the city of Amit and in the city of Hammond, there were arrangements for those who were evacuated.
"They will be able to return home when the water starts to look," he said.
In the Tangapaho district of Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed because of the water pollution and local citizens were able to obtain sands that could raise and try to protect their homes and businesses from water.
"We were here in March," said the city manager Lacy Landrum.
Looks like these clouds are going to be like this.
Rupert Lacy, manager of the crisis situation in Harrison County, Mississippi, stated that the long-lasting rain continues on the coast of the Persian Gulf.
He said a few houses were announced on Thursday, but on Friday none of them appeared in the report.
Keith Townson, the leader of the Shopper Value Foods in Amit, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I saw water in a few places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "a boy shot like a solution", survived the shooting in Philadelphia
According to the police, there was a six-year-old gun in Philadelphia, which is already a second shoot for a child at age 6 in town this week.
Her cousins for CBS Philadelphia identified her as Mahaje Brown.
Family members say that the boy suffered a number of shots, including weakness, legs, arms and legs, but when he was transferred to the hospital, he was unconscious.
"He thought it was too bad, his little body was shot like a solution," said his grandmother's station, Delores Mendez.
I can't believe it.
The boy was in a critical condition in the hospital and had several operations.
The family at the station said the boy should get well.
He was supposed to be in the first grade of elementary school.
Mahaj Brown is between four people who were shot in the Germantown area.
Three other men were shot: two 29 years old and one 32 years old.
One of the men 29 years of age is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, the other two victims are in a stabilized condition.
According to the report of the station, a child was found shot at the front seat of the vehicle along with a nine-year-old man in a critical state.
Two other victims were not in the car and the police were testing whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter.
The investigators of the CBS Philadelphia reported that it was likely that the shooter had arrived between several armed men.
A weapon of an attack type, belonging to a different weapon, was found at the site.
According to everything, it was definitely an ongoing battle.
On the street, there were bullies on both sides of the walker.
It seems, then, that there were several armed combatants who were actively involved here," said Captain Philatelfs police officer Anthony Ginaldi to the station.
There were also several homes and vehicles in the area.
No one was detained and the police were investigating video games from the camera.
Another six-year-old child, this time a girl, was shot in the back of a bombed gun on the Tuesday in front of the house in the neighborhood of the West Oak Lane.
The girl's fighting, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That's exactly what I'm thinking of a female team of gymnasiums for the annual Olympic Games, and that's for a few reasons.
First, I've been on every summer Olympic since 1984, and the USA has never been so dominant.
And secondly, in this team there are three gymnasiums, Simone Billes, Gabby Douglas and Lauren “Laurie” Hernandez, who inspired so many young color girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team that complements Aly Raisman, which is the Jewish origin, and the Catholic Madison Kocian.
Finally, we have a team that looks like America.
He also confirmed the presence of blacks and Latin Americans at the peak of this sport.
The number one in the last four years was an African.
Simone and Gabby were on the first and second lines.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals miraculously became a champion of Olympic heroes and America.
Now the world could be a witness to the incredible performance of the three-dimensional world winners of Simone Billes, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who presented unexpected but mysterious comical figures.
On Thursday, Simone became a fourth American who got gold in the women's match.
And a member of Aly Raisman's team got a strike.
We're witnesses of the top sports, but it doesn't look like that in the hours of the gym in the country.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie went to the Olympic team on the same route as Aly and Madison.
They are “the final fifth” because the gymnasium on the next Olympic Games will be composed only of four athletes, and this is the last year when Marta Karoli is training.
The reality is, however, that gymnastics are financially competitive sport and gymnasiums are mainly practiced in private gym clubs that maintain parents who pay the cost of training, training, travel, clothing, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their beliefs and families). And that is not all.
Most of these sports clubs are in the rich areas in the area where they can support activities.
In these clubs there are precious all the coaches, and for the family, there is a costly and long-term commitment to the gymnasium and gymnasium.
Aimee Boorman, coach Simone Billes, and Maggie Haneyo, coach Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes at the time they started at the gym.
It is our duty to carry out the training of gymnasiums, which are more accessible and accessible to the communities of the number of young girls who were inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I set up a gym class 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free or low-cost gym in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people in the city (in particular the Black and Spanish origin) we trained national and international champions.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide quality gymnasium for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and enjoy this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and decision-making of the mind.
This combination means life - giving benefits for good health, success at school and at work.
The inspiration of this team will send us thousands of young girls who will want to make a gym, and that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
I thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for having demonstrated "girl strength" and you won the Olympic team gold, and I thank you for encouraging so many young girls for all the reasons to stand out on the road with healthy, strong and successful young women.
Following the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are prepared to enter further steps
The Ministers hoped that following the conclusion of the revised contract, the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would come to an end with a change in mind, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who participated in the election refused the contract.
In July, Hunt withdrew plans for the implementation of the contract with the fact that NHS was in "no-one country" and that further delays would have a detrimental effect on employees and patients.
The first doctors have already signed a new contract, which includes changes in night and weekend work to improve care in non-social hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, president of the BMA Commission for Young Doctors' Statement last night, stated: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contracts, in particular in the sense that they will increase the current labour crisis and therefore the fair treatment of all doctors."
Eight weeks before the first group of doctors enters into the new contract, progress must be made and time will come.
The BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through the negotiations met with the unexpected involvement of a doctor and often with a listening silence from the government.
And despite Jeremy Hunt's promise of last month, this opportunity is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt now has to go on, push on the exercise and solve the concerns of young doctors."
If that doesn't happen, young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the final steps at the end of the autumn, almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were made because sisters and specialists were allowed to represent doctors who were among the protestors.
The Ministers hoped that following the conclusion of the Treaty, the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would come to the conclusion of the changes concerning the matter.
BMA wants to pay more for work on the weekend for 54,000 young doctors who would be the subject of a contract.
Daniel Mortimer, president of the NHS employees, called a young doctor not to enter any steps.
Mortimer said: “The campaign will be carried out only a little or nothing, but it will cause the pressure on the already overloaded teams and services and the increase of anxiety, abuse and abuse for patients, healing staff and their families."
In the past two months, we have met with the Council of Young Doctors and with the Ministry of Health and others who have responded positively to their concerns about the role of the monitor and the informant.
Employees hoped that continuing positive involvement in other important issues - such as education, education flexibility, further training for those who return after completing their careers, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study freedom and the difference in wages between sex - was evidence of the fact that employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health have reached agreements with BMA in November, February and May.
The treatment for 60 kroner per day can reduce the risk of heart failure
Thousands of patients at risk of infections will be able to use medicines that are estimated to be around sixty kroner (two libres). The authorities recommend that more patients be given after a longer period of time.
Treatment with Ticagrelor blood clotting reduces the risk of relapses in people with heart disease.
The medicine is now administered for 12 months after administration to reduce the risk of death or other infections.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that human treatment be given over four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, the NHS watchdog NICE recommends that people be given over four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, heart disease afflicts about 140,000 people each year, and a quarter of them will still be infected or heart disease.
Infarction and death are caused by the accumulation of fluid that creates a relevant species on the walls of the arteries.
If you experience withdrawal of this type, it may result in blood clotting, blood clotting, and heart attack.
If the wound is released, the blood can continue to clotting, blocking the flow of blood into the brain and causing the brain death.
People who have already been infected are exposed to a higher risk of another infection.
Ticagrelor, which manufactures the British company AstraZeneca and is sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk of becoming more likely to result in injuries.
It is recommended that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg in combination with aspirin twice daily for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments, there are a quarter of patients who had an infarction and who reach another heart attack or death - often with devastating consequences."
Fear of packaging may have a significant negative impact on the quality of the patient’s life.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of other heart attacks and deaths in people already infected.
We are pleased that we can expand the possibilities of treatment that are available to thousands of people who will be able to cope with it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagreloru - especially on the risk of bleeding - is limited to over three years, it is not recommended in the proposal for treatment over this period.
With computer culture, there has been a wave of confusion in Muslim areas
The old town of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was dismissed last year because of corruption, which was linked to government news
The culture of political correctness leads to a look at widespread contradictions in the Muslim communities, which is now referred to in the government report.
Former Minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticises the police, volunteer inspectors and councils for ignoring the abuse of voters for “ethnicity and religion.”
The former secretist of the community, now the leader of anti-corruption practices, said that the fear of voters on the basis of their religion is so bad that the police would have to do harm to the volunteers and protect the elected voters.
He recommended that the voters take evidence of authenticity and could prove who they are when they are.
At the same time, the petitioner is sufficient to enter his name and address.
The report further suggests that in the case of a vote, a person's fingers will have an inconsistencies in order to prevent someone from wanting to vote twice.
Whistbellowers should have greater protection, says Pickles.
He requests that the press be given greater access to documents from the meeting and decisions taken by the informal committees or working groups.
"Not only is it about protecting against voluntary fraud but also about protecting the local government against wider corrupt media and financial fraud, which is at hand," he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street as a result of a voluntary scandal in Tower Hamlets in western London.
In last year, the special election court decided that the mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed from his position after being accused of corruption and illegal practices.
The Court found that Rahman "synically touched" his Muslim community's religious sentiment and hid his criticisms from racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, according to his own words, “made his campaign so as to be the religious duty of the Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes were cast or as a result of theft of identity when a person votes and presents himself to someone else.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed particular concern about the contradictions in the corresponding vote - arguing that the elderly Muslim communities had raised pressure on people to vote for the candidates they chose.
Sir Eric, on the picture, gave several recommendations on how to clean the optional system, including presentation of evidence of authenticity
His report states: “There has been evidence that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been forced to vote in accordance with the wishes of the elders, especially in the communities that come from Pakistan and Bangladesh."
"The concern was that... the state institutions have been convinced of such conduct because of "politically correct" sensitivity to ethnic origin and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including that political activists are forbidden to manipulate with correspondence and thus prevent "voting."
The report currently valued by Theresa Mayo also requires more thorough checks on registrations to prevent the use of voluntary lists for immigration and dose-related routes.
Consider the possibility of requesting voters to submit evidence of authenticity before voting.
The use of unbridled ink on the fingers when voting in order to prevent someone from wanting it twice.
The implementation of systematic checks on the nationality of persons in order to ensure that they can vote.
Requests for automatic correspondence voting shall be limited to three years.
To prevent political activists and activists from manipulating with their own voice and voice.
Give the police the right to create around the optional halls of the corridor.
Change the laws to make it easier for people who are developing illegal pressure under the 1983 Reform Act.
Prohibition of photographing in optional places.
Require that only English (with the exception of Wales) be employed in volunteer locations.
Strengthen the training and ensure that workers maintain the rule that volunteers go to the polling booths individually.
Sir Eric criticises the London police and says it's "excessive" that, in the case of Tower Hamlets, there was no charge of criminal acts.
"The Court rejected Lutfur Rahman and his agents for corruption and illegal practices," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was closely monitored over the framework of reasonable doubts - in the strength of evidence of a criminal act.
It also criticises the endless "control of the lifeguards" in the labour force registration departments.
Sir Eric said: “The final decision of the court in the case of the Tower Hamlets is an insult.
Our people have a proud attitude towards parliamentary democracy, but worrying and hiding the spread of voter riots and the attitude of some authorities threaten this reputation.
Distortion of the cyclical double leading Kate and other two known personalities on the Olympics in Rio
This week, the fans of the Olympics in Rio 2016 broke into the French cycle of Pauline Ferrand-Provot, which is still a somewhat similar guide from Cambridge.
But the four-year-old Olympics are not far from the only athletic year on gold, which can be taken by its own double from a number of famous personalities - at least not according to social networks.
At the celebration of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous personalities that are currently displayed on our screens, the club for women of FEMAIL has formed a list of Olympics that are more than similar to Hollywood celebrities.
As a hunting beast: A member of the American team of random bombers, Brady Ellison (left) was compared from a baby to Leonard DiCapriov
According to a double Kate on a Cyclistic drive of a number of people online, she quickly showed that a certain lubricator could be the twin-star Leonard DiCapria.
The U.S. boxer, Brady Ellison, caused on Twitter a storm following his photos of the seemingly like wolf from Wall Street.
Brady saw the media madness on his own and admitted that he had heard about his childhood with Lee.
"I don't see any great similarity, perhaps except tears," said Brady for Huffington Post.
"It's a guy and it looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be further highlighted this year: an idea between the British jumper to the far side of Greg Rutherford and the beloved Prince Neil Patrick Harris.
About the Russian composer Aliye Mustafin with her big, expressive eyes, it was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the blue pool, South African blues Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Gell Matthew Morrison's serial star for years.
And for the change: The user thinks that Nathan is "a athletic version" priest from the film Home (Inception)
Another long-term comparison is the comparison of the tennis stars Rafael Nadala and Prince Josh Hartnett, who have similar sharp faces and lips.
The Russian silver-striking Yulia Efimov is not just the same snowflake and blonde hair as Annalyn McCord's. And about Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team, fans say it looks like "the athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitta."
Educated women: a star football Hope Solová (left) and the hero Dexter Jennifer Carpenter series (right) have similar faces and eyes
Not only one: Twitter user was very happy to see the similarities
The theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for a similar view of couples
One Twitter user recently expressed his satisfaction over the fact that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solov and Jennifer Carpenter are really identical."
The football star Hope Solov and the hero series Dexter Jennifer Carpenter have a truly incredible face and face form.
Among other favorite comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jengings' smile, which is almost identical to the smile of the hero Laura Linney, or the holder of the gold medals for the guitar of Gabby Douglas, who boasts with his beautiful wide smile, as if copying the smile of Gabrielle Union, stars of Bravo, girls!
Commentary of the Olympics CBC Station is sorry that the Chinese Navy said "suppressed"
The wonders of the medium-lived transport from the Olympics to the CBC station have been shaken by the development of the performance of the fourteenth-century Ai Yanhan commenter Byron MacDonaldem. The Flood ended in the fourth place of the women's race at 4x200 m free-style stoffet
The Canadian CBC was awarded an apology for what one of its commentators said that the fourteenth-year-old Chinese swim was carried out during the race "as a smurf" and "float".
Commentary Byron MacDonald assumed that his microphone was removed when, at the end of the woman's final staffing of 4x200 meters free-style, he began to hide his own views.
MacDonald, who had to bring "life" to the CBC team, said, among other things, "This little fourteenth-year-old from China has given it up, you mad."
It's a terrible blow, it's like a smell, it's broken.
Thank you.
The Chinese Navy Ai Yanhan (14) launched a second race ticket in time 1:57.79 - then 1,61 seconds lower than Canadian Taylor Ruck and enabled Canadians to reach China.
Strangers in Canada quickly began to call online and were frightened by the tone and language that the commenter used
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: "The CBC voter has announced that the fourteenth-year-old whale from China "whispered"???"
That idiot didn't realize he was still sending."
Ai Yanhan from China, at the end of the 4x200 - foot - long [4x200 m] football race, was described as: “The 14-year-old Chinese gave it away, you white."
Byron MacDonald's criticism on Twitter came from all sides and many asked for his call
When Twitter users learned how unsensitive Byron MacDonald was, they didn't keep it back.
Another user, Sarah Paradise, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and it sounds like we're a band of racists.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who sent the CBC host, apologized for MacDonald's lively comment, saying: “We speak for a comment on the performance of the sailboat that has escaped from the shipment."
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry it happened."
The CBC station finally apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to the comment
Sponsor Scott Russell must be named MacDonalda.
CBC then copied and submitted their apology in response to more than 90 Twitter users who complained at the comments of McDonald’s comments.
The station also apologized quickly and made a statement.
He is sincerely sorry that the word was pronounced, she shouldn't get into the liver.
We quickly apologized to our surprises in sending out and to those who follow us on social networks.
To make it clear, Byron's comments were about the performance of the sailor, not the sailor itself.
In other words, there was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron deeply regrets what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized in his live transmission and tried to explain his note with the claim that he did not want to appear as a personal attack.
"I'd like to apologize now for the comment I made last night after the woman's staff," he said in sending from the Olympics to the CBC station.
"I had the idea of performing swimming, not a person swimming like that."
"I don't have to say that I didn't mean any injustice, and I'm very sorry."
Customers in Primark have been injured by a woman who has suddenly tried a lower duty in the middle of the trade
When the woman went out to try the boilers in the middle of Primark, they were not buying the assurance I'm looking for.
To make it even worse, she tried how much she fell, pulled her pants off, and brought her back to the rule.
She continued looking and finally tried four pairs of potatoes in the shopping center of Bouverie Place in Flocestone.
Trade Primark at Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkeston, where a woman tried to cook before returning to the rule
The mother of Jenny Davidson’s two children, who were in the store at the time of her pregnancy, noted that a wealthy woman “was going to buy something for herself after testing the undercover dress again and out of the store without buying anything. ”
She said, "The people could not believe in their own eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store, took off the calhot rule, pulled off her own pancakes and pancakes and set them up.
"She didn't even try to find any discrepancies - she just stood there and kept it like an ops."
"Every man just walked away as he pulled his pants off again, and obviously didn't like her, because she came back to the rule."
She did the same with three others before she finally decided she didn't like anything, dressed again and left.
"She didn't seem to care who looked at her - nor would she think of the person who should buy the pants she tried."
Ms. Davidson (33), who lives in Kent, said: “The idea that someone would take the house of a prostitute who had someone else and had no one to clean it up is disgusting. ”
It happened in the afternoon.
Miss Davidson added: “When she left, I picked up things that I obviously tried to get out of sale - which is also the only right thing. ”
"It would seem to me that I would bring new suitcases to home and find out that another woman had them, that she had them, and that they were not chosen."
The speaker of the Primark trade said: "Primmark knows about the incident that occurred in our trade in Volkestone on Tuesday 9th August."
All the products concerned were obtained from the sale.
How to Fight the Attack of Weapons by Krav Maga
The outside world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com could be more safe for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, the great federation of Krav Magy sitting in New York to find out how to deal with armed thieves in the near distance.
This video will show you how to get on a violent move, whether it's getting close to you in front or behind.
If he approaches you back, he says Mirrachi, then the first thing you have to do is to turn around to see his attacker and to “have free driving shots”.
Then you'll catch the weapon between your front and the shoulder firmly before you hit it in the face of a free lock.
Then the knee follows into the weak, and while the attacker is in pain, you will draw the gun out of his hand, strike it in the face, and start to leave the gun, and then you will keep it focused on it.
If the armed man comes near you, he's a similar technique - get your body out of the fire line, get the gun and turn it off so that the gift can't be shot.
At the same time, put in a force weapon and hit the enemy into the chest, then pull the weapon out of its shutter and start to retreat, and then die on it.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video where you'll see exactly how Mirrachi does it.
But don't forget that the safest way to get through - if you're not the great Krav Maga - is to be ready.
Traveller Ian Wright olives the most impressive places in Europe to travel guide
The British traveler decided to make a difficult test of his immune system and a dose-reflexion - by eliminating the most difficult and most expensive places in Europe.
The Moderator and Traveller Ian Wright (51), based on Suffolku, drew on evidence of the strength of his immune system in their language of the euro bank, leaned on Piccadilly Circus, pressed the button on the toilet in the train and Russian public phone.
In front of each object, he used a lightmeter to show himself and all of us what's going to happen.
The experiment, based on which the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed, also produced interesting results.
The aim of oligoticizing the push in the train used by thousands of other people can seem quite relaxing, but the need in the kitchen bed is actually much more harmful bacteria.
Ian Wright talked to doctors and specialists throughout his journey throughout Europe about boosting cancer bacteria and about his own health.
Unfortunately, nothing was left in his mouth more than a bird.
Ian Wright was celebrating his adventures on the streets around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
During this mission, he proved his immune system completely - from public funerals at train stations after the crash
In the film he pointed out, he said: “I haven’t been too old for my health since I was a child, and I’ve given myself everything I can, from the grass after the vegetables and the bananas of the water. ”
In the film, his reputation was confirmed by the teacher.
The only thing he refused was the Spanish public holidays in Russia.
After a simple star, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4,000 units.
For comparison, clean-cut hands should have less than 60.
One public contract in Russia but olive oil declined after showing more than 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy producers Valio surrounded tourists' film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom
In the film, he said: “This is almost the easiest thing I've ever felt at the funeral. ”
Nothing more spinner than this!
I'm not gonna take it because it's useless here.
Film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was set up in collaboration with the Finnish producer of Valio milk products.
Mr. Wright has provided Valio Gefilus, which contains bacterium milk acids and vitamins C and D, which help people strengthen breast bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, senior vice president of Valio for entertainment, jussy and new categories, said: “We wanted consumers to offer something really new.
Something that would follow up on the commitment and at the same time would allow us to explain the benefits of the probation.
We've come up with a lot of crazy ideas that end up with the idea of "call Ian."
It's said that the interest in cancer health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about the producers, we wanted to give them more attention - good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of cancer health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in health is a global phenomenon and through this document, we have brought more information to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think that the film reveals a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakal, who filmed the film, adds: “Let’s say that Ian would lose my respect if he took some of what I wanted for him - as if the incredible Russian sunset that appears in the film. ”
Olying some things was naturally harder for Iana, others very hard.
I'm glad we got rid of some of these dirty things."
In 2015, Valio conducted a study involving 84 per cent of respondents associated milk-based oxygen bacteria with, in particular, cancer and cancer, and 58 per cent of respondents indicated that at least the products containing added milk-based oxygen bacteria are available.
The family of the socially needed before the move destroyed the current building in Saltash City in Cornwall
The family of the socially needed left the damage in its current home of over 50,000 pounds after being accused of terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were expelled from home in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of ills against him.
After their violent eviction, the authorities of the housing community were shocked when they found out that property was in a state of emergency.
In the walls there were walls, floor coverings were covered, all on the grounds of the war of waste, and it seemed to be destroyed.
The family has already moved and has to live in private homes
Donna McEvoy, director of housing issues in Cornwall Houseing, said she was worried if she was going to save the house.
She said: “It was a nightmare for people here, and I don’t think people should live like this.
A number of circumstances need to be considered, because this property will probably lead to fame as “not so much as a good part” of Cornwall.
This family is not well-known and their names are not.
A couple have three sons who have been away from home at times, and the police have indicated that the horrors caused by the family included street fights using baseball bats, fears of the local population, drug use, drug distribution and loud screams, beatings and threats.
Skeldon (47), whose name was mentioned in the rental contract, was sentenced to antisocial behaviour in June.
In a few places in the house that may have been destroyed, there have been noticeable wastes.
In a house where drugs were distributed in the past, a underground crack had been removed.
The neighbors say they saw her on the street, and they called the police regularly.
Cornwall Houseing was forced out of the house this week by violence after they had received an additional 11 weeks to volunteer.
The neighbors who came to the scene welcomed the arrival of their lives as a living flock.
One of them said, "They never tried anyone."
We've lived with them for 20 years, and it's always been like this.
How many times we've seen the police here, they can't count at all.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because there was incredible silence here - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, director of surveillance in Cornwall Housing's neighborhood, said the family could not cooperate with local authorities.
The family in the house lived 20 years, the police were regularly summoned to the house
Wastes and old toys moved into the growing part of the home
She adds: “It is a shame that the tenant was unable to accept responsibility for his own conduct and for the conduct of his family, and that he is always moving up to the last step taken by Cornwall Housing.
It was a very difficult case because their conduct was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, had to be feared by her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team carried out, the police from Devon and Cornwall and the members of the local community who informed us of.
I hope that this step will bring some comfort to the neighbors and at the same time convey the message that non-compliance will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons of renters who lived in the house at different times were about 20 years old.

Workers will now have to remove waste stocks that remain buried around the house
In 2014, the police carried out raids and found over 70 grams of concrete, weights, equipment and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon's got a warrant when she was found a drug-holder in class B that she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was fixed on the basis of her son's home, Leo Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It's because Tanya and her partner are now living in private apartment in Plymouth.
It seems that graffiti were used in many places at home.
Police say they're going to force employers to break the rules of their contracts.
Angela Crow of the Denov and Cornwall police indicated that the transfer was a clear link to other tenants who would continue to break the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can act innocently, and to those who wish to follow such conduct," she said.
Denov and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and inhuman behaviour and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal are afraid of the low-flying military pressure aircraft over the beach
Tourists who enjoyed the sunflowers in the Portuguese Aveir were afraid of death
The flight of the Portuguese military aircraft P-3C Orion was flying to an incredible low
The military aircraft reported that it was a summer flight and that it was not safe.
At the time that a low-flying pilot found himself on a full beach, he was caught by frightened tourists of panic.
At dramatic events, it is seen how the military aircraft is getting to the distance from the sun and people on the sandy beaches in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The tourists began to raise after the collapse of the engine of the train without seeing what happens from the darkness.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon at Costa Nova, near the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several athletes who confirmed video games of a dramatic flight on social networks, said: “The plane was going through twice as low and at one point it seemed to be going to work. ”
Nuno Arroja adds: “I surfed and really thought my plane would fall on my head."
Travellers on the beach in Aveir were frightened when a low plane appeared from the darkness.
The Portuguese military aircraft reported today that the P-3C Orion pilot was on a train with a view to identifying fishing vessels on the coast and had to be low because it was the only way to control ships.
A plane apparently flew something less than usual because of the poor visibility of fire caused by fire from nearby forest fires.
Forest fires destroyed part of Portugal this summer and claimed four lives on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese military aircraft reported today that the pilot had to fly low because of the heavy smoke and smoke from the fires that protected him from exposure.
The flight was on a course flight and the pilot was requested to identify the fishing vessel in the course of the course.
Half of the funeral services do not comply with the rules.
Half of the providers of funeral services do not comply with the legal provisions.
The Czech Trade Inspectorate (CHOI) found this in the second quarter of checks.
Its main purpose is not to inform the rest of its prices or to provide written confirmation of the taking of orders.
CHOI put 41 knots in total value of 73,000 kroner.
Today, her speakers, Jiří Fröhlich, were informed of it.
Inspectors found errors at 47 out of 95.
According to non-information on prices and missing confirmations of certain funeral services, the products were also sold or provided services at other prices before the meeting.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly marked and once the seller used an unverified measure.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products by a total of 7077 kroner.
This was the case with watches, candles and candles which were not properly marked by mandatory information.
"In view of the fact that in this specific area of services there is still a breach of the law, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
The London school that joined the IS was killed in Syria.
It was reported that Kadiza Sultan, one of the three British schools that went from London to join the IS, died in Syria.
Legal representative Tasnima Akunjee said her family learned about her death in Syrian Iraq a few weeks ago.
The ITV News reported on Thursday that she was probably killed during a Russian plane attack in Iraq, which is a very good group in the country.
Sultan was 17 years old and her family died right away when she was ready to flee the war and return to Britain.
"Man wants to believe that the only good thing about the whole thing - as a message and a warning to others that these are real dangers associated with the path to the war zone - is that people are better off when they make decisions," Akunjee said.
Sultan and two other schools from the eastern part of London arrived in February 2015 to the airport to Turkey and then to the bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultany family learned that she was married to an IS warrior in Syria and was released within a few months.
Reid says if Clinton is elected, he leaves Garland as the candidate of the Supreme Court.
The Senate leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that the presidential election candidate Hillary Clinton appoints Judge Merrick Garland to the highest court in the case of his election.
The Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment, even though her President Barack Obama was already nominated in March.
The leader of the Senate of Mitch McConnel says that the person who replaces the Supreme Court will choose the future president.
During the conference talk on Thursday, Reid announced that Clinton's choice of Garland was deemed to be "with certain degree of reliability."
Reid's speech later revealed that he didn't talk to Clinton directly about whether Garland would be named, and that he was just speculating.
He evaluated Garland and said the Clinton team wouldn't want anyone else to "rojot the ship".
Garland is the president of the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Reid said that the republics blocking Garland's appointment are "responsive" and "posco" of the Republican candidate to the presidential office of Donald Trumpa.
He said Trump didn't get to the office.
According to the Treats magazine, our calendars are for "women and men"
Magazín Treats is co-operated with photographer David Bellemere for the publication of the calendar for 2017, inspired by Pirelli's 70th calendar.
But instead of revealed famous personalities, NU must try to find another generation top model for its calendar 2017.
President Treats Steve Shaw has already told us this year that his store is full of toys from the old school because "Playboy is for men."
I do it for women.
Obviously, the calendar is thought to be too.
"We have to go back to the display of time and classics when women and men are pleasantly feeling and letting themselves be inspired by the photograph of the woman's body," Shaw said in a press release to issue a calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can send their photos online or personally during open competitions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where's the vinyl? Who really buys the gramphone?
Vinyl loves men's identity in the middle of the age.
Before you decide to add a section of comments to your notes under the pseudonym Not AllSpecialsFor the Middle Ages, we note that this product is derived from actual data.
According to YouGov, so much discussed the rise of the gramphones has been linked not to the boom of millions who want to love the original property of a physical object, but to the middle age nostalgia.
Those who recently bought the album on vinyl are the most likely people between 45 and 54 years of age.
Young people aged 18-24 are at least likely.
In fact, it is not about the collection of the above-mentioned fiction - all of it has an emotional dimension: older people who buy gramophones are more likely to keep their feelings (56% version 53%) and prefer to be alone (69% version 66%).
But the results of YouG are true?
If this blog had been posted as a television reporter, I would have watched the camera as I looked into the Russian street in Soho, dressed in a decent dress and a broad gesture. Then I would stop, pull my hand out and say something authoritative, like, "Let's go look at this."
Let's look at this.
As soon as Soho's heart loses its charm and charm - buildings sometimes surrounded by independent sellers are now filled with hotels, restaurants and food, Confucian and office needs - a number of fantastic specialised trades with gramphone tables remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop running for a while, and I'm going to get closer to the different men in these shops and try to figure out what their age is and their emotional dispositions are.
Stuart (55), born in Glasgow, following from Sister Ray (numbers: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (numbers: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20 has an afternoon meeting in London and is looking for business to spend several hours.
I wonder if he's a collector.
"I think so," she says.
I have about three or four thousand records.
All these recordings remove the walls of his apartment - on the picture above (the photo sent me by e-mail, I didn't follow him home).
This huge number of albums and singles also has the ability to afford it: they can now buy gramphones that he could not afford when he went out from the beginning, and he buys again what he sold in youth and had no veins.
“Many of what I buy is from the end of the 60s and from the beginning of the 70s. These are things that would be published when I was 11 or 12.
They agree that those who buy their savings are likely to invest in what they like about themselves, and they add: “I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink too much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works in Sister Ray, and she also thinks that a number of customers she meets belong to the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media wave, people who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy their old gramophone tape back.
According to my discussions, the people of their congregations were the most numerous between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their gramphones and bought a CD check are now selling their CDs to buy their gramphones back," he says.
This could explain the boom of lovers of a certain age.
But what is the emotional importance of the gramphones?
It will not take you more than a few seconds to find out in business like Phonica that you will find a pleasant community with similar thoughts in music.
According to Weze, some older customers are particularly affected by the free payment system.
Some graffiti receivers can feel excited in a digital world and decide for a known average of both graffiti, things that cause memories of a quiet recovery.
"I think that filling a table or owning something can bring certain comfort," Wez says.
I'm a collector, I have it, and I think it's a lot of people too.
It's a simple way to fill the place in the head.
"We're all like their social workers!" is called a co-workers from a collection of gramphones.
The ICM study concluded in depth that nearly 50% of people who bought vinyl albums a month ago did not listen to it.
According to the study, 41% of the requested gramophones are never used, while 7% of the gramophones they buy do not have.
In this reporting point, he must have been seriously concerned about the transition of the new bossa compound.
The aspect of "trophy" and reviving interest is something Jonny (42), who works in Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men).
"Someone just came in and said, "I don't have a gramophone yet, but I want to buy it on Radiohead's desk so we can put it on the police," she says.
The percentage of these is not big, but it's coming.
It's more about a product page than a song.
People come to us who say, "I don't have a phonograph."
They're younger people, not older, grown-ups who get into it.
Fopp, where at the present time almost one floor is won by a gramphone desk, has many more diverse visitors when I come.
There's a couple of seventy-year-olds, tourists, who make photos, pubertys, and women in the middle of the year.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as it used to be - from players instead of abaly jezzet calls the latest pop from Wild Beauts full of synthesisers and sex, it is good to see different customers.
None of them seem particularly personal, but the inner trauma is hard to imagine when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) spends a few minutes in Fopp and looks at various gramophones on the left.
She's one of those who's more likely to look at the exhibition than she's losing her temper.
According to her words, she doesn't do much, so she doesn't seem to think she'd pick up a gramophone disk.
It's worth a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on the computer or something like that, but the gramphones have their angle...," they'll be excited.
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is the trade that inspired a new generation of lovers of the gramphones: Urban Outfitters.
I pretend I'm very busy with girls in busy jeans and I'm following a group of attractive girls who just hang around the polaroid camera. Then the father and daughter decide to buy the Crossey gram.
The left is the castle whose walls cover the gramphones Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Maca: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, based on any average collection of gramphones.
No one looks at them - maybe just because they're just for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they can't reach them.
It's a "vinilary trick."
But because any attachment to him could mean more money for the industry and send several customers to Soho Valley for another, it's not too much to worry about.
It is not surprising that the demographic area, where it is likely more time and money than in other areas, is also the one where the most costly of the most luxury goods that the wine has certainly been.
But while I find that the results of YouGov seem accurate - at least in the trades with the gramphones, they do not take into account a large number of collectors and lovers of vinyl who actually exist, in trades with the gramphones and online forums.
These people probably work hard at schools or offices.
It certainly does not work on Thursday morning after trading with the gramphones on Berwick Street, passing the recordings and avoiding looking at the odd, thirty-year-old fake television modator, hiding behind nothing of the middle-aged men.
The Groningen root is the most active converter - video reporting

The Court of Justice in France refused to cancel business in the jungle camp
The court in France refused orders from the authorities in Calais to demolition ten of the provisional trades and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During the trial, the Authority in Calais held this week that the state should be able to cancel up to 72 provisional trades where people in the camp sell goods from cigarettes after energy consumption, offer hair drying, sell tea in provisional restaurants over 50 cents or basic food for several euros.
The Calais Prefect's Office argued that it was necessary to eliminate places because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they mean the danger of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organisations in the court stated that the shops and restaurants are viable and that the free food offered by the State by the supported association and other groups does not provide food supplements for increasing the number of refugees in the camp.
Sponsored provisional shops and restaurants often provide shelters and free food for people in need.
The Court of Justice in Lille decided that there is no legal basis that would prevent people from carrying out 72 provisional trades, but pointed out that the purposes of Prof. Calais are "intelligible".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that sales of food, coffee and restaurants play a lot more than just food to people who "live in extremely desperate conditions."
He said that the spaces provide quiet places for meeting refugees and volunteers.
One of the places where demolition was threatened was the camp coffee shop, Jungle Book Kids, which runs a non-profit organization that offers 200 meals, English and French hours and asylum advice for hundreds of people who are under threat of being killed in the camp.
Peticis for the protection of children have signed more than 170 000 people.
Guardian received a letter that stated that the closure of the coffee shop would "be for these children who are only 8 years old."
The charitable organisation Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the number of refugees in the camp grew to over 9,000 over the coming years - which is probably the most over the whole time.
You thought he was dead.
The wolf crosss itself and the volleyball mouths.
"I could have trained normally from March," he reported at the start of the summer preparations in full strength.
What happened to you?
I've had extraordinarily high blood pressure, and I've had heart problems.
Because when I was at the college in Korea, I didn't know I had some blood problems.
So it's been a long flight to Asia?
Two years I had a bullet in my throat, and I didn't know about it.
It hurt me. No one found anything.
Then the wounded came up.
In the summer there's a ruined life, it'll always suffer, especially when it hurts or changes time.
But nothing that would limit me is an aesthetic thing.
Did you have concerns about life?
He's got it.
Last year at the summer tournament in the Forests, I didn't know I had an embolism, and I couldn't even move there anymore.
I turned my blood off last night.
The doctors told me it was something completely different, I was still five days fully equipped.
In fact, I thought in the trees I was dead, and my friend and family.
I've seen you somewhere else.
How did you compare that?
I guess I had to survive, now it's just going up there.
I know I have some blood problems that I have to watch more when I fly somewhere.
But it can do anything about it.
Even if I wanted to get back to Prebras right away, there were problems with my heart.
It's all right now.
From March, I was finally preparing myself at home to be able to play again.
I swear, I'm physically better at it than I used to.
What do you expect from Ostia?
I'm glad the party looks good, most boys I know.
I'm curious about the other two foreigners who're coming.
We might sit down with people so we could fit in together.
Do you know the mouth?
He had a history of kidnapping, but every season is different.
Two years ago it was eight, now it's over.
There's a new team in Ostia, just a few players left.
It was the last in extralysis, so it's a big area for improvement.
The way we use it, it's on us.
We'll see about the first cars who'll be fired, maybe we won't.
Is the Bronch Tower a success guarantee?
He'll think of a lot better than the last place.
But my coming didn't agree with him, I agreed before.
There were other coaches in the game, I was with one big friend, and it was agreed he'd move here.
I'm not gonna say that.
Finally, Mr. Brom came and I like it.
He's got a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been doing a lot of ten years, he's been a good player.
They'll move us up.
What do you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I love fighting, I love Hecu and I like to get an opportunity in not such a spy team.
I was two years in Pribras, but there's a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team, because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned a stranger who is already training Australian Boehm in Austria.
What does it look like?
I agree with the circumstances I know. We played against each other at the university.
And once we were there together, we used to sit together for the night after the game, so we know each other and we're friends.
I missed 3:1. I just found it at the start of the summer preparations in the port.
He's got a Slovenian friend, he's a sympathetic.
There's still American Nadazdin and Brazilian Ze.
Do you know anything about them?
I wrote to the American, it looks like a nice boy, Brazilian who knows how to speak English.
You've been contacted by the American?
It seemed like a good idea to me.
I'm an actor, so whoever creates, so I should communicate with everyone.
I just found out what it's like for a player, I found myself online playing, I saw some video.
He's totally fine, the boy jumps, he's tall.
We wrote a few messages on Facebook. He seemed like an asshole, he'd come after us.
How do you enjoy the position of the recording unit?
I didn't want to take anything else.
It'll only be four and I don't mind going to shoot.
I'd rather be at the center of the line, I'd rather take the team than someone else would.
I guess I don't want to play anymore if I'm supposed to be a second player and get involved in it full-time.
How many times have you been single?
Half a month in Pribras when it didn't go to Custava as a captain, he got sick, and then there were money problems, and he left.
We've been up since then, and I've been playing.
In Brno, where I'm a restorer, I shot one and two.
He was in the Old City for a great year, after which I had a lot of offer, and he just chose Prebra.
Since then I've been wanted by Budéjovice, I've stayed, but I haven't finished the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
A short walk stays with Phelps' domain.
"Being again on stage winners and hearing the hymne is as sweet as always," Phelps laughed and then he had eyes full of tears again.
His fiancée and his mother were again in search of him, the son of Boomer this time slept quietly on the ears.
I'm spending an ineffective week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago, I started swimming, and in a couple of hours, it's gonna be all right, he said.
In the terminal behind Phelps for two seconds, the strong Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won a long career.
Bronz won the Chinese Wang Shawn, a bronze medalist in this discipline from the world's late mysteries.
After Alu Oerterov (disk) and Carl Lewis (far away), Michael Phelps is a third athlete who has managed the same discipline in four games.
After most of the race, Phelps and the next American Ryan Lochte and Tiago Perreira were held in the head.
While the goldsmiths in the final royal palace had settled down to the tree end, they lost their medallion.
The American superhero will have at least one chance to expand its unique medal collection in Rio.
Shortly after the ceremony, he entered the final race for 100 metres.
The legend could not have been halted by Ryan Murphy, who won a significant double - he won in Rio and a double track.
In the finals, he left for 37 seats of Australian sailor Mitchell Larkina, the third of which was finished by Rus Jevgenij Rylov.
While Murphy has only the fifth place from the second century B.C.E., in Rio, he became a prominent king.
From the imaginary throne, Larkin met, who had the same double just happened on the lower world champion.
The Olympics, but he only got medals now.
Canadian Penny Oleksian and American Simone Manuel were divided into gold.
For the sixteenth century of Oleksian, it was the fourth medal in these games, for Manuel's second after the stick.
The blue gold came to OH as the first African in history.
I believe I can be inspiring to others.
This medal is for all those who come after me, sports for them will become love and get to where I am, said Manuel.
The third was Sweden's Sarah Sjöström, which won a race of 100 metres in the world's record and still has a glass from the Royal Ballet.
By the end of the sixth world recordman Australian Cat Campbell.
Japan's Rie Kanet won the Persian bilateral victory, for which it was the first Olympic medal in the 1970s.
There is no valuable stone from the mystery of the world, its maximum was the fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second gun in Rio won Russia's Julia Yefimov, which started in the games despite the touchdown of the past with the non-destruction of the monsters and the opponent.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won the court, and I don't know why I should always answer those questions.
I'm so tired of it, she said Russian blue.
The right to start in Rio was required until the special panel of the CAS arbitration was closed before the start of the year.
They got away with my call, and I won.
If anyone likes it or doesn't, or if he has another opinion, to turn to the arbitral tribunal, he's added.
Herman: Breaking, we could win.
And start about midnight?
I don't remember that.
The Czechs lived on a special day.
Not until about an hour before the game, we found out who it was against.
They had to control the tactical preparation lightly.
And then, in a non-traditional time, the game started on the small box number 1.
The first set didn't start well, then hit the opponent's knife, but by the condition of 19:19 they didn't control the end of the line.
In the second, they were clearly better and comparable, but the decisive tie-break did not go out to them.
First of all, the number of services shown was 10:15 and the theft with the Olympic tournament.
"We could beat Russians," Herman's flight.
How would you measure the game?
Hermanov: After a bad start before I played, we got to the game.
At the end of the day, he flew me into the last balloon with the receipt I used to have.
We lost a set that was key.
In the next set, we've got a look at the roof, another defense, and we've pressed on the service.
In the thie-briak there were terrible cuts, we picked up on this page.
It was a defeat because we could defeat Russia.
The damage to the beginning of the first set, we got out there.
We've been able to take it away, but we've missed the points.
The second set was great and the third dealt with service.
We made a lot of mistakes.
We've given them five points, and about five of them, we've been very busy there.
It's a shame the Russians were jealous.
How did you play number 1 in the small yard?
In fact, it's similar to China in subsequent courts.
The environment and the atmosphere were different.
It was one hour at night, complete silence, no music, nothing.
It was a difference between the center and the center.
We wouldn't choose such conditions, but we can't choose.
What was the preparation for the event when you found out the name of the opponent an hour before the game?
Herman: It was special.
We started having fun at the party without knowing how to fight, so we couldn't make tactical preparations like the rest of the team.
But Simon (Nausch's uncle) came to the tactic of almost all the possibilities that were there.
He had a lot of papers prepared with a tactical device, so we were pretty well prepared on this page.
Remember you'd ever start a lunch party?
Herman: Probably not.
We've played half a dozen, but not twelve.
Block Rusky Birlov in front of play-off on OH in Rio.
Beach volleyballists Markéta Slukova and Barbara Hermanov are located in front of the play-off on OH in Rio.
Was that unpleasant?
The point is, since we've been playing the last two games in the group since the tenth, we've had the regime removed before.
This was two more hours ago.
It's special, I can't imagine that another sport has a athlete who has to give his best performance in twelve hours.
But I think we've prepared the best we could.
We knew it would be, but it's not completely typical and it's probably not gonna have a favorite time to play.
How do you value the Olympic experience?
Hermanov: Since the process from our target group was, it's on one side fine.
We did what we said.
But now after the game, I'm sad.
As a result, I will sleep with it and from the morning on the Olympic tournament will only be remembered positively.
The big brother is here, the first cool SIM comes.
Don't let her go.
The new rules shall apply to all persons without a Thai passport who, at the time of their stay in Thailand, decide to arrange SIM for one of the local operators.
Thus, not only are tourists but also those with long-term visas who, for example, work or close marriages there.
The Secretary-General of the Office of National Communications and Telecommunications Commission Takorn Tantashi also announced that there would be no exceptions.
The sales plan for SIM intended exclusively for foreigners was presented by the national telecommunications regulator at the beginning of August.
New measures that enable monitoring of their positions to be carried out by the authorities within six months.
According to Tantasitha, it is a means of maintaining national security that will allow the criminal activity to be managed by a just foreigner.
In addition, so-called tourist SIMs also have help to withdraw persons who exceed the allowed duration of stay.
For sellers, within half of the year, the special SIM for foreigners should be set aside for Thailand.
The distance will be just the monitoring function that will be permanently suspended on behalf of the designated persons without the Thai passport.
She won't be able to escape.
"This function in SIM for Thai is not because you can always be easy to track," Tantashi added.
It is necessary to add that in Thailand there are no anonymous candidates like in Czech.
The seller requires evidence of authenticity.
On the other hand, one of the operators spent several years distributing free starting SIM to tourists on the airports.
They were so anonymous.
The introduction of the same measure as Thailand also takes into account ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries, such as Malaysia or Singapore.
They are also currently subject to SIM registration, although the legal use of the monitoring system is not possible.
However, the measures adopted do not mean an obligation for foreigners to take part in the entry into the country of the local operator of SIM.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own domestic SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be brief.
Operators of the country concerned shall know only relevant network information after crossing the border and after reporting SIM to their network.
They know the phone number, but they never know about the owner.
However, the difference in roaming prices between local operators' rates is so embarrassing that most tourists are also looking at local SIMs during their stay in Thailand.
The efforts of the authorities to monitor the movement of foreigners were legally expected by foreigners living in Thailand.
Tantashit eases the situation and, in relation to the protection of the privacy system, compares the obligation to provide residence addresses in immigration documents.
The police will also need a court order if it is necessary to monitor specific persons.
Any abuse of the system will threaten the near future of an unhindered punishment.
"If the service provider follows the SIM position without a court order, he will be charged with a criminal offence," Tantashi added.
The system should also maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While it is currently possible to recycle a specific number until the 90-day period after the SIM did not sign up to the network, a new one could come back to Thailand after fifteen days.
Luxury apartment in the newly built Vinohradch has a swimming pool and a terrace.
Why did you choose to live in the building?
We've been looking for an old-fashioned apartment where most people care about property.
The condition was sufficient parking spaces and elevators in the house, which was essentially disqualified by the older constitution.
It's not about problem acoustics in old houses, problems with flooring, high energy supplies and similar.
Under the condition, there were also large terraces, which the old constitution is not able to offer.
More interesting visits are found in the newspaper Modern apartment.
The entire interior has been proposed for you by architect Lenka Langer with his colleague Kamilo Polákov from Artiga's studio.
Why did you just say it?
Would you recommend cooperation with each expert?
Co-operation with the architect would be recommended to everyone, if he proposes to stay from the beginning, it is also a very complex technical process.
The second equation is the design of the interior itself: designers have a much better idea of the scale of possible materials and, on the basis of customer's request, are able to imitate the interior accordingly.
We have already worked with architect Lenko Langer on our mountain apartment, then on the basis of the personal recommendation of another client, and given that everything worked well, there was a clear choice for us even in the reconstruction of our new apartment in Vinohradch.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We have built a large community-living space with the corresponding land for a four-member family that is considered modern, but not a cold interior.
The priority was to target the connection of the apartment with the terraces and to realize intelligent household management.
And of course, the quality of implementation should have been observed.
Did you leave everything to experts, or did you put yourself in the final form of the interior?
All proposals, including technical expressions and samples of materials, were accepted, however the proposals were always taken from architects.
At first, we decided what we expected from design, and showed some elements of the interior that we would like to include in the proposal, such as copper or images.
I think that just our collection of Czech authors including the works of Karl Malicha, Karl Visushila, Václava Špály or Otto Gutfreunda architects helped us to focus on our experience.
Also the combination of black, white and orange wood was the idea of architects as well as the individual pieces of furniture, walls, floor, lighting, coppers, textiles, art, etc.
Were there any complications that you had to give up on your original ideas, or were you going to join the new?
Almost in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the building at the moment when it was possible for the first time to appear at the height of our base, and they found that the views we had planned were actually behind the building.
At that time, we've changed the availability of the night from the base.
It was used on the kitchen line and on the roof of the blood walls.
In the interior, wood surfaces are then covered with added skin, such as food and baroque silhouettes from Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Do you want to make any changes here, or is there something you would like to have otherwise today?
I mean, it's about a modern air interior, which, in particular, fulfills its purpose.
We don't know what the changes are, most of the repairs after the move have been played at the level of shooting and killing today.
Almost the only way out is by showing us that the flower tree is too cool to be home with a dog.
Slovo architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langer and MgA Kamila Hornykov, author of achievement.
Staying in the last floor of the new building was therefore possible to complete a completely new solution and several other repairs within the building.
The interior is an important first place for lighthouses in the corridor and the main toilet.
That's where we got the light of the day into the darker room.
Also direct entrance from the main bathroom to the air-conditioning terrace to the USSPA pool is one of the building repairs that was very useful for the whole apartment.
The participation is also a pool and a believe.
You're not negative compared to Francouis, says a Muslim living in Prague.
You're coming from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are the source of Algeria.
I was born in southern France, a piece of Spanish borders.
I've had enough to move.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
In France, I studied journalism, which led me to work in one store.
So why did you decide to leave the country?
I started to feel like I'm breathing in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Especially because of the atmosphere between people.
I've come to realize that every Francouz is very negative.
The people in France are negative in the world, but it's been worse lately.
It's interesting that you're reducing the exact negativity.
Some people still value this kind of Czech attitude.
Trust me, you're not negative compared to Francouis.
Some people don't think it's going to happen when they come to France because they don't take it as a tourist.
But it was too much for me.
The big issue is money.
People feel they have little money, but the minimum probability in France is fifty hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Now there's also a problem with the conduct of people against Muslims.
It's completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor began to look at me through his fingers just because I was a Muslim.
It's like I'm a bad guy.
That's why I didn't feel good in France.
My family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the exact Czech Republic?
I've been looking for work anywhere else, and I've found a place free of charge in the Air France company here in Prague.
I admit I didn't know anyone from the beginning of Prague.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what happened in Czechoslovakia, but I didn't know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here for three years now and I can't imagine I wouldn't live here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of the whole other atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't catch any negative reactions or offenses, but I feel people are more free here.
That I can do anything, dress up, and no one will judge me.
In France, someone still looks at you uncomfortable, perhaps when you have special clothes and the same.
In Prague, I started to seem really free.
I don't think the people who ask about such things are trying to figure out what I'm saying.
Where are you working now?
After working in Air France, I was working for a travel website.
Then we set up another friend's website on which people offer and search for shared housing.
We're just moving to Prague, but we'd like to expand it across the middle of Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I've got two very close friends here who are Czechs in half, and two other Czech friends.
I have to say that another specification of the Czechs is that it's going to take longer to start.
He won't let anyone go to his body right away.
It's quite different from the place I grew up.
Everybody cares about the south and likes the face.
It's different, but I understand it's cultural, so I'm trying to adapt.
You said you didn't speak Czech.
Is there a language barrier problem for you?
But I've got it pretty simple in Prague because almost everyone here speaks English.
Even in the evenings or in the food.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have much time.
And since everyone gets to communicate in English at least a little, I don't need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Have you ever met any negative reactions?
Maybe because you're a Muslim?
Not really.
Maybe it's also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
One experience hits me.
My leader, Czech, once told me about the French football team and brought something into mind: They're not French, but Africans.
That really touched me.
But if someone had a problem with being a Muslim, I haven't had it yet.
And even though my colleague once warned me of some anti-immune demonstration.
He said don't go to the center, they're gonna give me that.
The anti-terrorist demonstration is partly related to terrorist attacks.
How does your current situation affect you?
Do you need to be afraid that something like Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen in Prague?
I'm safe in Prague.
But the problem is that it can happen anywhere today.
I must have been unable to imagine something like this happening in France recently.
And it's not just Muslims.
And Islam does not recognize violence at all.
For me, people who kill are not Muslims.
The Koran says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel when terrorists protect your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel tired and guilty, even though I shouldn't feel that way.
I'm trying not to follow those reports of violence, but every time I read something, I need to apologize for something that's not my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for the terrorists?
We met in the place of Jire from Poddebrad.
In the middle of this section, Muslims and Christians demonstrated their resistance to violence.
Did you record it?
I didn't know about that.
But I understand that you people need to prove that they don't agree with violence.
I don't think they should do anything like that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they haven't done?
Are you meeting in Prague with other Muslims?
For example, my colleagues are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
There's a little more religious foundation than I do, so sometimes we have a rather wild discussion about Islam, because we're all thinking of it a little bit differently.
I'm leaving France, so I've been through a different course, and they've probably learned Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People who are Islam sometimes associate themselves with the underprivileged position of a woman.
How do you know that?
I don't think I'm undercover in any case.
It's a little different.
I'm a woman, I have power.
It's also related to that you don't wear any head coverings.
For example, a hijacker?
And she's signing up on the main way I've been raised.
My mom, for example, is a fundamental Muslim.
He prays five times a day, but he doesn't just wear a hat.
She always taught me that faith is a pure personal thing.
It depends on every way she interprets it.
When you read the Quran, you should make your own opinion about it.
So when I read in the Quran a passage that says God has told the prophet to hide his wife from the eyes of others, I said, "I am not the Prophet's wife. Why should I hide myself?"
On the other hand, I respect this, and if I have to go to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where the checks are required, I'll take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
Yes, I am.
I didn't feel so good anywhere else.
I've been thinking about Poland for a while, but it's great in Prague.
I can even imagine that I would raise my own children here.
Prague is the ideal city for this.
Holy Muslims and Christians demonstrated their opposition to violence.
The Kossels' Fencl wind in Rio has taken over the history of the past.
The voyages to the sea in Brazil, Rio de Janeiro, were carried out by Czech explorer Veronice Kozelské Fencló.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved in front of the final two breakouts in ten.
That would ensure Czech participation in the final race.
You'll pick up the packages as cotton.
They want to compete with transporters.
For example, using already planned transportation routes is the TV director Matéj Liška and the manager of the Prague music club Marek Gregor.
Three applications with a different geographical approach were inspired by the thought.
The national application of the Movement was released in May.
At this time, there are thousands of cities in it, and we will expand the network.
In Czech, we want to learn this first, rather than focusing on the foreign side, says IDNES.cz, a 14-year-old manager.
How does the Translation work and who can benefit from it?
You will download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the path and information on how large the package can be carried and how much you want to carry.
Someone's asking for transportation that day.
When the route and time of delivery is fulfilled, it will be delayed and mutual notification will come.
At that moment, a chat will open where the two will discuss the presentation.
How many people do you think I'd have to register for each package to always find their cook?
I don't know the ideal attitude, I can't figure out how many registered and how many roads it takes to cover all the most optimal and each offer is in line with the request.
It's already working on the main branches, and it's more logical than it needs to be on the road between the villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
People are still confident that no one will escape with the ball.
You've never had to deal with such a case before?
How many users do they have a job in two months since the drop?
Right now, we have about 5 to 6 thousand people who create roads.
We think it's a success, and we believe they'll fight next time.
He doesn't have to wait too long for the transmitter?
We hope that we will be competitive for large conglomerates now only because we are able to deliver something that needs to be delivered on the same day and at a price break.
In a large delivery company you will pay several thousand for two hours.
You're gonna have to pay a hundred and a half here because it's a way someone's already doing business.
Should traditional transport to the future be afraid of possible customers' death?
We hope so.
The market has a huge potential, it feeds international transport here as well as commercial grids where everyone started buying and gradually found that quality does not correspond to what they are paying.
No one wants to be found in the cover of the list, I promise you he's got to pick up his boots on the side, first that day after 19 o'clock.
At that time, however, I needed a package for six hours and waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that won't harm anyone and send a signal to try.
Marek Gregor (41) and Matéj Liška (39).
Not one of them ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as the director of the music club, Mattéj Liška as a television director.
In 2014, Shippancee LTD began to prepare an application that is used to transform the already planned routes between the world's metropolis, in particular the airport.
In 2015, the project was launched to develop a company that created the application required for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming lasted for three fourths of the year and the applications were placed on the market in March 2016.
The Translation applications began to develop in December last year and released this year in May.
It's about the local version of Shippansee managed for the Czech market.
The applications for Mesik and Mesek Profi have developed since January of 2016 and have been accessible to users at the end of July 2016.
The objective has been to make all these applications that are connected one day from the start.
In Czech, they want to govern the application and then to focus more on the global market in cooperation with a strong investor.
The share of the economy has recently been the subject of AirBnB or Uber.
Don't you worry about the move in the area where no one can tell you where the sharing threshold is and where the economy is?
It's the same as another product.
It is clear to us that if this is to be successful and we go up with it, we will be able to take another step in the light of the economy.
But while someone saves and does, it is not intended to maintain financial and tax controls.
Every user, whether on the one hand or on the other, will be forced to pay his income if he does so.
What makes you think the service has such a great potential?
The transmitter shall save and deliver, respectively, the costs on the way down.
That's a strong idea that's related to both sides.
In times of social networks that divide people, we would like this to get closer.
They can come up with nice stories, people are happy to help someone and they'll tell you about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or bags.
People, according to me, for a long time, lack of personal access, we say this application is the service of people.
So, how do you promise that a pack of chicken won't break?
Each user of the application together with registration shall draw up a public document and enter a bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are channels that give service and trust to man.
The Korahs also collect stars on the basis of the value of the senders.
We'll also offer insurance, we'll still have details.
In the event of a loss or injury of the custodial arm, the insured person shall not be liable under criminal law for content if there is something illegal within it and he does not know about it.
If the police stop him and find him in a closed package in his suitcase or ten kilograms of cash, he will be liable to the sender.
Don't you mind using sensitive data from the database?
Registrations are, if necessary, by the supervisory authority, who will be able to monitor it as the only one we are unable to see, data are protected from abuse.
How much money will you get after a successful delivery of a cure to the cancer arm?
The cook determines the price and gets the whole amount he's gonna say about.
The sender shall calculate a number of percentages for the communication.
These money is our profit, but it's just a few percent because we want to press the volume.
And no one can blame the curator for not adding the envelope when he actually delivered it, taking and distributing it is verified using the QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
What about the size or contents of the package?
You can move anything.
We have three sizes, small as a bone of butter, medium as a flat egg and large as a beer base.
Then there's no more restrictions and if anyone has a place in the car, he needs a refrigerator.
Plus has the possibility to take a photo in the package app, so the cook sees what he wants.
You don't even have to take a ball if you don't want to hide the contents.
You're gonna throw the chicken into your hands with the forgotten monkey, and it's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long was it going to take?
Kamarad got an idea more than two years ago, and I didn't pay much attention to it.
Then he showed me a demo application with an international approach aimed primarily at a passenger plane.
I told him I wouldn't be looking for an investor at the moment, but I'd like to stand up for him and give him a break.
The next year, there was a long-term development that we were founded in London by Shippanne LTD because of the greater credibility of the whole product.
But this isn't the version that you're focusing on now.
No, marketing we focused on Česko, where we're trying to raise the application, because this whole thing had birth pains and it's still what to solve and improve.
We are trying to react to the back-up of customers and the foreign market at the moment we do not solve that much.
We know it's a long run, but we don't understand, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the most basic and most expensive application, the other two were in their way of upgrade.
The transition came when we said that the national segment could be far more interesting and that at least we'll learn in Czech.
The third Mexico app is local, for the city.
But he can send a package to the exact address and to the other end of the world.
It works for the senders as well as the Movement, but the difference is that in it you can see images in the form of points on the map that are closest to you thanks to the geolocator in the mobile.
Applications for whores who want to live there, we called Mesic Profi.
So, can anyone get out of here to make sure he's going to get the package out of town?
Exactly, the last application will be downloaded to Prague by a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to travel to work.
Now, just like all the idiots with these camouflages, they can get this whole thing together.
The person sees where the orders are in the city, clicks, and sees when it has to be given and the transfer is taken.
It is set lower than competition services.
At this point, we're still making web-based broadcasts that will make it difficult for companies to send the backups, to the web for full data about them, to create points on the map.
Then we are able to use the services they need to factor them out every month.
Are you now committed to full consideration of the project?
It's bothering us, but we've got it normally at work so that we can enjoy and develop the project.
There's no hiding behind us a strong international investor, we're two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and one of them got caught up in it with other ideas and ideas.
Now we're looking for an investor strong enough to be able to compete with us not on the Czech market, but who should go with us to the world product and become another large player on the market, such as AirBnB and Uber.
The front part of Titanfall 2 must provide such a forgotten landscape.
It's the second part and only the game in it will be smarter than in Call of Duty, according to the first information.
The length will be moved around the standard eight hours and the filling must come directly from the food of the network in the first part.
It can therefore be enjoyed on the freedom of movement which includes, in addition to running, the possibility of using the battle titanium.
In addition to the action puzzles, the game will contain a level of right-to-left movement.
They'll remember the plates and include the ribs.
They are therefore the main example of double jumps, running after the wind and the laundrome.
At times, it will be necessary to eliminate even enemies.
There will be no lack of maps of the memory of the foolish and at the same time with special concepts.
For example, it will be possible to lift and dry the floors and close the possible doors.
That's how you're going to be like a warrior.
The time of the game should be offset by this between the noise action and the calmest moments for researching unknown planets.
We're going to play Jack Cooper's ass on the pilot's career.
Cooper at the beginning of the campaign, along with Captain Lastimos, spent on the international planet Typhon, which is inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And he's not going to have any weirdity.
In addition, during the disaster, the Lastimoss will have fatal wounds, and Cooper will therefore be given the task of delivering the captain titanium.
His dream of a pilot's career is so full before he's expected.
First step, but stealing the battery will be necessary for the robot repair.
There'll be great conversation with Cooper with titanium.
Players are served as a source of information about the past of the army, but they will also create humorous moments in robotic communication.
For example, when titan is about to eliminate all the injuries that Cooper is threatening at the planned altitude.
First information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 brought to the server Polgion.
The result will also be possible in two months and Bonusweb will bring you the first experience from the online game after Gamesco.
Titanfall 2 comes out on October 28, and it's for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ signal heals, however, the original publisher remains dead.
Sweden's Nordic company has changed its name to THQ Nordic.
In 2013, after a short period of time, THQ’s publishing company received a series of brands and rights to use the logo and company name.
Nordic was released, for example, Darksiders 2 Deathnative Edition or Red Faction Collection.
In addition, 23 and 13 of them have not yet been released.
Thirty years ago, at the time I went to bed, my wife, after thirty years of marriage, found a younger man, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - first of all, she'd probably try it for a long time, then they'd be together.
She's such a big guy, probably her guy, because she was like walking before me.
She's totally lost her mind.
On the first day, she even changed her voice, had such a girl, a favorite voice.
But when I told her I know what's going on, she was singing.
But I've noticed it all.
He went from work regularly to half a quarter, so she always went to three for purchases.
She tried to see him at least every day.
Later, I found out they were meeting him in the bar, in the office.
How many times did I know they were there?
I took my keys, he was determined to reach them there.
But I don't know why, I've always been sitting at home.
I've never been there to take that decisive step.
Maybe you'll laugh at me, but I believe my wife has dominated me mentally.
She soon found out that I was competent to do what she wanted.
And I really did.
Maybe I'm just such a doll.
My immediate neighbors then indicated that he knew about it too.
I was such a fool that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid that if it all went wrong, it would be bad.
That it's going to affect everyone in the family, it's just a daughter's shower.
So I've always said it, go on and on.
But once I went to his apartment, I needed some help.
He went there with me, and I told him I got anonymity that he was meeting with my wife and that he's testifying.
I asked him what he'd tell me.
He stood there, baptized his arms, looked into the earth, and didn't say a word.
Then I met his wife on the way out of the store at the same time.
I told her that, but she didn't believe it at all.
She never answered that and she didn't say anything to me either.
No one told me anything at the time.
I'm such a man who never went too far, who has a problem getting to know someone and then finding a woman.
So I didn't even think about divorce.
I've always relied on it to end one day.
I said I'd forgive her, and life's going on.
That's right, but it wasn't.
And I've never really dealt with it.
I've got it in me today.
I used to give her a lot of excitement, but I finally left it for rest.
He's still living in the next house, and I'm still living with her.
It's just more than my wife, my husband.
She's always done everything - she's smoking, she's lying, she's getting drunk.
She's working.
She always tried to convince me that I had no other reason to complain.
And it can be said that it's a lot.
But sometimes I'd like to look at her, cover her, and she'll let her go.
Together, we go through shopping and shopping, and we all think about the happy marriage we have.
But she once told me she never loved me.
She loved me, but she didn't love me.
And I see that he loves her today, that's her God.
And I don't have that kind of life.
I told her I didn't want to live, and I asked myself what I would say if I ended it.
I wanted to know if she would agree with it or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: yes or no.
But she thought, and finally she said, "But there's enough place here."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to create a new French Islamic mission that should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim citizens.
Following terrorist attacks, France is fighting radical Islamists, and with the help of the government and the local Muslim minority.
"If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will be more difficult for France to guarantee freedom of expression," Prime Minister Manuel Walls said.
He's willing to make sure that there's only spiritual education in France in the country.
He also wants to stop the financing of mixing from abroad when cash-inducing drivers often come in to pick up the jehade.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wanted to introduce a new French Islamic mission, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim citizens.
The new institution rewards the current French tax on Islam, which was established by the former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin in 2005.
She had already contributed to the review of the financial flows between the cities and the countries to which the building was financed.
Soon, however, internal conflicts broke out, and she never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," said Walls.
The former Minister of the Interior and Defence Jean-Pierre Chevénement, who is known as the residence of the secular state, will appear on the head of the new mission.
In France, about 2,500 mice and praying, about 120 of them serve radical Islam.
Since 2012, the French authorities from the country have hosted a total of 80 Islamic clergy and in a few decades they consider this step.
This week, she also attacked the German police against the Jewish clergy.
The Imams were reportedly recruiting fighters for the Islamic state.
One of them carried out a space where believers apparently radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essena.
Immediately after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate on a new institution that is not going to pay off.
All of this has resulted in further terrorist attacks carried out on behalf of the Islamic State.
The new assignment will have two main tasks -- to ensure the financing of the mix from home resources and to monitor our assets as well.
But it's not clear where he's going to get the money, although he's taking a few proposals.
One of them is a special payment for the meal hall, and especially for the meat coming from the garbage according to Islamic principles.
This tax would be paid to the sellers in practice for food, which is to provide permission.
A part of the money would travel right to the grant bill.
The contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French tourists who come to Mecca.
Each year, they are released from France in traditional deserts to South Arabia about 30,000.
In French museums, only indicators that have passed the educational programmes at foreign universities should be used.
As a result, their sentences should be in accordance with democracy.
The government is also blocking radical mixes.
"We've been closing them 20 since December and they'll follow up," Minister of Interior Bernard Cazeneuve said.
"In France there is no place for those who complain of hatred and disrespect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
I'm sick of it.
His ex-wife was seriously injured by an unknown shooter on Friday afternoon at the shopping center in northern Zaragoza, says the Independent newspaper.
The shooting came after the woman and her daughter left the garages in their car.
The man was waiting in the car before the shopping center, where he started shooting.
According to the witnesses, the man then turned the gun against himself, writes Independent.
The woman took an untreated daughter to the hospital, and she had to get a sanitizer for the men in the critical state.
About 11 a.m. came to the central part of the Metropolis autonomous region of Aragon, a nearby local university.
With a call to the Spanish agency Europa Press writes Independent that the motive was probably an unsolved recent divorce of both partners.
Callings with a Christian, we're wearing a tie, a ring and a chilli locker.
It's a summer of light, well-fated food, only we're a rebel, and we have our own hunger and our head.
And so, from the summer's prizes, the giraffe's giraffe, the bogey, the velvet ring.
Not very healthy, not very easy, not too often with the exception of salt or covered vegetables.
True, heating is time-consuming, and it is also a social concern, and no one should be locked in the kitchen.
But there are other options, how to do well, with special chairs, their preparation is a little ritual, but there is no need to create, five, reduce or breathe.
And they're still contributing to our health.
Whether it's a domestic sushi or sashimi, where quality raw materials and a few well-encumbered griffs will be used to make the preparation fun and to eat the real exotic cuisine itself.
Just like even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
Even here there is a time of more intense burning and freezing of rice.
The paper can only be moved to the water for a moment and then it's only about the fantasy of the cook how to play with the supplements and supplements.
It's not hair like hair.
The resulting range of Asian cuisine foods is today and the raw materials are available in general.
Includes a sugar-skinned product, which is one of the basic wastes of drying or fresh grapes.
You can also prepare it at home, but the right rose branch of the product has a unique pizza island and also a delicious taste thanks to the secret recipe, according to which it mixes from several types of octopus and plant.
It is therefore sufficient to buy a bag of the corresponding size, and the Annex with the showable antibacterial effects, supporting strength and resistance to cough or cripples is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are mainly used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in the service and supply of food in the context of the most diverse holiday opportunities and rituals.
Long-bred banana leaves are widely distributed in a number of Asian and South American countries as well as as "help" for the preparation of the most diverse cooked, cooked and dried foods, which they fear as well as the albola.
The banana letter then passes the feed to a specific trailer.
We are allowed to buy in stores with exotic fruit and vegetables, even before they are put into the shape of a bottle.
However, select only the list of green grids, and then healthy and unsolicited.
Similarly, it is easy to prepare salads from a variety of wakams, sauces, and sezam oil.
He can buy another frozen one.
Someone who often prepares her sushi will probably know a lot of crazy.
In Japan it is one of the most important types of marine species from which it is produced by cutting, cutting and drying so-called nori leaves – so payments are intended directly for the production of sushi.
Wakame – dark green rice growing in the waters around the island of Hokkaidó – is also fresh and dried and is equally popular as the nori rice.
In contrast to those who would not know the half-life of a cow, Asian women apparently use it for birth control.
And even this kind of effect is almost amazing.
The pure blood, strengthens the blood circulation, even clearly prohibits hair drying and is largely covered with mineral substances.
The dried and crushed wax also serves as rooting, for example, for the flavoring of rice.
The pure roots are first released into the water, then washed, put into hot water and in half a minute of boiling water.
Then it's stored in ice water, the middle irons are lifted and further adjusted, perhaps as a favorite salt.
Buying her already ready, frozen, is the easiest solution.
Thus, it is only possible to wash your hands with easy green filling, light and light, full of healthy senses.
That's how long a bomb lasts.
If you give up and don't come up with a grilled bottle.
Eat well, easy and summer.
The Asians know how to do it.
There's a few special raw materials and some liquids, and you have an interesting fresh food that easily combines fat.
And it's ready twice.
Four cups of rice paper, 40 g of flour, 40 g of white flour, 100 g of green wheat, 60 g of salt, 60 g of wheat flour, and 60 g of sweet chili.
The root of the dried coral, the lily of the black sesame, the liquefied chille, 20 g of manganese, and 40 g of the pellets, some pineapples.
First, we're gonna get a job ready.
The rice paper will be added for five seconds to the study.
Then we'll take her out and wait till she's gone.
In the middle of the hot water, we will soon break down the Christian benefits, and in three minutes we will quickly get them to ice water so that they don't lose color.
We're going to put the paper in full green and we're going to put it on.
We prepare them with white thread, pears and salads, we buy them on delicious noodles, we smile them with sweet chilli beads, we add a sliced corridor, we wash them thoroughly, and we put them on rice paper.
On the banana leaves we put Christian benefits, add spices, and finally finish the whole meal with a variety of wafers, a loaded dish, a cup of butter, a black sauce, and a couple of pineapples.
Britain has to rest with the silver in the seventh round, the choice of Fiji takes gold
The next performance of the Great Britain in the seventh row ended with a zero step on the last stop, Fiji broke into the final game on the fourth night of Brittany at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio at 43.7.
The Fijians presented a master lesson in processing, casting, drawings, supporting games, running on sand and brutal forces - and gained gold, their first Olympic medals at all.
The accident came with an unaccompanied price of escape in the form of silver medals - for Britain the third day - and the British could be on their performance in the inaugural Olympic tournament of the seven-week hill range, defeating New Zealand, Argentina and the South African Republic.
A victory over South Africa 7:5 in the semifinals of the same day may have died in the final.
In its form, Fiji would defeat a 15-member team in full health.
It's probably not going to be easy for Britain, but they can be happy that at least one of them will have gold medals tomorrow around the church: the chief guard of the Fijians is Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimbledon.
Great Britain hit the road.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, every game was lost in Adelaide Sevens.
They lost one here.
This wound hurts, but progress is unstoppable.
Fiji began to grow, and Britain's princesses seemed happy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and other co-players, it was like running behind a number of buses in the movement and World War I champions led to 5:0 when Osea Colinsa was discovered outside the border.
The timer showed four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing from which the conversion was.
12:0 and Britain is struggling with the sword.
Great Mitchell tried to stop the giant Leon Nakarawa and prevent him from healing his wounds, but only the Fijians failed.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremallu went to touchdown to the right corner and the British lost 17:0.
Nakarawa added the next one, and for hours it's still been more than 1 minute... from the first half.
Vatem Ravov passed through the tiny Britts and reached the pool where he was taking care of.
After the conversion to status 29:0, the suspension followed.
It was like Fiji was born for the 7s race, while the British were still learning to deliver.
That's exactly what it is.
The British, after the season, made big changes and the Fijians' effort stopped... for four minutes, which was good compared to the first time, until after the brilliant border of Fiji Josua Tuisova went on.
Dan Norton tried to get an opportunity for Britain, put the touchdown into the left corner on an increase of 36:7. The game has already won the citizens of the Pacific islands and their fans sang on their horses, had trains and dancing.
It was hard not to imagine the very happy approach of the Fijians.
In the final moments, Mata Williams was still the next attempt to win the Fijians.
She called the gunman, the Fijians were fighting, and the British fell on the truck all the way.
Just before that same day, Fiji broke Japan 20:5 in a semi-final and Great Britain won the South African Republic in a solid semi-final - about the difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown got the South Africans for the first time in charge, but Dan Norton, thanks to his hard work on his leg, crossed the protective line and ran the second time under the knife.
The great latecomer Marcus Watson, Brother Anthony of the fifteenth English team, provided victory - and finally a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Staning for victory in the space race inspired a coach's fight with cancer
In these games you won't find more emotional gold - and that's what to say.
From the first arrest to the last, during the 220 devastating expenses in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another significance in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Although there were two of them on board, three were on board. When the ship lit up the second Olympic gold for himself in the race of women, there was still a voice in the ship from the trainer Robin Williams. They were the first women in the history of the British sports that had such a result.
Their transport was absolute, totally their 39th race, in which they remained unconquered.
What we see - two excellent athletes, as after the water cold flying with elegant labyrinths - does not reflect the spirit of victory entirely.
For every gold medal from the bow, the battalion is a hand-hand, which the kiss means a difference, and no hand was helpful more than the trainer's hand, which he did not know 30 months ago if he was diagnosed with cancer this day.
According to his word, it was uncertain.
I've been suffering from cancer of a powerful mercenary that can operate, and I've been able to perform this operation.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
Sometimes it changes your view of things.
The manuscript was discovered to Williams in December 2013.
Fortunately, for the whole trio, he could have been treated at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, and so cut the event down at least - if that is what we can call it.
I needed to make money, so I had to get together fast.
That's what he's been up to.
I was in the hospital and I went after the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet in time when they said there were enough steps.
That's how it started.
It's a journey, but it's more important than anything.
Immediately after victory, their first thoughts on Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, spoke less than usual as he tried to overcome his own frustration.
Staningo, captain of the Royal Deployment Board, who has a mission in Aghanistan, said: “This week I was with emotions on the ground, it may be a little extreme, but it means so much. ”
Once again, it highlights how much it means to me, how much Helen and I have worked with, and Robin as well.
So far, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so thanks to him, it's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't wait for a better man for a trainer or a better dog.
Helen Glover and Heather Staning didn't lose the only race in five years.
The two set up an alarming rhythm that their rivals could not solve.
Even in the final 500 meters, when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stannings and Glover had a very large reserve.
At the most, we focused on the moment.
Helen cried, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important to get rid of it.
We had a good start, and at the same time, we didn't have to get to something famous.
We didn't enjoy today's fire, we just wanted to get out, go out and win the race that led us.
The two will take a year to think before they decide what to do next.
Glover's next week's wedding, with her upcoming TV show, is Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it would be my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
In London it took about six months before they found out I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
I have a much better feeling," she said.

A bond?
Even if people drive freely, the hunter says the Rubes taxafie is guilty of fraud.
Six taxi drivers and former Magistrate officer in Prague are, as the CHT stated, regrettably.
You've gone through a series of reports in which you've been removing false practices and those who should be in a group that will be before the court.
That's why you've been hiding a couple of unfavourable links with the missing actors.
How much is the report on the complaint of the members of the organised group going through?
I was hoping he'd come to some court.
I'm mostly aware of the verdict.
But I don't think they should be in jail.
It's nothing.
First, they should return all the money they've earned.
And they should return them so they can drive all people free.
It's a real solution somewhere.
Does that mean that you do not take any punishment as effective enough?
It's enough for me that some of them have such fear that they don't work here anymore.
For example, one makes a ping, another analyzes pizza, and one is completely exposed to it.
Suspension can theoretically get two to eight years of imprisonment.
Is that your adequate rate?
I'm generally in trouble with freedom.
I think it's a bad punishment.
Locking someone in jail, especially in such a case, makes no sense.
Such people should return the company they took.
In the fourth century, they succeeded in destroying the name of our country and stealing the people.
So let's make a good visit now and let people go free.
I can't imagine that.
It would work like a public prosperity job.
Like someone's going to collect waste, they'd get a car and free people in Prague.
No, I really think they'll finally get a condition and it'll be the same for them.
They'll find another way to convince you somewhere.
He studied at the Miroslav Ondříčka Film Academy in Pisa and then at the University of Tomáše Bati in Zlin.
He is referring to people who started with official videos and videos directly for the website in the Czech Republic.
He works as an editor for Stream.cz Internet television, where he shares in series, now prepares the Prague Guide series, which is specially designed for foreign fans.
This Rubesh is a form of short reports which I prefer to avoid in Prague and which it recommends without fear of using.
Previously on the series with the names What about this, The City of Controversy?, Life in luxury, And Enough! and Prague vs. Prague.
The complaint concerns them as an organized group.
The police have been watching her for months.
Can such a network of double taxi drivers be identified as a mafia?
They're so cute mafia, not what we know from Kmotra.
It's more about the mafia -- Juniors, but it's definitely organized.
It's just that they're looking at each other's staffs.
Prague's all broken.
I found that, for example, the main event is not happy with Paris, Paris is not happy with taxi drivers waiting in Karloví Lazní (Disco club)
Everyone's just looking at their place, and every group is kind of organized.
It's obviously online.
The suspects, however, are only seven people, six taxi drivers, and one former chief of the Magistrate that the driver warned against.
As you're saying, the unsolicited Jews didn't get out of the street.
So what percentage of the Persian taxi drivers in the taxi service, according to your estimate, is it?
It's a very small percentage.
They're still the worst on the street.
For example, I'm talking about Aleš Rijčk.
It's a man who's really dangerous - he's driving a telescopic bus in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he's standing at Karl's bridge and driving people.
When I last went out with him, he wanted me seven hundred miles away.
His police didn't arrest him for any reason.
They just picked a few people out of all that big group.
The same situation is also in other Prague locations.
Unfortunately, seven people are making it difficult to eliminate the already famous porcelain, which is apparently much larger.
Of course it's not for anything.
It'll help, but it won't change everything, it's true.
Are taxi drivers who steal foreign tourists still at the same places as you showed in the reporters, then at Karl's bridge or in Paris Street?
Yeah, that's right.
In these locations they stand every day and they break the records every day.
He ignores it as a city cop, as a prince of Prague.
It's not even cocurs anymore, but it's an easy silence.
House of Purse taxis in numbers
Still, some of them will be brought before the court if only part of the group is concerned.
It's half past midnight.
So I have to ask myself, Do you feel satisfied?
If I took it as a compliment, it would be wrong, because it was my goal, and it's always going to improve the center of Prague.
And even if I feel it needs a little better, I'll continue to do it.
You need to press the door on the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still do something to get rid of him.
You can't rest with that.
But it's not that way, of course it's more.
You're still trying to confront them directly in the taxis?
Sometimes I do tests and I have to say it's still bad.
Just last week, I caught one taxi driver, outside of the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He counted 560 kroner in three kilometers, although he claimed that it was 56 kroner (he used a ten-pound trick).
He had a uniform, the police took him, and this taxi driver was so upset that he was still following those cops and asked them when someone finally gave him 56 crowns.
A similar case.
The taxi driver on the taxometer crossed a decade’s mark and stole the tourists with 357 kroner.
Is it said that the volume of underwater taxis didn't rise even after you showed the faces of those who counted ridiculous amounts for a short ride?
Their pride is still unbelievable.
How did it happen to that taxi driver with 56 kroner?
The police sent him away because they couldn't talk to him on the spot because he put an account.
And it's going to be, I think, a problem in that court (six taxi drivers and one officer).
On the one hand, there will be a taxi driver with his accounts, on the other hand, the police.
Only according to the decision of the Supreme Court, the master shall not use secret deposits from the service taxi vehicle as evidence in the court.
When I got the news about their subpoenas, the taxiers themselves warned me about this earlier.
I've been busy, but I've always wanted to use it just for reporting.
Do you have any fear that this reality could protect her before the court?
I hope every judge will understand that no taxi driver can ride six or ten miles per kilometer because he would not use it.
You've been talking about a trick with a decade's mark, which, especially in front of foreign customers, are being taken by a water taxi driver.
Is it still up-to-date, or are they concerned about using this file after your reports are published?
I think we've popularized this trick by sending the order.
I recently went with one taxi driver, and he was proud to me that he was the right taxi driver.
But then I realized that there'd be a black cap on the side of the taxometer.
When I asked him what he had there, he said, "You know what it is."
If taxi drivers don't work too hard, can they be sentenced to a trial with their colleagues?
Is there anything that can be done from doubt?
You've been talking about the way you think they'll always find themselves on the road to subjugation.
I don't think it can do anything.
But someone can push them out of these places.
And these are the cheap taxiers who should be more willing to get them out of there seriously.
From my experience, I have to say that those hairy taxiers in Prague are overextended.
But do they want to go against those who claim to tell their services?
They want to have it, but they don't have a mind.
She can't go too far and she can't say exactly what they want.
When the demonstration was organized (on the basis of the proposal for a comprehensive restriction arising from Adrian Krnáčov's office), it was not very clear what they really wanted.
Once they said they didn't protest against Uber that they just wanted to have the same conditions as this service, then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It happened that they just blocked Prague and caused only the best possible ads for Uber.
How will you fully appreciate the access of the Prague Master in solving the traffic problem?
It's seen that she had to get into it until the criminal police were able to figure something out.
The Magistrate was short on that.
They had a map that provided information, which means that the taxi department had done its work for several years completely.
I hope the officers will count on the last control of all measured controls to find out what he's done.
That's what makes me the worst.
I've even been with him on one control drive, which I've discovered until then from their description.
It's been several months since the last parts of the series were published.
What's the answer?
I'm thinking mainly of foreign monsters, which is actually the most focused series.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I'll let them go.
And then when we go to the Old Town, it's a surprise that the same people who see it on the streets are really standing.
It's not famous for the famous Persian celebrity.
But seriously.
I'd put a bullet around them so people could look at them.
The museum of communism right on the street.
My last question is clear.
You're driving a taxi when you need it?
Of course.
I'm driving with services that I don't have to pay for, but the card.
I'm using services such as Uber or Liffago, where there's no way of subpoena.
But there's a lot of ghosts that are free.
I've only taken a taxi in the street since then.
The driver said to me after I got into the car, "But you've got the courage."
I'm gonna be moving for an Italian tourist.
In 2005 it was written about double taxi drivers.
Some of the prime minister Paul Bém, in the same year, appeared on the control train in the Italian tour and immediately on the first attempt by her driver, was two hundred.
Editor Rubeš had more experience.
The taxi drivers instructed him to drive 820 kroner from Old Town to Václav County, which is up to 195 kroner per kilometre, as reported by the reporters.
The Prague Master, however, determined the maximum price of 28 kroner per kilometre.
There are also other surprising sums in the report: for example, a two-mile road from the streets of Paris to Trulářský, 400 koruna.
The expensive rides also provided taxis waiting at Karl's bridge.
On my way to Angel, which is 2.5 kilometers away, they're gonna have to figure out six hundred rounds.
The marble smells mostly clean water, which is the best without chemistry and as far as it goes.
The uncleans are good with him, even though sometimes he has to give himself a slender back, he needs to keep her out of trouble.
It's not simple and it's not going fast, it's close to her job as a restorer of Vanessa Trost from Oldrich in Hawaii.
Down front of her: the burial is left with a wound that must be taken out immediately and come back again.
"The restorationer should be warm, patient and unwelcome at work," she concluded.
It's not far from her first restoration job in Frydlantsk.
Thanks to its restoration, for example, the stone element of the façade in the last tract of the Frydlántska workshop, she also restored the soys of St. Mary Magdalene in Zatiša, St. John Nepomuké in Frydlant, Piet in the Frydlántian District Street, the Marian column in Frydland or the Atlantic in the spring of the holiday in New Jerusalem under Smurk.
With the reconstruction of Melchior, Krystofa and Katerini from Rederna, it started in Fryland in 2011.
Now the surface of the stones is cleansed from the burden of uncleanness and the cross, which is made of stones, shall be secured against fall and dust; they shall be cast into the wall or into each other.
It's also waiting for surface healing and preservation.
The inscriptions on the tomb will be reprinted.
"Then it begins with the posting of letters on marble sheets of silver gold," said the rapporteur of the State Memorial Care of the City Authority in Frilanda Vérre Sobot.
In the past, there are no records of the funeral of some sort.
I'll take a closer look at the openings in the marble columns.
They're hundreds of years old and it's about the rest of the crew.
He was rich and rich, and, unfortunately, after the Swedish invasion after the Thirty Years' War, everything was gone.
They've broken up all the stories, known as Sobots.
In the Church of the Holy Cross are restorationers with peaceful overcrowding as a home.
After the spring of 2010, it was necessary to re-establish the baptisms, put up in the tomb, and now the tomb.
"We would also like to be left in the future," said Sobot.
The church is in a very good position, every year to maintain and repair the money.
Restoration work on the redundancy refurbishment will reach a total of 128 thousand kroner.
They will be removed from the grant, instead of being restored to this part, they will not charge any money.
The hundreds of thousands of crowns are just winning in the 2015 Historic City competition, and the remaining 28 thousand crowns are then the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, Frýdant Dan Ramzer said.
The representative decided to release the refund for the refund.
Experts' views on future developments in selected foreign markets followed by the index and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) in the horizon of one month and a half a year.
The market is dominated by low volume and growth.
Who would have said that at the beginning of the year?
The U.S. S&P500 index, which went through 12% of the corrections, is today at a new historical level and has already reported 7 percent since the beginning of the year.
Once again, the railway rules are confirmed that traders should never go against the interests of central banks, which have finally achieved their own.
In a situation where US shares at historical level are so low again that it is currently lower than in 2014, when markets are peaceful and without fear grew thanks to the quantitative release of the US Central Bank and when the same volume index (VIX) remained stable below the limit of 12 per cent.
And not to be.
Although the Fed market continues to prepare for a gradual increase in rates, quantitative release in Europe and Japan is in full progress and has also contributed to the work of the Bank of England, which will buy debt in the next six months of 70 billion pounds.
The new wave of quantitative release, therefore, puts down so low the results and contributes to almost complete elimination of the risk and fear of the future.
How long will this situation last?
Of course that's a million question.
But at the moment, there is no risk, the world economy is undergoing almost constant growth without further training, the situation on the comedian market and in China is stabilized, and Brexit is no longer essentially the subject, so we should not be too surprised if American actions continue to be maintained in a similar calm regime.
Unfortunately, Juncker doesn't study Klaus!
I'm very glad my friend Michel Barnier took this important and important assignment.
I wanted to make this difficult policy work, the head of the European Commission Juncker, when the French policy (a really experienced, because it was so different from the most diverse international political functions that we would find it difficult to look for a better example of European elite so that we would find it difficult) referred to the main executive of the European Commission's terms of departure from the Great Britain from the EU.
Juncker's selection of footnotes hopes that the EU is in serious interest to look for the forms of future friendly co-existence with Britain.
Most British media, however, adopted the name Barnier as Juncker's military act.
Barnier is a scaled European federalist.
Great Britain hates it.
As the European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009 - 2014), he was responsible for the reform of European banking law.
He took her as he could take her alone: the determined enemy of the free market and the model of capitalism.
The existence of multilateral regulations was a co-founder of the so-called banking Union concept and was against all that comes from the London Financial Centre, which has passed legislation to suppress the rigid financial sector and services regulation.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in the struggle with London, is going to be a tough, non-violent and obviously unscathed mediator.
That's probably not good news.
In this context, do not mention the quiet and friendly division of the Czech Federation, which has contributed so much to the development, transparency and empathy of Prime Minister Václava Klaus.
And that's why today Czechs can be the closest friends and allies.
Unfortunately, Juncker from Václava Klaus - at least in this - didn't learn.
That would be good for everyone!
The earthquake around Putin?
Governor Kremlin has abandoned his neighbor Ivan.
Russian President Vladimir Putin released Sergey Ivanov on Friday from the position of head of the presidential office.
He's gonna take Anton Vayno's place.
She informed the Russian press about this with a call to report to the Kremlin Press Service.
Putin then pointed out Ivan's missing his own request.
At a meeting that transferred Russia's 24 television station, the president said he was going to face Ivan's request when he came to the office that he wanted to be the head of the presidential office for no more than four years.
At the same time, he announced Ivanov would be his special environmental and transport representative.
The report on the exchange with the President of the administration, which currently gives Ivanov's representative of the Russian Federation, is considered to be quite surprising.
Ivanov, 63 years old, is still known as one of Putin's closest colleagues.
This former KGB officer, for example, has in the past suspended the functions of the Minister of Defence and the Head of Government.
The President of the Security Council will now be released.
Ivanov, in his meeting with Putin, pointed out that he was a long stay at the head of state administration, in fact a recordman.
He's been in it for four years and eight months.
In this regard, he noted that 11 people had already been active in this function for 25 years since her establishment.
The White or the Debts of Strycs won't win the Chafare finals.
So far, not one of the five tennis races has been able to turn into a final part.
As his first battle, Peter Quitov, who followed the Portuguese surprise of Monice Puige after the seeds 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
In a short time, the Czech thickets were followed by Shafářírí with Stríc.
Winners of Williams Network Sisters in the first set were after the win, however, two sets were missed, and Russia finally used the set in a short game.
The second set was lost by 4:6.
The success of the afternoon program in Rio has been noted by the Czech celebration: the bishop of Ondréj Sonek won his semi-finals in a glance when the second Damira Martina from Croatia was injured and was released in close to a second.
Today's good, the conditions were great, the wind dropped.
I've been trying to catch up with the most, said Sonek.
That's what his opponents had to fight for.
So some power has taken them, so it could be easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's gonna be easy, it's just playing for me in jail, and the Prussian Duckly reporter declared it.
Mirka Topink's button, but she didn't run in the Snows.
The fifteenth-year-old nurse has a fourth position in her driving semi-final in her career, waiting for her to start at the B terminal and fight from 7 to 12.
The gold from London doesn't work like that.
At first, I didn't get to the end of the Olympics.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I had a high-quality race, and I gave everything I had.
The contestants were just better, the Topink button was hidden before them.
She struggled to the end and believed that she would get in her fourth games between the sixth and the sixth.
The fight's got to be quiet before the target.
I knew the girls were all right that the field could get anyone out of it.
I was surprised that China had such a fine.
And I thought through Rakushank, I'd be able to get to the end.
Unfortunately, today's life race has been running, said the world's mystery since 2011.
Far behind the final defenses in Rio, a young shooter, Filip Nepejchal, who was not able to sell himself out of the qualification, this time a small market in bed.
In it Nepejchal listed the 33rd place.
Qualification was best for the Russians.
From the first story, Sergey Stoneski came up with 629 points, from the second Kirill Grigorjan (628.9).
Nepeichal's shot had a value of 620,5.
To the program in Rio, the athletes also spoke, among them and the Czech weeklys Katerín Cachov and Eliška Klučinov.
The Cachos are the second Olympic competition in the same place, the Czech recordman Eliška Klučinov is twelve.
He led the British Katarina Johnson-Thompson, which jumped up to a height of 198 centimetres as usual as the second Belgian Nafissatou Thiamo.
They both looked forward to the historic best high school performance within the week.
They still tried to jump 201 inches, but they failed.
Germany, Russia, who's worse?
When we look at the absurdity of the questions raised like this: The German company has gone through a deep severeflex, which is never Russian.
In both major European nations, dictators have been exonerated in the 20th century and have become powerful in regimes that were Nazi, brutal, and terrible.
From 1917 to 1989, the Russians contributed a large amount of 94 million to the victims of communism, which states the Black Book of Communism, regardless of the daily individual repression, hunger, non-competition of war or neiling experiments.
The Nazis have frozen around 6 million Jews, and the total victims of World War II are estimated to be 60 million.
Germany and the Soviet Union carried out their activities in the affected or abandoned territories.
In Germany, even in the SSSR, there were not only a few individuals, but a large part of the nation took part in these crimes either actively, passively or only by beating their heads into the sand.
It's not just the specifics of these nations, we're just as busy as we are.
In Germany, immediately the end of the war came the denationalization, the Norimberg Court.
But that's the most important thing I've ever seen.
As the children grew up, they began to ask, “Daddy, grandpa, why did you take part in such animals? ”
How could you do that?
This has led to real reflection and treatment of society.
Germany's elites have recently tried mainly on the prosperity of the country, the eradication of poverty, the prosperity of their citizens.
Now they also have other (often idealistic) goals, but they are definitely not going to join back Alaska-Lotrinska or anyone - to revansh - military attack - that's almost everyone knows.
After the lost student war in Russia, there was no big reflection.
The window of possible positive changes was definitely closed to the millennium when the former KGB officer (sic!) Vladimír Putin came to power.
Often the criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
Russia's road policy is revanishing, gaining lost lands, weakening the West.
Health, prosperity, and the future of their own people are not of any value to belief.
You'll be afraid of yourself, and strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that this is only in the decades of the despotic regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally minor - driven to Asian (self) tyrants.
Who is promoting the growth of heat around Crimea?
Ukrainian Army.
In the last few days and hours, there has been a deterioration of the situation at the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimea area.
Who is the source of fuel growth?
After a longer period of relative peace, the relationship between Ukraine and Russia was again damaged.
The Ukrainian side has become part of the Krym peninsula, which was joined more than two years ago to Russia and is part of its territory.
The reports from both sides of the dispute are of course contrary and are it difficult to verify them independently, so we have the opportunity to just think of an old well-known question that arises?
According to a report from Moscow, there were terrorist attacks on Crimea from Ukraine, which, of course, refused and yet accused Kreml of prosecution.
Information on the arrest of Ukrainian special units in Russia has already been provided by the Savčenkovi pilots known to have been identified in Russia.
If we were to join the Ukrainian version, in what would Russia benefit from the deterioration of the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is: nothing.
The scale of pressure around Crimea can only harm Russia, especially from the West in the form of further approval of the sanctions and strengthening of the anti-terrorist campaign.
In the last year, the immigration crisis in Europe has come to an end to the situation in Ukraine.
Ukraine's leadership has already lost all credit before its citizens when current support of President Poroschenka moves around 15%.
Ukraine's economy would have long broken down the EU's financial injections and especially the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to pay more attention to its country in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation before voters in its country.
President Porošenko and other members of the leadership of violent groups want to be shown again as strong men who are not afraid of becoming a major Russian.
There is no hope that all those who are trying to resolve an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will eventually realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers but all ordinary people on both sides of the conflict and stop their hostile actions at the time.
Bulgarian first showed inflation in eight months
According to national statistics, 1 % of the monthly inflation rate was reached in Bulgaria in July.
This is the highest value for several years (since June 2012) and the first non-inferior value since October of last year, when a net inflation rate of 0,2 % was published.
The annual average inflation rate, measured by the CPI index, for the last 12 months (June 2015 - June 2016) compared to the previous 12-month period (June 2014 - June 2015) was -0.8 %.
The Consumer Price Index in June 2016 was 101.0 % in June 2016 and the monthly inflation was 1.0 %.
The rate of inflation since the beginning of the year (June 2016 to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual rate of inflation in July 2016 to -0.2% in July 2015.
On the contrary, in July 2016, there was a marked increase in the path of these consumer groups: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
The price decreased in clothing and clothing (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and normal maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
At the same level as last month, prices remained in alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
The U.S. secret services were tracking Russian hacker attacks a year ago.
Information on Russian attacks was made available to the public last month when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that an attack was being carried out on the servers of the country centre of Democrats.
The Russian part of the attack is not mentioned, but there is no official report.
Moscow's part of the attack was destroyed.
The report on the monitoring of a particular Russian attack was very secret, as its statement would indicate that US secret services are monitoring and detecting the way they do it and the resources they use.
Two Russian reporting services were previously involved in the attack.
New cybernetic Security Advisory Committee
The Russian track material was coded and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reuters wrote.
Only a small group of eight main members of the Congress, called the United States gang of eight, were informed.
She is made up of two chief members, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, presidents of the two chambers of Nancy Pelosie and Harry Reid and four members of the Congress's defence and security committees.
The Head of the Democratic Party, Donna Brasile, announced on Thursday that he would create an advisory assembly for cybernetic security, which would be "to prevent future attacks and ensure the primary protection of the Democratic Party's servers".
There was a dangerous parasite in Albert's shoulder.
The hunter apologized.
On the basis of the consumer's rise to health problems after consumption of the food Losos divorcée taken - tastes 100 g, the date of consumption 22.11.2016, the pests of controls in Albert's shops in Václavský and in the Museum.
The control found that the L23012562/T4 load with the consumption date 22.11.2016, on which the customer warned is no longer available, and therefore the product concerned was collected with the consumption date 11.12.2016.
The laboratory investigation confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It's about the parasitic red of the trawl of the seabirds.
This is dangerous for a person - sharks in the body nest or fish stocks are a strong allergen and human-acquired live wolves can pass through the frozen wall into the internal organs, Štich said.
Customers are very sorry for the problems in this brand.
We were immediately on sale and for preventive reasons we were also on the other side of this position.
The suspect came to the side of the supplier that we're dealing with, and at the same time, we let this product be tested by ourselves, said New Yorker spokesman Albert Barbara Vanko.
If the customer bought this product, he can return it to any of the retail shops and get the money back.
Larvy destroys the ice and enough heat adjustment
The seller was Nekton-Vrnėta company.
They informed the Persian and Mediterranean veterinary administration about the threat of the health product.
According to the safe food server.cz people can be infected with anaisakisosis, which is caused by sudden chest pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease can pass without a license, the CHC indicated.
The symptoms will be delivered for an hour to two weeks after consumption of insufficiently treated infected fish.
After three weeks from the start of the malaria disease, most patients suffer from a spontaneous release of life-threatening drug.
Adults are sensitive to higher and lower temperatures, so they are killed either during sufficient heat processing of fish or in freezing it.
The veterinary authorities have at present verified the salmon and the products imported into the Mediterranean country.
Three of the five samples studied were parasites.
The 1700 product supply arrived in the PRC according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) at the beginning of the autumn.
To date, 919 packagings have been distributed in the vast majority of the Ahold River.
At the present time, there is an unsold stock collection of the product from sale, said SVS Petr Pejchal on Friday.
After finding positive samples, the veterinary authorities immediately banned the movement of other products from the warehouse.
Seventy-five Brittany wanted to get out of Rakky, apparently killed her with a Russian flag.
After the initial excitement and a quick fight with the Jedi who was interested in killing, there was an explosion.
The expected paradise of the caliphate has changed for the British girls to hell on earth, from which there was no exception.
The girl was in contact with her sister Halim.
She called her back to Britain and made sure she wanted to come home.
Leaving the Islamic state is like trying to escape Alcatraz.
They have no intention of shooting, The Telegraph quotes family lawyer Tasnim Akunjee.
The last steps went to Rakky, where the girl called the last one.
Then there's only news of her death that she can't believe.
The family communicated with her from the apartment in eastern London.
They've studied how to get from Rakky and cross the Turkish border.
They hoped they'd meet the former student again.
But Kadiza was probably killed before she could escape because the house in which she was staying compared to a flowering country was introduced by British TV News.
The TV added that the bomb was apparently triggered by a Russian aircraft that attacked the IS field in Syria.
You'd find blue from the sky just to get your child out of the danger zone, Tasnim Akunjee, the lawyer of the family.
In a week when Kadiza was thinking about a flight from the territory of the Islamic state, one Rakushanka was caught while trying to escape and was publicly killed to death, according to the information available.
I think that's what Kadiza said as a warning and she decided not to risk it, says BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana was released along with 15-year-old friends from the school of Shamim Begum and Amiro Abas on the 17th of February last year.
They just said they're going out.
But they were targeted at Gatwick airport and from there through Turkey on the territory of the IS.
The family of girls, according to the lawyer, did everything in their power to get Kadiz back.
You'd find blue from heaven just to get your child out of the danger zone and this family did everything she could to get all the strength to get your daughter home.
But it wasn't possible without risking their own arrest, to add a lawyer.
The only positive one, he said, is that the Kadiz court can serve as a frightening case for other girls or boys who are allowed to expose the Islamic propaganda.
"There are many cases when people went out there, realized how things were there, understood how far it was from the promises of Islamic state propaganda, and wanted to come back," continued Akunjee.
The Kadizin's associates are unknown.
However, since they have also been blinded, their families must be at peace with the fact that they are with the greatest likelihood of death.
To prison for money.
In Scotland, you can go to the grid and get the crime out of there.
For many years, the village of Inveraray was a national center and a guide base from Argill.
Since the 18th century, courts have been serving as a local prison.
The conditions in which the prisoners lived were sad and many prisoners tried to escape.
A lot of them have been successful.
Therefore, the city's representatives decided to move to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much warmer, hotter, and rainlighted in prisons.
In any event, it was not long before it was closed up for economic reasons by the end of August 1889, since the less appropriate device was expensive for operation and was not too expensive.
The punishments and the hour for the ghosts.
For the public, the prison opened a whole century later, visitors can compare the old building to a new building to convince themselves how different conditions prevailed in them.
The leaders in contemporary costumes are still encouraging authentic experience.
There is also a torture room in which visitors can learn what kinds of punishments have been applied to criminals, whether it has already been fingerprinting or body burning.
During the visit, tourists can be allowed to close to one of the destinations, most because of photos on the memory, or to express their feelings of being imprisoned on the streets.
Meanwhile, the Inveraray Prison is one of the most famous Scottish locations, where it is likely to be scared.
Several teams of paranormal activities have appeared there, and today the museum allows people to come to some ghosts to hunt.
That night it's going to be 300 pounds, which is in the count of 9500 kroner.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, there is also great food, nearby panorama and history.
"Animé" effect on Snapchatu is criticised as an Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by anonymity, but some observers say it's racially sensitive.
The Snapchat application every day allows about 150 million users to change the reality and to play with the unique way that limits them with absurdity.
You can make yourself ananas, a dog or a set that looks like a Roye Lichtenstein picture.
The filters are simple tools that deform reality and generate more than 30 million improved self-restraints every day.
Any mistake will be made immediately.
Snapchatu filters have in the past served as a criticism of the accusation that the application promotes blackfacing or supports white cuts of skin as an ideal beauty.
So when this week's users offered a filter, thanks to which they had a soft eye, covered teeth, and face-to-face, some critics marked it as a racist Asian character - "yellowface."
And they asked whether these repeated controversial questions did not show up on the larger problems of society - the problem with diversity.
In the middle of it, Verge and Motherboard wrote and the news and the explosions spread rapidly, and Snapchat immediately indicated the next day that the function was cancelled.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was designed as an expression of the account I set anonymity, not as an Asian cartoon.
But to observers who were witnesses of racism, the filter reminded the sick stereotypes in action.
The rest of them refused without comparison with the animes.
Grace Sparapani, an American art student from Korea whose photo tweets were widely shared, stated in an e-mail that the filter was “at least harmful and embarrassing.”
He added that “it is difficult to argue against the comparison of obvious Asian characters and filter effects.
It is shown that the filter is not only about yellow face (yellowface) but that the yellow face is attached to the outer edge.
Snapchat is not the only company that has crossed these cultural boundaries.
The American culture seems to have an endless set of divergence and inclusions, from the blues in the companies after Hollywood and the devices that we all carry in our hands.
And the vast number of young people in Snapchat - who are more racially diverse than their older partners - can mean that they can expect even greater sensitivity.
"When one Snapchat filter creates a picture that is offensive to some user," said fifteen-year-old Katie Zhuov in the discussion, "it's very difficult to cover these things today without notice as it was before."
Katie Zhuova, a product manager and designer who works for the Media, decided on Thursday to destroy her account on Snapchat and called on the others to do the same.
In the Media article and in the telephone discussion, it was pointed out that racially motivated problems reflect a lack of diversity at the meetings of workers in Snapchat.
Katie Zhuova criticized heavy whites, entire male leadership company, and the article ended hash tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's just that there's no difference between employees and colourless people at the moment they decide on these things," Zhuov, who has a Chinese-American origin, said, "or color people work there, but not on positions to feel safe or pleasant to talk about."
Other observers share her opinion - the problem that Snapchat left in significant proportions without response.
The company shall not publish the figures relating to the divergences of its employees by having the status of the private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origin of his employees, but according to the language company, he recently accepted a collective worker who should focus on the insufficient representative population and on the internal management.
Zhuovo adds: “I am aware if other users who can say that this is not okay” by keeping their account broken.
Military officials drew up reporting information on IS, says the Parliamentary Committee
The Parliament's report, issued on Thursday, stated that the officials of the United States Central Authority changed the reports of the reporting services to express more optimistic images of the war against the Islamic state in Iraq and Syria than the events from the country.
According to the preliminary report of the Working Group of the President of the Committee on Armed Forces, the Committee on Reporting and the Subcommittee on Defence, "extended discrepancies" have been found between the analyses of the Central Reporting Service, which have changed their assessment of the American effort to defeat the Islamic state.
The Central Command, known as CentCom, is a military center in Tampere in Florida, which is responsible for American military operations in the Middle East and in Central Asia.
The press release states: “The outputs of reporting secret services approved by the Centcom authorities have usually offered a more positive picture of the US counter-terrorism forces than has been confirmed by the facts on the ground and have been consistently more positive than the analyses obtained from other parts of the reporting community.”
"What happened in Centcoma is unacceptable - our fighters are injured when an incorrect analysis is presented to policymakers," said Ken Calvert, a congressman and a Republican from California.
Traveling in the direction of the Centcoma takes place at the top of the organization.
The tenth report describes in detail the persistent problems of the Central State in the description and analysis of the American forces in the training of the Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although there is no conclusive evidence that the top representatives of Obama's administration have ordered the reports to be changed, it is stated in the report that the analysts had the idea that they were under pressure by the Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the danger posed by the Islamic State or the IS.
"In the first half of 2015, there were many press reports from the Central State, declarations and declarations from the Congress that were essentially more positive than what happened in fact," the report states.
For example, the representative of the Centcom publicly announced that a major military attack on the Mosul invasion could begin already in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic state.
"This is clear after months of investigation," said Ambassador Mike Pompeo, representative of the Republican Party of Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest number of reporting staff in the United States of America have been manipulated with reporting services out of the state with the aim of putting the IS at risk in Iraq.
The Republicans formed a working group after learning about the concerns of analysts about the manipulation of information on reporting services concerning the Islamic state.
After the report published in the fourth quarter, further examinations should be followed.
In the reporting services of the Center, further investigations are carried out by the General Inspector-General of the Ministry of Defence.
On Thursday, the Democratic Members of the Committee on Reporting Services confirmed their own findings, which correspond to some conclusions of the working group of Republicans.
"Centcom has created a very difficult process between 2014 and 2015 to compile information on IS and Iraqi security components," said the representative Adam B. Schiff, Chairman of the Committee and representatives of Democrats.
According to Adam Schiffa, this process "has led to the overcrowding of reporting services," he has damaged morale between analysts and "not enough to take into account non-conformity."
However, Schiff and Democrats claim that they have found no evidence that the White House would try to pressure the Center's analysts to make their conclusions according to the “proposition or political situation.”
The preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published on Tuesday in the Daily Beast.
Loni reported in August on the ongoing investigation of the general inspector General of the Pentagon, which was initiated after the difficulties of the Centcom's analysis.
Commander Commander Patrick Evans, speaker of the Pentagon, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence will not comment on the parliamentary report because the investigation of the general inspector is still continuing.
But he noted that "the experts never agree to the interpretation of complex data and that the reporting community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these fundamental issues of national security."
The investigation has an impact on the framework of the question whether the United States is successful in the bombing in Iraq and Syria (a product now known as the growing number of defence representatives).
However, lower charges have raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can rely on the central state to properly assess military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis sites.
The report's criticism of the Islamic state reflects the conflict for more than ten years, when the report's analysis of Centcoma Gregory Hooker wrote a research work that indicated that President George W. Bushe's administration - despite many analysts' intentions - rejected a small unit in Iraq and gave only a little time to think about what will follow the invasion in 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in protesting the Islamic State's reporting services.
Last year, the authorities announced that the Hooker team had concluded that despite the public statement of return, the air forces against the Islamic State’s refinery had not been able to provide a significant financial source of this terrorist group, because the group had developed temporary refinery and was selling it on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the finding was not transferred outside the central state.
The leader of the Centcom, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then criticised a year after many lawmakers had followed the testimony of the Senate to a very positive assessment of the war.
General Austin left in the dark, and in the Centcom he replaced her Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The United States won the world hockey in the fourth series, so today it's going to play the key game in the Great Britain team.
Katie Bamov, in the game against Japan, which ended with victory 6:1, shot three banks and only one day after the American team of women on the ground hockey shot the first two gambling banks in which the United States defeated India 3:0 on Thursday.
Five blocks in two tapes are a lot of memory success, but Bamo (27) said it's not sure if something like that ever happened to her.
"I have no idea," she said.
I don't belong to those who write their own branches.
But he knows this: Americans on the Olympic tournament lead to the Games 4:0 and he is the first place in the group with Great Britain, which remained on Thursday after Japan 2:0 hit.
Great Britain and the United States will be held on Saturday at the last stop of the first car.
Both teams qualified to the square and the game will decide who of the six teams will end up on the first and the second.
The first will avoid the powerful Danes who are on the heads of the second group.
Whatever the Saturday event ends, the Americans here have been calling for their surprise rides, four years after the end of the 12 teams on the London games.
There was Bam in that team, too.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took the hockey to the ground hockey first when she was 3 years old (her oldest sister played double in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player at the time.
The Olympics left her alone in 2008 because she didn't get to the finals.
Then came the year 2012 when neither her nor her members of her team did so.
The next year he was a coach named English Craig Parnham and things began to change.
"Culture changes, mental changes, physical changes," said Bamov.
In London, we didn't have the same speed as we have today.
We've done a complete job.
On Thursday night, Bamova started in the first half of the factory shooting near.
India joined the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself to be surprisingly firm and kept score 1:0 until the end of the third quarter, when Bamov took advantage of the opportunity.
The only one on the left side of the playing field, then she called in the middle and shot the ball in the bank to get the Americans to the direction 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last branch in half a quarter.
The U.S. banker's organization, Jackie Briggs, who helped one branch in each of the three victories, was the first on tour.
He's in excellent shape.
Just like Bam.
"Now we're in a good place," said Parnham, but as good as it is, it will depend on the outcome of the Saturday party.
Green trampoline in the middle of the Olympic Spring
It's one where you are, it's one, it's one, it's one, it's one, it's an Olympic.
From the experience in Rio de Janeiro, it is a feeling of enduring, unwritten and busy competition and effort.
It's like the Olympics itself would be a yellow steffet wheel that is transferred from a sailor, a gymnasium and a triathlonist.
You can't stop television, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation at the front of the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Billes, Katie Ledecky or the murder between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then it's Logan Dooley too.
Dooley, an exhilarating love of women with gloves in her face, is first on the Olympics and could also be among those whose name appears in houses in the main broadcast time between advertising and sponsors, if he was a blue, yellow, or even a shirt.
But Dooley (28) from Lake Forest in California is fighting Olympic gold in horses on trampoline.
The Olympic Fire doesn't light all the competitions at all.
From the middle, there are sports in the stage that are not generally known: air gun shots, lukostral, badminton, taekwondo.
We'll always have success in classic blue-style, and it'll probably rule for a long time.
But if I can name my extraordinary favorite, let me warn you about the sudden drop of trampoline.
Although the jumps to the Olympics since 2000, when they were first introduced to games in Sydney, after 16 years of intervention, this sport is almost without attention - many of the people I asked or didn't know it was Olympic sport.
It could be regional hostility.
The United States never got medals on the trampoline race, and by 2012 none of the athletes got to the finish.
Prices in the male category are usually divided between China and Russia and in the female category between China and Canada.
This year the gold medals from London will show Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
Steps on the trampoline, but there's still another problem, partly because the unsanitary ear will seem to be more likely to be at the clone university than at the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert, but just a superhero from the country.
It has a comical potential - a comical vibration of endless reflection - but also the ease of gymnasiums and tapping, two sports that combine itself.
The word "trampoline" is derived from the Spanish "el trampoline", meaning "scokan table".
Aspirins jump on a large trampoline, which is exposed to a height of about 10 meters and precipitates several pieces (salt, heat and combinations) before they finally reach their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed according to performance, difficulty and "airtimes".
In Rio it will compete with twelve athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The usual Olympic road trajectory is ahead.
Soldiers of gold medals must go on, faster and even higher, sometimes to the end, then and again, up and down.
He is trying to reach not only the target sand or the start wall but also the television news, as well as another thought line: the world or the Olympic record.
This one-sided effort is noble, wonderful, a little fanatical - and enough to bring the monsters to tears.
But I think it's kind of boring somewhere when you're watching the Olympics.
Steps on the trampoline in this regard bring relief.
The route of the athlete to the trampoline is upward.
I don't think it's a move ahead.
He or she looks like they're in a state of noxious as an astronaut, flying up, then down, and then again without a lift up.
Without competition and, of course, even difficulties will not go away, but after a long period of time, there will be no cruel struggle to achieve the goal, no distance measurement, but only perfect, easy time and gravity.
This is just the closest time the Olympics and the Sun are approaching.
Qualifications and final women run on Friday afternoon, at 13 o'clock of the east time, then male competition on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC station will finally be sent within the afternoon block starting after two days at 14 hours.
In the middle of the Olympics, they promise calm, pleasant moments that you will probably see through other files.
And if you have to be careful only that the athletes will be the subject of favorite views and entertainment - as the Wall Street Journal recently proposed the fun American – then Logan Dooley is just waiting for their new fans who are crying for breath.
"Protesting generation" in Ethiopia, long-term USA
Violent protests in Ethiopia
The demonstrators of the political changes required in Ethiopia were subjected to violent opposition from the government.
The Witnesses claim that a lot of protesters were shot during police attacks.
Is there a war in Ethiopia?
In recent decades it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a strong Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
During the last months, however, the earth has been plagued by anti-government disturbances that continue to spread to more and more areas.
Only in the last week have thousands of people gone to the streets who require fundamental political changes.
According to the organization of human rights strugglers, government reactions were cruel.
The witnesses claim that the police have shot and killed unarmed protesters.
In colloquial video games from protests that are probably from the end of the past year or from the beginning of this year, security officials are arrested, such as young naked people after what they were forced to stand on the wall.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now requesting a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and to take the step forward will be even harder," Rashid Abdi, leading the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group, announced.
Ethiopia is the second most beautiful nation in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is supported by the West.
American military and intelligence agencies are working with Ethiopia to remove the threat of a terrorist attack in the area, especially in Somalia, and a small number of African countries, if any, are receiving such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has developed a gradual storm.
Its infrastructure has improved in a major way - in the main city of Addis Ababa even a new local train.
And the streets of cities are typically quiet, safe and clean.
To this end, Ethiopia may find it difficult to mark the example of democracy - organisations fighting for human rights without speaking about government repression - opposition in the country has been shaken, dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many of them were imprisoned, imprisoned, killed or fled to the desert.
But that can change.
"When people breathe and they don't have a chance to protest, they're going to break up," said Seyoum Teshome, who holds a university in central Ethiopia.
He's protesting all the young people.
He's protesting the entire generation.
The problem is a lot and it affects everything from disputes about land after absolute control of the power of the ruling coalition.
Following the London elections that were widely criticised, the ruling party and its allies received the last round of opposition and now controls 100 per cent in parliament.
Also increasing pressure on the border with Eritreu. The conflict in the face of this unexplained, controversial border demanded hundreds of lives in June.
The Anilitics fear that the separatist groups that have been involved during the past few years, such as the Russian Liberation Front or the Ugandan National Liberation Front, may try to exploit and rearm.
There are several factors that explain why, after years of study under the surface, these hot feelings have resurfaced.
The first one seems harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate through social networks until a few years ago when they have become more easily accessible phone calls and have improved the provision of Internet services.
And even if the government restricts access to Facebook or Twitter, as is often the case during protests, many people can still communicate through Internet proxys that hide the status of these people.
Several young Ethiopians spoke about how they met in protest.
There is still greater solidarity between Oromy and Amhary, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Russians and the Amhars are not natural allies.
After many years of Amhar, mainly from the Christian heights of Ethiopia, came into politics and trade and used the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But it's also changing.
"We are on our way to a unified leadership," said Mulat Gemechu, the leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests came in the areas of Amhar and Oromy.
Many Amhars and Oromas believe that Ethiopia is wrongly dominated by members of the Tigris ethnic group, who make up around 6 per cent of the population and dominate the army, reporting services, trade and politics.
A third reason for anxiety is the death of Melese Zenaw.
Genavi, the former leader of the rebels, was the Ethiopian president of the government for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he suffered an unexpected defeat.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who was able to see a hero.
Analysts say that, in particular, he was able to remove the initial signs of discomfort and use the messengers to process and get on his side.
"The current regime deals with basic knowledge," said Abdi, an analysis of the conflict.
The new President of the Government of Ethiopia, Hailemaria Desalegn, was expelled from the relative ignorance with a view to reimbursing Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigris region of northern Ethiopia, Haelimaria comes from the south.
Analysts claim that there is no confidence in the security service of the Tigris.
Many fear that the result will result in further bleeding.
Finally, Ethiopia experienced such turmoil in 2005 after thousands of people protested against what the analysts described as the elections that the government took and then stole.
He followed a strong pattern during which many protestors were killed - even though less than in recent months - and this period of trouble has passed relatively quickly.
Experts on development assessed Ethiopia's leaders for vision planning infrastructure, which is a new urban train and moderate progress in combating poverty.
It is quite obvious, however, that the gradual increase in disputes within the Ethiopian government has not ceased.
And it comes to dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month protestors in the city of Gondar attacked their business companies owned by Tigris and the fight against Tigers on social networks continued to be more common.
Analysts say that protests lead to an unacceptable situation in the United States and other Western alliances.
The U.S. government uses Ethiopia as a basis for the transfer of drones over neighboring Somalia, although it has recently declared that the foundation was closed.
While the West wants to support democracy in a single way, at the same time, he does not want its connections to be broken down in such an unprecedented area.
"That," said Abdi, "is very sharp food.
Donald Trump explains his report on Obama and the financing of IS as "sarkasmus"
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to recapitulate the latest controversy, which engulfs his campaign, by saying that he did not seriously think of it when several times this week he insisted that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were "founders" of the Islamic state's terrorist groups.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the Republican candidate to speak clearly to the American public.
It also puts him in a bad situation, and he has to explain that he may not have thought seriously about his remarks.
Following this proposal at a meeting in the middle of the night, Trump confirmed the product on Thursday and held talks that it was not really meant to say that President and H. Clinton created it.
However, in his Twitter contribution on Friday morning, Trump declared that he was just a sarkastic.
The contribution was in response to an old one day's claim, when Trump said in a few conversations that his accusations were serious.
When Conservative Speaker Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump's note to calm down by recalling that Obama was forced to destroy IS, the Republican candidate did not respond to the president.
The latest storm comes at a time when Trump tried to focus his campaign on the economy, while his preference in the pre-trial studies is impaired.
Trump and Clinton took part this week in Michigan, due to economic issues.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to this subject.
On Twitter he again warned that Clinton's proposals were linked to an increase in taxes and indicated that her speech was useless, according to one source.
The trumpet has already been used to protect the sarc something.
At the end of July, when he cleared up the criticism when he suggested that the Russians should pass on to Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his note: “I am, of course, a sarkastic.”
This approach enables Trump to push the limits of political declarations and to measure them as necessary.
"I think it's his method of testing, to what extent some messages respond to his recipients to find out how they respond, and according to the reaction one or the other, "he gave an explanation," said Ruth Sherman, a communication specialist who followed the language used by both candidates.
But I also think that in my statements it's negative and he knows that they're important enough to explain it differently.
Because the results of the preliminary investigations in its progress continue to be debated, Trump has allowed in recent days even more competitive tone, instead of measuring things for the general volleyball.
A new study of NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, which was published on Friday, showed that Tump is with great distance from Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very close to Florida.
The trumpet is actually trying to avoid apologizing for the provocations that it says, but often its criticisms are due to a lack of interpretation of its words or a misunderstanding of its sense of humor.
But together with the fact that the Trump in the final months of the presidential campaign is headed by increased attention, Trump's tip points to the unacceptable situation of his rank, which must be publicly behind him, even if his remarks are already provocative.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, who is one of the most prominent Trumps, had to challenge the candidate on Thursday in the CNN speech.
"I think what he says is the right political comment," Giulian said when he was asked about the probability of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic state.
That's the truth in the sense that before Obama, the IS was almost unknown, a small organization that was mistakenly called a novel, and it came to be because his army from Iraq stopped.
Most of the ordinary Republicans are trying to argue that Obama's government, in which Clinton as a minister of foreign affairs, allowed the IS to grow and fail to manage the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Before the five - day assembly in Pennsylvania, Trump and on Twitter continued to fire at the media because they had changed every word and were busy with him.
He spoke to the “poor, pathetic ” television students who try to understand her, and said, “It’s impossible! ”
A number of Democrats have apologized to Trump that it is only another evidence that the presidency is not capable of doing so.
Cavaran has been pulled out of the price market. Now returning to Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe coffee was destroyed in Williamsburg, where you could only pay for it ready, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee has been served for 15 years.
It was inspired that she was pulled from the front of the house to Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - trade that Verb won in 2014 - sells furniture in the form of dormitories.
The locals were burning like the last loss of the growing city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe that CBGB is dead, the hotel Chelsea is destroyed and from Verb is now a retail business."
But if New York changes, then it's also reopening.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened the hall in November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original.
The new Verb has wifi and accepts payment cards, but some of the original employees work there and have a similar, humble atmosphere.
Coffee's still good, too.
The manager of the new Verbu is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the original coffee shop, who is also the owner and executive director of the new place.
In Verb began in 2001 and stayed until the end.
When one of his clients offered to pay for the move to a new location, he said he would do it with joy.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same bakery supplier and bought the same machine model on espresso.
He even used the light from the old verb.
Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new too.
He started to use new vows.
The offer includes sandwiches with honey, eggs and cheese and topings, such as camaras and reduced cybulls.
You'll find a mix of hot rice here as well.
Coffee doesn't give you beer anymore, but it offers you pure fruit juice.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady flow of original stamps.
"The number of original customers from Williamsburg also had to rise because of the prices," he said.
Last week there was one of those clients, Rebecca Oliveir.
Mrs. Oliveir (34) lived in Williamsburg and often went to Verb Cafe.
She came even when the coffee was moving to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb stopped, she stopped drinking coffee for some time.
"I have found that what I like is coffee and culture in Verba," she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, but on that day she gave her usual ice coffee instead of a soft tea, another newspaper.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-term customer, has been traveling to Verbu since 2003.
He goes before work and orders himself the same.
"On Thursday and eight o'clock every day, like hours, I'll come and prepare my house for me with everything and with butter," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add to the offer of a new oath.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what's usual, but sometimes he lets himself be put on his own house with a slant, an ox and a dog.
Rodriguez said he's not sorry that the drug trade took his old place.
It's true that Soap Cherie's owners offered him a special furniture for Verb and as a pledge they use filtered coffee from the coffee shop.
"I think we could still use it," said Rodriguez.
The traditional Polish people of Greenpoint also accepted the coffee.
One of the new customers was transferred to the police station and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place where he would soon show up to make his new neighbors feel like home.
The new place has other benefits.
The local producer of fruit juices wants to get into coffee and sell a filtered coffee.
It offers an opportunity to expand the coffee shop into a nearby building.
Many customers are satisfied that they have recovered their old favorite.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the coffee stopped, he broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the coffee is opened again, it's like coming home and getting some coffee.
"I've missed this dream," he said.
Depressive food from times of crisis - in "Square Meal"
Shortly after his arrival at the president’s office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in Oväläläwäwäwäw and ate.
Laguna President Roosevelt welcomed the 5th Avenue selected food items, such as a pasta from the woods of the Jatery and a mariland yellow soup.
His menu on this day, however, was more modest: the bee for the devil’s way in the desert, the brown pepper and as a desert of light powder.
"It was the law of kitchen solidarity with people who were suffering," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to the Americans as to how to eat."
A couple who live in Brooklyn Heights are bound by gastronomic history.
The last book of Andrew Coey "Chop Suey" was about a Chinese kitchen in America, while Jane in her book "97 Orchard" tells the life story of a living house on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new "A Square Meal" joint work, which is on the afternoon of the Harper public conference, is the events of the American kitchen during the major economic crisis.
They showed their own kitchen solidarity and met with the reporter at evening in Eisenberg's trade with sandwiches, a small electric buffet in the fourth Flatiron, which has been operating since the crisis since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered mastic cheese and sandwich with dried olives, Andrew (57) gave it to the croc, brown cheese, and soft vegetables.
The reporter ordered a mass carbage, which, according to the couple, was very good at talking about food during the crisis.
"Carbanats were very popular," said Ms. Ziegelman.
He's been selling buric, iron and fascose carbánate.
It was made from that direct and other cheap food that the ingredients continued.
Stop the number of beers you're supposed to eat at dinner.
Andrew Coe got stuck.
"They would lie in your stomach like a wolf," he said.
In the years before the crisis, the American kitchen, especially in foreign areas, was given a form of buffet snow you eat.
The women's teams burned for farm workers, and for breakfast, lunch and dinner they offered a freshly baked cake.
They were Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "And Square Meal" follows the way the nation was compared to the fact that it was not a country of refuge at once.
"It was the time when the food became an average, scared ground for American people," Coe said in an explanation why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Similarly, a new diet was feared: a new budget diet, such as carbanades and casserole foods, casseroles as “a wonderful way to use the rest,” noted Ziegelman, because the cooks could hide non-aesthetics under the type of cream.
The pure fruit was replaced by the lightest dried fruit.
The mass - after many years the average American food item - became a persistent luxury.
Similar mixtures, which were to serve as caloric and life-threatening supplements, were precipitated or even healthy in burning.
During the study of the book containing recipes, Ms. Ziegelmana prepared a meal of hot chocolate filled with beer butter.
"It wasn't a favorite increase on the dinner table," Andrew Coe said.
Jane Ziegelman stressed: "It was surreal."
Bourne butter with a hot chocolate doesn't come together.
It was typical for a lot of domestic recipes.
As never before and ever since, domestic economies - including Louise Stanley, the head of the federal government for the home economy in the years 1923 - 1943 - have led the country’s welfare practices.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, called for women to take over the difficult budget, and candles, such as meditated spaghetti, changed to delicious foods.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historic festivals.
First of all, the tests have been carried out in response to the government's hungry citizens, as President Herbert Hoover should have said, "I'm going to have a drink."
While he publicly praised the simple little farm kitchen of his childhood, he served as a chosen millionaire who became.
"He likes to eat continental cuisines like fish with a chicken cucumber," Andrew Coe said.
He's been eating in an almost outlying room, he's wearing a suit.
He was unbelievable old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably make the same mistake if his wife Eleanor did not agree to go for example with her own complaint.
As the book reports, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a family who was not interested at all in hunger, and this led to the fact that the White House “did not only offer almost the best food in all Washington, but also in the most unhappy way prepared."
A series of food habits from the time of the crisis have been resolved as soon as the country has settled on its feet again.
The reference remains in our ongoing calorie study and survival values, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way science applies to smoking.
Some say that during the book writing they better understood the fun habits of Miss Ziegelman's mother - perhaps why she couldn't eat.
"She had real fear of food poisoning," Andrew Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled: “People were wrong. ”
There's been an accident with the prisoners.
When there were clean chairs in Eisenberg, she and Mr. Coe had a dessert prepared at home: a Christmas dessert that President Roosevelt ate for dinner.
"It's called a light cream," Ziegelman said and added that the usual trick was to give modest recipes of elegant names.
There was no cream there, just candles, some milk, sugar, water and sugar.
Every one of them accidentally put a lie in a bad stomach.
Surprised it was wrong.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
And as the right manager said to his wife, "It would be a little bit of dried fish."
Europeans: Migrants go for doses.
Most of the refugees who move to Europe come for economic reasons.
The young Russians are making fun of themselves.
That's how serials would look if we were to beat them up.
A group of Russian artists, called 2D Among Us, is making fun of their country of origin.
The photoshop creates colleges that funnyly show how it would look if the famous series and films were filmed in Russia.
Gilead has an advantage over the cost of legal representation in the case of patent against type C fraud against the Merck Group
The Court of Justice decided that Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to make payments for lawyers who have made it in the process of patenting against type C fraud against the manufacturer of Merck & Co Inc.
In June, the judgment was lifted, according to which Gilead had to pay 200 million for damages due to the failure of two Merck's patents in relation to very successful treatments of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the federal court found again illegal conduct on the part of Merck, except under oath and other non-ethical practices.
The Federal Court of Justice Beth Labson Freeman wrote on Thursday that Gilead is entitled to a minimum of payments that have been incurred in connection with the representation in the case.
Merck is trying to remove Gilead, which dominates the new generation’s drug market against type C gluutence, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case came in 2013 when Gilead and Merck complained to each other and claimed that they were the owner of the basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, an active substance of the medicinal products from Gilead.
US supported military units claim to have gained full control over the city of Manbij
The US-supported military units gained full control over the northern city of Manbijg shortly after the last Islamic state soldiers arrived in the city, the language group was introduced in the fifth.
The Syrian Democratic Force (SDF) is now crossing the city after the rest of the group of radicals that have been hiding in the city.
The units released over 2,000 civilians who held radical arrests, said Reuters Sharfan Darwish with the SDF alliance and the Manbijje Military Council.
"The city is now under our control, but we're still looking for it," said the Reuters agency.
Clinton paid $10.75 million in 2015 and paid the federal tax fee 34.2 per cent
Hillary Clinton confirmed its tax recognition for 2015 on Friday, stating that the presidential candidate for democracy and her husband had an income of $10.75 million over the year and paid a real tax of 34.2 per cent.
Clinton was awarded $1 million in 2015 for the charter, mainly to the Clinton Foundation. President Bill Clinton contributed to the joint cash of almost $5.3 million for the presentation, and the former foreign minister accepted an admission of $3 million from Simon & Schuster's charge for his book on his foreign ministry.
Clinton's community, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, together with his wife, Anne Holton, has approved a tax admission in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a real tax of 20.3 per cent.
"Hilary Clinton and Tim Kaine are still a model of financial transparency," said Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton with the campaign.
On the contrary, Donald Trump is hiding for false statements and withdraws from his previous promises that his tax recognition is public.
It is customary that candidates to the President of the United States shall make their tax admissions public, even if they are not subject to the law.
Trump, a businessman from New York, and his lawyers quoted the audit of the U.S. Tax Committee as a reason for his refusal to grant tax recognition.
"Your move," said part-time champion Hillary Clinton on Twitter and pointed to the tax recognition of democratic candidates.
Michael Cohen, Special Adviser to the Trumps, said on Thursday CNN that it would not allow the Trump's tax admission to be confirmed until audits were completed.
According to Trumpo's criticisms, among which the Republican candidate for President of the year 2012 Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican parties agree that his refusal raises questions regarding his net profit, contributions to the Charter, trade and other relations, including relations with Russia.
Clinton is strongly involved in the issue and has published a video on Friday, which reminds him of the high position of the Republic of Trupa in order to confirm his tax admission.
The fourth question will be mentioned in its report on economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all the other candidates at the presidency have done after the decade - to confirm their tax recognition," people said before.
The Policy Organisation stated that Trump paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times quoted a number of tax advisers and accountants who claim that this could be done in the meantime.
The federal tax rates have become the subject of presidential elections.
Clinton passes a rule named after the billionaire Warren Bufett, which would ensure that all those who make up more than $1 million a year pay tax at a minimum of 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, Buffet attended the Clinton Assembly in Omaze, Nebraska, where Buffet Conglomerate Berkshire Hataway was invited to meet and exchange tax recognitions.
Buffett said he also went through the IRS audit, and that Trump "is afraid" of the financial authority, but the voters.
Clinton's campaign confirmed the tax recognition until 2007.
Clinton, who now lives in Chappaqua in New York, paid federal tax on average 32 per cent and a combined tax on about 40.5 per cent between 2007 and 2014.
From the 2015 Clinton tax admission, it appears that, unlike most Americans, it is only about $100 in their revenues.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which Clinton received dividends and interest rates of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chilli or a firebulb for the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Nature defenders in Tanzania use a non-orthodox method to prevent elephants from being preyed on by human beings - a cave on them condoms filled with chilli powder.
This process was witnessed and awarded by Honeyguide, who, with the idea that a few years ago, together with the American Eco-Protocol Organization The Nature Conservancy, promotes this process and teaches volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania, as a means of protecting their homes and their flocks in four steps without harming animals.
Many of them used to use copies on their defenses.
The fifth is the world's day of elephants, which is dedicated to protecting these animals.
"Since the time this ... tool file has been developed, we have recorded changes in behavior in these communities. People believe much more that it is possible to keep elephants out of their fields without harming them," said the Executive Director of the Honeyguide Damian Bell in a statement.
The first and the second step is on the passing elephant to greet the battery and drop the button.
If she doesn't do this, she'll be exposed to a so-called chilli cloud.
The chilli smiles together with the petardo in the condom, his end is so he's confident that he's just hanging out with it.
After the fire, the condensation will be released and the air will be dissipated from the chilli.
Most of the time, there's one trap and the elephant is coming out of the other direction.
The last option is to fire a fire engine that produces a loud, clear explosion.
The Jewish director turned to the Berlin hotel because he removed the "request" code for Israel - RT News
The French film director of Jewish origin called for a divorce in the media after he found that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have a code for calling to Israel, according to the employee's word on the basis of the "demand" of Arabic customers.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the documentary "Shoah" holocaust, ventilated his frustration from the Campinski Bristol hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of codes for hotel calls.
The state has not yet been identified between countries where it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, Germany’s main city, Israel was removed and destroyed?
Napsal Lanzmann.
The Kempinski Bristol Hotel instead offers an opportunity to call to Israel via its own call centre.
The director was looking for an explanation and had a problem with the hotel reception.
The answer he received, Lanzmanna, according to his word, was "screaming."
The hotel worker replied that the measure was "resolved after considering the management of the Kempinski Hotels."
The reason for this step of the director was even more widespread.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they asked you to remove Israel's call code," the Lanzmann employee quoted in his letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman noted the case as a "great defeat".
We were scared and shocked by the events.
It's just a huge shame about yourself.
The fact that something like this has happened in Germany and more in such a hotel chain is even bigger.
There's no need for another explanation.
We expect the hotel to produce the right conclusions," he said.
The event caused a strong online reaction, people marked it as scandalous.
Some believe that the hotel Kempinski simply "lost" in demanding Arab customers.
“Hanba to you,” says another contribution, indicating that the hotel located in the noble street of Kurfurstendam is located near the synagogue.
According to the newspaper Spiegel, the hotel itself quickly dismissed any charges of having a "visit" and Lanzman's "confessed".
"There has never been a direct order" without including Israel in the list of codes for the call, says Suddeutsche Zeitung, representative of the hotel Kempinski.
It adds that the call code was added to the list.
The police used heavy gas and rubber projections against protesting Brazilian students
The students and the police arrived in Brazil on Thursday when the students met for demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
The anti-prosperity police used heavy gas and rubber projections.
The problem was won when the government's order services tried to separate the students, which ended by the police using rubber projections and heavy rain.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration with the aim of expressing their concerns from plans.
Among the government's proposals of San Paulo Geralda Alckmina to save money is also the closure of almost a hundred public schools and 300 000 students.
Some of the participants in the demonstration were able to see how they accepted letters from the wall against the temporary president Michel Temer.
The latest protest will only come a few days after the demonstrators appeared together in the street in support of the President-in-Office of Dilmy Rousseff when the Senate decided to complain.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian census in Iran, Lebanon Dzhagaryana grew up following the abolition of the tax between Moscow and Tehran in the mid-year ratio of 70.9%.
As the rapporteur pointed out, ever since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, interest has increased by Russian companies operating in the country.
Russian companies renew existing ties with Iran while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Further expansion of trade is certainly one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagarian said.
It pointed out that during the first five months of 2016 trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent in comparison with the same period in 2015 and reached an excess of $856 million.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent and reached over $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent to $158 million.
The scale increase in trade has ensured the supply of equipment, land vehicles and weapons," said the spokesman.
Dhagaryan also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
In recent years, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran has issued approximately 35,000 visas, mostly travel.
Iran first reached between top 20 countries according to the number of tourists who come to Russia.
It is safe to say that the record numbers of tourists from Iran in Russia will be exceeded since last year," he said.
At the same time, Iran is visiting a relatively small number of Russians.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the memories of long-standing Persian civilization are in good condition," he said.
Scott Callum Skinner runs home after the British got gold in the cycle
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered the glory line last night at a male team station in Rio when the three VB teams held a title from London in 2012.
The 13-year-old parent from Glasgow was in the role of the storm that he took for his Scott Sir Chris Hoy, and the young legend was pleased when he joined the target and stole victory from the favored New Zealand.
The British won a surprise four years ago, and Hoy won five of his six Olympic gold medals.
And the same trick was repeated after the end of the humble sixth world champion in the road cycle in March, even though Hoy finished his career.
The problem between Peking and London was the reward for the specialized internship of Jamie Stuff.
So the Hindus appeared right on time.
After Hoye left, there was also the place that tried to fill out Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was a man of British coaches and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindus - who was with Hoyy's champion four years ago - and Skinner got an Olympic record at the qualification, but the trick took the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio got in the team ring gold.
Hindes was behind his bike, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner held the lead.
The change of the strategy was a big part of the transformation when Hindus went to higher translation to slow down and enable Kenny and Skinner in part to maintain the pace.
Hoy was watching from his position as a BBC commentator, and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindus appeared on the podium, he didn't let their eyes down.
Three-year-old Skinner, father of Glasgow, said: "It's a cheap comparison."
I'm here to get the best out of me and honor my name.
We've created an Olympic record in the finals, and we've missed you the best.
It was just unbelievable.
There's no better way to win.
After the triumph near Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012 Hindus admitted that he had fallen on the road voluntarily after a weak start.
The signal came back later, and the British opponents had no chance to withdraw.
This time there was no such problem around this victory.
He said: “With all those British trains on the courts, I felt like London."
In the last three months, we've all been together as a team.
We've won many world races, so winning the Olympic again is just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for the nation that won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then we've been waiting for five days.
With the form Kenny suggested, it is not impossible to restore Hoy's success and win one Olympic three gold medals at the same time.
This would then be for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, also has a birth date on March 23 (this date seems to be sacred for British sport, this day also celebrates the birth of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - meant a total of six gold medals and one silver medal.
Just as much as Hoy got.
The next time Kenny participates, she starts today and spends the next three days.
An eight - year - old relative from Bolton said: “I don’t enjoy it here.
Team race is always the best.
You win with the others.
To tell the truth, playing for yourself is a little lonely.
He said: "If he wins two gold medals, he should have a knight's title."
It was the only medallion race that day, but the British were waiting for another good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Dowell qualified as the fastest in the four-mile racing race.
It ended with 3:51.943.
World record, which fell in London in 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and the finals (22:42) take place today's second day of the race on which Wiggins will be targeted.
Yesterday, prior to the qualifying race, he discussed with the Commissioner when her decision-makers called for a high-level measurement.
In a similar race of women who continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trottov, Joanna Rowsell Shandov, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgavie arrived at the world record at 4:13.260.
The VB team relied on its strong team of driving cycles and ruled the middle of the Olympic Games and gained a lot of medals.
After really extraordinary performances, showing the free movement in Beijing and London, the preparations for Rio were reduced during the preparation.
There were dramatic events in the background, in the latest series of interviews of technical director Shane Sutton in depth due to the charges of sex and discrimination, and the end of the career of grandparents, such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as indicated by the first night of the race on the planet, the legendary reputation of the Great Britain team seems to be able to perform a spectacular performance with perfect timing so that it can be confirmed again.
Unsecured future of portland furniture after the end of the energy supply contract
The future of the Portland railway station in Victoria - and the workplace of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of electricity provided by the company and who informed one of the owners of the electricity supply contract to end it is expected that all supply contracts will be cut off.
This step is followed by what the Government of Victoria decided earlier this year that it would not delay the supply of supplies that the company holds in place.
The amount of a fixed 20-year grant shall be increased in November.
Alcoa Portland may be at risk of up to 2000 jobs.
In closing up, up to 2000 jobs can be threatened - directly or indirectly.
And because the tobacco consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, it can lead to other side effects.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the bridge Point Henry, which led to the shut-down of England.
The Alcoa company's tavirina in Portland is spreading and threatens to close it.
This step follows several years of speculation about the future of the company, initially in response to a strong Australian dollar and in recent times because of the prices for the production of the race.
AGL, which delivers electricity from the Loy Yang A power plant at Latrobe Valley Valley, announced that it is expected that some of the other three owners will also decide to terminate the contract.
Most of the company's owners are Alcoa and Alumina, small business shares are owned by the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubine Corp.
"AGL expects that the Portuguese race will continue to function, in other words, so that the demand for electricity will continue," she said.
AGL indicated that the contracts were so-called ‘insurance contracts’ that they should enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have 12 months' notice period, so their validity will indeed end in 2017.
"AGL continues to assume that the contracts will be divided into profits for the fiscal year 2017," the electrician declared.
Any possible impact on AGL’s profits since the fiscal year 2018 is still limited due to the strong view of the comedian market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL indicated that she had already signed the contract value according to her accounts of $187 million "in case it would have reached its end."
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the contract "has no impact on its ... ability to carry out a tavern or to secure the supply of electricity to the tavern."
The U.S. company stated that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which had to start paying since November of this year, although it still had to explain why the contract came into effect.
The analysts are very careful when it comes to the possible closure of the Portuguese tavern in Victoria and the Tomago race near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the sector.
During the course of AGL Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts this week, said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity a year and about 900 megawatts a year.
If both of these undertakings were to be marketed, this would mean a substantial reduction in market demand [electric energy].
It wouldn't be good for us as a producer," he said.
Kendall is not only a star real TV show Cardassian - now is the cover of the Sacrament Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), the model and fourth daughter of the mother-manager of the Klan Kris Kardashian-Jenner, appeared on the title page of the American edition of Vogue magazine.
Kendall, Ambassador of the Estee Lauder's brand, who presented the fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday at his Instagram account.
"In the rooms full of people I love, I want to cry on this title page," Kendall wrote.
The discovery of the title page was unique (or simply a continuation of humor in the administration of Kardashian?) produced a film in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (brought out to Rob and Caitly and together with them all the favorite girls from the showhouse, producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest). On the cover of their sisters they forgot that the scene could end with a classic performance: they prepare a secret party.
It's an action line of almost every "born" part of the child television show (Seacrest says: "You thought we forgot about You?" with the honesty of the King-in-law in the order at eight o'clock in the morning), but Chris somehow needed to make sure the other girls could survive on this publication.
Because when we look at the serial number of Vogue magazine, we've definitely entered the new era of Cardassian.
The older sister Kim might have hit Kendall on Vogue’s shoulder (she was on her side with her husband Kanye Weste in April 2014), but the title of the magazine’s release was different.
The latest issue of Vogue magazine is the most produced year-on-year.
The publication, which reminds its burden of a book for advertising purposes more than the fashion magazine, attracts a number of inserators (Fashinist calculated that 615 pages in the lower edition were from 832 pages with advertising content).
The discovery of the star appearing on the title page is unexpected, so it is not surprising that in the past two years, the magazine has disappeared before its official publication.
Among the women who appeared in the past were Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelist or Kate Moss.
In recent years, the title page has certainly revealed more "cellulars making models" than "models that are celebrates."
Jennifer Lawrence, keeper of Oscar and Ambassador of Dior's brand, appeared on the title in 2013, and a year later, Lagy Gaga was here.
But although it is very unlikely that Kendall - whose store describes her generation as a "proportional model" - will fall into the first category, will be in very good company.
These celebrities are not friendly people, neither stars of real show, nor children today who know how to make a well-founded video (even if Jenner represents all of this).
They're definitely talented women who come out of the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, which appeared on the title page of Loni, had one of the strongest years in her career thanks to the release of Lemonade Alba.
Of course not everyone's success is overemphasized.
Her position in the world of fashion will always be difficult because of her participation in the reality of the show.
Stephanie Seymor's original model Victoria's Secret in June criticized Jenner and her colleague, Giga Hadid, and she called her "girls of the moment".
These feelings were rebuffed by the report that Jenner appeared on Vogue's cover.
But this discomfort isn't on the spot.
Kendall Jenner's on the cover of the Sieve Vogue.
It's a supermodel in the right sense.
He's in charge of Mark Jacobs.
He's selling you make up from Easte Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves on their own pajamas.
He's selling photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter who took photos for the LOVE store.
And in free moments it works in reality show, perhaps just as one of the ways to see Kurtney and her children.
Community Centre for Legal Assistance Annually disbanded 160 000 people
More than 160,000 of the most threatened citizens are refused legal aid every year in the Community centres and will be affected by the sector itself, which will have further financial constraints on the provision of services already under way.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly people of advanced age, immigrants, threats of workers, victims of violence and people without financial means to fight injustice and similarly - are rejecting at a time when they are looking for free legal aid and representation.
Community legal services, which are already so engaged in prostitution, are subject to further penalties.
Since June next year, this legal aid centre will come up with another 30 per cent federal funding.
The director of the Community Legal Aid Centre in Queensland, James Farrell, said that according to the most recent summary report of the National Community Legal Assistance Centres, it was found that five thousand people were rejected every year.
Mr Farrell said that without the federal government's decision, the situation would be worse.
"The Community legal aid centre in Queensland is chronically funded, which means that thousands of people are denied the vital services they need," he said.
People who have avoided relationships with violence, people with excessive and protective debt, families who have passed decisions, workers who are unjustly released - all these people have problems with legal dimensions and this report shows that they do not have the opportunity to get the help they need.
The federal government has reduced funding by 30 per cent since June 2017, leading to the fact that thousands of other people at risk from Queensland will have to focus on complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the State Representative and Senator Queensland George Brandise to prevent this cut in funding immediately so that people can get the help they need when they get into legal problems.
In recent years, the government has been committed to ensuring the financing of legal aid to the highest national level.
Now is the time to look at the needs of Community legal aid centres and the community of their clients and the Palestinian Government must invest in this important work.
Appeal for the Donalda Trump campaign after a member of the state deliberately intended the weapon
New York: The Donalda Trumpa campaign was filed for alleged inaction after they were informed that the Operation Director in North Carolina had targeted a gun at a member of the state during the course of the raid.
The incident was recorded in a file in court, which, in the middle of the court in Charlotte, handed over to Vincent Bordoni, a former software student of the state campaign.
Bordoni said that the month was waiting for the situation to be resolved inside before he concluded that "it would not happen".
Editor Earl Phillip "signed the fingerprints, gave the right clue and directed Vincent's head to the pocket," Brodoni said in a complaint.
The letter states that after the disease in the local and regional leadership campaign, Boroni found that at least four other people had experienced the same thing with Phillip.
"The weapons must not be shot to cause damage," Boroni said in his complaint.
The complaint will only come two days after the Republican candidate called the president adjourned when the voters in North Carolina said they would be able to cut off the owners and holders of weapons (which is set up in the second addendum in the U.S.), if his opponent Hillary Clinton was elected and was able to appoint his judge.
The trumpet campaign says that the media broke his words from the context and that Trump did not resort to violence.
Brodoni, in his complaint, asks for a return campaign for weekly surveillance and from Phillip to threaten personal security, illegal use of violence and the pursuit of emotional interests.
The trumpeter's spokesman Hope Hicks responded immediately to the request for a comment.
The attempt to get an explanation from Phillip was unsuccessful.
WCCB, the local news station in Charlotte, announced that Phillip had just left the campaign.
The phone to his advisory company Innovative Consulting Services has not responded in a short time.
The Republican candidate for President Donald Trump is conducting a controversial campaign.

Britain must continue to spread the Olympic Spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of restoration and prosperity not only for our local communities and for London, but throughout the country.
For me, Heathrow is enormously attractive, just like London 2012 when we have developed extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions will be able to endure from the Olympic Games.
The Olympic Games meant huge awards for Startford and East End.
And we'll do it again by creating opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
For our local community alone, we create 10,000 new jobs, 40,000 new jobs, and we end up unemployed young people around the airport.
Like before the London Olympics in 2012, there will be a silence that will think that Heathrow's expansion is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic Games and that we would laugh at the world floor.
The suspects were mistaken in 2012 and in Heathrow's case, they were not true.
There will always be a need to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow will be able to answer every question that concerns him.
Like Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project where many people and companies are involved, not just a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create 180 000 new jobs, an economic growth of 211 billion pounds, to leave the legacy in terms of skills and jobs both around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have a great team on Heathrow, which, in the term and with the planned budget, launched an investment programme for infrastructure of 11 billion pounds, starts with the T5 terminal - which was chosen the best terminal in the world for five years, after the T2 terminal, which was set between the two most ugly branches in the world.
They are now ready to add the third round, which represents 16 billion free private investment.
Games in London in 2012 were huge success in Great Britain and I am convinced that Heathrow's expansion will be theirs too.
It's time for us to continue to spread the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, ensure trade in the future and leave the legacy of skill and employment that might be British pride.

Adblock Plus - Facebook in the game on the cat and mouse in blocking advertising
From attempts to cover blocking advertising programs, for companies that make online marketing, the game has become a cat and mouse. At least it is claimed by one of the companies that program such software.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertising filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus confirmed the contribution on its pages, indicating that users can update filters in their program and reblock advertising on this social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook indicated that its desktop pages will change codes around the advertising to make it easier for advertising filters to find out which parts of the pages are advertising.
But Adblock now claims that the new codes have already gone.
Speaking of Adblock Ben Williams, he wrote to the blog that "this kind of war between the community open source of advertising blocking and those who try to cover it is from the time the blockage has been found," and that Facebook is likely to come with other own equipment.
The fact that the company itself has joined the world's largest social network in war only proves how a major problem with blocking advertising for industry has become.
According to the study, Pagefair and Adobe have been using advertising filters around 200 million people worldwide - almost four months before it was in 2013.
Mobile advertising now reaches 84% of the profits from Facebook ads, each day from mobile devices visits 1,03 billion active users.
The speaker pointed out that the company is also going against advertising filters on the desktop because mobile advertising filters on mobile applications for social networks and Instagram do not work.
Advertising on the desktop still represents the profit so high that Facebook decides to invest in it.
Facebook also announced on Tuesday that it will update the tool for "ad preferences" to allow people to better control how advertising is presented to them.
On Thursday, Facebook announced that the new Adblock filters are worrying, as the pages could also block content that does not match the advertising.
"This is not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem," said the speaker Facebook in an e-mail release.
The blocking of advertising is an unfeeling tool, and that is why we prefer to focus on building tools such as Ad Preferences that give control to people.
A woman broke up a Swiss highway
The victim was lying in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for witnesses of what happened on Thursday mornings, when several cars were on the road by a woman who was probably trying to escape suicide.
The accident occurred on the A1 road near Morges in the canton Vaud shortly after midnight in Thursday.
The Vaud police said in a statement that the "trustful act" actor was lying in darkness on the street and passing a number of cars.
It is clear that the victim, a 49-year-old woman, wanted to kill herself and injured several cars, including a cost vehicle.
She died on the spot.
A number of drivers have already been heard, but the police have not yet identified all of them.
There was an open criminal investigation, a "logic" step in the situation, as it is, said to Le Tribune de Geneve legal representative Gilles Hofstetter.
It is still necessary to find out whether any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent it?
This must be found by the complainant," said Hofstetter.
On the basis of two similar cases from the past five years, it appears that drivers will not be responsible.
In both cases - one of which was about a person coming in the distance - it was decided that motorists could not expect to walk through the distance during the night, as the news indicated.
Last year the police officer was released for the murder of a minor who was injured and killed on the night of August 2014 by a man who was on the A1 street near Payynnen.
The court ruled that the victim had been drinking alcohol at the age of 22 and was smoking on the street.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to the emergency call - ate the right way and that the presence of the man on the train was “a very exceptional and unforeseeable situation”, the judge said.
Any person with information on the fourth incident that occurred in Morges should report to the police on telephone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Tolerant city.
Prague is a favorite destination for LGBT communities.
The Association of Czech Travel Offices and Agency (AČCKA) is expected to reach up to 20,000 visitors within Prague Pride to Prague.
On Friday, the executive director of the AČCKA Caterín Petříčkova sent it.
The sixth anniversary of Prague Prade started on 8 August, the festival draws on the life of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals (LGBT).
Loni participated in the campaign about 35,000 people.
"The bridge is one of the most popular destinations of the LGBT community, which is for a high degree of tolerance and a wide range of specialized enterprises," Petríčkova said.
According to the authors' study, foreign visitors lose the festival on average 3100 kroner per person per day.
Gay tourists are supporting their travel to the special map of Prague with a complete list of Prague’s gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants like mobile applications, etc.
"For travel, it is generally paid that LGBT client is very lucrative, interested in living in higher prices with a high standard of travel services and losing more than the rest," said Petríčkova.
The festival is held this year and the first Prade Tourism Symposium.
It is presented by experts from the LGBT travel sector from Europe, the USA and China.
The festival continues on Sunday 14 July.
The main theme of this year is love, but action will also be undertaken in a number of thematic areas that are family, AIDS prevention and transgender problems.
The festival will be held on Saturday with allegorical cars coming from the Václav village in Latvia.
The reason that thousands of people have been involved in recent years this year will learn a minute of the silent memory of the victim of a red attack in the night club in Orlando, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Matt celebrates fourteen years.
The inhospitable cot Pat and Matt, whose strength usually ends in disaster, has been enjoying small and great wonders for four decades.
The pilot part of this evening's series of directors, Lubomír Benesche, was the prime minister on 12 August 1976.
As a result of this animated series, now known as the monsters in more than a hundred countries of the world, the impression was made by the manufacturer and director Lubomír Benesche, who had written for the magazine with two bags of Mr. Ouholič and Mr. Sedle.
Benez then called for the cooperation of the dramatour of Jiří Kubíčka and the manufacturer of Vladimír Jiranka and produced the film Kučáci together.
Today’s image with the yellow and red triangle and the towering and radiotics came into play in 1979, when in Prague’s short film the series for Slovenian television was started.
The names Pat and Mat were then obtained in 1985, this time for the short film Praha.
In 1990, Lubomír Benez founded his own studio of an animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Curych, where other parts occurred.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other artists, many of whom were divided by Benez's son Marek.
There are currently more than ninety episodes of the stories of these bottles that all sleep under their hands, but they never hurt themselves and are always full of optimism, ideas, and humour, and finally they are satisfied with their part, which belongs to the well-known gesture "...and that's it!".
Pat and Mat even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs and theaters or other games with the appearance of Pat and Mat are at the rate of each game.
It's for Fiji and for Harmonia's two-year-old.
At the end of the week is in the mark of the event, we have chosen for you one sport and one of life.
They both have a good ending.
Let's see.
Fiji has achieved a historic success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole country?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and she's happy with her.
And for what things are people losing most on the planes?
It's a five-way look at the world's websites.
The first medals from the Olympic Games.
Historic success celebrates the island state of Fiji.
Ragby's choice of this island was made in the finals of the Olympic tournament of the British team's seven-week gang.
It's just the first medal that Fiji won for herself on the Olympics.
Waiting for the win of the first prize stone took sixty years since the first training was sent to the Olympic Games.
There's a great deal of success for Coach Fiji.
It's ironic, however, that they have Brit Ben Ryan.
This led to 2013 and after the fall of the British citizen, it was possible to be at peace with its own countries.
"Let's play freely and easily and see if we can manage the biggest game in our history," said the coach before the final.
Fiji finally ruled over it, and the small state of 900 thousand people now live in the Olympic Games.
The French newspaper Le Monde brought the report.
New friend and lucky for a little girl.
2 year Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who has lived without his hand and foot for 11 months.
A lady who looks like her.
"Mummy, she's like me," rejoiced a two-year-old girl as her mother betrayed her for ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes pantheon to wash her hands and feet and then sit together without resistance.
harmonicia has been diagnosed with type B meningitis for less than a year, and doctors have only given her a 10 percent chance of survival.
There's nothing I wouldn't like about her.
She's beautiful, smart, funny, and she's never giving up.
He's got a look.
I saw her represent the other kids with the words hello, I'm Harmonie and I don't have my hands, my mother added.
Look at the joy of the lady.
What do we lose at the airport for most?
CNN provides the finding that people on the airport will lose most of their bathing water.
The driver sold Hudson's travel essential stores published data in the last year, where he collects 10 products that customers in his airlines buy most often.
The water was sovereignly first.
The drinks were generally very popular, in the first decade they were placed eight.
The ninth place contained a large M&M pump with coconut juice.
And can you agree who's closing the first decade?
As one of the above things cannot be eaten.
According to CNN, it's The Wall Street Journal.
Among other popular news sold on airports are: New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines are US Weekly, In Touch a The Economist.
The Sovereign Sovereign of the universe.
We're just gonna win, they're laughing at Murray and Bond.
The editors Eric Murray and Hamish Bond of New Zealand sovereignly rule the two categories without a coroner for seven years and their rulers have confirmed in the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At first glance, the two did not have to go to a smaller post-Olympia in Beijing and since 2009.
At Rodrigo de Freitase's legend, 69 won in the fourth final.
What are we different from the rest of us?
We're just pretty, Murray's already joked during the Olympic Regat when he had to answer questions about the governor of the New Zealand couple.
Honestly, we're not doing anything different to each other.
We're just training hard, very hard.
And we're still trying to improve our technology, it's our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their rule is remarkable and because they're physically different.
Murray is almost two-foot and stocky chassis, academically looking at Bond is five centimetres smaller and 15 kilograms light.
They also have a different attitude.
Bond's studying, and he's financial, Murray's got a charity boxer game.
And that's why it doesn't take too much time to celebrate together.
Eric's heading into the ship, basically because we can't win.
We're just gonna win.
I have a tendency to think about what can be seen, recognized Bond, who, even at the press conference, suggested that the dominant in office is Murray.
He just always answered as the first and Bond waited for his chance.
However, there is no resistance to calm force on the water.
They eat their pace, and often even half of the strata are not in their head, and the opponents have not yet found a prescription on their gradual acceleration.
We're running two-mile trails, and we never wanted to go the first mile back.
We're just trying to get the pace that no one else can.
We know what we need to do to win, said four-year-old Murray.
With his four - year - old partner, he won seven gold medals for the world's mystery.
They also triumphed in 2007, when both of the gold members were unharmed.
Just after the unexpected failure of the major Olympics in Beijing, a year later, they decided to move to a two-sided Corridor.
The Olympics in London apparently opened their careers and the dominant ones confirmed in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and they didn't ask for anything.
This time it was a little more fun.
We knew it was going to be very hard, and we had to make sure that we were mentally well on it, Murray said.
We know we all want to get out of the tower.
We're still on the back.
But we're trying to be half a step ahead of everybody, he added.
NASA climate model: Venice was once a citizen
According to the design of the new NASA climate model, Venus was once inhabited.
Scientists at the NASA Institute for the Study of the Universe have developed a model for testing Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by scientists living in climate studies.
The model was proposed to determine whether ever in Venice, whose surface is hot, without water and CO2 measured, could be subject to conditions similar to conditions on Earth.
Scientists have already suggested that the low speed of Venus’s approach can explain its harsh atmosphere.
According to the latest simulations, it seems that Venus was once capable of swallowing a guide atmosphere like Earth and then slowly retreating.
The model was also fond of the previous topography of Venus.
There may have been more areas on the planet than on Earth, but at times there was enough water and land resources to control life and provide protection against rapid recovery.
Venus also used the Sun, which was 30 percent thicker.
"In the simulation of the GISS model Venus during a short visit, it presents its daily page to the sun almost two months together," explains a scientist from GISS Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
This leads to the burning of the surface and the formation of the rain which creates a dense variety of clouds that act as rain and protect the surface from excessive solar heat.
The result is climate with average temperatures that are actually lower than at the present time on Earth.
The model composed the story of Venus, similar to the evolution that was once hypothetically composed by planetary scientists.
Even though Venus was probably civilized in the past -- over a few billion years -- it was exposed to too much heat and ultrafilament.
Its oceans disappeared, and the water pairs were lit by ultrafilament light.
The water is unique, and it's just a harsh atmosphere of oxygen that's exposed to the deadly effects of the greenhouse gas -- it's Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers confirmed their results from the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy refused to post a team coach Colorado Avalanche
On Thursday, Patrick Roy gave up his position as a coach and vice president of the hockey operations team Colorado Avalanche, giving reasons for not being able to participate in the decision-making process in the team.
The executive vice-president/general manager Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed the step and announced that the club will immediately start looking for a new trainer.
"For the past three years, I have served as the main coach and vice-president of hockey operations for Colorado Avalanche, with energy, strength and determination," stated 16-year-old Roy in a statement.
Over the years, I've been thinking about how I can improve the team, give him the depth he needs, and get her to a higher level.
To achieve this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and vice-president of hockey operations be in line with the vision of the organization.
It must also be possible to participate in decisions affecting the team's performance.
These conditions are not met at the present time.
Sakic, who received Roye on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate all that he has done for our organization, and we will bring him to the future with great happiness.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adamse as the best league coach during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to a score of 112 points and the first place in the Central Division. Colorado, however, had an affair with Minnesota in the first round of play-off, and during the last two years, he did not always go out after the season.
The Avalanche team in the season 2015/2016 reached score 39:39:4 and missed five points to get another wild card in the Western Conference.
The banker Roy, who wrote to China's glory, won Stanley Cup four times -- twice with Montreal Canadiens and twice with Avalanche.
Workmen on the rocky plains in the North Sea renew conversations and cancel the strike
The High Representative of the One Party indicated that the stocks for the construction of the coal mines in the North Sea were cancelled while all sides of the dispute were on a new round of settlement.
To stand against the service company for the wood field group gradually arrived at the plains in the North Sea, which runs the Royal Dutch Shell company.
"Wood Group and the United States and RMT committee organisations can confirm that they have agreed to renew the process for resolving current imbalances," states the statement.
Starting next week, we will have a few weeks of a series of full-day meetings, where we will try to look at the problems in the new fields.
According to committee organisations, their recent action, which was the first for more than 25 years, was protesting against foot-and-mouth disease by up to 30 per cent.
In the year, Wood Group reduced taxes and paid its suppliers in the North Sea by about 9 per cent less due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in company rates is due to a 10% reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company claims that other damages would provide space to deal with market distortions.
On the other hand, Shell broke out of his payrolls thousands of people and announced plans to release operations on the ground floor and ground floor up to 10 countries for modernising his processes - directly after mega fuze with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of low oil prices, the economic situation associated with the UK's red decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of this week, a member of Parliament from Scotland, Dave Anderson, met with committee members to address one of the largest labour shortages of the whole generation that led to the siege of the North Sea.
The North Sea, as he said, is vital to the economy in the region.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for all, not just for some," he said in a statement.
For comparison, in 2016, approximately $1.4 billion is expected to invest in new projects in the North Sea, while the average over the past five years was around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of the orbit of the stars in the sky
The most recent mission of Kepler's space telescope to assist astronomers is to get almost a complete list of the speedy orbits of the stars from the Plejady constellation.
New data help astronomers to understand why stars in the constellation point at different speeds, as well as how travel time relates to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the star mass, its age and even history in its solar system," said Luisa Rebulov, a research worker at the center of Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadeno.
The stars of Plejadi are 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars in the sky now reach the state of maturity and have emerged for about 125 million years.
He's moving faster now.
At the instant maximum speeds, these rising stars release huge amounts of star wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a negative effect on them.
In combination with the age star, her speed decreases.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by measuring the time between the appearance of different points on the stars -- similar sunscreens.
According to the most recent data on rapid orbits, stars are smaller than mass stars.
Rebull is comparing stars to dancers, making pirates smaller than those smaller.
"In the "Ballet" Flood we can see that smaller points of stars are more massive, while those that point faster are usually very light stars," said Rebulov.
Because stars are so close, they serve as the ideal space laboratory for comparison of the quality of the stars and the speed of the rotation.
"The result is that the theoretical models of star rotation are given to both directions in younger and older stars," Rebulov said.
There is still much we want to learn about how when and why stars reduce their rotation speed and thus say “telling their dance boots on the refrigerator. ”
Rebullova and her colleagues described in detail the latest analysis of the rapid approach of the Flood in three studies that will soon be published in the Astronomic Journal.
Is a qualifying agreement necessary?
If I didn't sign up, then the qualifying agreement would not be concluded and I could go to another hospital in a few months?
Is it even possible to work after the study without being enrolled in specialized education?
One thing is that in the area where I would like to work is now a free workplace only in some more distant hospital, but in half a year, the noise could be released in another place where I would like to work.
So I don't know how to deal with this half-life situation, it's still asking.
He's responding to Mr. Lenka Vlkov.
No legal provision shall lay down the obligation to conclude a qualifying agreement with employees - hospitals.
A qualifying agreement is a legal institution which manages the labour law and may be concluded between an employee and an employee in order to ensure the return of costs incurred related to the increase or the extension of the qualifications of an employee.
In the area of health, a long-term pressure on the non-conformity of these agreements with the aim of ensuring the labour mobility of medical workers and not all hospitals are currently required by this Agreement.
Under Act No 95/2004, Sb., on the conditions of obtaining and acknowledging professional and specialized opportunities to perform the medical call of a doctor, dentist and pharmacist, it expressly states that participation in specialized education is considered to be an improvement in qualifications (never to increase it).
This means that a qualifying agreement can be concluded under the labour law only if the costs reach at least 75,000 Kč.
There is no legal provision or obligation to participate in specialized education.
The law only lays down conditions for the application for admission to the specialized education.
However, the doctor is entitled, under the law, to carry out a doctor’s call because of the completion of the required high school study, even if the conditions set out by the law (by professional supervision of the doctor with specialized competences in the relevant field).
The Act provides for a situation where a professional practice in another field of specialized education may be established in the specialized education of a doctor if its content and scope correspond to the relevant educational programme.
Theoretically, it would be possible to start a period of rest, which would correspond to the situation.
However, given that I do not know the details of this case, it may be recommended to consult the appropriate committee of the Ministry of Health (Scientific and Medical Appeals) as the Ministry of Health provides advice and advisory services related to the inclusion of specialized education and its course.
The Advisory Service also provides the Czech Medical Room, which must be a member of each doctor.
Doctors from the Syrian Halabu are asking for US intervention.
The United States has not resorted to any efforts to end the siege (resurrection of the city by government forces) and has not used its influence on the protection of civilians, quoting from the letter addressed to the AFP Agency.
"We do not need tears, guilt, or even prayers; however, we need to create an East Halab in order to stop attacks, and we need an international action that would ensure that Halab will not be re-arranged," the doctors said.
Russian forces supporting the army to the faithful President Bashar Asad announced that he will stop from today for three hours every day in the Halab area in order to enable the safe passage of humanitarian forces.
From 9:00 to 12:00 SELCH should be stopped all military activities, air raids and semi-trailers.
The head of UN humanitarian operations Stephen O'Brien has already welcomed this, but stressed that there is a need for at least two-week reference.
According to the AFP, 15 of the 35 doctors who are active in the eastern part of Halabu have already controlled the rebels, according to the AFP.
He writes that during the fifth war, witnesses were violent, cruel deaths of innocent patients, friends, and colleagues.
The world looks at and sees how hard Syria is, but it's only doing a little to protect us.
Recent evacuation offers of citizens from the Syrian regime and Russia seem to be just an easy target for seizures, pediatrics, surgeons and other doctors.
Doctors reported 42 attacks on medical devices in Syria were reported last month, 15 of which were in the hospital where they work.
We are most sad that we have to decide who will live and who will die.
Little children are ready to come to us with such serious injuries that we have to choose between those who are most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't even have the material needed to help them sign doctors.
Two weeks ago, four newborns died when the blast stopped supplying oxygen to their incubators.
They fell to the ground, and then their lives ended, before he could actually start, they remembered.
The army of loyal President Bashar Asad, supported by the Russian forces, in the past few weeks, caused the rebellion in the eastern part of Halab, without food supply for over 200,000 people.
Rebels, which are under constant pressure of Russian and Syrian aircraft, were subjected to prolongation within three weeks of Saturday.
Both sides then came to the city and its surrounding forces.
