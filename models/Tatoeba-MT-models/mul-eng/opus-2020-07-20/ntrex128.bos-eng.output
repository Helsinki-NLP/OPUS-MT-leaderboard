The great members of the congregation are concerned about the likes of the Mapetovians.
Some members of the congregation were upset by the proposal to change their title in the "Members of the Grand Parliament" (MWP).
This was due to plans to change the name of the assembly in the Great Parliament.
Members of the congregation throughout the entire political spectrum are concerned that they may become subject to ridicule.
A lab member of the congregation said his group was worried "because it's rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers out of Vels: On a large twp means lead, and pwp means waste.
A member of the congregation from the political party Plaid said the group was "not satisfied" and submitted alternative names.
A member of the large conservative party said his group was "opened" on the subject of change of names, but he noted that there was little difference between the MWP and the Mapetovac concepts.
In this context, the meaning of a great word is similar to the meaning of a word in Irish English.
The Congregation Commission currently working on the draft law on the introduction of a change of names stated: "The final decision on the descriptions of the title of the members of the congregation will, of course, bring its own members."
The law of the Government of Velsa in 2017 gave the congregation permission to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public debate on proposals that resulted in great support for appointing the Assembly to the Grand Parliament.
In the case of the title of the members of the congregation, the Commission has given priority to the designation of members of the Parliament or of the WMP, but the option of the MWP has received the most support in the public debate.
The members of the congregation are reportedly offering alternative proposals, but efforts to achieve consensus could be made to the head of the president, Elina Jones, who is expected to submit a draft amending law within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will also include other changes in the way the congregation operates, including rules on the disqualification of the members of the congregation and the Commission system plan.
Members of the congregation will have the last opportunity to vote on their name when they discuss the law.
Macedonians go to the referendum on change in the name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday whether to change the name of their country in the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The national vote is organized in an attempt to resolve a multi-year dispute with a neighbouring Greece that has a territory called Macedonia.
Athens already claims that the name of their northern neighbour represents its territory and is firmly opposed to its demands for membership in the EU and NATO agreement.
Macedonian President Dr. Ivanov, anti-Pelbistic opposition to a change of name, said he would not admit the vote.
However, rapporteurs, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, consider that the change of names is simply the price they have to pay for membership in the EU and NATO agreement.
The bells on St. Martin were silenced while the churches in Harlem fought for survival.
"The old people I talked to say that there were bars and churches in every corner at times," said Mr. Adams.
"There's no one today."
He said the disappearance of the baroque was understandable.
"People are different today," he said.
"The bars are no longer a quarter of a day's living in which people go regularly."
As for the church, he is worried that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the manuals expect, "and sooner or later, they will return to where they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by state buildings with dwellings filled with people who will not help in the preservation of the remaining Quartet churches.
"The vast majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and that's why it's going to speed up the closure of these churches because it's unlikely that people who will move to these places will become members of these churches."
Both churches built white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis — the metropolitan community of 1870, and the Church of St. Martin ten years later.
The original community of white methologists was settled in the 1930s.
The black community she served nearby took over the property over the building.
St. Martin's church took over the black community under the leadership of the late John Howard Johnson, who led a merchant fighter on the 125th street, the main trading street in Harlem, which was opposed to black employment or promotion.
Fire in 1939 damaged the building very much, but as Johnson’s father’s dentists redesigned the plan, they ordered the organs.
The great David Johnson, the son of Johnson's father and his successor in St. Martin's Church, proudly called the organ "the sound of the cheese."
The expert who played the organs in July called them different: "cultural goods" and "unchangeable historical instrument."
Colonel Tiffany Ng from University in Michigan also pointed out that these were the first organs in the world to play black musicians, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger organs in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church didn't find a replacement.
What was played in the Church of St. Martin in the last few months is a complex story of architects and businessmen, some of which were brought by church leaders, and other Episcopal Bishops.
The Bishop's Administration – the bishop's administrative body composed of church heads – wrote the bishop's letter in July expressing concern that the bishop "will seek to transfer the costs" to the bishop's government, although the bishop's administration was not included in the rent of the architect and the businessman sent by the bishop.
Some Jews complained about the lack of transparency in the work of the bishop.
Aikula was injured by a 13-year-old in the hunting in California.
Aikula was attacked and wounded by a 13-year-old boy while he was hunting the hunters in California on the day of the opening of the hunt, officials announced.
An attack took place about seven o'clock in the morning near the beach of Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday he broke up with his friends about half an hour when he heard the boy who came to help and then took him with the group and helped him get him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was about getting excited because of the noise, but then he said, "he realized he was shouting, 'It's me!'
She bit me!'
His entire key bone was broken," Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I called everyone out of the water, 'The shark's in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy's been transferred to a helicopter in Rady's paediatric hospital where his condition is leading as critical.
It's not known what kind of shark attacked him.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in the media that the shark has already been identified in that area a few weeks ago, but that it was established that it does not belong to a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim received traumatized injuries in the area of the upper body.
Officials closed access to the beach from the Ponto Beach beach in Casablada to the Swami's beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours due to investigation and security.
Giles claimed that there are more than 135 kinds of sharks in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the beauty market in Great Britain
Sainsbury's becomes a competition for boots, Superdrug and Debenhams to split cosmetic products in the style of slave houses in which professional assistants work.
In addition to a significant market for beauty in Great Britain of 2.8 billion dollars, which is growing while selling fashion and household equipment on markets, larger cosmetics will be tested in 11 shops across the country, and will be expanded to more shops next year if they are successful.
Investing in cosmetic products is due to the fact that supermarkets find ways to use police that are sometimes used for televisions, microwaves and household equipment.
Sainsbury's said he would double his cosmetic as he would offer more than 3000 products, including brand products such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing brands of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space in sections similar to those in stores like Booths.
The Supermarket will also re-start its Boutique wine line so that most products will be suitable for vegans – something that the more young buyers need.
In addition, the perfume store Fragrance Shop will test the sales place in two Sainsbury's shops, from which it was first opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the other one will be opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and driving to buy daily smaller food in local stores means that supermarkets need to make additional efforts to attract people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of the chain Sainsbury's, said that salesmen would look more like slaves in the pursuit of the supermarket to reverse the attacks of the chain with the great Aldi and Lidl discounts, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's opened sections of Argos shops in hundreds of their shops, and also introduced the Habitat department since they bought both chains two years ago, which says it increased the sale of food products and the profitability of purchases.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to modernise its cosmetic and pharmaceutical products has been unsuccessfully completed.
Sainsbury's has tested joint attacks with the Boots chain at the beginning of 2000, but this partnership ended up fighting about the share of the asset income in their shops.
The new strategy came into force three years ago after Sainsbury's sold his 281 patented company Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain for 125 million pounds.
It has been said that Lloyds will have a role in this plan by adding an additional line of luxury products for his skin, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of the Sansbury's chain, said: "We have transformed the appearance and experience of our beautiful sections to give our buyers a more pleasant environment.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be at hand to give advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and attractive surroundings and practical locations mean that we are now an unstable market for beauty that sets new standards in relation to the old way of buying."
Peter Jones was "white" after Holly Willoughby withdrew from the 11 million-pound deal.
Dragons Den, Peter Jones, is "white" after television director Holly Willoughby withdrew from his personal brand of 11 million pounds to focus on his contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV companies.
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of home and extra equipment Truly.
The company of this money is connected to the brand Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning (37) emissions manager announced his departure via Instagram.
Holly Willoughby escaped the stars of Dragons' Den Peter Jones by withdrawing from their profitable brand in the last minute – to focus on its new binding agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV companies.
The sources said Jones was "white" when a gold girl recognized, during a sudden meeting on Tuesday in his business empire in Marlow, in Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million dollars, meant that there was no time to expose their brand of home and additional equipment to Truly.
The company was associated with Gwyneth Paltrow Goop and was expected to double the wealth of Willoughby, which was estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby (37) announced his departure at Instagram, Jones left Britain in one of his weekends.
The source said: "Holly's Truly put herself in the top of her priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term plan that would provide for her through the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw was all involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to launching.
In Marlow's seat there is a lot of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of this Morning's director, who is among the most profitable British stars, could cost the company millions because of large investments in a wide range of products, from jackets and candles to clothes and household equipment, and possible additional delays in launch dates.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Mother three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his wife, Tari Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) joined in March as company director.
Couples go for vacation together and Jones has 40 percent share in Baldwin's production house.
Willoughby will become the Ambassador within the M&S and will replace Anta McPartlin as the leader of the ITV Emission I'm A Celebrity.
The source near Jones said last night, "We wouldn't comment on his business."
Hard words, 'and then we fell in love'
He was referring to criticism that could be obtained from the media because of comments that could be characterized as "non-Presidents" and because of a positive attitude about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump leave so much?
Trump said with his amazing voice "reading news".
"I didn't let it go at all."
He concluded that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump declared their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step forward to the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the high North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders and the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see "appropriate response" from the US on the first steps of North Korea to disarmament.
Instead, he tried, the U.S. continues with sanctions aimed at retaining pressure.
Trump gave much more positive opinion during his speech together.
"We're going great with North Korea," he said.
"We were on the step of war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to repair Kim's relationship had led to positive results - the failure of rocket testing, release of the hostages, and the return of the remains of American soldiers.
And he stood in defense of his unusual approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It's easy to behave as presidentials, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this whole arena, we'd have about 200 people here," Trump said, pointing at the light in front of him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed the island of hundreds of deaths
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations have been told that their assistance is unnecessary.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of the island of Lombok has been replaced, the state of national disasters has not been declared, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear to know that they are not seeking international assistance, so it will be quite difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While the Save the Children organisation consists of a team that will travel to Palu, they are still not sure if side staff can work on the field.
Mr Sutopo, the national disaster agency's portfolio, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation on the island of Palau to see whether international agencies should be allowed to participate in providing assistance.
In view of the ongoing earthquake in Indonesia, it is sad that this country is not prepared for the anger of nature.
Although the cave shelters are built in Aceh, they are not often seen on other parts of the coast.
It has been said that it was not for the tsunamis on the island of Pala, although the warning was on the force, so it also contributed to the loss of life.
And in ideal conditions, travel between many Indonesian islands presents challenges.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship planted in Lombok to help the victims of earthquakes is on the way to Pala, but he will need at least three days to arrive at a new disaster.
President Joko Vidodo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesian infrastructures and did not save money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has hit Mr. Joko's administration until the next year, he expects a new election.
Mr. Joko was also under pressure because of long-term sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority had gained a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have lost their lives, and tens of thousands have been displaced from the street fighting of Christian and Muslim groups, who have used swords, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Look: Fudbaler Liverpool Daniel Sturridge has put in deep contrast with Chelsea football club
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss in Premier League in the 89th minute of Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge got a ball from the Sherdan Shaqiri on some 30 yards from Chelsea's naked club while his team lost 1:0.
He moved the ball to his left side, then he jumped to the outside stop.
The ball flew high above the penal area turning to the top right corner of the network.
Finally, it fell over Cape Arrizabalga, which was in the jump and jumped into the net.
"It was only to position, to take the ball, and players like Shaq always go ahead as much as possible, so I just tried to give myself more time," Sturudge said for LiverpoolFC.com.
"He saw Kante coming, I touched her once, and I didn't think much, I just hit the ball."
Chelsea led 1-0 in the half-hour after Belgium's star Eden Hazard got hit in 25 minutes.
The Blue Attacker added five to Matte Kovači's ball before running from the middle of the ground in Liverpool.
Kovacic hit fast and brought the ball back to the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful cross, leading Hazard to the penal area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and ended up near the stats placed on the left side of the network, except Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool is fighting Napoli in a group phase of the League of Champion in three hours on Wednesday at the Stadium of San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in the League of Europe in three hours on Thursday in London.
The number of Indonesian tsunami victims reached 832
The number of Indonesian earthquake and tsunami victims dropped to 832, a state disaster agency announced early Sunday.
A large number of injured people were reported in the destructions of the building, which broke down the 7.5 earthquake that took place on Friday and raised the waves high and up to 20 feet, said the portfolio of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered by the remains of damaged buildings.
The police arrested a man (32) after his wife died.
A murder investigation was launched after the woman's body was found in Birkenhead, in the Merseyside area.
Forty-four-five-year-olds were found fired at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street Street, and a 30-year-old man was arrested suspected of committing murder.
The police called on people who were nearby to see or hear something to answer.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is in the early phase, but I call on everyone who was near the John Street street in Birkenhead and who saw or heard anything suspicious about contacting us.
I would also call on everyone, especially taxis, who may have recorded something to camera on the control panels of the car, to contact us because they may possess information that is important for the investigation."
The police department confirmed that the woman whose body was found from Birkenhead and found it in the house.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman came to the front to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and the police said they were in the process of informing the victim's family.
The taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police informed him that nobody was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He stayed out of text when he found out what happened.
Stanners are now told that they will have to wait hours before they are allowed to come back in.
They heard a cop told one man that a reading area was considered a crime scene.
One woman came to the crime scene in tears.
She repeated "this is so terrible."
In 14 hours, two police vans were inside a police cordon, and another van was right next door.
A large number of police officers were inside the police cordon watching the building.
All who have any information are invited to contact @MerPolCC directly, call 101 or anonymously contact the Crimestopers line at 0800 555 111, indicating case 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's status in parliament has become the latest reminder of the "historic review" in the middle of the debate.
Her removal would represent a poignant justice due to the dispersion of numerous cultural and religious artifacts in England, which in the way of the Taliban have produced its Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society's proposal, Mr. Cricka, described as "ruining" and "testing history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "As part of the current debate on the removal of the status, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's character in front of the palace in Westminster became a target.
Cromwell didn't even order, nor did he carry out an icono-birth during the English civil war.
The wrong Cromwell could be victimized by the actions of his nephew Thomas from the past century.
The magnificent exhibition Cromwell author Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the opinion from the ninth century and part of the history of the type for which many still believe it should be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell many think, perhaps by the end of the ninth century more than today, to protect Parliament from external pressures, in his case of monarchy.
Whether this is exactly the subject of permanent historical discussion.
What is certain is that a conflict in the mid-seventh century formed a further development of our nation and that Cromwell was a recognized figure representing one side of the division.
His achievements in the property of Lord Lord the protector are also worthy of honor and remembrance."
The killer's pig brought death wounds to the Chinese farmer.
The pigs attacked and killed a farmer on the market in South-West China, reported local media.
A man who only knew that Yuan was overcome was found dead with a broken artery and buried blood in a pigeon on a market in the city of Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reports South China Morning Post on Sunday.
Swinjar was preparing for pigs for the outbreak of the vaccine on June 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai, China.
He reportedly allowed a relative from the nearby Yunnan area to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a big man pig with blood around his mouth.
The Forensic investigation confirmed that the pig had weighed less than 550 pounds on the death toll of the farm, as reported in the report.
"My cousin's legs were bleeding and broken," said a relative who represented himself as Wu, carrying Guiyang Evening News.
The security footage shows Yuan who came to the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man did not belong to Yuan, nor to his family.
The market manager told Evening News that pigs were closed to prevent other people's attacks while the police collected evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and market owners are reportedly negotiating the death penalty.
Although rare, cases of swine attacks on people have been noted before.
Swinya attacked his wife and her husband in 2016 on their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 650 pounds fell in love with a big farmer with his tractor while his wife wasn't afraid and scared.
After pigs had eaten anorgon farm in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "wig".
"They're just playing.
They like guys, they're very curious... they don't intend to hurt you.
You just have to respect them enough," he said.
The rest of Rosa's uranium brings scattered lungs to the southwestern United States
As predicted, Uragan Rosa failed to move over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring the floods over the northern part of Mexico and the Southwest of the United States in the next few days.
Rosini's hurricanes first category reached a speed of 85 miles per hour from five o'clock in the morning after sunrise on Sunday, and was 385 miles south-west of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, I am formed in the Pacific and moves toward the east and west coast of the United States. As the Tropical War of Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, it will begin to strike the Tropical River north to the south of the United States.
Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the Tropical input will be created along with the coming wave of spreads on the south-west in the next days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will result in floods, floods and possible crises in the desert.
The high troupe will result in floods that will reach both local and 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Even 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in the southwestern regions, especially in the larger part of Arizona.
Floods are possible as a result of a sudden deterioration of weather conditions and typical abundance of tropical rain.
Flying sands in the desert would be extremely mindless with the danger of tropical rain.
A heavy rain in canyons could result by dividing the rivers, and by literally blowing up strong winds and sandstorms.
The coming me will bring local flows to the parts of southern California.
There are possible total dropouts from over half an inch, which could cause nasals and cholera crests.
This will be the first rain season in the region.
The room will reach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before rain becomes more spread later on Monday and Tuesday.
The lungs will also reach Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue on a number of Wednesdays.
In October it can reach large fluctuations of temperature across the United States as the Arctic gets colder and the trophies remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature in short growths.
There is a great example of dramatic differences in temperature in the Central United States on Sunday.
The difference in temperature in Kansas City, Missouri and Omahi, Nebraska and between St Louis and Des Moins, Iowa, was almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days, the remaining summer heat will again try to buy and expand.
The beginning of October will be warm in most central and eastern parts of the United States with temperatures from about 80 degrees south to the north.
The temperature in New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term forecast of time shows a large possibility of temperatures above average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the hearing of Bretta Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people were watching the exciting witness of Britta Kavanaugh before the high court, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual assaults that occurred in the 1980s, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political unrest continues, with issuers interrupting regular broadcasts due to the latest appeal Friday: the agreement reached by Senator Arizona Jeff Blake with the FBI agency on a one-week investigation of charges.
Ford told the Senate Justice Commission that hundreds of times it's safe to join Kavanaugh's pipe and try to break up at the high school party.
In a sad story, Kavanaugh said that hundreds of times it's safe to say it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, this probably looked at more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company calculated CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC viewers.
The numbers were not available immediately for the other networks that issued it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who are following the transfer from the office.
To make things better, it's a public like the one that follows football elimination matches or Oscar's fate.
Fox News Channel, whose editors supported the name Kavanaugh, led the other network with an average number of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's hearing, said from Nielsen.
ABC was another of 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, were declared from Nielsen.
Interest is high even after hearing.
Flake was the central actor of the drama on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican to vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS took note of the video of the prosecutor who were shouting at him after he tried to get into the elevator to attend the hearing of the judicial commission.
He was standing in the dark for a couple of minutes while they hurt him, moving his life to CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?
And it was said to him, 'You have power, as many women as you can't.'
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said before the elevator closed, he had to say something else at the hearing of the commission.
Kabul and television networks had a live transfer hours later, while the judicial committee voted to track the appointment of Kavanaugh Senate to vote.
But Blake said he'd do this only under the condition that the FBI investigate charges against the so-called next week, on what a minority of democracy calls.
Flake's conversation with a friend, democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few more senators after that, Blake decided.
Flake's election was significant because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened the FBI investigation against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "playing politics" in relation to Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critics of her plans to leave the European Union to "play politics" with the future of Britain and lower national interests in the interview for Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, September 29, 2018.
In a second interview to her address on the agenda, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued with an attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal is that Britain and the EU take up taxes one of the other "very absurd".
The murder of Wade Sims: The police arrested Dytheon Simpson, a suspect of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect in the death penalty that killed Wade Sims, a twenty-year-old LSU basketball club.
Dyteon Simpson (20) was arrested and imprisoned under the charge of a second-party murder, reported from the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials published videotapes between Simms and Simpson and the police said Simpson lost his glasses during the fight.
The police took cover from the crime scene and reported that they found Simpson's DNA on them, reports the WAFB network channel CBS.
After Simpson's investigation, the police said he confessed to having killed Wade.
His guarantee was $350,000, said a lawyer.
The Mortgage of the East region of Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report on Friday, saying that the cause of death was a gun shot in the head and neck.
The department said that the benefits belong to the police working group for the refugees of Louisiana, the criminalist state police lab, the Southern University police and the local authorities who helped during the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports director of the LSU club, Joe Alleva, thanked the local law enforcement agency for "the severity and severity of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The attacker up 6 feet and 6 inches grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also a basketball player in the LSU club.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps after the sword.
On Friday morning, Lsu Will Wade's basketball coach said the team was "expected" and "in shock" because of Wade's death.
"This is what we always worry about," said Wade.
Vulcan throws the hell out of Mexico City.
Pepeo, which shines the volcano Popocatepetl, has reached the southern quarter of the capital city of Mexico.
The National Disaster Protection Centre warned Mexicans on Sunday to stay at a safe distance after the volcanic activity in the crater increased and after 183 gas and dust emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was following more tension and tension.
Images on social media show tanks of ashes covering wind-cars in the squares of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increased activity of the volcano, located 45 miles (72 km) south of the main city since the 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
Vulcan known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police competed with Catalan separatists to mark the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Sunday after the prosecutors, representatives of independence, met with a special police assignment, when thousands of people joined in contravention demonstrations because of the marking of the anniversary of the polarising Catalan referendum on abortion.
A group of mascot separatists, held by a special police department, threw them with eggs and colors in the dust, creating dark clouds of dust on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Later in the day, they broke down and broke up with a cop who used pendants to get a fight.
Independence delegates had been scanning "No Forget, No Forgiveness" for hours and were fighting with the allies of the Union who called themselves "Spain's Life".
Forty-four persons received medical treatment for minor injuries received in protest, reported local press.
Tension is still high in the region, which was established for independence year after the referendum of the first October that Madrid declared illegal, but which catalytic separatists celebrate.
The voters chose independence in a large majority, although the output was low because the opponents of small abortions fought against the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people have been injured last year after the police tried to stop voting in violent conflicts across the region.
Groups claiming independence campaigned on Friday evening to prevent demonstrations and provide support to the national police.
The demonstrations were still held, but they changed the route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who participated in separatist sermons with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about catalytic independence.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I watched my parents pay for happiness because they're allowed to vote, but we're in the script now," he said.
Although they have taken the key, but a secret victory at the local elections last December, the Catalan parties claiming to be independent have had difficulty holding back because some of their most famous leaders are in self-defense exile or detention, awaiting trial for their role in the referendum organisation, and then declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 40-year-old auto mechanic who recorded a statement on the phone for police support, said politicians on both sides supported the conflict.
"There's more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in custody since the end of last year, published his candidate in the elections for the European Parliament next year.
"Candidacy in European elections is the best way to condemn the backlog of democratic values and the repressions that the Spanish authorities have imposed on us," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after the car was killed in the house
Three men (33, 34 and 39) were arrested after more than one car had been killed in a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in the Ballynagard Crescent Street on Thursday about 19:30 after the British time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said he's damaged the gate as well as the building itself.
There's a possibility that in one moment the car was shot out of the plane.
The Menge hit Livingston won 1:0 against Rangers.
The first goal of Dolly Menge was to win for Livingston.
The advanced Livingston surprised Rangers and marked only another loss for Steven Gerard at the 18th Ibrox match club.
Gol Dolly Menge was key, while Gary Holt's club was compared to Hibernian in another place.
Gerard's club has not noticed any win in the guests in the Premier League this season and will play against the first-class Hearts for which eight points remain next week.
Before that, Rangers will attack Rapid from Becca in the sword of the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased a series of victories in the league for six matches, and Chief Coach Holt hasn't experienced the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed a chance against the guests who had lost their mates.
Holt's team had to be in charge a lot before they gave up because their direct game was very difficult for Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried, but his attempt went past the floor, and then the attempt by Alan Lithgrowa went beyond the floor after he pulled out to get the ball that Craig Halkett had moved his head to the floor.
It was appropriate for domestics to allow Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could create problems for guests from free strikers.
And that's how the key goal has been achieved.
He was convicted of a free strike against Rangers, Livingston made a pass, Declan Gallagher and Robinson created an opportunity for Mango, who took the ball and shot from the middle of the penal area.
By that time Rangers had dominated the owner of the ball, but the defense home remained unreachable and the gold Liam Kelly didn't have a lot of trouble.
That form continued in the second half of the time, although Kelly had to intervene for Alfred Morelos.
Scott Pittman stopped the footsteps of the Rangers Allan McGregor, and Lithgow jumped across from another free strike for Livingston.
The Croseis have come to Livingstone’s penal area continuously and have been banned, while two of the hostages they have sought – one after the failure of the replacement player Glenna Middleton, and the other because of the game’s hand – have not been assigned.
"Fenomenal Game" Livingstone – analysis
Newspaper BBC Scotland, Alaskar Lamont is in Tony Macaroni arena
The phenomenon game and the result of Livingstone.
All up to one was great and they continue to overcome expectations on the way out.
Their style of games and players have probably not changed since their return to the top, but great rewards belong to Holt, who gives the team the energy from its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, leading a well-organized defense, while Menga did not give Connor Goldson and Joe Worrllu peace through his sword.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As long as they were good under Gerard's fire, they didn't get that degree.
There were no final hits – only one time they crossed the lines of the house – and this is the kind of invitation to wake up Rangers, which is on the middle of the table.
Exchanged reception for Erdogan in Kelna
Saturday (29 September) was marked by a smile and a blue sky while the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan Germany, whose aim is to improve NATO relations.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of prints and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Keln to open a huge new gym.
This is the city in which the largest number of Turks live outside Turkey.
The police took security measures as a reason to block the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many delegates gathered near to see their president.
Hundreds of witnesses who opposed Erdogan – many of them Kurdi – were also voting, condemning Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to grant him a welcome welcome to the country.
The two-pronged sermons reflect the division in the opinions of a guest of some German Turks who is famous as a hero, while others suggest that he is an autocrat.
Traffic accidents in Deptford: Bicyclelist died in a car crash
The biker died in a car crash in London.
To the end, it came close to Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on the road to Deptford, in the south of the city, about 10:15 by the British time.
The car driver stopped and intervened by the emergency relief team, but the man died on the scene.
The accident occurred a few months after the other biker died in the accident in which the driver left the accident site, in the Childers Street street, which was about a mile away from the accident site on Saturday.
The London police said they were working to identify victims and inform the family.
Streets are closed, buses are being redirected, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six employees injured in riots
Six prison officials have been injured in the riots in the high-security prison for men, reported from the Prison Office.
The riots broke out in Long Larsin prison, in Worcestershire, on Sunday about 09:30 in British time and still lasts.
The Special Staff Officer "Tornado" has been invited to make peace with eight guards participating in a prison wing.
Officials have received fewer facial injuries, and help has been given to them on the scene
Portparol of the prison administration said: "We compared the specially trained prison staff involved in an incident that is in the course of Long Larsin prison.
Six staff members received medical assistance because of the injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we have made it clear that the police will be responsible for it and that prison sentences may be extended to them."
Long Lartin prison is located in more than 500 prisons, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was admitted to hospital treatment after he was attacked by the prisoner.
And in October last year, a special department was called in prison because of serious accidents in which staff were attacked by billiards.
Uragan Rosa warns to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lat City (which may be useful in areas covered by drought)
Very rarely when tropical depression strikes Arizona, but that is exactly what will likely happen at the beginning of the next week while hurricane Rosa passes through its remaining energy through the desert southwestern provinces, carrying its risk of floods.
The National Meteorological Administration has already issued warnings for floods on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will pass directly via Phoenix on Tuesday, and her approach will announce rain on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Administration in Phoenix is tweeted that it was only "ten tropsic cycles since 1950. It held the status of tropical storms or depression in the circle of Phoenix for 200 miles!
Katrina (1967) is a hurricane that was 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The most recent projections of the National Centre for Uraganas predict 2 to 4 inland waterways and in isolated parts of Mogollon Rome in Arizona and up to 6 inland areas.
In the rest of the desert south-west, including the central part of the Rockies and Great Basin chain, it will be most likely to be 1 to 2 inches, and possibly up to 4 inches in isolated parts.
In parts where there is no fear of floods, Rosina rain could be a blessing because the area is hit by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these floods will probably be of benefit because the South West is currently hit by drought.
According to information from the American drought control agency, a little over 40 percent of Arizona has been hit by the least extreme drought, the second highest category," said weather.com.
First on his way, Urgan Rosa will lead to a cliché on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, who will still have the strength of the winds of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenie in Mexico and will move at 12 miles per hour speed.
The oil will reach the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean and will therefore begin to fertilize.
It is therefore expected that Mexico will be hit by the force of tropical storms on Monday afternoon or evening.
The floods in parts of Mexico could be very strong and could represent a great risk of floods.
"A total of three to six inches are expected from Bay California to northwestern Sonore, and perhaps up to 10 inches," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then go north through Mexico with the power of the tropical storm before it arrives in Arizona early Tuesday in the form of tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday late evening.
"The main danger expected by Rose or her remnants is large floods in Baja California, northern Sonori and the South-West American desert," they said from the National Centre for Uregans.
These floods are expected to cause life-threatening floods and floods in the deserts, as well as cliffs in the mountainous regions.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and 20-year-old men were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a six-year-old was found shot in Somerset.
Teenagers found wounded near Excelsior Terrace Street in Midsomer Norton on Saturday about 4 a.m. after the British time.
He's taken to the hospital and he's in a stable state.
Seventeen-year-olds, two eight-year-olds and twenty-year-olds were arrested in Radstock's area, reported from the Avon and Somerset police.
Officials are calling to contact those who have any video on the mobile phone.
The trumpet said Kavanaugh's "stolen and angry" Democratic Party.
"The voice of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against cruel and unguarded tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wellling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "sustained subsistence and rage" democratic party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before Congress on Thursday, strong and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's claim that he had sexually assaulted several decades ago while they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed hearing of her charges.
The president said on Saturday that "the Americans saw the beauty, quality and courage" Kavanaugh that day.
"The vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is the vote for the confirmation of one of the most comprehensive legal concepts of our time, a lawyer with great achievements in public service," a group of contributors in West Virginia said.
The president drew attention to the appointment of Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of the Republican outcome of the elections in the middle of the mandate.
"Five weeks of the most important choices in our lives.
Although I'm not candidate myself, I'm actually candidateing," he said.
"That's why I fight all over for great candidates."
The trumpet claims that democracies are trying to "oppose and stop."
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday, the High Commissioner of the Republican Party for CNN said.
Hundreds have lost their lives in Indonesian earthquake and tsunamis, and the number continues to grow.
At least 384 people died, many of them gathered with huge waves that hit the beaches, when large earthquakes and tsunamis struck the island of Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for the festival on the beach in the city of Pala on Friday when the waves hit the coast in the morning, bringing many to death and destroying everything they had found their way.
Cunami succeeded after a 7.5 earthquake.
"When the danger from tsunamis was announced yesterday, people still took their jobs on the beach and did not run away immediately, and they found themselves," Sutopo Purwo Nugroh, a portopol of Indonesian disaster management agency, said in address in Jakarti.
"Cunami didn't come alone, he carried cars, balloons, houses, he hit everything on the ground," Nugro said, adding that he traveled through the open sea at 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) before he hit the coast.
Some people fell on trees and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people are evacuated to 24 centers in the city of Palau.
Air photographs, issued by the disaster agency, show the number of destroyed buildings and shops, damaged and damaged bridges, and the area around the water.
The promotions continued to strike the city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes struck an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) reported that the energy of large earthquakes on Friday was 200 times more than the nuclear bomb power dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geographical position of the city, located on the edge of a long, narrow line, increased the force of tsunamis, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "a surplus" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, malls and hotels had been destroyed.
Several victims were found under the ruins of destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said that the victims and the damage could be greater than 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in the area of Dodrea, which is near the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication "was completely disconnected without any information" from Dondre, Nugro said.
"More than 300,000 people live here," said the Red Cross in the press, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the endangered areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticized for not reporting that the tsunami hit Palau, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
Amateur records shared on social networks show men on the top floor who are people on the street under panic warning of coming tsunamis.
Within a few minutes, the wall of the water hit the coast, carrying its buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the video immediately.
Landjotres and tsunamis have caused a lack of electricity that has cut off communication about Palu, causing the rescue efforts of the authorities to fail.
The military started sending heavy aircraft with humanitarian aid from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the evacuations still needed food and other basic needs.
The city airport is reopened only for humanitarian flights and will be closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo ordered a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of Indonesian tsunami victims increased by over 800.
It's so bad.
Although the staff of the World Vision organisation must have arrived from Dondree in Pala, where employees were located in the rooms raised in the office yard, they witnessed the signs of the explosion on the way, said Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's so bad.
Even when relief groups began to take the first steps in mitigating disasters, the complaint was that foreign high-qualified humanitarian workers were not allowed to travel to Pala.
According to Indonesian regulations, the impact of foreign resources, goods and people is only possible if the place of disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the Ukrainian level," said Aulia Ariani, a portopol of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'OK, this is a national disaster', we will be open for international assistance, but this status is not yet declared."
As the second night of earthquakes and tsunamis falls on Pala, friends and family of missing ones still hope that their loved ones will be miraculously saved and that their thrilling story in this natural disaster will be reduced.
On Saturday, the boy was pulled out of the canal.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the debris next to her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subbandon, a trainer of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two missing paraglideres of Asian games that were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
The other prisoners in Roa Roa's hotel, including Mr. Mandage, were his students.
"As an old paraglyzing member of the team I carry my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls how hours after the news of the destruction of Roa Roa's hotel spread across the halls of the paraglider suddenly sent whatsApp messages to the competitors in Palu who participated in the festival on the beach.
However, his messages had only one green flower, instead of two blue flowers.
"I think that means the messages are not delivered," he said.
The thieves took $26,750 to fill the banks in the Newport on the Level
On Friday morning, police reports in Newport stole $26,750 from Brick's worker who filled the banknotes in Newport on the Level.
The driver of the car was empty in a fun complex and prepared to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the release.
While he was busy, the other man "traveled behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be delivered.
The Witnesses saw more suspects running away from the scene, standing in the press, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
All who have any information about their identity should contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Reper My Change in Ye
Reper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Publishing a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "It will be known in advance as Kanye West."
West (41) has been known for some time under the Y nickname and used the name for the title of his eight album, which was published in June.
Until the change came before his event at the Saturday Night Live show, where the promotion of his new Yangi album is expected.
He replaced the singer Arian Grande who rejected the "emotional reasons", said the author of the show.
In addition to the shortcoming of his current professional name, West has previously said that this word has religious significance for him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'ti'," said West earlier this year while discussing the title of the album with the radio director Big Boye.
"So it's you, it's me, it's us.
She was born from Kanye, which means only Ye – which is the reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more reflective of what we are."
He's one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West's associate, JAY-Z, also used versions with or without quotes and big words.
AMLO in Mexico swears he won't use the army against civilians
The elected president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, swore that he would never use the military force against civilians as the country nears its fifteenth anniversary of the war against the students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday that "he will never use the army to crush the Mexican people."
The military fired at a peaceful demonstration on the market on 2 October 1968, killing even 300 people during the time the left-wing student movement took place in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those studying and opening up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of access to education for young people in criminal gangs.
The United States should double the financing of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the cost of research in this field, said the investor and the artist's artist's Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments came after various parts of the American authorities published an announcement on artificial intelligence, although the United States does not have a formal strategy in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China has announced its plan: their goal is to be the first in the domain of innovation of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"The bilateral budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, considering that all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are looking for a new experiment in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The double funds could double the chances that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will occur in the United States, Lee said in an interview for the CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "Supersle Art Intelligence: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Council" published the publishing house Hughton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the executive director of the Sinovation Ventures company, who has invested in one of the most important companies of art intelligence in China, Face+.
He was in the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University on the art intelligence system that proved to be higher than the most ranked American Othello player, and later he was executive director at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese border Google.
Lee gave recognition to former US government technological competitions such as the Robotics Challenge Agency for Advanced Defense Research Projects and asked when they planned the next competitions to be identified by future spectators.
Researchers in the United States often have to make huge efforts to get government subsidies, Lee said.
"We're not taking China's academic leaders, they're doing corporations," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have employed great individuals from the university in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policies could also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think it should automatically offer green cards to doctors in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued its plan to develop the artistic intelligence of the new generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Science grants grants to people in academic institutions the same way as the National Educational Foundation and other government organisations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year in the United States, the Defence Division formed the Community Centre for Art Intelligence which seeks to involve partners from industry and academic communities, and White House announced the formation of the Selection Committee for Art Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of two billion dollars for an initiative under the name AI Next.
As regards the National Educational Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in researching artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the American legislation which sought to form the Commission's national security for artistic intelligence for months is not taking over.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on the change in the name of the country
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name in the "Northern Republic of Macedonia", a step that would resolve a multi-year dispute with Greece blocking their membership in the European Union and NATO Union.
Greece, which has a territory under the name of Macedonia, claims that the name of their northern neighbour represents the ownership of its territory and has imposed a promise on their entry into NATO and the EU.
Two governments reached an agreement on a proposed name in June, but nationalist opponents claim that this could jeopardize the ethnic identity of the majority of the celebration in Macedonia.
President Dr. Ivanov said he would not vote on the referendum, and the boycott campaign asked whether the referendum would go out at least 50 per cent, which would be necessary for the referendum to be important.
The question on the voting list was, "Are you for NATO membership and the EU with agreement with Greece?"
Representatives of the change of names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, claim that this price, which Macedonia, one of the countries, suffered from the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth paying for entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonians, to be able to live freely within the European Union because that means a safer life for all of us," said Oliver Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament stated that they would be led by the vote and that the outcome would be decisive.
To change the title, a double majority in Parliament would be needed.
The State Electoral Commission stated that there was no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, the output was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of the voters went to the elections.
"I've come to vote for my children, it's our place in Europe," said Díose Tanevski (62), a voter in Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško voted in the Macedonian referendum on change of names, which could open their way to membership in the NATO Union and the European Union, in Strucica, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
Before the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small bin and pulled the chairs in front of the tent that had been torn by those who would fight the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to participate in raising heads, not at the last door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor, but a proud country.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the European community."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership will be brought to Macedonia before the necessary investment that is more than 20 per cent of the unemployment rate.
"I believe that the majority will vote 'for' because it is more than 80 percent of our population for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after listing.
He said the result "for" would be "the certainty of our future."
A survey published on Monday at the Macedonian Institute for Political Research says it will take part in the referendum between 30 and 43% of the voters – which is under the necessary headings.
According to a second survey conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they'd vote "for."
A 50 per cent plus one vote is required for the referendum to be successful.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first serious hit on the Western Government since it came to power last May.
See: Player Manchester City Sergio Aguero passes through a wide range of Bridgeton defenses and reaches the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to win the 2,0 Manchester City against Brighton at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It was very easy when Aguero got naked in 65 minutes.
Argentinian attacker got a ball in the middle of the ground at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three defense players Brighton before he found himself in the open field.
Aguera then surrounded three greens.
He ran around a defense player and was faster than a few more on the edge of the bridge.
Then he added it to the left, finding Sterling.
The English attacker used his first shot in the criminal space to return the Aguere ball, which was dominated by the Golman Brighton Matthew Ryan at the right side of the network.
"Aguero had some foot problems," said coach Pep Guardian to reporters.
"We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's right.
We're glad he got naked at that moment."
But Sterling was the one who gave the skyscrapers the initial priority in the Premier League.
He got naked in 29 minutes.
In that action, Aguero got a ball deep in Brighton's part of the field.
Greatly added Leroy Sane on the left side.
Sane touched her several times before sending Sterling to the floor.
The skyscraper threw a ball into the net before he got out of the field.
The city is fighting against the Hoffeneheims in the group phase of the League Championship at 12:55 on Thursday at the Rhine-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a game without a competitive spirit against Rockies.
Since the Nationals were eliminated in the elimination game, there was no reason to insist on another party.
But competition-based Scherzer hopes to take a position on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if they are Rockiesi, who have a game of advantage over Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, still playing.
Rockies at least have a direct pass due to the victory of 5:2 against the Nationals on Friday, but still trying to win the first title in the league.
"Although we don't play for anything, at least we can go out on the ground knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver will be likely at the highest level in relation to all the other years.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in these conditions?"
Nationals still need to publish the initial team on Sunday, but they're obviously willing to let Scherzer drop in that situation.
Scherzer, who would be 34 times to start the game, trained on Thursday and will be fired on Sunday when he's usually resting.
The right side of Washington runs 18:7 this season for the average wounds deserved from 2,53, 300 stikats in 220 2/3 inches.
Trump held a meeting in West Virginia.
The president briefly turned his attention to the situation around the election of his candidate for the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of the Republican exit to elections in half of the mandate.
"Everything we've done will be on the cat in November.
We're five weeks from the most important choices in our lives.
These are one of the great, great – although I did not actually apply for a candidate because I fight for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, "You see these terrible, terrible groups of radical democracies, that's happening right now.
And they're determined to return power by using all possible means, see evil, dirty games.
It does not matter to him who will hurt, who will lose himself in order to gain power and control, power and control are what they want, and We will not give them.
Democrats, he said, are in the mission of "repression and opposition."
"And you've seen it in the past four days," he said, calling Democrats "haul, evil, evil and unfair."
He informed the democratic senator and member of the Senate Justice Commission, Diane Feinstein, on behalf of which moved the public to vote.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leave the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting. It was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Laburist Party no longer accepts different positions.
It's abnormal to those who express their views.
When the Moments activists in my local range voted to censor me, I wasn't even surprised.
In the meantime, I am the last of the members of the lab who have been told that they have not been welcome, and all because we have reached our own opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censors criticized me for not joining Jeremy Corby.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, it is ironic that these are similar problems that Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
The announcement from a border meeting of a laboratory party in Nottingham East, held on Friday, "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During the eight years I spent as a local laboratory member of Parliament, the Friday evening meetings were mostly just like that.
Unfortunately, the tone of many meetings today is not so and the promise of "lover, lower" politics has long been forgotten, and the question is whether it ever was.
It has become even more evident that different opinions do not tolerate in the laboratory party and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the leaders of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues whom I believed to share similar political positions began to expect me to make the 180-step rounds and take the positions I would never have agreed with otherwise, whether it was a matter of national security or the single market of the European Union.
Always when I speak publicly – and it doesn’t matter what I say – it’s followed by social networks abuse, party withdrawal calls, political centre sentences, and tells me that I shouldn’t be in the lab party.
And that's not just what happens to me.
On the contrary, I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues because comments directed to me are mainly political nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and the decision of my colleague who carries with her daily sexist or racist abuses, but she doesn't withdraw.
One of my greatest frustrations during this time of politics is how these levels of injury have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the lab party should have its culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer parties that accept different views and every vote of disbelief or change of the rules of the party's selection.
I've got a lot of advice and the last two years, they've told me to blow my head, be less loud, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I got involved in politics.
Since I joined the Laburist Party 32 years ago, as an abbreviated government of Prime Minister Thatcher, because my primary school student literally ran away, I have been trying to convince myself that better public services to those who are most needed were as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never covered my policy, including the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused by my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday I would like to point out that, when the country comes to Brexit that will threaten households, jobs and our public services, I don't understand why someone would lose time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the lab party.
But the main message that I have is not directed to Momentum in Nottingham, but to the voters in my selection unit, whether they are members of the lab party or not: I am proud to serve you and promise you that I will not prevent my threat of removal from the party or political jokes to act in a way that I think is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr found on top
Two late attempts may have even revealed the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr has brought a deserved victory in this exciting game of the day at Tennt's Prime Minister League.
Now they're on top of the table, the only undamaged by ten teams
In the end, the domestic team won thanks to the superior defense, as well as a large number of the chances that were used, and trainer Peter Murchie had reason for satisfaction.
"We're already tested in the games, and we're still not broken, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Air all honor, they used their opportunities better than us."
Try Grant Nadersona in 14 minutes, which transformed Frazier Climo, gave Ayru the advantage, but it was a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who the Warriors let to play, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the digital advantage and Jason Baggot caught an unconverted attempt.
Climo has increased Ayra's leadership before, just before the half-hour, he has managed to turn the only attempt into a hit for the result of 17:5 for Ay's half-time.
But Melrose's second half-time started well and tried Patrick Anderson, who turned Baggot, reduced leadership to five points.
Then came a long break due to the serious injuries of Ruaridha Knott, which were removed on the noses, and Ayr continued to increase the advantage of trying Stafford McDowall, who turned Climo.
Captain Ayra's replacement, Blair Macpherson, then got a yellow card, and Melrose re-uses the digital overture with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvin, after a period of heavy pressure.
However, the landlords returned and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for a faol over Climus without a ball. MacPherson reached a touch down with a penalty drawing behind Ayr's incoming molluscs.
Climo turned, as it did almost from the beginning of the course, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's strike in the prison space and sent Gregor Henry's wing for five attempts at home.
The star series Still game is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
The star of the Still game series, Ford Kieran, is ready to go to the supplier industry after learning that he is appointed director of licensed restaurants.
Fifty-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the BBC popular series for which he writes a scenario and plays with his longtime partner in comedys, Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the next nine seasons would be the last in the series and Kiernan seems to be planning a life after Craiglunga.
According to the official record, he is the director of the company Affymorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the news, although the source of the Scottish Sun newspaper insisted that Kiernan wants to be involved in the "increasing restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no way out of the sea, hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
The sailors patrol the seabed in La Paz.
In public buildings, the Oceanskopval flag is being vibrated.
Sea base from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are marked by the slogan: "We have the right to the sea.
Returning to the sea is our obligation."
The area of the capital of Bolivia is still a strong memory of the coast that has been lost in the use of Chile in the bloody waters of natural resources in the 1990s – as well as the quest to relocate the Pacific again.
These hopes may be the biggest in the past few decades, while Bolivia is expecting the International Court of Justice for the first five years after the hearing.
"Bolivia has caught the flag, in the spirit of unity and prosperity, and of course expects a positive outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomats.
Many Bolivians will observe the trial of the international court of justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will judge for the benefit of Bolivia and claim that, after decades of Greek negotiations – Chile must agree to negotiations on providing Bolivia with a sovereign exit to the sea.
Here Morales, the charismatic Bolivian president of the home-based family, who is facing a controversial fight for the re-election next year, also has a great role to play when it comes to the judgment that will be delivered on Monday.
"We're very close to the return to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide for Bolivia, and that it will change little if it decides.
The United Nations body with its seat in the Netherlands is not able to assign Chilean territory and has claimed that it will not decide on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment is pronounced only six months after the last arguments have been heard indicates that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zarate, Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of making progress in the Bolivian case, the last four years may have taken him back.
"The problem of sea exits has taken over the current Bolivian authorities," Zarate said.
Morales' warbourous rhetoric killed the rest of Chilean's good will, he was honest.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate for one moment, but it will be very difficult to maintain these negotiations after this.
These two countries have not been replaced by ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision is unusual.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "a unique opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and the chance to "put a point on 139 years of non-reliance on mutual satisfaction," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – another of the most popular presidents of Latin America – is using the question of going to sea as a political trap.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to leave the Pacific," he added.
"The trial is an opportunity to realize that we need to go through the past."
North Korea says it won't be until they can't trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people will not kill nuclear weapons until they believe in Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to respect the promises of dates during the summit in Singapore between the opposing leaders.
His comments came at a time when U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompey seemed to be on the border to reopen the nuclear negotiations, more than three months after Singapore and a meeting with Kim Jong One from North Korea.
Ri says it's just empty dreams that the continued sanctions and opposition to the US declaration that the Korean War is ever to cast North Korea on its knees.
Washington is not ready to agree with the declaration until Pyongyang makes significant steps towards disarmament.
And Kim and American President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, the government is generally skeptical when it is about the seriousness of Pjong's withdrawal from the nuclear arsenal that the country is likely to see as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongjang next month to prepare another Kima and Trump summit.
The most recent line of giant hats that you will soon see in the nearest shopping street
If you want to increase the collection of hats or completely lock the sun, you're on the right place.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of huge hats on their spring and summer 2019 magazines.
The super-actual hats have won the Instagram this summer, and these designers have shown their impressive creations in modern letters.
The most striking Valentine's piece was a super-state hat with a wide pernadous area that had broken the heads of the model.
Among the other glamorous additions, there were rubies with precious stones, magic hats, and even pineapples, but their intentions are not to keep your head from cold.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of strange masks, and that was exactly at the time of the Night of the Witch.
Many of the charmed masks had noses, and they looked more like Hannibal Lecter than to high fashion.
One creature looked like a spindle with a diaspora and a mask, and the other reminded of a cornet with a frozen ice cream.
And if you are among those who follow the right course, you will surely be successful.
Those who follow the fashions predict that huge cuts could be found on nearby trading streets.
The giant hats came after "La Bombe", a broken hat with two feet of two feet that have been seen on many stars, from Rihanne to Emily Rattakowski.
A cult brand that invented this very ineffective hat that was passed through social networks, sent another great creation — a fragile beach bag that was almost as big as the model it wore.
Zagasitonandjast bag of raffins and white leather gloves was drawn up in detail by Jacquemus La Riviera collection for spring and summer 2019 at the Paris Week of Fashion.
The famous styleist Luke Armitage told the FEMAIL: "I expect great shadows and beach bags to reach the store in the next year, since the designer left such a huge impression would be difficult to ignore the demand for predimensioned fashion supplements."
John Edward: Knowing the language is of key importance to citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland can be praised for outstanding academic achievements, and this has continued in 2018 with a new set of outstanding results on studies, which is further enhanced by individual and collective achievements in sports, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, this school, which represents the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), is trying to provide the best level of service to its students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further education, selected careers and a place in society of citizens of the world.
As a educational sector that can think and implement its own learning plan and program, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable choice subjects of the school.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language that he can understand, that's what his head is.
If you talk to him in his tongue, it's his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build good relations and trust with people from other countries.
Judging by the results of this year's survey, we see that languages are at the top of the league table, with the highest transitional estimates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who learned foreign languages received an A rating at the final secondary school exam.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students received an A rating from the Mandarin language at the final exam in the secondary school, while 72 percent of those who teach German, 69 percent of those who teach French, and 63 percent of those who teach Spanish, also received an A rating.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as key skills that will undoubtedly be needed for children and young people in the future.
Languages, as election items, are now treated in the same way as STEM objects (natural science, technology, machinery and mathematics) and in programmes of independent schools, and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that in 17 percent of the reason employers have indicated the difficulties of filling jobs is just the least of those who know language.
So knowing foreign languages becomes increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
In addition to all the potential jobs for which foreign language is needed, this skill is necessary in the world of globalization.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if he knows another language, he will have a real advantage in the future because it's a skill for the rest of his life.
The art of direct communication with people from foreign countries will automatically place a person who speaks more languages in front of competition.
According to YouGo's survey of more than 4,000 Britanics in 2013, 75 percent did not know to speak another language well enough to conduct a conversation, while French was the only language spoken by two-digit percent, 15 percent.
That's why investing in learning foreign languages is important to children today.
Learning more languages, especially those who use the economy in development, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
Every school in Scotland is different when it comes to language learning.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for Britain by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interests are, there will always be several languages that will be able to choose from in independent schools, with skilled training personnel in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to ensuring a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need for success, whatever they may expect in the future.
At this time, there can be no denying that in the global business environment, languages have a key meaning for the future of the country, so that this must also be reflected in education.
Modern languages should certainly be considered "International communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You need to do it.
John Edwards is director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron is going to debide for Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The waiting is soon over for fans who want to see LeBron James's first appearance for Los Angeles Lakers.
Trainer Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James will play Sunday in the pre-session match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he still doesn't know how many minutes he'll play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official website of Lakers.
Reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, was likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training this week, James asked about plans in six games during President Lakers.
"In this stage my careers are not necessary for me to prepare for the pre-seasonal games," he said.
Trompo collection in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump started a series of re-elections in Wheeling, West Virginia tonight.
This is the first of the five Trump's banned groups in the following week, including visiting friendly facilities such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While his vote is pending for the completion of the post in the Supreme Court, Trump plans to increase support in the upcoming elections in the medium term because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress after the vote in November.
When's Trump's collection in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's collection in Wheeling, West Virginia is banned for seven hours after sunrise, on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch the Trump's collection in West Virginia under the transfer of life to YouTube.
The trumpet will probably talk about hearings this week regarding the appointment of Bretta Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court in which the charges for sexual harassment have been filed, and the expected vote in the Senate has been postponed for seven days until the FBI is conducting the investigation.
But the transitional objective of this series of events is to help the Republicans achieve better results in the elections in November.
Thus, President Trupa's campaign said that this week's groups are continuing to "give energy to volunteers and delegates while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of the people they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so key part of his agenda that the president will travel to as many countries as possible as we enter the pre-election campaign season," he said to Reuters Portparol Trump's campaign that he refused to introduce.
Entitled to Westbanko Arena in Wheeling, the evening group could gather delegates from "Ohia and Pennsylvania and draw attention to the media from Pittsburgh", reports West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, the second time this month, Trump will visit West Virginia, the country in which he won more than 40 percent points in 2016.
The trumpet is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the Senate in West Virginia, who is not well placed in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president came here to try to raise his ranking in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters report.
Ryder Buy 2018.: The US team showed the fight to keep hope before individual matches on Sunday
After three single sessions, Thursday afternoons may be exactly what was needed by this Ryder tap.
It's quite smart to have a completely invented concept in sport, but one of the players really believe in it, especially in competitions like this.
What do they think, when he's in trouble?
"There were six points, and now four, so it can be said that it's on our side now," Jordan Spieth said on his way.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four will be more, with another twelve in the game.
Americans, as Spieth says, still believe they have some wind in their wings, and there are a lot of what they provide encouragement, between the rest of Spietha and Justin Thomas who played together every day and each took three points from the possible four.
Spieth was great from the first to the last strike and led his example.
The winners of the celebration became more and more loud during his rounds to finally play a key hit for the unsolved result in the fourth match when he and Thomas stayed for two after two.
His final hit with a 15-pound sword was expected by a similar call, which reflects the belief that the American team has hope.
"You just have to give everything out of yourself and take care of your sword," said Spieth.
That's all that's left with these players now.
18 holes that can bring glory.
The only players with multiple points from Spietha and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the principal story of Ryder's purchase.
It's unusual, but an infamous European couple got all four swords and games without mistakes.
"Molywood" was the only couple who didn't play the gods of the strike on Saturday afternoon, and they ran away on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The game they have shown so far has also shown the way they exchange energy with the botanical audiences have established them in the position of the main favorites on Sunday and no more popular players from Fleetwood or Molinary could take the potential European win while the sun sets on the Le Golf National field.
The best would be both at the same time on different holes.
However, it is still early to talk about European celebration.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ruled Sergey Garcija, a hero game with four volts that morning when he played in pairs with Alex Noren.
One divine strike and two doubles in the first nine holes buried Spain and Sweden in a hole from which they have never succeeded in finding any source.
However, on Sunday no one can help you get out of your hole.
The game with four volts and four is so fascinating to watch the approach due to interaction between couples, advice that they give and that they do not give, and the way the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has so far played better as a team and has a great advantage before the final day, but this session has shown four times that the US team has a desire to fight in which some have doubted, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe runs 10:6 before the last day of Ryder shop
Europe in the last Ryder will enter with a significant premise, since after Saturday's games in the game with four volts and four of the four won the U.S. preference from 10:6.
The inspired couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, first led two victories over the undisputed Tiger Woods, with an even greater result on the territory of the Le Golf National Club on four points.
European Thomas Bjorn in the struggle to return the trophies that lost in the Hazeltine golf club two years ago, dominated the inaccurate Americans in the morning game with four volts and won the 3:1 series.
The United States has made a major obstacle to the tournament of four, winning two swords, but they have not been able to reduce the remainder.
Jim Furyka's team has to win eight points in 12 single matches a week to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood is the first European debiter who won four points in line, while he and Molinari, called Mollywood after a fantastic weekend, only the second couple in the history of Ryder's Cup who won four points in the first four matches.
After crossing Woods and Patrick Reed in the game with four volts, they were well-compounded and dominated by the drowned Woods and American debitant Bryson Dechambeau with even worse 5:4.
Woods, who was spooked by two swords on Saturday, was flashing at the moment, but now he lost 19 of the 29 swords in the game with four balls and four and seven rounds.
Justin Rose, who retired during the morning game with four volts, returned his partner Henrik Stanson to the tournament on Thursday and suffered defeat 2:1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the first and third of the world.
Europe, however, did not everything follow the plan of this pleasant winter in the southwestern part of Paris.
The three-year winner of the major tournament Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a goal for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They chose the victory of 2:1 over Jonah Rahm and Ian Poulter in the game with four volts, to return and win Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4:3 in the squares, after they lost the first two holes.
Only two times in the history of Ryder's buy some team came back after the rest of the four points before each match, although Fury's side is a defense party, with an unsolved result to keep the trophies.
However, after two days in another place, it seems that they could not perform the opposite attack on Sunday.
North Korea commands "no speech" on one-sided disarmament unless it is trusted
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister said to the United Nations that the extension of the sanctions would result in its distrust in the United States and that in such circumstances the country would not be unilaterally disposed of of its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Hu said at the UN General Assembly last year that North Korea has taken "significant measures to show good will", such as the interruption of nuclear and rocket testing, the detonation of nuclear policy and the promise that nuclear weapons and nuclear technology will not be multiplied.
"However, there are no corresponding reactions to the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there will be no word that we will be confused once and for all."
Although Ri repeated known allegations of North Korea against Washington's "progressed" approach to denuclearization by which North Korea would be rewarded for progressive steps, the meaning of his statement was that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization from the game as Pjonjang did earlier.
Ri called for a joint statement by Kim Jong Una and Donald Trump at the first meeting held between the current US President and North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim promised to work on "the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump pledged to provide North Korea with security guarantees.
North Korea seeks the formal end of the Korean War (1950-53), but the United States has announced that Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington also listened to calls to ease international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States will not give up 'decollarization first of all' and increase the level of pressure on sanctions in order to achieve their goal, even against 'declaring the end of the war'," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can drop us on our knees is the empty dreams of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that advanced sanctions produce our mistrust."
Ri didn't mention plans for the second summit between Kima and Trump that the American leader spoke to the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister held three meetings between Kima and South Korean leader Moon Jae-ina in the past five months and added: "If we negotiate this issue about denuclearization with South Korea, rather than with the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not come into such an unexplained position."
However, the tone of Riojog's speech was dramatically different from last year's, when at the UN General Assembly he said that the shooting of American land rockets in North Korea was inevitable after "Mr. Zli President" Trump called Kim "the rocket" on the suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations Tromp, which last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, commended Kima for her courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much more must be done and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea does not carry out denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't set a time frame for this, saying, "If necessary, let it last two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongjang for the steps they have taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council's sanctions must continue to be strict and without being allowed to be carried out until complete, final, confirmed denuclearization."
The Security Council unanimously supported the sanctions against North Korea applicable since 2006, in an attempt to make it impossible to finance the programme of nuclear and ballistic missiles in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Rij van Generale of the UN and then said he would visit Pyongjang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has not gone well.
In July he left Pyongyang with the words that progress was made, and North Korea condemned him after only a few hours because of the "gangster demands".
North Korea, at a meeting with Moon this month, promised to decompose the rocket polygon as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took the "responsible measure".
He said Kim told him that "responsive measures" that required security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students are going to a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to make students dream more dreams in an effort to heal the increasingly popular cat culture of learning "all night with the help of caffeine".
One academic observed that students of the leading university in the world are often unaware of their basic concerns.
Charles Czeisler, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and hospital specialist Brigham and Women's, created a course for which he considers the only type in the United States.
The inspiration to start this course was given after a speech that had a bearing on the impact of a lack of sleep on learning.
"At last a girl came to me and said, 'Why are you telling me this just now, in my retirement year?'
She said that no one ever told her how important the dream was – which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which this year is the first time for students, provides the basis for how good sleep habits contribute to better academic and sports outcomes, as well as to improve their overall situation.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University of Health Services, said the university decided to introduce a course after it was observed that students had suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
A single course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, the picture of the room in the student's home and students should click on a school for coffee, teasing, pies and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as about the impact of lack of sleep on the athletic performance and the meaning of the routines before sleeping.
In the second part, participants are told how long-term sleep deficiency can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then the map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We're aware that it won't change the behavior of the students right now.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know what health effects it has on smoking cigarettes," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride because of the "beautiful night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students have led to a lack of sleep to become more and more problems.
A sufficient amount of sleep, and that quality, should be the "silent weapon" of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even against higher kilograms, since the result of a lack of sleep goes into the cooling system, so they are always hungry.
Raymond So, a nine-year-old student of chemistry and physical biology from California, helped Professor Czeisler to figure out a course after he attended one of his lectures during his first year at Harvard last year.
He says that this course opened his eyes and inspired him to lean on his entire campaign for survival.
It is hoped that the next step is that all postgraduate students are asked to pass a similar study programme before the entry into force of the competition institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting up the alarm on sleep and wake-up times and that they take account of the harmful effects of the "white light" that emits electronic screens and LED lighting and can interfere with the circadian rhythm, and that also leads to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menging gol is the defeat of Gerarrd's team
The Rangers experienced another depressive defeat in the guests when Dolly Menga sent a growing team of Steven Gerard to the battle of 1:0 from Livingstone.
The team of Ibrox wanted to win the first win in the guests after the February triumph from 4:1 in St. Johnstone, but the team of Gary Holt hired Gerard as the second manager only in 18 matches, leaving his team eight points behind the missing leaders of the Ladbrokes Premier League, Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes ago, and the uninspired state of Rangers never came close to comparison.
While Rangers are now burning in six places, Livingston fell on the third floor, and the Hibernias are just because of the difference.
Rangers could face additional problems after the linear judge Calum Spence had to show his help when he was shot by some object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that stopped Ayr and made her play in the semifinal Bethfred.
On the other hand, Holt arranged for the same eleven Livingstone players who took the Hearts point last week and would be thrilled by the way his well-equipped team pressed opponents on every step.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession of the ball, but Livingston used his time better with the ball.
It was a little missing to reach the goal just two minutes after Menga first added to the empty space sent Scott Pittman to the Allan McGregor Gol, but the middle player of the field missed a great chance and jumped near the goal.
The profound free strike of Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halketta, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow just managed to sneak near the corner, the end of the statue.
The Rangers managed to take control, but their game eventually gave more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos, of course, thought he was supposed to get a pen in 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless cooperated, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian request.
The Rangers only made two hits on the floor in the first half of the first century, but the former Golman Ibrox, Liam Kelly, escaped the attack on Lassane Coulibaly's head and stole the shoe that led Ovie Ejaria.
Although the first goal of Livingstone in 34 minutes may not have reflected the real relationship of power during the game, no one can deny that he was deserved, if not for anything else, then because of his hard work.
Rangers couldn't choose with the deep free strike of Jacobs again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Mengo for a simple finish.
Gerard responded to the interruption of the introduction of Ryan Kent instead of Coulibaly, and this replacement almost gave the outcome when the wing player employed Morales, but impressive Kelly touched his line and blocked him.
Livingston, however, continued to point out guests to play exactly the way it fits them, with long balls of Lithgo and Halketta.
Holt's team had the chance to increase the advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor was holding on and defending Jacobs' attack so that then Lithgow would send a bullet out of his head.
The replacement player Rangers, Glenn Middleton, at the end of the game, asked for another pen when he joined Jacobs, but Thomson didn't react again.
Almanah: Director of Geiger's Count
And now, the station from our Sunday Morning German: September 30, 1882, today at today's date 136 years ago... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity, an exception that will in time become a device known as Geiger's browser.
Besides being one of the main obstacles to science, Geiger's journalist has his place in the pop culture, such as in the 1950's "Call Coronada" film, in which the amazing Cuban scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, played:
A man says, "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's Geiger's number, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put those audiences, you can hear the effects of atoms using radioactivity in minerals."
Evans said, "Yes, that's it!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the exception that bears his name is still alive.
A new vaccine against cancer could teach the immune system to "see" criminal cells
A new vaccine against cancer could teach the immune system to "see" criminal cells and then kill them.
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize criminal cells during therapy
The procedure includes the administration of immunological cells from patients and their metabolism in the laboratory
They can then "see" protein that is common in many kinds of cancers, and then they re-inject.
The test vaccine has shown promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The cancer of an egg woman who received treatment with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize the harmful cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The procedure includes the introduction of immunological cells from patients, their transformation into the laboratory so that they can "see" protein HER2, and their re-injection.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American Institute for Small Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "helps growth of several types of carcinomas" including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
Similar access to immunological cells from patients and "learn" was the same as to target small cells was effective in treating one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West kept a tight talk on the support of Trump, wearing MAGA hats, after his event in the SNL issue.
He didn't have a good time.
Kanye West was a student at the Saturday Night Live show after a great event in which US President Donald Trump said he would apply in 2020.
After performing his third song called Ghost Town, and during the evening he wore a cap with the title "Make America the Great", he injured Democrats and once again spoke of his support to Trump.
"I talked to white people so many times that they said, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I'd have been moving from America for a long time," he said.
The SNL started the show with a sketch that played by Matt Damon and in which Hollywood stars scoffed at the witness of Britta Kavanaugh before the Senate Justice Commission regarding claims of sexual harassment Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it's not broadcast, the West speech record has been shared by Commissioner Chris Rock on social networks.
It's not clear whether Rock was trying to smile at West by putting the tape.
West also complained to the public that it was hard behind his neck because of the cap.
"They surrounded me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with that six on your head."
They've got me!
And then they say to me that I was born," he said according to the instructions of the Washington Examiner.
The West continued: "Do you want to see how it looks?" adds that "will have Superman's plague because that means you can't order me.
Try love."
His comments caused the public to exaggerate at least twice, and members of the SNL Emission Team were visiblely made, he transferred Variety, while one person who was present said, "This studio has completely disappeared."
The West came as a substitute for Arian Grande, whose former partner, reper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
The West has confused many by the execution of the song and the money it is broken into Perrier's bottle.
Westa supported the leader of the TPSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest souls: thank you for not being involved in the abuse."
But the director of Karen Hunt's show claimed that West was simply "what he really was and that it was absolutely beautiful".
"But I choose not to reward someone (such as I will buy his music or clothes or support his "art") for whom I believe he has raised a wider ideology that damages my society.
He's free.
And we're," she added.
Before the show, the reper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, saying that he will now "be previously known by the name of Kanye West".
He's not the first artist who changed his name and followed Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
colleague Reper Snoop Dogg called Snoop Lion, and of course the quiet music legend Prince has changed his name in symbol, and then in "the artist previously known as Prince".

The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor.
The star series "Games of the Past", Kit Harrington condemned toxic cat culture
Kit Harrington is known for his role in Jon Snow, who is a soft fighter in violent medieval fantasy, HBO series game history.
However, the actor (31) broke down on the stereotype of the hero's sword, saying that such roles on the screen mean that children are very often considered to be cruel in order to be respected.
In a statement for Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of the toxic cat culture in the time of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married a partner from the game of Leslie Rose (31), admitted that he had a "strong need" to forget about this problem.
"I personally suffer pretty much at the moment – what was wrong with the representation of men?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up when it comes to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be part of the responsibility for the spread of the toxic cat culture due to the appearance of figures representing men.
He went on, "What's born, and what's the thing?
What does this teach us on TV and on the streets why young people think they have to get involved in certain forms of male behavior?
I think it is, in fact, one of the main issues of our time – how do we change it?
Because obviously something went wrong for young people."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not agree to the presentation or series of the Games next summer, saying "he ended with war fields and horses".
From November, Kit will play in Sam Shepard True West, talking about the film producer and his brother, the robin.
The actor recently discovered that he thought it was what he met his wife, Rose, the best thing that happened in the game series.
"In this series I met my wife, so it can be said that she has given me a future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, a loving partner of Kitto's son Jon Snow in this fantastic series that won Emma's prize.
A couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslin's parents in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% rise in new cases
China reported a 14% drop in the number of new cases of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 82,000 people in the country have been hit, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were recorded only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases are transmitted through sexual relations, which is changed in relation to the previous state.
In the past, HIV spread rapidly to some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions infected with the virus.
However, the number of people who get HIV this way is almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living in China living with HIV and AIDS increased by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sexual relations is a hot problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been no longer considered illegal in China since 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT is very widespread.
Studies estimate that because of conservative perceptions in the country, 70–90% of men having sexual relations with men at the end of the stage of marriage with women.
The transmission of the virus is often due to the lack of appropriate sexual protection in such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to HIV medicines within the framework of a plan to address this problem.
Maxine Waters ignored the claim that one of her staff published data on Republican senators, condemning "dangerous lies" and "trust theories"
US Ambassador Maxine Waters has denied the claim that one of her staff has published personal data from three U.S. Republican senators on the websites of these legislators.
A Democrat messenger from Los Angeles claims that these claims are posted by experts and websites of the ultrasonic wing.
"Talk, lie, and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a post on Twitter.
The information published has reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of American Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatcha, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the network on Thursday and was published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate Commission on allegations of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court candidate, Bretta Kavanaugh.
The information was published in a few minutes after three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative web sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publication associated with the Waters office and published information about its staff member, Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely inaccurate and absolute lie," Waters continued.
"A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security are threatened by these false and indirect claims - is not in any way responsible for the disclosure of these information.
This unfounded claim is completely inaccurate and absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly raised the online court, which also issued the former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial goes white," Fleischer wrote.
"This states in conclusion that she does not have a temperature that is necessary for Congress members.
When he accuses someone of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
It's not supposed to be a joke.
He must not promulgate the motives of the prosecutor.
They must be calm and calm."
Fleischer evidently influenced the reaction of Waters to the criticisms of the democracy of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry to listen on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was asked to change Waters to the middle of the mandate, also announced via Twitter.
"Great thing if it's true," he threatened.
In his statement, Waters said her office warned "appropriate competent institutions and judicial authorities about these false claims".
"We'll make sure the beginners find out," she continued, "and they're in line with the law for all their actions that are unstable and dangerous to all my staff."
Review of Johnny English film again in action – a small spy family with Rowan Atkinson
It has already become a tradition to look for a subtitles about Brexit in every new film with a British theme, which can also be applied to this French follow-up of satirical action comedy about Johnny English – which started in 2003 with the creation of "Johnny English" and returned to the screen in 2011 with the following "Johnny English: born again".
Will ironic autosatry about how we're apparently useless to be a new export opportunity for the nation?
Whatever the case, bourgeois, imperfect Johnny English was given a new chance to discover something – in which his name is more than all of it that the word of a common comical creation is intended for a film-based audience whose English is not the mother tongue.
It's, of course, about a crazy secret agent who, despite the strange claims of the highest glamor, wears himself a little Clouseau, the Mister Bean's throne, and the ring of that boy who played only one note in the context of the theme melody of the "Chariots of Fire" at the 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony in London.
It was also originally based on a traveler and an international man entrusted with a great secret that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, leaving chaos behind him.
One or two of the newest scenes are good.
I liked it when Johnny English came to the helicopter dressed in the middle of the middle of the night's windmill, and when the knife rotor shortly cried about his cat.
Atkinson's talent for the physical comedy is obvious, but humor is perceived as weak and in a very strange way superior, especially now that "serious" film brands such as 007 and the Impossible Mission are self-evidently adding chemical elements.
I think it's about humor for children, not for adults, and for me, Johnny's adventures are not as inventive and developed as Atkinson's gegos in the form of non-films like Mr. Bean.
Now it's a very current theme that Great Britain is in serious problems.
Hacker was infiltrated into the British super-tank spy network, discovering the identity of all British agents in the field, to the shame of an agent on duty – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last cap in a full cup of water for the prime minister, the pumping and trained guy who is already living in complete hunger due to the fall of the political population: Emma Thomson has masterfully played this man-made character by the example of Theresa May, but the scenario is quite innocent.
Her intelligence consultants are informed that all active spies are compromised and that they will have to hire one of the retired.
And that means chubby Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at some remote station, but suddenly holds lessons about how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting gegos when English holds a spying academy in the way of the "School Hand" movie.
English quickly return to Whitehall on emergency instructions and to regroup it with an ex-Bugham impatient partner, who plays Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married to a man, married to a submarine commander whose energy and vocal role Vicki Pepperdine has been a little consumed.
So Batman and Robin are again serving the secret services of her Majesty and happily beautiful fatal wife, Ophelia Bulletov, who beat Olga Curylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the trap of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems: the corrupt Jason Volt, who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their dress of comics: destroyed in the conobars, they set fire to the elegant French restaurant, the real haos crossing on the Voltina luxury yacht, and English starts the right anarchy by trying to get to know the inner Voltine house using the audiences for virtual reality.
It is obvious that great effort has been put into this last sequence, but it has as much sympathetic and cheerful, complete film as it has been designed for children.
A pretty average quality.
Like other movies about Johnny English, I can't ask myself: can the British film industry imagine any role for Rowan Atkinson that would really show his talent?
Laburist party refuses to make a plan for the British to work four days a week and to be paid in five days
Jeremiah Corbin's Laburist Party will consider a radical plan for which the British would work four days a week, but were paid in five.
The party claims that the head of the company will transfer to workers the time it saves thanks to the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them another day of freedom.
This would be the way for employees to enjoy the three-day weekend – but they would still get the same pay.
Sources say this idea would "integrate" into the party's economic programme and plans to improve working conditions and workers' rights.
The transition to a four-day working week has approved the Syndical Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A high source from the Laburist Party said to Sunday Times: "It is expected that a new policy will be published before the end of the year.
This will not happen during the night, but a four-day working week is an ambition that fits into the party's approach to economic rebalancing for workers, as well as in the party's industrial strategy at all."
The Laburist Party would not be the first to approve such an idea because the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 pre-election campaign.
However, this ambition does not support the reading of the Laburist Party.
Portparol of the Laburist Party stated: "The four-day work week is not a party policy and the party is not considered".
The opposition's officer John McDonnell used the Laburist Party conference last week to expose his views of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power from "individual directors" and "professors" in municipal businesses.
The plans of the opposition officials also mean that current owners of the sector in water supply companies may not return their total investment because the labs could substitute "reveals" on the basis of perceived injustices.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in the company committees and to create inclusive own funds that would allocate 10 per cent of the company's value in the private sector to employees who are likely to collect annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy is talking about the 60-minute show on whether the FBI could change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Bretta Kavanaugh has raised a final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court at least seven days and raises the question whether the Bureau could indicate some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the "60-minute" issue reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I think so, of course," said Kennedy.
"Before hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges appeared, I asked, 'Did you do that?'
He was inconceivable, determined, undisputed."
But Senator Graham's voice seems confused.
"My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh has been formulated and there would be a need for a serious charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has rejected it energetically," added Graham, talking about Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whoever she calls it can't confirm it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Festival of the City of the World, and did he do anything that would reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will be the town of the city of the City of the World, an annual musical event with a truly impressive list of stars that will take place, as well as an impressive goal – to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizens' Festival will gather tens of thousands of people at the great grasslands Central Park that will not only enjoy the events of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real purpose of this event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival, held for the first time in 2012, is an extension of a global project against poverty, an international group that is struggling to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who will actively fight the same.
In order to get an event free card (except if you are not willing to pay for a VIP card), those who wanted to attend the concert had to do some tasks or "work", such as volunteering, sending e-mails to the world's leader, telephone calls, and any other meaningful way to increase their awareness of their goal – ending poverty.
But how successful has the project of a citizen of the world been with the rest of the 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts the right way to kill themselves to take over something, or just one more view of so-called "clipticism" – when people believe they have done something that will change the world by signing a petition on the Internet or tweeting?
Since 2011, citizens of the world's initiative have claimed that they have marked more than 19 million "actions" of their accessions, which have been committed to a number of different objectives.
They say these actions have been directed by world leaders to publish promises and political guidelines that are worth more than $37 billion and will affect lives than 2.25 billion people by the year 2030.
By the beginning of 2018, the group included 390 promises and announcements of proceeds from their actions, and at least $10 billion has already been allocated or collected.
The group estimates that the funds collected have already directly affected 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are the Power Shiran, the partnership of investors and producers from Great Britain who have promised to "help children grow in their full potential", promising that Ruandi will allocate $35 million to deal with the end of inflation in that country, after receiving more than 4700 tweets from the City of the World.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, as you are, we can make social injustice a historical fuse," said Ambassador Mocii Shrana, Tracey Ullman, who visited a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions called on Britain to improve the orphanage of mothers and children, the government announced that it would finance the project of the Power of Ashran, whose interventions would extend the lives of 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their page, "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
The people of the world say, "This will be a long and difficult path for us.
However, like all major steps for civil rights and anti-parity before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are just some of the artists who will take place at this year's event in New York, which will lead Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could "block" Russia in energy exports – Secretary of Internal Affairs
Washington can "how much it takes" use its Navy to prevent Russian energy exports to third markets, including the Middle East, found Ryan Zinke, the US Secretary of Internal Affairs, and transferred Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russia's engagement in Syria – namely, there is a legitimate government call – represents an excuse for researching new energy markets.
"I believe that it is the reason for what they want to sell energy in the Middle East, just as they do in Eastern Europe and the middle of southern Europe," he said.
And according to the official's statement, there are ways and means to solve this issue.
"The United States has the opportunity to ensure, together with our mariners, that maritime corridors remain open or, if necessary, block them in order to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke turned to the participants at an event where the organisation was the Association of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group called itself "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He made a deal with Washington's approach on relations with Russia and Iran, finding it to be the same thing.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is less and more involved in the use and replacement of fuel," he said, saying that Russia owns only one advert, and that its object depends on fossil fuels.
Statements are coming after the Trump's mission to increase exports of natural gas to Europe, which would replace Russia, which represents a far more favourable option for European consumers.
For this purpose, Trump's officials, including US President Donald Trumpa himself, are trying to kill Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" gas pipeline of the North River 2, which would have made Berlin a "compulsory" in Moscow.
Moscow has in many ways stressed that the North River 2 gas pipeline is worth 11 billion dollars and that the existing gas pipeline capacity needs to be doubled to 110 billion cubic metres, except a relative project.
The Kremlin argues that the reasons for the intense opposition of Washington to this project are purely economic nature and that this represents, for example, illegal competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of implementing pressure and that consumers should have a choice of suppliers," Russian Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with the American Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who was held in Moscow in September.
The U.S. State has challenged the German response that has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The lead organisation for industry in Germany, the German Industry Union (BDI), invited the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when some third country joins in our supply of energy," said Dieter Kempp, president of the German industry (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angele Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "think seriously" about the presidential candidate for 2020, said the state senator Massachusetts
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "give serious thought" to candidates for president after the next mid-year elections.
During a meeting at the city council in Holyoke City in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would think about candidates.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, and that includes a woman on top," she said, and transfers the source The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously think about candidates for president."
Warren called President Donald Trump during a meeting at the city council, saying he was "leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was called up for criticism of the Tromp and his candidate for the Supreme Court judge, Brett Kavanaugh.
In his tweet published on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, the results of the polls published on Thursday showed that most of the electoral body that voted for Warren did not think she should apply in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of voters who will probably vote in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be candidateed, according to a survey conducted by the Center for Political Research at the University of Suffolk/list Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidate.
The survey showed that there is greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidates, with 38 percent of voters supporting the potential candidate and 48 percent against the candidate.
The other voices of the order of democracy that were discussed within the meaning of their potential candidates in 2020 were former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin spoke about the PTSP Track Palina in support of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recruiting in September.
He was arrested and charged with family violence after an incident that occurred on Monday night
"What my son goes through, what goes through after his return, I can connect with what happens to other families who suffer the consequences of PTSP and the injuries our soldiers return with," said a press release to support President Donald Trumpu in the city of Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “a hot topic” and, speaking of his son and other war veterans, added“they return a little different, they return to stricter, they return to wondering if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots have done, and all the other members of the army have given to this country.”
He was arrested on Monday in the city of Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with violence in the family - assault on a woman's person, arresting the registration of violence in the family and possession of weapons under the authority of the opiate, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the police department of Wasilla.
18 countries, D.C. support the resolution of new asylum policies
Eighty countries and the Columbia District support a review of the new US policy that reduces asylum for victims fleeing from gangs or violence in the family.
Representatives from 18 countries and the District filed a friendly court report on Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers who oppose this policy, reports the NBC News.
Many names of prosecutors in Grace v. Sessions, which the American Union for Civil Liberties filed in August, have not been found against the federal police.
She said she had been abused by her partner "and violent members of his gang," but American officials rejected her asylum request on 20 July.
He's in prison in Texas.
State lawyers who support Grace explained how El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come in the United States, are facing a growing problem related to gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy rejected the 2014 Committee on Immigration Appeals, which allowed immigrants who do not own documents and fled from violence in the family to submit asylum applications.
The state prosecutor of the Columbia District, General Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new policy "determinates the decades of state, Union and international law."
"The federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of individual facts and circumstances, and that the chamber violates this principle in this way," says a friendly report.
Lawyers continue to report that the police that prevent immigrants from entering the US are causing damage to the US economy, and that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and "ensure the necessary labour force."
In June, State prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges in matters related to migrants to refrain from giving asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Azil is only available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear of belonging to a particular race, religion, nationality or social group or because of their political opinion," Sessions said in a statement on 11 June talking about politics.
The purpose of asylum was never to alleviate all problems, even serious problems that people around the world face every day.
The desperate efforts to save the city of Palu while the number of dead is doubled in search of survivors
The situation for survival is all worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, comforting her sick little boy at the center of evacuation in the abandoned city of Palu.
"Every minute emergency aid will be imported by the body.
The government has condemned clean water."
Residents return to their abandoned homes, overcrowded things trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals were devastated by earthquakes of 7.5 degrees.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, whose back and shoulders are broken, are located outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients are being helped outside because of continued severe strokes.
His eyes filled with tears as he told how he felt a strong earthquake that damaged the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"It wasn't time to save ourselves.
I think the ruins of the wall have pressed me," said Haris' agency Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city for marriage.
"I heard my wife crying for help and then quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of committing "violent acts of propaganda"
Seven days after the official Chinese newspaper published a statement on four pages in the U.S. daily thanks to the mutual benefit of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
American President Donald Trump responded on Wednesday to a paid addition of Chinese news from China Daily to Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after he accused China of joining the US Congress election on 6 November, which China does not.
The trumpet claim that Beijing is trying to get involved in the American elections indicates how American officials told Reuters, a new phase in the scaling campaign leading to Washington to make pressure on China.
And while it is customary for governments to publish declarations aimed at promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in the scalaring trade war where some of them increase import tariffs.
On the contrary, earlier Chinese tariffs in this trade war have been directed to exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supports the Trompo Republican Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador in China and earlier a longtime mayor of the state of Iowa, who is the main exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in a comment published in the weekly edition of the newspaper Des Moines Register, "now we double that violence by publishing propaganda ads in our free press."
"By slamming its propaganda, the government of China uses a valuable American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of print, plying a paid advertising in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, on the kitchen down the street here in Beijing, you will find a limited number of different opinions and you will not be able to see any real impact on the different views that people in China may have on the problem of the Chinese road, bearing in mind that the Chinese media are under the strong flag of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not mention what the news is doing.
Republicans reject women from voting in the light of the mid-year elections with the background of Kavanaugh, warning analysts
Analysts have warned that a large number of the most prominent Republicans who defend and stand with the candidates for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh, who face several allegations of alleged sexual assaults, will experience negative reactions, especially women, during the upcoming mid-year elections.
The emotions associated with this issue are very intense and most Republicans already show that they want to vote.
In these things there is no background," Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse, said in a newspaper article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he suspected that what Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arison) was in the last time would have asked the FBI's investigation to be enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - it won't forget tomorrow, nor in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and state speaker of the progressive movementOn group, said in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators called for "new arrivals!" during a demonstration in the Senate hall, while the Republicans who controlled the Justice Committee decided to investigate with the candidate Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, told Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be huge," said news reporter Stu Rothenberg, a fearless political analyst.
"People say it's already high, which is true.
But it could be higher, especially among undecided female voters in the suburbs and among young voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who do not like the president, they do not vote."
Even before the Ford's public testimony in which she filed a detailed complaint against the alleged sexual attack against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts were of the opinion that it could have a negative reaction if the Republicans were investigating the appointment.
"This has become a big mistake to the great old party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, transmitted the NBC News network earlier this week.
"It is not only about the Committee's vote or the final vote, nor about whether Kavanaugh will be a judge, it is also about the way the Republicans have solved this issue and how they have dealt with it," said the information channel Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Priority Group, who supports the democratic elections.
Yet, it seems that the Americans are even divided in respect of who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a slight tendency on the side of Kavanaugh.
The new YouGov survey shows that 41% of researchers are definitely or likely to believe Ford's testimony, while 35% said they definitely or probably trust Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that Kavanaugh thought he was probably or definitely lying during his testimony, while only 30% said that he thought the same thing about Fordov.
Following Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other person who has raised the charges, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford, in front of the Senate Justice Committee last week, testified under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunk state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that her candidate for the Supreme Court's judge showed her genitals while attending the parties during their studies at Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web network user plans to launch a new Internet that will supersede Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web network, runs a startup that aims to be a competitor of Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company based on an open source platform Solid, which is the Creator of Berners-Lee.
Solid enables users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company, Berners-Lee found that the intention of Inrupt is "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said about the start.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal data store" or POD (personal online data store).
It can contain the contact list, the list of commitments, the calendar, the music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, they're all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique to a personal data retailer on the network is that it depends entirely on the user who can access any type of information.
The company calls it "personal effort through data."
According to the company's principal director, John Bruce, the idea is that Inrupt provides sources, processes and appropriate skills so that Solid is available to all.
The company is currently operating in Berners-Lee, Bruce, a safety platform for IBM, a number of employees of development engineers engaged in the project and the volunteer programmer community.
Since this week, technology engineers around the world can create their decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google whether or not to introduce a complete change where all their business models will be completely destroyed through the night.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a press release on the Media platform on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inruptiva is "a mission to ensure commercial energy and ecosystems that will protect the integrity and quality of a new website built on Solid."
Berners-Lee transformed the Internet in 1994 when he founded World Wide Web concerts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been a very influential voice in the discussion of the neutrality of the network.
Despite the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundations and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new web era," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebrates the Victor's Cross of Dedicated Priests in World War I · Global Voices
The celebration in the honour of the only Church of England priest who was celebrated by Victoria's baptism as a warrior in World War I was attracted to his hometown 100 years later .
Colonel Bernard Vann won recognition on September 29, 1918, for an attack on the cities of Bellengles and Lehacourt.
A few days later, however, he was killed by a rapist and never knew he had won the greatest British military recognition.
On a parade held on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandsons discovered a memorial plaque.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was "unbelievably symbolic" because the monument was discovered 100 years after the subjugation his grandfather had received a prize.
According to the newspaper London Gazette, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal of Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918, "through a very nice clay and under a strong fire with war and munitions. "
He later rushed to the fire line and carried the water forward with the "major crowd" before he left without any help on the field top and hit three out of the military line.
Colonel Vanna died on 4 October 1918, a little over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's moves were "something I know I could never get, but something that causes humility."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed a prisoner after a parade led by the Duchess Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it feels honored to participate in the paradise" and added that "the courage of a true hero shows support that many will give."
Lovers of MMA who have been awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they got Pepu Prase
Think of it, you've been awake all night to watch the Bellator 206 matches so that you could finally be unable to watch the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 battles, including six on the main list and showed up alive during the night on Channel 5 in Great Britain.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, right at the moment Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready to face, viewers in Great Britain were blocked when the transfer stopped Pepa Prase.
Many were not impressed that they were awake all night to the early morning hours just because of the fight.
One blogger on Twitter described this interruption of the transfer to black movies as "some kind of disease joke."
"It is about the government's regulation where this content is inappropriate at 6 a.m. and it has to be replaced by a programme for children," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president of Bellattor for marketing and communication, on the transfer question.
"Pepa Prase," yes.
The president of Bellator Scott Cooker said he would work on his schedule to include viewers from Great Britain in the future.
"I think that when I'm talking about repression, I think we can probably solve it," Coker said.
"But the transfer is there at 6:00 a.m. on Sunday, and we won't be able to realize anything until Sunday comes to us, when it's already Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the break came, they were surrounded by prescriptions and they were all enemies.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a matter of government responsibility.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce the number of fights from six to five, as we usually do, we've tried to give more to our fans, but we've gone too far.
That's one unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic driver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that gave him motivation to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he was only in high school to realize that "not everyone like me."
Speaking at first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, representing Lauren Laverne, said he was openly talking about gay rights to give others a "hope."
He also said that what became a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular director of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, was absent for several months because of the disease.
Acting as a loser at the first Laverne's show, Daley said that during his growing up he felt "a little less valuable" than others because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, you feel less worth and feel that I am different from the real things that have given me the strength and the strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove he was "someone," he said, so people don't get disappointed when they eventually find out about his sexuality.
A two-year winner of the bronze Olympic medals became a very important fighter for the LGBT population and used his appearance at this year's Game of Commonwealth in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was speaking because he felt happy that he had an opportunity to speak without consequences and because he wanted to give others a "hope."
Trotsuki World Championship said he was in love with a man, American producer Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 "was surprised."
Daley married Oscar, a 20-year-old winner last year, and said that the difference in years was never a problem.
"When you live so much as you're so young," -- the first time he appeared at the Olympics when he was 14 years old, and his father died three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone of the same years who experienced similar successes and falls.
A couple took place in the role of Robert Ray Black-Daley's parents in June, and Daley said his "full perspective" changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was just about "I have to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more things than gold medals in the Olympic game.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 in the year 40 after he was diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was whether they still had tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to sit in first order.
"I couldn't tell him "You won't be here to sit in first order, Dad," he said.
"I held him by the hand while he stopped breathing and only when he really stopped breathing and when he was dead I finally realized he wasn't inevitable," he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
"I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life - swimming before the local public at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It served as an inspiration for his first choice of songs - Proud from Heather Small - who responded to him while he was preparing for the Olympics and from which he is still being passed by by the poets.
Desert Island Discs is on Radio 4 BBC on Sunday at 11:15 after British summer time.
Mickelson van form at Ryder’s club in Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th game at Ryder's Cup, but he will have to return the form that would not be a novelist.
Mickelson, who plays on record 12 times, Captain Jim Furyk sent to the club on Saturday games with four volleyballs and four games.
Instead of being at the center of action, as was often the case for the US, the five-year-old main winner spent a day in driving and improving the subject in the game, hoping to fix what concerns him.
This 48-year-old, who was never the best player, even at the top of his career, is not an ideal choice for the demanding Le Golf Nationala field, where a long rough land regularly punishs strikes.
And if I'm not afraid enough, mickelson is in the ninth game on Sunday facing the British Open champion, Francescom Molinari, who has won all four of their games this week with beginner Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who start 12 individual games with four points less, come to the hot start, the Michaelson game could be absolutely condemned.
Furyk said he had confidence in his man, but he couldn't say anything more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, supported me by the shoulder and buried me, and said he would be ready by tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He believes in himself very much.
He's a member of the famous House, and so much he brought these teams back in the past, and this week.
I'm sure I didn't imagine playing two games.
I thought it would be more, but that's how it went, and we thought he had to go.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will record Nick Falda on the number of games played in Ryder's bathroom on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his career on Ryder's Cup where he never fully reached the level of his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 injuries and seven semi-times, although Furyk said his presence brought a certain non-material value to the team.
"He's fun, he's funny, he likes to fuck people and he's great to have a guy like that in the team," he explained.
"I think it was fun for young players to give him a chance, and this week, which was fun to watch.
He's giving a lot more than a doll game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a huge advantage could soon be lost
Mr. Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage in the last day of the individual Ryder match can easily be transformed into an unpleasant experience.
The day first appeared at a game played in Valderam City in 1997, when the captain's side was Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but they ended the competition with a real difference 141⁄2-131/2.
"You will always remember that we had a great advantage in Valderrami, we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won," Bjorn said, thinking after looking at the 2018 team, which won the score 5-3 on Friday and yesterday led 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So my stories and everyone in that team will show me this isn't over.
You're going to the end tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get points on the table.
We have a goal, and that's what we're trying to win this trophy, and that remains the focus.
All the time I'm talking, I'm focused on 12 players on our side, but we're very well aware of what's going on over and over -- the biggest players in the world."
Excited by the behavior of his players on a heavy golf tournament, Bjorn added: "I would never let this take me.
It's a new day tomorrow.
Tomorrow's all right, individual games, and that's something else.
It's great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when you're alone, you're testing yourself as a golf player.
It's a message you have to pass to players - give most of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner and he must be the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague Jim Furyk will ask his players to play better individually than they did in pairs, excluding Jordan Spietha and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Soryk and I were on both sides of these major revolutions of the last days, since it was part of the victory team in Brooklyn before it ended up as a loser after Europe had performed "a miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he answered when he was asked how the 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve great results at the very beginning like what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When he starts with such a flight, he creates a big pressure on the middle game.
We formed our position according to that and we prepared the boys so we're trying to perform some magic tomorrow, you know."
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to lead the counterattack and confront Rory McIrroy in the main game, with Paulo Casey, Just Rose, Jon Rahmo, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the upper half.
"I went with this group of guys in this position because I think she can cover everything up to the end," Bjorn said about choosing a single player.
New German warship again waiting
The new fleet of German sailors was to be released in the spring of 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War, but will not reach for at least a year due to fraud on systems and external costs, local media have reported.
The release of the ship "Rheinland-Pfalz," a lead ship in the class of the completely new Baden-Wuertmberg frigat, was due by the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, quoted by the military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems after the release threatened the fate of this ambitious project.
Four boats of the Baden-Wuertemberg class, which were ordered in 2007, will replace the old frigate class Bremen.
As is known, there will be a strong top, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-brody rockets, as well as some invisible technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important persons include longer periods of maintenance - it should be possible for the latest frigates to be scheduled for up to two years without returning to the maternity home.
However, continuous delay means that the most modern warships, which should have allowed Germany to distribute the forces out of its territory, will already be older when they start using them, says Die Zeit.
An unfortunate F125 frigate arrived last year in the newspaper when German Navy officially refused to release the ship in use and returned it to the Bloom & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy returned the ship to the ship builder after delivery.
It is little known about the reasons for the return, but the German media have indicated a number of key "software and hardware deficiencies" for which the ship would be useless if it were to be deployed into some battle mission.
The software deficits were of particular importance because the Baden-Wuertmberg class ships will manage the crews of some 120 seafarers - exactly half the number of people who managed the old Bremen class frigates.
It has also been found that the ship is a significant burden that reduces its effect and limits the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
It is believed that 7,000 tons of heavy ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice heavier than ships of similar class that the Germans used in the Second World War.
In addition to the unfair hardware, the price of the complete project, including staff training, also becomes a problem.
It is said that it reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion), compared to the original 2.2 billion.
The problems related to the latest frigates are particularly significant in the light of recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, president of the German Parliamentary Defence Commission, admitted that the Navy "is actually leaving ships that can be distributed."
The officer said that this problem was growing in time, because the old ships were written and not obtained replacement ships.
He was sorry that none of the frigates from the Baden-Waertmberg class couldn't join the Navy.
The National Fund is a secret life of flexibility
A new study carried out on one property in the mountains of Scotland is aimed at discovering how smoother uses locals in search of food.
It is expected that the results will cast a new light on the conduct of single flying sisters and serve as a guide in future conservation activities.
A study conducted by scientists from the Scottish National Fund follows the usual smiles and type of soprano Pipistrelle, as well as a sweet long smile and smiles of the Daubenton species in Vrtovima Inverwe Gardens in West Ross.
A special recording device will be set up at key locations around the property to monitor smoother activities throughout the season.
Employees and volunteer NHS will also carry out mobile research using manual detectors.
The technical analysis of the recording of all records will determine the frequency of the calls of the muscles and what they do.
A map of the stations and reports will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behavior at the local level.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant in the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas are the most important of the deaf and how they are used by all kinds of people.
This data will help to determine the benefits of working on the management of the facilities, such as the creation of habitats, and which is the best way to maintain the forest for molluscs and other types of habitats.
In Scotland and the UK, the population was significantly reduced during the past century.
They are threatened by work on construction and development, which negatively affect the beds and the loss of the apartment.
Aircraft and lighting can also pose a risk, including beautiful paper and chemical processing of building materials, and attacks on household cats.
The shirts aren't really blind.
However, because of their habit of hunting at night, their ears are much more useful than their eyes in catching fat.
They use sophisticated eho-location technique to locate the bug and stop on their flight by flight.
NTSC, which cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 ha countries throughout the country, is very seriously aware of the noise.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out checks, medical inspections, and sometimes rescue.
The organisation even established the first and only reserve for skis in Scotland on the property of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which are home to eight of the ten types of skis in Scotland.
The owner of the property David Thompson says there's an ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave we have a lot of areas for skimpy," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old buildings and all the good buildings.
But there's still so much that we don't know about flies, so what we're doing here and on other property will help us understand better what they need to move on."
He stresses how important it is to check whether they are smarter in possession, as it is possible that the accidental destruction of one mother’s bed will kill up to 400 women and young people, which will probably lead to the destruction of the entire local population.
The pigs are protected animals and the law prohibits their killing, torture, harassment or destruction of their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrrell, the Scottish Support Fund's Office is a public to include and help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our deaf people, and we just don't know how the population of most of our species is developing."
Ronaldo rejects the allegations of rape while lawyers filed a complaint against the German magazine
Cristian Ronaldo is a charge of rape that he has been referred to as "false news," saying that people "want to promote" using his name.
His lawyers are ready to file charges to the German magazine Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of rapeing an American named Kathryn Mayor at the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, after that, he paid $375.000 to cover this incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
Turning to its 142 million followers in the video on the Instagram Live network, a few hours after the report on the charges, Ronaldo, 33, criticised reports called them "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, it's false news," said the 5th-century winner of the Gold Ball.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous talking about me, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player laughing.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel for these allegations, which have called "an unacceptable report on doubts in the field of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "unmaterial damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of the injury, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino apartment in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the night club, Ronaldo and Majorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he reportedly raped her, according to the documents provided by the District Court of Clark in Nevada.
Major says Ronaldo fell on his knees after the above-mentioned incident and told her he was a "99% good guy" who failed those "1%."
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that a couple had sex, but that he was willing.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were photographed in the hospital, but that later she agreed to an outside deal because she felt "fear of revenge" and worried she would be "publicly humiliated."
A 34-year-old girl says she's looking for a contract cancellation now because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to the Royal Madrid from Manchester, United States at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he went to the Italian Juve for 100m euros.
Brexit: The UK will always regret losing the car manufacturer
The UK will "always complain" if it loses the status of the world leader in the car production after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that what Toyota the UK said to BBC - if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement that it will temporarily stop production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on borders in the event that Bexit would remain without agreement could cause the loss of jobs.
A factory in Buenos Aires, produced by Toyotin Auris and Avenis, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which have been exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain comes out of the EU by the end of March we will see the stop of production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director General Toyote in Burnaston.
Other UK producers including Hondu, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover expressed concern about how cross-border trade would work if Britain left the EU without an agreement.
BMW, for example, says he'll close his mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main fears relate to what car manufacturers call risks in the supply chain in the case of Brexit without an agreement.
The Toyote production line works on the principle of "time management", where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers from the UK and the EU for vehicles made by order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it may come to an end at the border which can lead to the slowdown and loss of shares.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep stock for more than one day in his factory in Derbyshire, they said from the company, so the production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that the "Checkers" plan offering Theresa May for future relations with the EU "is precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We must have an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will allow me to say, not only to enjoy the present success but also to take this opportunity," said Radiation 4 on BBC in today's programme.
"The first example is not only Toyote but also other producers is that we must be absolutely able to continue what has been extremely successful under the supply chain."
Toyota could not say how long the production would be stopped, but warned that long-term additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory on the market and ultimately reduce the number of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked for 24 years in Burnstone and president of the Union union at the factory, said his members were more concerned: “My experience is that when such a place of work is in jail, they never return again.
The Speaker of the Government said: "We must draw up a precise and credible plan of our future relations with the EU."
The Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be remedied, they say from the White House
A very important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "deprived for another week" because there is an ongoing debate on candidates for the Supreme Court of Britta Kavanaugh, they said from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the case of Russian involvement in the election, the relationship between Trompo's assistants and Russia, and the potential distortion of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will release the deputy of the Attorney General or not, and thereby threaten Mr. Mueller's independence, it's been months of discussion in Washington.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein was also talking about the call to record talks with Trump and about the possibility of a presidential amendment on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these voices.
But last Monday he was in the White House, in the middle of a vote about leaving.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then held in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "not like" to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was arranged to avoid a confrontation with the hearing of the Senate's Legal Commission on which Kavanaugh was witnessed and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, the trumpeter ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation against Kavanaugh for a week, which further delayed the vote of the Senate in the plenary.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared Sunday on Fox News.
On the question of a meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for this is not yet determined, it could be this week, and it could happen for another week in view of all the other things that are happening in connection with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I like the press always to be informed."
Some journalists would deny this claim: Sanders has not kept a brief press address for journalists in the White House since September 10th.
Leader Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that a small number of short talks were not the result of the "theatrical behaviour" of a journalist, although she said, "I'll agree with the fact that they're overstepping."
Then she said there'd be a direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president holds more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him," she said without stating the evidence: "We have seen those numbers."
The short approach will continue to be maintained, Sanders said, but "if the press has an opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, that is much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this more and you've seen us do it in the last few weeks, and you're going to talk to the president of the United States for a short time to talk to journalists."
The Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or when attending open meetings or conferences during the official’s visit.
Individual press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, acting in front of all the journalists, being undeterred and sometimes odd.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at the National Health Service (NHS) Scotland on Brexit-related fears
The Health Secretary wrote to EU employees working in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude to the state and wish to stay after Brexit.
Member of Parliament of Scotland, Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before withdrawing the EU from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to meeting the costs of the EU citizens' demands for the status of its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: “The negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued over the summer, and decisions are expected this summer.
But the UK government has also accelerated its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this was a very awkward time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Fellows from across the EU, and widely, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, from which patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie under an emergency operation after head injury
The defense player of the State Tigers Tennessee, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after he injured his head in a Saturday break at 31:27 from the Vanderbilt Commodores club, reported Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Major coach Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the damage happened just before the half-hour.
"He came to the field line and just got down there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen to the soil before they put it on their clothes and carried it on further investigation.
An officer from Tennessee State said Chris Harris from WSMV Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had finished surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no details about the type/both of injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to discover when the injury happened.
Abercrombie, a student of the second year in the red dress, plays the first season for Tennessee State after a walk from Illinois.
He had five total fights on Saturday before he left the game, which he reached total 18 in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with more tax on the purchase of real estate in the UK
Buyers from foreign countries will be charged more tax on the occasion of purchase of real estate in the UK, using additional resources to assist homeless people in accordance with new conservation plans
This move will neutralize the success of Corbin's efforts to attract young voters
More tax will be paid to those who do not pay the UK tax
Tresor expects to collect up to 120 million pounds a year - to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged more tax on buying real estate in the UK, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, published today Theresa May.
This step will be considered to try to neutralize the success achieved by Jeremy Corbyn trying to attract young voters to promises that will ensure more affordable attention and focus on those who earn more.
More tax will be paid to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, thereby strengthening the government's plans to fight open sleep.
The additional fee, which is next to the existing tax, including more levels, introduced two years ago on the second real estate and purchase for rent, could be up to 3%.
Tresor expects this move to increase income to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built estates in London buy people who do not have a residence in the UK, so the price increases, and buyers who buy real estate for the first time become harder to become owners.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become “the cities of spirits” because of a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the taxi so that more young people could be helped to get to their first home.
He accused the construction companies of maintaining high prices of real estate by buying the first chance of a land that they do not use, and asked Mrs May to withdraw from the quota for accessory homes in order to cut off the British 'crazy of tribal politics'.
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of reforms proposed, including the control of hire and the suspension of any due process.
He also wants to give more authority to build new houses.
“ Last year, ” said Mrs. May, “I said that I would dedicate my office to the prime minister to return to the British dream - that the life of every new generation should be better.
And that means fixing our bad mood market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life in it.
However, it can't be fair that individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as other companies, can buy homes easily as well as worthy Britishs.
The dream of ownership over the house has become too far for many people, and non-human sleep is still real."
Jack Ross: "My final ambition is to lead Scotland"
Chief Sanderland Jack Ross says his "final ambition" is to be a Scottish representative manager at a certain time.
Forty-two-year-old Scott enjoys the challenge of returning to the life of a Northeast club, currently located in the third place in the First League, with three points less than water.
This summer he moved to St. Mirren after the last season returned to the Scottish Prime Minister's league.
"I wanted to behave for my country as a player.
I was in the B-tier and that was it," Ross said for the Sports Sound BBC Scotland show.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and that always pushed me back.
However, such an opportunity would be given only if I were successful in running the club."
Russian presidents as managers of Sanderland include Dicka Advocate, Davida Moyes, Sam Allardycea, Martina O'Neilla, Roya Keanea, Gusa Poyeta and Paulo Di Canioa.
The former head of Alleo Athletic Club says he didn't feel upset because he came after so many names in such a big club, after he rejected the offer of the Barnsley and Ipswich Town Club.
"The measure of my success at this moment will be 'will I succeed to return this club to the Premier League?'
Judging by the structure and possibilities of this club, he undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to bring him there, but I think I'll be able to think of success only if I can get back to the club where his place is."
Ross was only in the third year of his managerial career, after a period that he spent as assistant chief in Dambarton and 15 months that he spent as part of the training staff of Harts.
Then he helped Alla recover from the fall into the third category, and St. Miren withdrew from the rest of the fall in the league to the winner of the Championate next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his sports careers in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It must have been the real anniversary," recalled Alla's review of the club.
"I sincerely believed that management is a real thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds weird because I wasn't bad, I earned decently, and I enjoyed some solid success.
But playing can be hard.
It's so much you have to spend every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and pressure from work, but management simply fits me.
I always wanted to be involved in management and now I'm doing it, and in my entire adult life, I didn't feel more comfortable than now."
You can listen to the entire interview at the Sportsound show on Sunday 30 September at the Scottish Radio from 12.00 a.m. to 1 p.m. after the British summer time
Perfect time for glass is Saturday at 17:30, discovering research
The summer's heat wave has increased the traffic of British popes fighting for survival, but it has increased pressure on the range of restaurants.
In the papo and baroque groups, sales growth from 2.7% in July, but in the restaurants, the traffic decreased by 4.8%, as the figures show.
Peter Martin, of CGA’s consultant company, who collected data, said: “The long - term and long - awaited English participation in the World Championship led to a similar pattern in July as in the previous month, when the popes achieved a 2.8% growth, and restaurants had even more fall.
The drop in traffic in restaurants from 1.8% in June just increased in July.
The pubs and barons focused on drinking have achieved the best results with increased growth compared to the corresponding results from the previous period, rather than the decline of traffic in restaurants.
The popes focused on food also lost due to the sun, but not as dramatic as the owner of the restaurant.
Looks like people just wanted to get out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, the sale of alcohol is increased by 6.6% per month, with the drop of food by three percent."
Paul Newman, from the Agency for the Analysis of Entertainment and Entertainment of the RSM, said: “These results continue to be a trend we have witnessed since the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social and sports events remain the main factors when it comes to sales on the market outside the home country.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to fight hard, although the decline of 4.8% at annual level will be particularly painful with existing price pressures.
A long summer could not come in the worst time for consumers focused on food, and the time will show whether the moderate temperatures we had in August will provide a little more than the necessary relief."
The total growth of sales in papayas and restaurants, including newly created objects, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow introduction of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, an industrial service for tracking sales in the Baroness, Papov and Restaurant in the UK, collects and analyzes data on the impact of 47 business groups with a total turnover of over 9 billion dollars and presents an approved industrial measure.
Every five children have a secret mission on social networks that hides from their parents
Every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret job on social networks that conceals from their parents and teachers, discovers research
Research involving more than 20,000 pupils of higher basic school classes revealed an increase in the number of “false Instas” page
This news has increased the fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of girls said they had a "main" job to show their parents
Every five children, of whom only 11 years of age are employed on social networks that are hidden from adults.
A survey involving 20,000 students in higher primary schools revealed a sudden increase in the "false Insta" commission, which relates to the page to share the Instagram photo.
These reports have strengthened the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of the girls said they have a "main" job that shows parents, but they also have private jobs.
One mother who found her 13-year-old daughter on the secret page discovered a teenage girl who called another girl by the words "Serve me."
A study conducted by the Digital Society of the UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40% of children between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, while half of them acknowledged that they had private tasks.
HMC president Mike Buchanan said: We are disturbing the fact that so many teenagers are coming to experience creating a space on the Internet where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "vote of athletes" in the Scottish athletic team
Elidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish athletic committee as an imperfect director at the annual meeting of that governing body.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie described this move as a great opportunity for those who lead sports to benefit from her rich experience at the international level over the past decade
"Eilid enjoys great respect for the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from its membership in the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be a sportsman's voice, and I hope I can really bring sports to Scotland."
The American, who won a total of four Olympic gold, including victorys at 200 and 400 meters in the 1996 game in Atlanta, and now a regular expert in BBC, has remained unbelievably after experiencing a transient ischemist attack.
On Twitter he wrote: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time can show me how much I'm going to recover.
It was hard work, but I was completely cured, taught again that I was going and that today I'm practicing as an agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages."
Advertisements for a publisher whose mother’s trade with cows shared an opinion on the Internet
The company that produced the publisher shared views on the Internet with advertising that wanted to compare the cows with the mice.
In order to mark the launch of a product described as “the first silent publisher,” Elvie published a promotion of inspired entertainment music videos showing the freedom that the new pump provides for milk-producing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a chair between the pigs and the cows with a song of their voice: "Yes, I'm married but I don't have a rap" and "If you haven't noticed, but I don't know, these are my breasts."
Next rehearsal: "Pamp, pump, feed my babies, pump, pump, man myself."
However, advertising published on the company's Facebook page has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video created a different audience's reaction, while many said to cast light on the "dark" milk industry.
"The use of cows for advertising this product was a very bad decision.
And they have to be pregnant and born like us to produce milk, but their babies are taken a few days after birth," someone wrote.

Another commented: “It is clear that it is traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why don't you use the publisher's advertisement for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another added: "The announcement has no meaning."
Others stood in the defense of advertising, and one woman admitted that her song was “sudden. ”
"I think the idea is genius.
I'd buy this if I still wanted to.
Because of the betrayal, I felt like a cow.
The announcement's a little ridiculous, but I got it right.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another commented: “This is a ridiculous advertising directed at mothers who deliver milk (often at the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like “crowds. ”
This isn't advertising that praises or kills the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were dancing with discreet pumps hidden in their chestnuts.
The concept of advertising is based on the discovery that many mothers who give milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely unheard of, there are no wires or pipes and stands in the chest for the baby, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even get out while they deliver milk.
Ana Balarin, a partner and executive creative director of Mother’s company, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves courage and provocative launch.
By withdrawing the parallel between the rain and the cows of the musar, we wanted to focus on the issue of milk and all the challenges that go along with it, showing in a funny and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new pump provides.
This isn't the first time that Elvie's pump got into news headlines.
During the week of fashion in London, the mother of two children appeared on the bridge in the creation of Marte Jakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to a tent camp at the border with Texas
The number of migrant children detained has increased although the number of monthly crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because the other rhetoric and policies introduced by the Tromp's administration made finding an elderly person for children difficult.
Traditionally, most of the elderly themselves were migrants without documents that were afraid to threaten their ability to stay in the country by doing what they would do in order to accept the child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential elders and other adult members of their household would have to be given fingerprints and that the information would be shared with immigration services.
Matthew Albence, a senior officer from the Immigration and Customs Service, announced last week before Congress that this service had arrested ten people who had been reported for ageing over minors without following up.
The service later confirmed that 70% of the arrested were not convicted in the past.
"About 80% of the persons who are either the elderly or members of the household of the elderly are illegal in this country, and a good part of them are strangers who have committed crimes.
That's why we're going to keep looking for those people, said Mr. Albence.
In order to speed up the process, officials have introduced new rules to which some of them will have to appear before court within a month of detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, said the workers in the reception hall.
Many will respond to a video call instead of personal, in order to ask the immigration judge to reinstate their status.
Those who are determined not to meet the conditions will be deported soon.
The longer the children remain in prison, the more likely they will become anxious or depressed, which may lead to the easing of anger or the attempt to escape, the more reception workers and reports that have come from the system of last month.
Lawyers say such risks are increased in larger institutions like those in the city of Tornillo, where it is much easier to see signs indicating that the child has problems.
They added that moving children to tentacles without time to prepare them emotionally or to greet friends can lead to the trauma that many children have already faced.
Syria seeks immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish "occupational forces"
Turning to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualam also invited Syrian refugees to return, although the war in that country has lasted for eight years.
Moualem, also acting as prime minister deputy, said that the parties were illegal in the Syrian country, under the pretext of combating terrorism and "that they will be treated accordingly."
They have to be put out and unimpeded," he said at the sitting.
Moulalem insisted that in Syria "the war against terrorism is almost over," where over 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue "holy struggle until we crush all Syrian terrorists", including terrorist groups and "every side presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, primarily responsible for training and counseling Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this country of war.
In the case of refugees, Moulam said there were good conditions for their return and charged "one Western country" with "wide irradiational fears" that forced refugees not to return.
"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to enable this return," he said.
"They policy what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that it will not be helpful to restore Syria until Assad and opposition reach an agreement on the end of the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of the Tampon-zone in the last major rebel resort in Idlibu created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has rejected a major attack on the Syrian forces that support Russia in a province where three million people live.
Moual, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear hands" and expressed the hope that a war will be launched against the Jahadists and fighters from the Nusra front associated with Al Kaid, who will "be executed".
Ambassador of the UN Staffan de Mistura hopes to gather soon the first meetings of a new committee consisting of the authorities and opposition members in order to draw up a draft subsequent constitution for Syria and prepare a path to the elections.
Moulalem outlined the terms of the Syrian Government for participation in the Committee's work, saying that the work of this body should be limited to "considering the members of the current constitution" and warned of the possibility of external interference.
Why Trump will be selected for another mandate
According to that logic, Trump would be re-elected at the 2020 elections unless many liberal observers are likely to hope, opposition and scandals will not break his mandate earlier.
This would undoubtedly represent the most dramatic end of the presidential mandate of all time!
For now, there's no sign of the viewer's wear.
Since 2014, the rating has doubled to 1.05 million on CNN channel and nearly 1.6 million on MSNBC channel.
According to the Nielsen agency, the Fox News channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the attack term, unlike four years ago when it was 1.7 million, and Rachel Maddow Show channel MSNBC has transferred rating cable channels to 3.5 million viewers during the night with the attack news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's about something we don't understand," Neal Baer producer drama "The chosen survivors" said on the ABC channel, about a government secretary who becomes president after the attack that destroys Capitol.
Nell Scowell, a longtime comedy writer and author of the book "Only funny parts: and a few raw truths about placing in Hollywood Boys' Club," has a different theory.
She remembers driving in Boston before the 2016 election..
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
She asked.
"He said, 'cause he laughs at me,' said Mrs. Scowell to me.

Big cash flow from the side in the most uncertain medium-year election race for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th round of Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the transfer of convention districts that resulted in two candidates in the race for the same place.
The recent crossing of the border in the town of Pittsburgh led to the election of democratic representative Conora Lamba, who came to the top of the second round after foreign elections last spring.
Lamb fights against another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th round of Pennsylvania, which is largely in conflict with the new 17th round.
The cards were re-examined after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were constitutionally formed for the benefit of the Republicans.
The new 17th round launched a campaign to finance the campaign between the main foreign fund collectors, the Committee collecting funds for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became known as Pennsylvania after his final victory in the widest special elections for the 18th district of Pennsylvania in March.
This position has been held by the Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won a round of 20 points.
Political analysts have given unknown preference to democracies.
The United States considers El Salvador's punishment for China's support, but then withdraws
Diplomats have found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, with little support from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heartbreaking meeting with Paname Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the Trump's management team.
Officials of the State Department have decided to withdraw the heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "a recent decision not to recognise Taiwan anymore," said Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the Department, in a statement early in the month.
But the penalties are considered only for El Salvador, which is estimated to have received 140 million US dollars in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including the reduction of financial assistance and the target of restrictions, would be difficult to deal with this Central American country with high levels of unemployment and murder.
As the internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity, which was to continue a similar past year's group, which took a step forward in efforts to prevent the arrival of migrants in the United States.
By mid-September, however, the senior officials of the administration had made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and that, in fact, they had ceased any consideration of the sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, which represents a sign of the importance of the administration's meeting, the diplomats said.
And three American envoys have secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any further hard messages or sentences from Washington.
The White House spokesman, on behalf of Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the discussion described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal discussions on the condition that they remain anonymous.
Their findings confirmed an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next preparation could be the report of special researcher Robert Mueller on the possible Trump's execution of justice, which now has considerable evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller also directed his investigation to discover a possible link between the Trump campaign and the Russian election attack.
If the majority changes in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just when he is ready to step back before the voter, and perhaps before the jury.
There are a lot of these "if" and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, not even for those in Europe who are like him.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German soldiers were ready to launch a state attack on Hitler, just because the West opposed and supported the Czech Republic in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years that followed.
The course of history is turning around such humble moments, and the improbable march of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are now facing more of such extremes.
What will we do if Mr. Trump leaves the deputy of the chief prosecutor, Roda Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in an undisclosed position since this letter reported last year that he has submitted a secret recording of the president and has expressed his belief that he is not similar to the performance of the function.
Mr. Rosenstein says the evidence from Tims is incorrect.
"How will we react if a recent FBI investigation about Britt Kavanaugh is incomplete or fair, or if his candidate for the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-year elections for Congress, which Mr. Trump will call for responsibility?
If we fall into these tests, democracy will sleep a long winter dream.
But I believe we won't fall for the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz to the same Nazi regime that had once taken over the country in which I was a ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America and 60 years later, sent me to burn candles for the Sabbath on that table with a crate baptism.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid from Beča
The Rangers are on Thursday at Rapid's home in Bec, knowing that they will be defeated by Austrians, after an impressive campaign in Spain against Villarrela this month, to put themselves in a good position to qualify from the G Group of the European League.
The damage to the knee prevented binding player Graham Dorrass from deliberating all this season into an unsolved arrow with Villarel's final result 2-2, but it is believed that Rangers can use this result as a dropboard for further.
"It was a valuable point for us because Villareal is a good opponent," said a 31-year-old player.
"We went into the game believing that we could achieve something and we went with the point.
Maybe we could finally take them, but everything in all, the unsolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half of the time, and we returned to the second and we were better.
On Thursday, he's expecting us again for a big European evening.
We hope we can take three points, but it'll be a hard fight because they've had a good outcome in the past game, though, with the support of the public we can certainly say and achieve a positive outcome.
Last year was no doubt difficult, starting from everything that happened to my injuries until the change in the club itself, but now we're content with what we have right now.
The team is in good shape and the boys really enjoy it; we train well.
I hope we can continue now, leave the past season behind us and be successful."
Women can't sleep out of concern for pension saving
Despite the fact that the investigators had a clear idea of how to care for them, few of them spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the people involved in the research of the nationwide company said they were talking to their spouses about the costs of long-term.
Only 10% of them said she talked to her children about it.
"People want someone in the family to talk about them, but they don't want to talk about it," says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the life insurance sector at the Nationalside company.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to give it to you unless you first express your wishes.
Work with your consultant and your family and consider where and how to be given to him, as such decisions can be a significant factor in determining the price.
Include your financial adviser: Your advisor can help you and create a way to pay those costs.
Your choice of long-term financing may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a cash value that will help you to cover these costs or self-insurance with your own savings – provided you have enough money.
Sort your legal documents: Prevent legal battles in the background.
To make a decision on medical help, you should have a trusted person who will monitor the medical care provided and ensure that healthcare workers act in accordance with your wishes in case you are not able to communicate.
Consider, too, the conclusion of the financing multi-stakeholder agreement.
This implies that you choose a person of trust who will make financial decisions on your behalf and take care of paying your bills if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation where he needs urgent medical care and takes him to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please specify the details in the written schedule so that you will be ready.
"It's not just about finance, but also about who the doctors are?" asked Martin.
“What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Plan it."
A man shot with more shots from the airgun in Ilfracombe
One man was shot with several shots from the air gun while the dogs came home from the night's departure.
The victim, in her 40s, was in the field of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and arm.
The police described the shooting, which took place about 02:30, according to the British summer time, as a "crazy act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called the witnesses to answer.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by powerful earthquake and tsunamis that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials announced, and it is expected that the number of dead will grow.
As a result of the interruption of the link, relief officers were unable to obtain any information from Dondree province, a region north of Palu, which is closer to the peak of 7.5 degrees.
In Palau after the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Here are some of the key facts about Palau and Dondri, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palo is the capital of the province of Sulawesi, located at the end of the valley on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when he was hit by torture and tsunamis.
Dodrea is a circle that extends more than 300 km (180 km) west of the island of Sulawesi.
The area, which is administratively lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are based on the territorial attraction of Central Sulawesi, particularly the coastal region of Dodrea.
Nikal mines are also important in the countryside, but they are mainly concentrated in Morrow, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palau and Dodrea were hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dondria.
The tsunami hit the West Dongrey in 1996 when nine people were killed.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Pacific Fire Zone and is regularly discussed by earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004.: The great earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh on Northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong attacks struck the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The earthquake of 6.8 degrees hit South Java, the most populated Indonesian island, starting with tsunamis that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: Strong 7.6 steps have been struck by the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010.: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing tsunamis to reach ten feet [10 m] that destroyed ten villages and killed about 300 people.
2016.: The plague hit the region of Pidie Jaya in Acehu, causing destruction and panic because it reminded people of the deadly outbreaks and tsunamis of 2004.
This time it didn't come to the tsunami, but more than 100 people died in the collapse of the building.
2018.: Great earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, with more than 500 people lost their lives, mainly on the northern side of the island.
Potres destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists remained temporarily trapped.
The oldest son of Sare Palin was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President, Sare Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from the city of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on the basis of suspicion that he had committed domestic violence, stopped reporting violence in the family and stopped arrest, states a report published on Saturday by the State Police Agency of Alaska.
According to the police report, when the acquaintance tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin was detained in Mat-Su prison unit and he was sentenced to 500 dollars in prison, reporting to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday where he explained on the issue of the explanation of the crime that "it is certainly not a crime", this network reported.
Palin is faced with three Class A infringements, which means that he will be sentenced to a year's imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.
He is also accused of breaking Class B, which is sentenced to a prison sentence for one day and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal reports have been filed against Palina.
In December 2017 he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palina.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Veteran Court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of violence in the family, a ban on the registration of violence in the family and possession of weapons in an alcoholized state that are related to the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her face.
Sara Palin criticized the Veteran Group in 2016 after it brought into line with his son's violent behaviour with PTSP after his work in Iraq.
Condoms and landscapes in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after a earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of 7.5 degrees that caused tsunamis destroyed hundreds of homes.
The link and supply of electricity has come to an end, and the number of dead will be expected to increase in the next days.
The epicenter of the country was directly with the central part of Sulawesi, north of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarte.
On social networks, videotapes are surrounded by videotapes showing the moment of attack.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach festival in the city of Pala when the tsunami hit the coast.
The federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York.
The federal prosecutors in New York are looking for a death sentence for Saifula Saip, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York where eight people have died - a rare penalty that has not been committed for federal crime in the country since 1953.
Saipov, 30, he reportedly used the hired truck company Home Depot to carry out the attack on a bicycle track along the West Side road in Donja Manhattan, where he was injured by the sands and bicycles that were found on his way to October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saip killed eight victims "amically" and "amically" caused serious physical injury, which is mentioned in the request for the death penalty imposed in the South New York district.
After both of these points, it is possible to remove the death penalty, as stated in the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury accused Saip of 22 counts involving eight charges of murder and correction, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "significant planning and thinking," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as a "grunt, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayful Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrena Drake, Ariel Erlie, Hernan Ferruchia, Herna Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucca," says the application for a sentence.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been decades since the South District of New York last had a case where the death penalty was threatened.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty in a federal case in New York was executed in 1953 by Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after being sentenced to a conviction for spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg's were killed on June 19, 1953 at an electric chair.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show punishment in the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he did, she reported to the police.
Saipov told the authorities that after watching the ISIS videotape on his phone he was inspired to carry out an attack, he said in charge.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be issued in his hospital room, and the police informed him.
He made it clear he wasn't guilty of 22 counts of charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were clearly disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death penalty, instead of accepting a life imprisonment without the possibility of release for confession of crimes, will only extend the tranche of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saip's defense has previously asked the prosecutor not to make a death sentence.
The Conservative Ambassador says NIGEL FARGE should be responsible for talks about Brexit
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilisate the National Army" today during a protest at a Conservative Conference.
The former Independent Party leader of the UK said that politicians had to "feel discontent" with the Eurosceptics, as one of the messengers Therese May suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative representative Peter Bonne said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would "go" so far that Mr. Farage was a secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May in attempting to unite her deeply divided ranks was highlighted by conservatives who claimed the rest of the EU and who joined a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep his compromise plan from the Chequers despite attacks and attacks and attacks and oppositions from Brexit and the EU.
The allies insisted that she continue to negotiate with Brussels despite negative reactions, and urged Eurosceptics and labists to choose between her package and "haos".
Mr. Bone said at the Goci gathering that means going to Solihul that he wants to "reject the Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have a title and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were the head, we would've already gone out," he said.
The messenger from Wellingborough added: "I'll fight for Brexit, but we have to throw out the Chequers."
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be born.
We want to bring our laws into our country."
Mr. Bonne rejected the statement that the public opinion had changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and that they want to remain completely incorrect is correct."
“ I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and among our activists who were actually the ones who went out on the streets and chose us.
"Please reject the plan from the Chequers and start listening."
In a strong message, Mrs. May added: “Primers are able to keep their jobs when they keep their promises. ”
Mr Farage told the audience that politicians must make themselves "feel dissatisfied" if they are ready to ignore the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to exaggerate Brexit, and we're here today to tell them "That won't happen to you."
In a letter to the excited audience, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the edge of Brexit’s edition, to feel dissatisfied.
"We mobilize this country's national army that has brought us victory in Brexit and we will not settle until we become independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the remnants have marched through Birmingham before they have held a double assembly in the city center.
A number of activists were attracted to the transparency of "Torieves against Brexit" after the formation of this weekend's group.
Laburist Lord Adonis feared the conservatives for the security problems they had with the application of the party to open the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that I can have IT systems and all technology for the Canada Plus plan for an unlimited state on the borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete phrase.
Good Brexit isn't possible," he added.

Russian Gran Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after his cousin guarantees victory over Sebastian Vettel.
Since the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that the team leader will play a major role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the start and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his team.
The winner first went to the box and left Hamilton behind to get involved in the traffic at first, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes went into the box one round later and went out behind the Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after the action point from the point where Ferrari's driver had difficulty leaving the free interior at the risk of staying after a double move in defense of the third race.
Max Verstappen began the last series of solutions and was seven at the end of the first circle on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the race by relying on his rubber to get to the fast end and cross the Kimia Raikconen in fourth place.
He finally came to box in the 44th round, but he couldn't speed up the remaining eight rounds while Raikkonen took the fourth place.
The day was hard because Valtteri's been working a fantastic job all weekend and was the real gentleman who let me through.
Tim did a really extraordinary job to make a one-to-two formation final," said Hamilton.
That was a very bad word of the body.
President Donald Trump called Senator Diane Feinsten on Saturday because she insisted that she didn't release Christine Blasey Ford in a letter to the Supreme Court of Britta Kavanaugh accused of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly take note of the testimony of the Forum before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are evil, dangerous and deceptive.
The only thing that could have happened was the wonderful thing that happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and angry and angry and lying, he said.
When you look at the publications and the information that they've been investigating in the public, and then they say O, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you posted information to the public?
You remember her answer... did you leave the document in public--what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leave it to the public."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we... no, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Ford sent Feinstein a letter in July with details of Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and it went through early September, but Feinsten claimed that the information had been processed from her office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's instructions, I didn't leave her story to the public."
She asked me to keep it secret, and I kept it secret, as she asked."
But her speech did not come to the approval of the president, who commented on the rally on Saturday evening: To tell you, it was really a bad speech of the body.
Maybe it isn't, but I've never seen the worst body speech in my life."
Continuing his defence candidate for the Supreme Court, which three women accused of sexual abuse, the president urged the Democrats to use these instructions for their own purposes.
They're determined to return power at every price.
You see the evil, the madness, they don't care who will hurt, who must be ignored to come to power and control," the media transmit the words of the president.

The air traffic controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after he died as a safe pilot of hundreds of people.
More than 800 people have died, and many water is lost after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, starting with the tsunamis.
A lot of delays continue to unfold in this area, and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues running away trying to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his workplace in a control tower at Mutira Sis Al-Jufri Palu which was heavily floating.
He stayed to secure Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then standing on the bridge.
When he realized that the control tower was running, he jumped out of it.
He moved to the hospital later.
Portparol Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News Australia.
We've prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transfer him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
Our hearts are ashamed of this news," he added.
Meanwhile, officials are afraid that the number of victims could reach thousands, while the government agency for disaster relief claims that access to the cities of Dodrea, Siggi and Butong is limited.
It is believed that the number of victims continues to grow since the number of bodies is still below the garbage, and to many it cannot be reached," the portfolio of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroh agency said.

Are you ready?" CNN report.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lomboka where more than 550 people were killed.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini reports that after the fall of a plane in a light face, it leads to a loss.
The airline whose aircraft crashed into a Pacific port in Micronesia reports that one face is running away as missing, after reporting earlier that all 47 passengers and crew members are safely evacuated from the plane that hit them.
Air Niugini, in the report, says that from Saturday afternoon they are not able to enter the passenger track.
The airline reports how in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and researchers work to find this man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the instructions for more detailed information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save the rest of the passengers and crew after the plane fell into the water in an attempt to land on Chuuk Island.
The officials announced on Friday that seven faces had been transferred to the hospital.
The airline reported that on Saturday six more passengers were kept in the hospital and that they were all stable.
It is still unclear what caused the fall and what was the exact outcome of the event.
And the airlines and the American sailors reported that the plane ended up in the harbor not reaching the bridge.
Some fathers think the plane flew through the gun.
American traveler Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
That's very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said how he and the others managed to get through to the emergency exits through the water that got them to a wire in the plane that hit them.
He said the crew was in the panic and screamed, and he suffered head injuries.
A U.S. Navy said that the sailors who worked near the port repairs also helped save the boat from a wave that the passengers moved to the coast before the plane landed at a depth of about 30 metres (100 feet).

The analyst reconstructed the follow-up on the night the woman was burned alive.
The investigation concluded on Saturday that the case was repeated against the accused man that he burned a live woman in Mississippi in 2014.
The American Ministry of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of reporting data analysis.
Before the jury, he explained how he used the cell phone data to create a picture of the move of the accused Quinton Tellis, aged 29, and the victims of Jesse Chambers, aged 19, on the night that her death took place.
Rowlett said he got the location data from several phones showing Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which was contrary to his earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was in the same place as Chambersin at the time he was with his own friends Michael Sanford, the police went to investigate Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he wasn't in town that day.
On the question of whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said that night was in Sanford's truck, Sanfrod said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another setback was that Tellis confirmed that Chambers met about two weeks before her death.
The cell data showed that they only met for one week.
Rowlett said Tellis was a certain time after Chambersin's death from his phone deleted her messages, calls and contact information.
He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defence should begin weekly with the introduction of the final words.
The judge said he expected the trial before the jury to be followed later in the course of the day.

Another black person?
The New York nanny's a couple of charges for rejection after racist text messages.
The New York nanny accused a couple of giving up on a discriminatory basis after she had received a text from the mother in which she complained that she was another black person."
A few deny that they are racist, estimating the complaint as an excuse."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, became dissatisfied when after her arrival on the first working day of 2016, she realized that she was the new parent of the children, Giselle Maurice, black.
There's no more CRNKINY," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent Mrs. Maurice twice.
When she became aware of her gauze, Plasco-Flaxman abandoned Mrs. Maurice, claiming that their former nun, who was an African, had done her job badly and that instead she was expecting a Philippines, she transferred New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received a grant for one day's work and the murder sent home.
Maurice now complains of a couple of appeals for exemption, as well as a donation of $350 per day for six months, to the extent that she is originally committed to living with the family, even without a contract.
I want to show them, you see, you can't do such things," she said on Friday for Post, adding that it's discrimination."
A couple of charges for racism revealed that the rejection of Maurice's engagement was reasonable because they feared that she would not be able to believe after they had offended her.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," he said for Post husband Joel Plasco.
But would you trust your children to someone you have hurt, even though it's done wrong?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
He qualified the complaint as an offer," Plasco said that his wife had only two months of maternity leave and that she was in a very difficult situation."
Are you going to shoot someone like that?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the public court was quick to condemn money on social networks, criticising them for such behavior and thinking.
The publishers of Paddington were afraid that readers would not agree with the bear who speaks, a new letter would be discovered.
The Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says about the letter: It's hard to put someone who reads it for the first time before the publication.
It's very interesting to know what we now know about Paddington's success."
She says that her father, who was, before he was a little drunk, inspired him to write a book for children, working for BBC as a cameraman, although he was positive if his work was rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was filled with happiness and sorrow after his death last year.
She added that her father was proud of Paddington, whom she described as a very important member of our family."
He was these men, he didn't like to praise," she said.
But since Paddington was so real for him, it was almost as if your child had achieved something and you were proud of him, although it wasn't actually your reward.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in some way.
Even though he was the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed all the benefits to Paddington alone."
My daughter died, and we had to apologize over the phone.
Her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors struggled to save her life.
Nad called regularly to say it was bad, and that they didn't expect to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called me to say she'll die in the next two minutes and I have to forgive her.
I did it, too.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, honey."
And I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave her so that her heart would continue to pump blood slowly and no longer flow through her bloodstream.
She died a few minutes ago, and everything stopped.
I could just sit and wait, knowing what's next.
I couldn't scream, cry, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be gathered."
At the end of Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was now in mourning for the death of her daughter, jumped into the plane with the rest of the passengers, who had never dreamed of what car she was going through.
No one knew," she said.
I lifted my head, and my tears went out of my face without interrupting.
It's hard to explain, but over the years, I've had a feeling of hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Sad women leave messages to prevent suicide on the bridge.
Two women who have committed suicide want to prevent others from taking life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreyes put cards with motive messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he started suffering from depression to commit suicide by 18 years.
I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis (45), who lives in Lydney, said her son was a prospector with a smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile would strike every room."
However, before his death he left his job because he was in a very dark phase."
Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after this 2014 suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm always worried that this will leave the consequences."
Mrs. Davis has designed those cards so people know there's someone you can talk to and who you can talk to, so at least it was just a friend.
Don't sit down and shut up and talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, who had been her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
He didn't say he's undepressed, depressed or anything else," she says.
A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his availability.
On Christmas he was on his own ground - when the children opened their gifts, he did not look at them in the eyes or anything else."
She says that his death was a huge tragedy for them, but that they had to cross it: It leaves a huge family holiday.
It's gonna blow us up.
But we will continue to fight."

With the opening of the FBI investigation, the future of Bretta Kavanaugh is uncertain.
I thought if we really managed to get something out of what he asked -- a limited investigation of the duration and scope -- maybe it would even unite us," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that the committee is afraid to break up because of disturbing foreign attitudes.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican allies not want an FBI investigation?
Their plight is caused by the moment's choice.
Elections for Congress are held for every five weeks, 6 November, and if Republicans go through the worst, as expected, their attempts to elect their man in the highest court in the country will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush called the senators on Saturday, lobbying for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him also met his wife Ashley, who was a personal secretary to Mr. Bush.
What will be after the FBI does its report?
There will be a vote in Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It remains unclear whether Mr. Kavnough could receive at least 50 votes in Senate, which would enable Vice-President Mike Penceu to decide and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court by his vote.
The number of escapes from North Korea falls below Kim.
The number of escapes from North Korea to South Korea declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, South Korean legislator said.
Calling for data from the Ministry of the Union of South Korea, Park Byeong-seug states that last year 1127 escapes were recorded in comparison with 2011 when that number was 2706.
Mr. Park said that two decisive factors are the stronger control of the border between North Korea and China and the higher rates that kidnappers pay.
Pyongyang didn't make it public.
The vast majority of refugees from the north will eventually be offered to South Korea.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Korean citizens have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War 1953.
Most run across China, which has the longest border with South Korea and is easier to cross than a strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between two Koreas.
China's escape is considered illegal to migrants, not refugees, and often returns them.
The relations between the North and the South - which have been technically still in the war - have been repaired in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang first to talk about the halted negotiations on denuclearization.
This followed a historic meeting between US President Donald Trumpa and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, on which a broad consensus was reached to work on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong blamed US sanctions for the current lack of progress.
Without confidence in the US there is no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances it does not take us to be one-sided," RI said in his address at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bretta Kavanaugh a hysterical," she said she was inconsistency to serve in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh a hysterical" and said that he was unable to serve in the Supreme Court because of his temperature.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't, but I didn't think that a woman would ever act like that would be called a hysterical," Pelosi said for his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotionally ignoring the allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while both were teenagers.
During his initial exhibition, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally screaming and screaming when he was talking about his family and his high school years,
He also strongly condemned the democracies in the committee, estimating the allegations against him by a gross and orchestrated attack on his personality" which organized liberal angers that Hilary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not function in the Supreme Court because it showed his fear of the damage to democracy.
I think he is disqualifying himself by such statements and the way he went against Clinton and Democrats," she said.
The question is whether he will try to call Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if the democracies get most in the House of Representatives, Pelosi has stopped.
I'll say the next -- if he doesn't tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he's not like being in the Supreme Court, but even in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanugh is currently the District Court of Appeal of Colombia.
Pelosi added how she was concerned as a Democrat for any Kavanaughi's trial against the Act on Accessory Health Protection or in the case of Roe v Wade, being regarded as a conservative judge.
In hearing of his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether he would exceed certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It's not time for a historical, fearful person to stand in court and expect us to say it's not wonderful," Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
A true heart, a rage that has been collected for months and years, and it cannot be resolved without payment.
We pay when we're angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, what do you say?"
She went on: She helped me a lot with a woman who was a executive director somewhere, and who said how she was crying when she was angry, but that she developed a technique that, when she got angry and started to cry, the person she'd talk to, you might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm mad."
And then she'd just keep going.
And I thought she was great."
Suspension is permitted to emit heat part and because they are basically misinformed.
One of my most clear memories of earlier work, in the office where most men were, is how, when I once cried because of an unrecorded heat, an old woman - the cold boss who was always a little scared - grabbed the door and pulled it out on the stairs.
I never let them see me crying," she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy because they think they've hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressional from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart at his presidential candidate.
When Mr. Hart was arrested in 1987 on the Monecky Business ship and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, she found that there was no reason not to consider the idea that she was also a candidate for president.
That wasn't a well-thinked decision," she told me through a smile 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it Snow and seven turtles."
Since the campaign was already delayed, she stayed with the collection of funds, so she said she wouldn't get into the race unless she got $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her clients who gave her $1,000 to men would give her everything to $250.
Do they think I have a break?" she asked.
When she announced in her speech that she was not going to launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotions - thanks to the people who supported her, frustration for the system that made it difficult for her to collect resources and target the voters instead of their representatives, and the whites for the cause of schovinism - from which she became pregnant.
You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Mrs. Schroeder how the press responded to her.
You'd think Klenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what would put me in my memory?
She cried?"
How a trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The first U.S.-China trade war cannons were impressive, and as the end of the battle is not yet over, the gap between the countries can have long been of benefit to Beijing, firm experts.
Donald Trump, the American President, was the first to be warned at the beginning of this year by the oppression of key Chinese export articles, including solar panels, steels and aluminium.
The biggest hit took place this week with the new tariffs that hit items worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion dollars), which are practically overloaded by half of all slaves coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has returned the same measure every time, and the latest introduction of the tariff from five to ten percent on American slave is worth 60 billion dollars.
China claimed that the US would respond the same way, and another, by the size of the world economy, seems to be not going to stop soon.
To force Washington to withdraw means to satisfy the demands, but the public cloning of the US would be too uncomfortable for Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say that, if Beijing plays its next move well, US neighbours in the trade war can for a long time positively support China by reducing the interdependence of two economies.
The fact that a fast political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the start of a hurricane crash in one of these two countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed," said Abigail Grace, a researcher whose focus is on Asia's New American Security Centre.
Syria is ready" for the return of the refugee, the Foreign Minister says.
Syria says it is ready for voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in the reconstruction of a war-ridden country that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouale said that conditions in the country are improving.
Today the situation in the field is much more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renew areas that have destroyed terrorists in order to restore normal lives.
Now there are all conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that were directed to their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million more people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mouelem said that the Syrian regime would be well able to help restore the country of origin.
However, he stressed that he would not accept the conditional aid or the aid of a country that had helped the rebellion.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018. The US final score was 16,5 to 10,5 in Le Golf National van Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six times on the European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned the crown while the Danish captain Thomas Bjorna team won 14.5 points that they needed to win over the United States.
American stars Phil Mickelson, who suffered during the entire tournament, shot a ball in the water on 16th floor par 3, leaving the sword Francesc Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all rounds, and became one of the four players who have ever reached 5-0-0 since the 1997 tournament began in this format.
American Jordan Speith lost 5-4 from Throbjorna Olisena from Denmark, the lowest ranked player of the European team.
The world's top ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 of Ian Poulter from England who might have been the last Ryder buyer.
Veteran with eight Ryder purchases, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the best European winner of all the time from the winning 25.5 points in the career.
I don't usually cry, but today I couldn't stand it.
It was a hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm very happy, I'm very happy we won the purchase again.
Here's an important team and I'm glad I could be of help," said emotional Garcia after the European victory.
The driver gives his country John Ramu, who won the legendary American golf player Tiger Woods 2 by 1 in each match on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up watching that man," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four swords in France and now holds a record of 13-21-3 careers on Ryder's Cup.
The unusual statistics for one of the best players of all time who won 14 biggest titles and only remain with Jack Nicklaus.
The American team suffered all weekend to find a way to the hole, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the top golf all the way through the tournament.
After the disappointing event of his team, American captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
It was a moment this morning when we gave Europe a break.
We didn't make it.
I'm gonna take Thomas's hat off.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with PGA America and our Ryder Cup team, and we'll go ahead.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to admit who's better.
We're overplayed."
