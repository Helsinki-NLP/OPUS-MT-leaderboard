I was poor like you.
They were thinking about how to get him out of there.
I have a better idea.
Take me with you.
Stop yelling.
Before you open the door, you'll be in a hurry.
Many Canadians don't.
Where are we going to find her?
I forgot the money on the night table.
The main city of the United States of America is Washington.
Tom's a big winter.
She doesn't like anyone.
But you like it!
Stay here!
Ken's bringing Tom.
I can go there in a hurry.
That's what we used to do.
Krysy doesn't like anyone.
Why didn't you call for help?
I couldn't stop laughing.
No one's set up.
I'll miss you when you leave.
He's eight years old.
Do you have these boots in my size?
Tom didn't see anything unusual.
Where are you from?
He saw him drop into the forest.
I'll do it now.
It was a huge and real relief.
I wish I hadn't been Tom.
Tom shouldn't just take a negative look at Mary's scaring.
Look, there's a cat in the kitchen!
He can't do it on his own.
You were in love with this man for your wealth.
Call him, please.
Me and Tom are guilty.
You shouldn't have eaten that.
He said he saw her there.
If necessary, press this button.
I guess you shouldn't eat it.
You still want to go with us next week to swim?
Almost anyone I know can swim.
He just writes his Chinese teacher's letter.
The company will complete its accounts at the end of the market.
Tea is one of the most popular hot drinks in the world.
Tom works at one Canadian company.
He's a dentist.
We've just started.
It's a shock!
If she thinks she made an idea of me, she's wrong.
Don't go too far.
I loved this place.
I don't know if that means anything.
I'm going to buy a new house.
It's all the money I have.
Georgian is probably one of the most difficult languages in the world.
Who could have taken Tom's place?
It was a hard test.
Tom's got three-year-old dog.
I don't read.
That's what he was doing at the party.
I'm not going to work.
I think they like you.
We've been here all our life.
You're twice as strong as I am.
Tom's got a lot of work to do this afternoon, isn't he?
We're advertising our products on TV.
He went to the hospital.
Stop lying.
It's our decision.
He made an improvement proposal.
I'm learning from eight to eleven.
When you stick to Tom's instructions, nothing can happen to you.
I've been thinking a lot about you.
He's my brother's sister.
The problem is, I don't remember where I parked the car.
She told him she hated smoking.
She said she was locked up.
Who's the writer?
It's like a bad dream.
This size is too big for me.
Then there was a host who had to endure until the light.
I had to protect them.
Do you like French wine?
I'd like to be your wife.
It's not normal for city life.
Who's there?
I barely know Tom.
Tell me more about Tom, and you've got a fall.
I really have to run.
What are you gonna do tonight?
No one told me you were waiting for me.
She took the photo back to her place.
I'm almost out of my chest, I'm fat, like a pig.
I don't like traveling by plane.
Tom's got a bad voice, a strong voice.
She's too young to be given.
I helped her get away with it.
Tom's younger than Mary.
He's a regular person.
Politicians are just lawyers, but that's not the least responsible for their actions.
The third battle is really good.
It's an old German habit.
The wicked will be seized and punished for their sins.
Tom and Mary are sitting on the porch and talking to each other.
Tom was only three years old when his father died.
He's been home for a while.
I lost my key.
Lisa's been dead for eight years.
We'll visit the Aquapark later.
We're very afraid of you.
Tom believes the roads to the moon have been submerged.
So don't look.
What's in your suitcase?
Tom's doing things I won't do.
Are you for his opinion or against him?
I told Tom not to give up.
Tom's not watching war movies.
You won't be alone.
I know it's a big demand.
Tom looks a little like Harry Potter.
They set up a new company in London.
He said he hated her.
He's got to admit your mistakes.
They took her to the castle and raped her.
I told him what I think of him.
When are you going to your new home?
I'm a black sheep family.
You're not going to miss anyone.
Mary was crying while Tom was talking.
You can't sell here.
I've got it back.
I was just venturing.
Sometimes I play chess.
I don't know if I can handle it myself.
I don't plan on being here that long.
If she's late, give her this message.
I don't think I can answer that.
Looks like it's funny.
I'm sorry I invited Tom and Mary to my wedding.
We have to fight alcohol.
Does it snow a lot in winter?
I hope this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
Is there something new?
What do you read about the book?
I can't sleep when the light shines.
I'm giving up!
Keep crying.
There was no water in the river.
I have clear evidence.
Tom will tell you.
Tom's threatened the death penalty.
Madrid is one of the most beautiful major cities in Europe.
He didn't do my surprise.
You still want to talk to me?
I'm very pleased with this conference tool.
He found in the woods of a abandoned dog.
The cat has eaten the mouse.
Can you drive?
You know who Tom's hiding in front of?
Women don't care about him.
They were in the shower.
I'm a little tired.
I believe Tom's right.
We have two children.
Finally, you understand everything.
Please, write down what he says.
It was a stupid idea.
It's in the details.
Do you like French wine?
The husband will be his wife.
Tom was my hero.
I've already started.
The time has come when we can travel through the universe.
Have you ever colored your hair?
My English is far from perfect.
Can you identify this man on the picture?
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.
Don't be a snob.
The loss of the work she loved so much for it wasn't hurt.
Tom wants to talk to you.
Next picture.
A lot of people are going to study in the library.
He's sitting next to his brother.
It's a year before the wedding.
There wasn't a lot of girls there.
The brain structure is complex.
You'll go right, then the second street left and then transport again. It'll be Karl's street and then you'll go right through Karl's bridge to the Mosteck Street and Malostransport.
The kids have fallen all night.
You can spend the night with us.
Marie kept saying she didn't do it.
The toilet paper isn't enough.
I'm not used to it.
Let's get a ten-minute stop here.
I don't like working in the garden.
What happened to you two?
I was born in Scotland.
I'm not that religious.
You shouldn't have told them.
You have to wake up early tomorrow morning.
No one's ever heard of that.
Is that a challenge?
You paid more than you had.
Forget I said it.
You broke your leg.
It's ice in the first month of the year.
I met a beautiful Hungarian girl.
Sloni's eating grass.
I'm a little tired of going there alone.
Mary doesn't like it when Tom's leaving the toilet ring up.
I'm gonna take care of it.
There's no water.
Time's playing for Tom.
I don't waste time on Tatoeb.
She invited you all.
Press the button!
That big flower is blue.
The air conditioning is broken.
Is Tom doing anything?
I can't move.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Who would believe your story?
That's how your mother thought.
Tom's in charge.
I'd like to travel and visit new places.
I really should have known.
Do you believe in love for first sight?
Is Tom on the line?
All my settings have been lost.
They're willing to talk about the problem.
Have you ever broken a tree?
I like music.
What do you want to buy?
Catholic priests practice celibate.
Four water.
Tom found out someone stole his wallet.
It's a Spanish village for me.
The dinner was full when he left.
She's a strong woman.
Japanese is my mother's.
Someone knew we were coming.
I'll give you everything you want.
He's sitting back to the corner.
All I told you is true.
He came to see me.
Do you really know who did this?
The cook prepares food.
I hit him at the end of the show.
We're asking for your unlimited capital.
Some of your answers are wrong.
I've paid for two newspapers.
I wanted to make Tom laugh.
The icebreaker is crossing the road through the ice.
You like college.
They gave me a name to honor my grandfather.
It's got to be over.
I'm tired.
Tom used to talk to Mary about that subject.
Have you decided what you want to order?
Tom wanted to jump out with the crash, but his family told him.
I can't answer Tom's request.
I'm very disappointed at how it happened.
We should go now.
These pearls look like they're right.
My sister started going to language school, learning English there.
I'm not sure about that either.
I heard Tom was bad for his last girlfriend.
Have you ever been abroad?
It was almost noon when Tom finally woke up.
Are we going to kill you?
It was over half an hour ago.
I'd like to know what's going on.
I can't believe him.
You don't know my real me.
It's an important decision for me.
How long have you been waiting?
She didn't know his address or his phone number.
There were snowstorms in Canada sometimes.
Tom's novel optimism starts to get me nervous.
It's my favorite.
When did Tom leave Boston?
Put the gun on the table.
Tom's changed a lot.
It's all wrong.
Tom was elected president of the government.
Tom likes to sing, doesn't he?
What do you hate?
I was in the doctor's office.
I'd like to know who's going to lead.
America rules the world.
My roommate's too busy.
You have to pay me for all my translation.
They don't believe in God.
He's already started to break up with me.
You could have done it.
I'm staying here.
Tom will need your help.
Don't touch me, bitch!
I've sacrificed myself all the time.
I know how you look.
Water is life.
You gave Tom a beer.
I heard some noise up there.
She got out of the way.
What are they living in?
And a little child would understand that.
You don't know why Tom wasn't here yesterday?
These two pieces are made of the same material.
Tom works at a restaurant in Boston.
You really did.
He spoke to me in Spanish.
A moment's neglect can make a pilot live.
How does it look?
The Commission accepted the proposal.
He's slowing her down.
Tom works in the garden.
Tom apologized for his delay.
He sat in the basement when I entered the room and lighted up.
Tom bought his sister a present.
Tom, I want to talk to you.
No one knows what's going on.
I want to know what you're doing here.
That's what caught the soup fish and Mary shot her.
What am I for?
Wash your hands with soap.
Tom's still in the hospital.
It's good to see you.
We didn't know which bus we'd go to.
Who killed Tom?
Tom's not upset.
I have questions about your plan.
He's calling me!
When do Christmas celebrations begin?
I'd rather go on a walk than wait for the bus.
I give priority to Czech food before those imported.
I'll decide on my own.
The train went to the station.
Tom's leaving until he gets what he wants.
It didn't make any sense to me that time.
I'm sure that's gonna bother you.
Is my answer right?
Happy to take the son of a dead mother.
"Will it be broken?" "I hope not."
This was my room.
I felt like I changed my job.
I'm trying to find a new job.
Tom apologized for his failure to study.
Tom stopped getting well.
Children learn by observing what adults do around them.
She used to live with him.
That's a serious problem.
It should be back every second.
I like winter.
They have no moral authority.
When was the last time you lived at the hotel?
You must be less impatient.
What do you know?
You think Tom's gone?
The whales aren't fish, they're probably hunters.
I wasn't the only one who saw him beat his wife.
Our dog's fruit and green.
The city seemed to be prospering.
Tom wanted Mary to wash her feet.
You must be crazy.
I brought you this.
Your blouse's going to that bitch.
He agreed to have a conversation with us.
I'll show you today from other pages.
Tom left his wedding with Mary in a hurry.
It's about where to go.
Just go on with it.
I knew you had a girl!
I don't know if he knows.
You don't have to swim here.
I'd like to thank you for your cooperation.
Tom immediately realized that Mary had a problem.
I don't like all this book.
We only won one game.
You know enough.
We're in front of the war.
I don't have a diet anymore.
We haven't bought a wedding tree yet.
The best days are those we haven't met before.
Looks like we're gonna have to do it.
Can you update my programs?
Time runs fast when you're having a good time.
You're the hottest girl I've ever seen.
I'm studying French and web design.
Tell me what you want, she's the one I'll take.
Tom's listening to music.
I'm a Hungarian.
Tom's talking to Mary.
It's beautiful seen from a distance.
He's in the train.
I know his name.
He didn't know what to say.
People will have words.
I was thinking about his aunt last night.
I don't like going out when it's cold.
I went there by train.
No one's seen Tom lately.
So what's that?
You're new, too?
Tom wrote a book about his life in prison.
Someone attacked Tom.
It's normal in this situation.
I've got a lot of friends, especially from my mother's side.
Now let me think.
You did it once.
Tomorrow I'll buy everything I need.
What did he want?
Let's say we didn't hear that.
I thought Tom was home and asleep.
He lost her.
The moon is beautiful on the floor.
You shouldn't wait here.
We have a special offer for you.
It's awfully painful here.
He left his coffee at the office.
Do you remember?
Good luck dealing with bad luck.
That really doesn't make any sense, does it?
What's the temperature of the ice?
Not everyone shares that view.
I won't be working too long today.
Tom suggested we do it tomorrow.
I told Tom that Mary wanted to borrow his mandolin.
"Lissat", the name of Hungarian writer Ference Liszta, means "muk" in Hungarian.
Tom's got a bloke.
I'm going to the hospital today.
He died yesterday.
Tom died last October.
Being well adjusted to a very sick society is not evidence of health.
Some things are hard to forget.
Did I pick you up?
I've never done that to you.
Better late than never.
Now's the right time.
I'll give you five bucks.
Boys and girls are playing in the garden.
No one likes you.
We have an English hour every week.
That's not why Tom wants to do it.
You should've come.
I'd like to know why.
My cousin's a journalist.
I'm in a cry.
I won't need it.
Who else is on that list?
They didn't apologize to me.
In the afternoon, we spent the lunch of the monsters.
I'll do my homework.
I also like watching lesbian movies.
This lie caused him trouble when his boss found out the truth.
That's what Mary said she's spending the night in Boston.
I learned something new.
It took us only three hours.
Everything has its purpose.
I'm making a lot of stupid decisions.
Mary was supposed to feel like Tom took her eyes off her.
Both of my sons are crazy about football.
Tom felt his cell phone vibrating.
I know Finsky.
By Monday, let us know how you decided.
He told me about you.
You'll be famous.
My house is conveniently close to the beach.
How much did they pay you?
I have to teach Mary English.
You see that guy in there who's got a black band on him?
Marie chose a virgin.
She's not a good girl.
There's one way.
Tom told me he didn't like life in Boston.
What makes one man smarter than the other?
Would you believe that October is almost over?
Did you ask for a job in this company?
I'm not going anywhere.
I need to talk to him.
You want me to call the rescue?
The hot season is over.
Tom broke his pants.
We got her here.
Anorexia still ruled her life.
You shouldn't go out without a gun.
The borders may remain closed for two years.
Tom's home for about three hours.
The results of your test will be delivered by mail.
It's harmless.
You think Tom's telling the truth?
Your parents were watching us.
Joga can improve human health and well-being.
If it's still hot, I'm moving north.
Tom got his phone out.
Tom suddenly became famous.
The girl killed Tom.
You smell good.
Give me more money.
What are the exact dimensions of this room?
I'll be 30 in October.
I'm glad to ride the train.
I need your dog and three photos.
My team makes ten people.
Blues like fish.
It's a very sharp knife!
Tom's my older brother.
It's time to go.
I have to tell Tom something.
I just hope there's nothing wrong with this time.
I've never been quite good at math.
I can't wait for him anymore.
Tom saw the train.
This time the test was not only difficult but also a number of ways to answer questions.
Now I have to leave, but I'll be back.
You can't park there.
Last night, we got water pumped at home with water.
He's in Tokyo.
They're cold everywhere.
Where was he in October?
Have you read it yet?
My mother, you're reading a magazine.
It was discussed.
What could I do better?
Where's Paris?
You speak English?
Please, don't forget to laugh before you leave.
It's been a year since she was here.
You're not the only one who's afraid of heights.
Last week, I wrote to Mr. Wood, and I asked him to give you a job at the farm.
She answered you.
Tom carefully checked the equipment.
We agreed that we should go to five-day working weeks.
My attitude is full of anger.
We had no choice but to go on foot.
This was a coffee shop.
I'm not pushing you.
Remember when you kissed me first?
My father will be in May forty-five years.
What's the French humor?
I'd like to open my eyes to Tom.
Leo's making a lot of fat.
It seems to be very sleepy.
It doesn't seem good to me.
I'm studying.
"I'm a teacher." "I'm also."
He surprised his opponent.
Do you believe in death?
Helena likes to play tennis.
We're not going back to the normal state, because the normal state was a problem.
That's how you solve all your problems?
I have the same dictionary as your brother.
Teaching little children to swim doesn't bother me.
Mary's missing her husband and children.
I had a problem like that.
We have to do this.
She's got her face torn.
I don't like to tell you that you're no industrialist, not even a factory worker.
I'll let you catch me.
This is the wind that's got the right number of bad on the shark.
I'm glad to ride the train.
My kids like to sing in the car.
That's what I'm reporting on.
They like English.
We only have one mouth.
I wish I'd been waiting.
I demand Tom to be held responsible for his actions.
He tried to get the meat, but he didn't have enough sharp knife.
I often do homework before dinner.
Mary lied about her age.
This woman is a teacher.
Because Tom was sick, he went to the hospital.
I want every one of you to be as quiet as a mouse.
What's helping to heal the cough?
Last year I read more than five hundred books.
Tonight, he entered the garden of a young man who tried to exploit one of the sheep, mostly.
It's been a few days.
Second is a measure of time unit.
She didn't want to have anything to do with him.
He was sexually abused by an older man in the bus.
There's a lot of smoke on me.
Who are you talking about?
It's not easy to get along with idiots, sometimes it's impossible.
It's not making enough money.
I'm getting up late on the weekend than usual.
I think Tom is responsible for Mary's nerve cramp.
You don't have to dance unless you want to.
I didn't know Tom was from Australia.
I had to change my plans.
Here, use my key.
Is there a public beach near here?
He answered wrong.
He looked at his beautiful tulip.
You didn't buy it or you didn't.
I think you still don't know what the word "the team" means.
I didn't expect that to happen so much.
I talked to Tom before the study.
Tom's only got one varle.
We gotta get out of here.
That's ours.
He thinks his job doesn't make sense.
They're always careful.
I'm a little curious.
Everyone can get hurt.
They're alone now.
Lisa came too late.
She broke the knife.
We've been enemies for a while, but we've made peace, and now we have a good relationship.
It won't work now.
Tom taught Mary how to eat five bread.
Sit down.
Juliana told me you were from São Paulo.
She looked suspiciously at me.
There was no reason to suspect Mary was lying.
Tom tried to get Mary out.
This law was adopted in 1918.
I thought it could happen.
Just a few people have a writing machine.
She's had a great deal of training.
There is a need for real change.
I don't know and I don't want to know.
He confessed to stealing gold.
I thought it was a joke.
Next year, I'll be your French teacher.
Neither Tom nor Mary has a driver's license.
I wanted to open my own restaurant.
I'm not afraid of you, Tom.
I want you to read this book.
I'd rather not have Tom come.
Why don't you come?
I couldn't understand what he said.
I'm afraid I'll be here forever.
I want to learn the Netherlands.
You look like my sister.
Tom was sitting in a book-reading window.
Tom was too eager to continue his work.
Did you hear about Tom?
Tom refused to talk to me.
I can't afford to have a car.
I'm glad to see you again.
I don't want to get you into it.
I don't like her.
That table is hard.
I'm glad I learned that.
What's going to happen to you when you see this picture?
You're going to lend me your bike?
You like elephants.
Let your dreams come true!
Mary believes Tom is possessed by the devil.
I don't care if you have a lot of work.
Some stars began to appear on the night sky.
Take your past without regret.
Smoking matrice may not be as comfortable as sleeping, but it's much better than sleeping on the floor.
You've noticed that.
Nice to read.
The wings of the eagle are over a meter.
I need to spit out my mouth.
That agrees with my idea.
By limiting mass consumption, we can improve the environment.
She's falling apart.
This gives her lessons.
You're leaving because you just got here.
If you want to go fast, go alone, but if you want to go far, let's go together.
I can't be anything I'm not.
Show me what you got in your left hand.
Everything depends on your decision.
You've got three days.
This is the right diamond.
I'll work on the garden all morning.
On the phone.
The Court of Justice has declared the case in question.
Tom claims he's been kidnapped by aliens.
How long does it take the engine from your house to the office?
There's nothing to add!
I don't think Tom deserves it.
I visited his house often.
I bought a lot of books.
Children often hate spying.
Tom sat in the window and read the book.
Tom ignored Mary's work.
If you want, you can come.
I know about him, but I don't know him personally.
He never heard Mary lie.
I can see more.
I need to get rid of the tattoo.
Tom's back in health.
It's time for you to let go of it.
That's what Mary did.
Why do you want me to go there?
It still doesn't have the courage to tell Mary what he did.
The smaller businesses are likely to have to close.
She's just a little shy.
Tom turned the wall into the wall and found it on the water tube.
I saw Tom playing tennis.
I didn't call you.
How did you say they were called?
It was nice to spend the night with such a smart, funny and beautiful girl like you.
How many rooms do they have?
The train crashed and caused panic among the passengers, but no victims were reported.
This is an important decision.
Tom went shopping with Marie.
We're used to waiting.
I realized that the bus driver couldn't speed it up.
Tom's a very handy dealer.
The Moscow Metro runs up to one hour in the morning.
Tom's gonna take his wife away.
I can't fix it.
Tom lived in Australia when the war started.
Didn't you say Tom was dead?
Tom did it after school.
Tom attacked an unknown man in the subway.
She likes pure, acid green.
He seems to have found a lot of money.
Where is he?
Tom's not willing to do this.
The tragedy is the cause of death that can be prevented.
He can afford to buy a house, not a car.
Talk for yourself.
I want to be a ballet dancer.
Hey!
You'll never tell me what you really think.
He knew that guy.
How many hours did you do that?
What place are we in?
Where exactly should he be?
Tom's dependent on drugs, but he doesn't want to tell anyone.
Dad stopped drinking.
He's got to get out of there.
Does that apply to our family?
The bear is able to get out of the tree.
This game was so unsatisfied that we both had sex with Tom.
Tom missed the video.
Mary won't want to do that.
This year, I want to read as many English books as I can.
I see white lion.
You shouldn't have hired Tom's car.
Should I know you?
I'm just eating.
I don't like teachers who like students who don't ask questions.
What do your neighbors think?
I went on my way.
We're not used to it.
How many people know you're alive?
How do you know Tom?
I like them.
I need her.
Tom wrote three books.
It's usually early to get up.
I had a very long hair.
Math is the most beautiful and powerful creation of human spirit.
You got the same chance, but you missed her.
The dog's name.
It's singing.
I'm working here.
I had the impossible to solve the problem.
Everything I said was true.
They took part in this.
Tom's waiting for you inside.
I have to get Tom out of here.
I'm just as old as Tom.
Tom told me he wasn't hungry.
Mary didn't wait.
Tom told me he was running.
He ended up in the fifth place in the race.
Her boss was a father to her.
She got divorced with her husband.
As usual, he's late and he's been waiting for us for a long time.
People love each day.
You have to do it now.
I don't like teaching kids to swim.
It's a palace.
Call me, okay?
The Bedouins live in the desert.
He did everything that Mary wanted him to do.
When it's dry, it's raining.
Then she gave me a kiss.
The coaches put their hands up after the game.
You think I'm fat?
That's what Tom said.
What law did I break?
Thank you, that's all.

You're hot.

I like astrology.
He immediately dismissed her.
Of course, I can translate it, for I am sure that everything, even impossible, can be translated; and what cannot be translated is that the heart may be translated.

I need you.
"I can't find Tom." "Try to call him."
She lived there alone.

How can we contact you?
I already did.
You can believe that.
I had to go.

I always wondered what would happen if I did.
They were surprised at what they saw.
I decided I wouldn't help you anymore.
Write a letter to his daughters.
There must be some way to get through the river.

I almost don't know Tom.
You didn't write anything.
I'm so sorry I couldn't help.

Tom needs a cup of coffee.
This is a very old picture.
I've got an elephant.
I was shocked by their killings against us.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I'll do my homework.
You should be there this week.
Tom doesn't want to talk about it.
I don't imagine life like this.
Why don't you trust Tom?
Why are you still working?
Does anyone know where Tom went?
I knew you were coming.

She's crazy and stupid.
Our neighbors offered us a pigeon.
You're gonna get used to it.
He still lives with his parents, even though he's thirty.
Mary was shocked by what Tom suggested.

So, what do you want to do tomorrow?
It's hot early. It's fast.
Tom has no assistant.
He didn't understand anything Mary said.

I'm afraid it's gonna rain.
I'll get less this time.
I told her I didn't even understand her.
Tom hates dogs.
We're looking.
That's what happened last night.
You're really incorrigible, yes!

The bedrooms see in the dark.
Why don't you explain all this to Tom?
I really hate him.
We're touched by what you are.
That's when I said I needed air.
Are you dancing?
My older sister is a year older than his wife.
Are you sure you don't want to do this?
I don't want to go back.
They don't want us to return the passports.
People should first look for their own.
Tom seems tired.
It's me.
You can change it if you want.

Tantal is a chemical first with Ta tag.
The cat has nine lives.
How could you do this to me after everything we've been through?
Why would Tom leave?
My door is always open.
I bought two karaokes.
You didn't hurt anyone, did you?
Be careful about this child.
Would you like that?
That's the coffee I'm paying.
Don't lose hope.
Such weight doesn't hurt.
Tom helped Mary.
Call her tomorrow.
I didn't see that.
Tom and Mary were spies.
They're playing at home.
I don't know why I'm still in trouble.
I'm not as efficient as I used to be.
Tom's dog's got a couple of blinds.
Don't forget Tom's blind.
Mary seemed to be a widow.
I don't like any desserts.
When Tom came home last night, he found out there was no more dinner on him.
He knows her.
They must be very proud of their daughter.
Tom got in the way, and Mary got out on the other side.
One's gone.
He started to explain what happened.
Tom's got a lithium ice cream, he can eat almost anything.
Mom didn't know what to do with her son.
He knows wine.
It felt like someone put his arm on his shoulder.
You know who the parents are?
No words will show how amazing you are.
I'd like a cup of tea.
Is it gonna rain tomorrow?
The font used by Sumery was found in many languages in the ancient Middle East.
I love summers, but I can't keep it cold.
Of course it is!
Mary likes you.
What are you doing?
What does that mean?
Where have you been all afternoon?
You found a sympathetic guy.
He did it out of jealousy.
She washed her hands before dinner.
I didn't talk to anyone about it.
Don't get too used to it.
I'm thinking of taking a couple of days off.
Tom never speaks French to me.
Tom left it on the desk with a high-performance desk.
It's not over the beer cup after the whole day's work.
She doesn't know any of us.
I've been at peace with my work so far.
Do you really need help?
Be you, I'll ask him.
Let it be for us.
I got a map here.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to the meeting, even when they invited me.
Hey, are you still here?
I thought you were going with Tom.
I've got to get to the next station.
That dream was for me.
You must have paid a lot for him.
It's obviously a lie.
So straight and then transport and then?
I need you tomorrow.
Why don't I have no food in the refrigerator?
It was just an accident.
I'll still have to call you.
Tom says he'd like to win.
Tom's gonna be 30 seconds late.
Put that mass on the thin plates.
I can't see how he lives.
Do everything in your power.
I'm only buying soft toilet paper.
Yeah, you have to.
We went to the top of Mount Fuji.
My wife and I want to go to Boston with you.
You remember what she was like?
I'm so happy about that.
It's not easy playing on the stage.
She took this job just to please her husband.
Moscow is Russia's main city.
Buy as much as you want.
Tom was concerned about the matter.
We drink a lot of beer.
Would you send Tom to my office, please?
I bought it for Tom.
You shouldn't be acting selfishly.
The old habits are dying fast today.
Tom's still got a lot of work to do.
You'd better get out of here right now.
Tom's innocent.
It's nice to read.
We've done this exercise.
I don't like to hurt you, I just came to apologize.
It can't help us tomorrow.
Tom stopped crying.
The train had to stop because there was a falling tree on the other side.
What was Tom calling for?
He's an ideal husband to me.
She's not as beautiful as her older sister.
I brought you lunch today.
We're going to a party in the costumes from the seventh century.
Are you satisfied with your body?
Can I talk to Tom?
I used to admire Tom.
With great effort, he jumped onto the tree.
Translating Czech text is very difficult.
It's probably the only one who knows the truth.
Tom's gone too.
We already know that, Tom.
I'm glad you warned me.
I left this morning.
You lied to me.
It's a beautiful language.
I won't be home for a week.
Who sent you there?
We've been running for the manager on the floor in the next room.
You're a kind person.
Can you ask Mary to ask Alice?
His skills qualify him for this job.
They're falling bodies.
She was alone in the dark.
Tom didn't have to tell Mary the truth.
Open your eyes.
I know Tom's wife.
Do you have a pen?
They don't help.
I like that tie.
We didn't bring ourselves as well as we wanted.
Please close the door.
I'll be back tonight.
Have you ever had a conversation with Joan?
You don't owe me anything.
You scared me.
The girls I met today were students.
The area is covered with dark clouds.
I need it more than you do.
You bought a car.
I'm afraid I'll stay here forever.
You gave it to Tom.
What should I do in this situation?
You're driving to school with train?
Tom won't be in school today.
I'm hurting Tom.
Who's Tom visiting?
It's Tom, not Mary.
What if you were to invite me to the locker?
Why doesn't Tom want to answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I can't answer that question.
I don't know exactly what Tom bought.
There's another question.
Don't surprise me when that happens.
He's free.
These people don't usually say.
Ask your mother.
Tom had a very soft leg.
Did you eat this morning?
Jana was as happy as she was when she got the recording contract.
I wish you were with us.
He's been working a lot of time on his computer.
We wouldn't be in this mess if you were to help us.
I don't know what to do anymore.
He's visiting his uncle.
They're all out.
Tom couldn't hear it, but Mary did.
I can give you an autograph if you want.
I saw him three years ago.
How could anyone live in such a place?
It's been two days.
I know exactly what's going on.
Did you ever sing in French?
I'm used to this cold weather.
The Americans were surprised by the Germans.
There's not enough cross in the conference room.
That's not enough.
I told Tom he was a false friend and he got hurt.

He's stuck on her.
I came to school late this morning.
I've been involved in this quest.
I went straight to bed.
We shot at a mine in the river.
Tom never had a hard drink.
Tom's not working.
My heart is French, but my background is international.
If you have a problem, I want to know what it is.
Tom fell for Mary's hand.
I'm just happy.
You did what you had to do.
We need to understand that we're still learning.
Tell Tom I won't be there.
Tom played with Mary Tennis yesterday.
What's your dad's name?
They've been here half of the walls.
I talked to him in English and found out I could talk to him.
Tom had to run.
I see the book.
Did any of you ever talk to Tom?
You should apologize.
That plane is freshly loaded.
She knows who you are.
I want you to see her.
Well, you'll regret it.
You're out of your mind.
We should win.
All replies must be written according to instructions.
Answer my questions.
Everyone would be happy if Tom left and he didn't come back.
Did you bring this book?
I don't care to open my mouth.
Their father is Czech and their mother comes from Hungary.
I'm thinking about getting divorced with her.
I bought one bag.
Do you know where your father is coming from?
What are you?
Did you do that?
There was no doubt about it.
This letter is personal, I don't want someone else to read it.
If I know, she's not married.
I can't say anything wrong about Tom.
Get up there and you'll see that better.
He's old enough to stand on his own feet.
As soon as we saw what Tom's got on us, we were able to make fun of him.
It's wrong, isn't it?
Better to be dead than hard to live.
They agreed that the wedding was delayed.
If I were you, I'd go home.
It would be great if you did it for me.
Tom knows what he's saying.
The wedding took place last week.
I still have it.
The horse's dry.
I borrowed Tom's grave.
I'm bored.
I'm writing my promise.
I'm not that kind of gun anymore.
You won't believe what Tom just told me.
Mary doesn't have to talk to anyone, but she doesn't feel lonely.
If it doesn't rain tomorrow, we'll go to the tower.
Try talking to the police.
You like to be slanted.
I don't want to change anything.
Barman, I'll have something to drink.
Do you like ice cream?
It was bigger.
I guess he's gone home.
I was in the woods.
Tom's drunk.
He asked me to wait there before he came back.
I made a terrible decision.
I'd rather be back inside.
She doesn't have to.
I know it's nice.
I'm not going to school on Sunday.
He owns his own house.
I don't usually do it tonight.
Why do you want me to ask them for help if we can manage it on our own?
I was waiting for them to tell the truth.
Put it under your armpit.
I'm so glad you're here.
She's beaten.
He didn't want to lose Mary.
Tom's home.
Bring that balloon to Tom.
I'll hurt her.
Was the police involved?
We like kids.
I wish I'd be a better man.
You're stealing, huh?
Tom's got to be involved.
You should consult a lawyer first.
You're a good journalist.
That's Tom's usual.
I love this book.
The waste is gone again.
When I came home from work, I found out someone stole our apartment.
Read this book.
This was a bakery.
My father's holding a restaurant.
You're really boring.
I like some movies.
This works.
Let go of it.
I'd like to make more money.
I know you're not still calm.
Can this report be true?
He's got it easy, he's gone.
Remember that you've seen me before?
I want to help, but I'm temporarily distracted.
Without her help, I would never have put this test.
You wouldn't be happier if I told you.
Can you turn from French to English?
A lot of people were waiting for him.
Tom told Mary she wasn't planning to come with us to swim.

In England, the reader asked us, "How many beer would you give yourself, half pints, or whole?" Because we had no idea how much it could be, we asked him to show us the score.

I like fish.

I feel a lot better than a minute ago.
We're working together.
Tom said the most difficult language for him was Finnish.
How many people can do that?

Is the hotel far from here?
It won't be easy to get her out.

What green do you want to buy?
She's a girl.
We've been looking around.
Did you find the one you said you lost recently?
His mother was a singer.
Did you know Tom was unhappy?
Don't jump into words when we're talking.
Please wait a minute.
The moon was the only source of light.
Tom's crazy.
I wish I'd bought a list of the concerts.
Come on, please, home as soon as possible.

He admitted he didn't sleep for three days.
They're all good guys.
The police can't find her.
Can I see him now?
Tom broke his cell phone.
The evil witch has locked up her husband and turned into a witch.
Where have you been?
I don't think there's any connection here.
I'm just getting a little excited.
He's supposed to go to school.
You can't do this.
Is Tom still sick?
Where have you been?
You're not stupid because you don't want to.

They just started drinking.
You can stop now.
How long do we have to wear clothes?
Tom's suffering Mary's life.
Don't give up!
I love both of you very much.
That's always leaving the computer busy.
How are you friendly with Tom?
Tom's busy preparing breakfast for his family.
Why didn't I know that?
You liked chocolate.
He's got attractive eyes.
I miss those things.
You're too young to marry.
What's your wife's name?
I hit his girlfriend.
I'll see you later, Tom.

I have nothing to do with this incident.
I'm gonna get you some pants in the bag.
Sylvia loved those concerts.
I opened the door.
Have you talked to them lately?
We did the same thing.

I'll be 28 in the morning.
He's talking too fast.
Do you think Boston is a quiet town?
Can I help you with something?

It's getting closer.
Do you remember what I told you?
We like Tom.
Don't lose your mind, Mike.

Tom, don't leave me!
I'm starting to understand.
Tom seemed kind.
It looks like it's too dangerous.

You used to like me sometimes.
It's acting like it belongs to him.
Tom was boring.
To be honest, I don't like Tom.
Tom said it wasn't his duty to take care of Mary.
He wants to be patient, to do it.

I'm sorry I can't tell her that.
They screamed.
I haven't seen you in a while.
You ran as fast as you went.
I've never really seen it.
I don't want to live with you.
Tom told me that Mary hates it.
I won't be able to tell you what happened.

He likes music.
Where did you get this engine?
I'm not the one you think I am.
Tom should be told not to do it anymore.
The situation has changed.
We talked about a couple of options.
I'm a hero.
When we're together, it looks like the time has stopped.
I'll call her right away.
She likes my hat?
What did they do to him?
This is a much more natural way to learn the vocabulary.
What would you do if you were in my place?
I love the sound of church bells.
Where's the boy?
The truth is, I can't even get French.
Bring it in here.
You better ask Tom.
Always be on the grid.

Why don't you want to wear a tie?
Let's all be friends.
