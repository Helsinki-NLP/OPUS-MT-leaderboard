It'll be ten minutes later.
We waited for him yesterday.
Tom said Mary was low.
Where's the exit?
If I remember correctly, Tom sold his car to Mary for only $500.

He's deaf and he's moving, and he's getting blind.
I still have to finish my tasks.
Tom didn't want coffee.
He won't believe us.
Don't try to scare me.
I'm proud of you.
Tom can't get Mary out of his head yet.
I can cook.
I play basketball with them.
I was from the barbie.
Speak slowly, please!
Tom has long hair.
Don't relax too much about it.
Do you believe in ghosts?
Did you know that Tom and Mary are good at golf?
Who are you to decide?
Why don't the police stop Tom?
He's pulling her out.
It's still in the kitchen, right?
I can't talk to my girl.
At least he's not fixing his heart.
Let me tell you why I don't like Tom.
How did you get in?
I've been bluffed at the exam because I didn't study.
He was ready.
We need to find Tom before he gets old.
Don't wait for pity.
John told you the truth.
I don't think it's gonna happen.
We'll miss your smile.
If time allows, we leave in an hour.
I'm not as lucky as you.
Tom and Mary asked for the best working conditions.
It's important for you to keep this secret.
We should start looking for Christmas gifts for children.
She refused to pay.
Tom called his dog Cookie.
I'm sorry.
Tom decided to buy a house.
I'm too young to drive a car.
He's stronger than me.
I'm the last one you've seen.
The guard.
That man is a soldier.
I thought Tom was guilty.
I made that song so much that I could do it while I was asleep.
I want to borrow your car for an hour.
I can't stop laughing.
South Africa became independent in 1961.
I think Tom's eating right now.
I could've done better.
I have some English book.
Can you make them laugh?
Tom can go if he wants to.
I want to work with you.
I like to wear sports clothes.
Why were you so short?
Tom and Mary were running for the weekend.
I don't even have a job.
I like to imitate Queen Elizabeth.
We should have told him the truth.
I'm so proud of them.
Who is he?
Is the supermarket open tonight?
I told Tom exactly what I saw.
Mr Suzuki teaches us English.
What's the best way to travel?
Tom lives with you?
What's the problem, dear?
I don't want them angry.
Is Tom really sick?
He didn't wash his hair.
I read your letter yesterday.
He goes to the supermarket once a week.
Can I marry my aunt's husband's mortgage?
I believe them.
She was interested in her son's luggage.
I said it was good.
I have no reason not to trust Tom.
He was the first to help her.
And the kids are already asleep?
We have to wait here.
I'm Chinese.
Tom wasn't very active.
We cleaned the way from the snow yesterday.
I don't care about anything now.
Tom doesn't think he'll win.
Maybe he should listen.
He's a brilliant artist.
Give me a kiss, boys.
I like your painting.
I waited for an hour and a half.
I'm not good at mathematics.
Tom refused to say what he did.
I don't like his hat.
I can't be happy when Tom's so sad.
I want to share this with you.
Study at the University of Hyogo.
We'll take part in the marathon.
Maybe you should tell her.
I know what to study.
His life was going on without problems.
Nobody wants to help us.
They speak very quickly.
Tom was lucky at first.
It's urgent to go to the bathroom.
Mary really looks like her mother.
He didn't have money to buy the farm.
How often do you go to the movie?
Are you religious?
Did he talk to you?
Are there a lot of holes in these parts?
Tomorrow, if God will, we will be with your parents.
It's from Sweden.
He didn't have money to buy the farm.
Did you really believe it?
Tom decided to sell his car.
I don't like fishing with ice cream.
I feel protected.
You're the tallest.
Isn't this fun, Tom?
Tom was born on October 20th.
It's a nice picture.
I'll leave her alone.
Tom won't even keep me.
We humiliated them.
He's already here.
I know who my enemy is.
Tom has to sleep now.
Tom's not honest.
Tom's father is a cop.
Tom's working here?
That's what Tom was looking for.
What did you do to her?
Tom wanted to send a message.
I wasn't happy to see them.
Don't hurt my heart.
I didn't plan for tonight.
Stop being sarcissistic!
She was crying.
I wish I could be rich like you.
We're having fun.
He's insane.
I read books often.
Tom and I want to talk to you about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom got angry.
I'm old.
I've got the dirty criminal feds.
Good night, my friend.
I bought a book in English in a library.
Tomorrow I'm going to the library to buy books.
What would the world be without women?
They tell us some interesting stories.
Can you hear what Tom is saying?
What's your favorite historical film?
We can't see her.
Tom and I still love each other.
Tom needs to eat.
All right, everybody.
The giant pandas live only in China.
I'm coming after you.
Don't say something like that.
It's worse!
Jim's Canadian.
You've done well here.
Where have all the others gone?
I'm relaxed.
The animal was hunting in the field.
He entered his private life.
Can I borrow your knife?
I'm late for a appointment.
Tom's still absent.
I ate all the honey.
Stop the bakri while the pen is heated.
Is the park open today?
We're just preparing yogurt food.
We're leaving Boston tomorrow morning.
We can't leave you there.
Tom was playing football.
Stop balbetting.
I know her.
And the real heroes are us.
We're waiting for Tom.
Unfortunately my birthday is only once a year.
Take your bike off.
I understood it as a compliment.
They called President Roosevelt pirate.
I could go to the movies.
It's not an appointment.
It makes me nervous.
Who do you think she told them?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to her!
You're good at this game, aren't you?
Take care of them.
I live on those Fiji islands.
You want to eat with us?
It doesn't seem so surprising.
I'm not going to school on Saturday.
It's my job to protect you.
Tom's infinity, isn't he?
Is this geaby intended to protect you from the snakes?
Tom wants to know Mary better.
I'm very disappointed.
Tom wants more coffee.
Who do you think is the author of this novel?
I'd like you to call me.
Don't you want to use it?
I sounded the trumpet when I was younger.
I'm faithful.
To write in the braille?
I don't know what he's got.
I'm free today.
Why do you want to kill us?
I'll eat a meal.
I caught him.
He's adopted the orphanage.
I imagine they speak French.
Take a step forward.
You have to become more active.
Tom and Mary are kidding?
He's a smoker.
I don't have an alternative.
I think Tom knows who lives in that house.
He's smarter than he is.
What's this summer gonna do?
He got angry.
Can you speak Shanghai?
He's stuck because I washed him.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.
Tom asks what happened to Mary.
Something bad happened to them.
How much was paid?
They didn't touch anything.
Do you like the horror movies?
I know a lot about animals.

Am I in London?
She's still there with her, right?
This will make a big difference.
Tom didn't have much money with him.
Tom doesn't have a big appetite.
Were you with them that night?
I was running.
The village was dead after the trauma.
What's your favorite rapper?
Hello, Tom.
It's good to see her so happy.
I'm usually tired of summer.
Why are you going soon?
I'm rather proud of him.
I smell gas.
I'll tell them it's not true.
Here's a picture of her.
I can rely on my friends.
The experiment confirmed its theory.
Tom's lucky.
Pass me the ketchup, please.
It's happened that I sat next to you at a convention.
There are no furniture left in the room.
Tom presented himself soon for the lesson.
It's a little bit weird, isn't it?
Who's the man who's singing the piano?
I've decided not to repeat it.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You have to listen to Tom.
Sleep in the car.
Tom and I are going to Boston with Mary.
He spent all his drinks.
Search more closely on Google!
It's not the only problem with your idea.
You're talking like you were the boss.
You want me to go with you?
I came to see her.
Does it look familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So, what should I tell him?
He's getting worse.
Do you have any instruments?
They're gonna die?
I really like it.
Are you going in?
Tom pushed her.
I don't have feelings.
She's incredibly stupid.
We're landed on a lonely island.
He wants us to be careful.

You're good.
How would you like to change it?

I can't raise our son alone.
Go get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I love to be right.
Tom married a rich Boston girl.
I forgot whether to drink wine or not.
Who warned them?
I had faith in God.
"I'll give it 50 miles for this statue. "Who will offer more?"
Why would anyone want to shoot her?
He should have bought a used machine.
I intend to stay at the hotel.
I didn't grow up like that.
He can park here.
Please tell him to get out of here.
Tom's just dressed up.
I like it almost every day.
I'm not going to apologize.
We really like a lot of picnics.
I haven't talked to him yet.
It was a warm summer evening.
I'll always walk.
It's decisive.
You're not very fun at parties, are you?
He searched for the keys of the car in his bag.
I really don't want to talk.
So it has to be Argentina.
I really like my work.
I'll suggest you be more careful.
It's gone.
He should've done it yesterday.
I'm a big fan of American cuisine.

We're aware of the risks.
I was home.
You found him dragged on the bed.
I bought some flowers.
We're just making some yogurt food.
Pay attention to them.
You don't respect him.
I just told you the truth.
I'm no longer a teacher.
Tom told us a sad story.
I'm reading a magazine to cover time.
If that day comes, the game will be postponed until the next day in which it will be beautiful.
What time am I now?
Could you be my teacher?
Do you want a ride home?
I love my cousins very much.
I was in the bathroom.
I'll start working soon.

He's not listening to me.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Don't eat anything.
I want to hear a story.
It's time to study seriously.
How brave you are!
I told them not to use those.

I'll be here tonight.
Take it as soon as you can.

How much money do I owe them?
The woman's almost deaf.
Have you ever read the Bible?

Don't hurt anyone.
I'll introduce my father.
