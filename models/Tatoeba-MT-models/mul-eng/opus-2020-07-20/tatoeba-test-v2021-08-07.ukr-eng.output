It's a text.
We're on the third floor now.
It's a matter of principle.
It's a quote from Don Chichot.
It's a very good feeling.

It was a tough night for him.
I haven't seen any grandmothers here in a while.
I haven't been to Boston for a long time.
He was expelled from the camp.
These were taken from the logs.

You better not go there.
It's better not to trust Tom.
There is no doubt that rain is coming.
He's burning!
She's burning!

It's probably a joke, isn't it?
It's getting better.
It's hard to choose.
It's hard to find a common language with Tom.
It's hard to focus on this camera.
This has helped us a lot.

It's impossible to explain.
Sorry, that's not gonna happen.
He's in my pocket.
She's in my shower.
It's interesting to talk to Tom.
She's in the refrigerator.
He's in the kitchen.
This is ironic.
It's just a matter of time.
It's down the street on the left.
It's marriage, it's not a blessing.
She smelled like shit.
It smells like someone's smoking here.
Today's Monday.
It's much worse.

It's not that far away.
It's not time to eat.
It's not too funny today.
It's not too much.
It's a rare case when things like this happen here.
It is not uncommon for us to hear the wolf come out here.
It doesn't matter to me.
We didn't do that.
That's not very important.
It would be unwise on your part to reject his offer.
It's a little expensive.
That's not going to work.
It doesn't make any sense to do this right now.
It's my turn to laugh.
Now it's my turn to laugh.
Now it's my turn to talk.
It's obvious that they want to destroy Tom eventually.
Apparently, Tom and Mary are more than just friends.
Apparently, Tom's not talking to Mary.
It is not a problem to make mistakes.
It is not a problem to make mistakes.
I'm fine.
It's just for a while.
It's on the eighth floor.
It's on the eighth floor.
Looks like Tom.
We're guilty ourselves.
She's ours.
It's part of the system.

Time to drink drugs.
It's time for you to get married.
Tomorrow's Tom's birthday.
It's Tom's fault.
This is Tom's problem.
I want to talk to Tom myself.
It's too hard.
Damn it!
It's too expensive!
The wind's too cool.
It's too much.
Now, twelve years.
It's a typical settlement of the weather.
That's true or it's true.
That's what you have to decide.
As you wish.
It's Holy Valentine's Day.
It's very dangerous here.
It's very nice of you to help me.
It's your life.
Now it's yours.
It's yours.
This takes a lot of practice and patience.
Children grow all over the village.
We need determination.

He himself was guilty.
That was amazing.
It was endless.
That was 2,000 years ago.
That's what I've been talking about with the business of Poland.
That was my mistake, not Tom.
So that was not enough.
I didn't have to make that decision.
That wasn't necessary.
I forgot our dog, not Tom's dog.
It was Saturday night.
You see, it was Tom's fault.
That was Tom's idea, not mine.
That's what Tom did.
It was very cold.
She was white.
That's what you suggested you watch this movie.
It'll be dark.
Tomorrow will be worse.
It's going to cost $15 somewhere.
It'll take a while before he understands it, right?
It won't be as boring as you think.
It won't cost you anything.
It's working.
You'd be the best if I did.
I'd rather tell you the truth.
I'd rather tell you the truth.
