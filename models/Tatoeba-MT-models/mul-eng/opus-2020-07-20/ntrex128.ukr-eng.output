Members of the Welsh Assembly are worried that they will "cooperate with maps"
Some CAs are afraid of the recommendation to change the name of their seat in the House of Wales (MWP).
This recommendation was made through the plan to change the name of the Assembly to the House of Wales.
THE whole political spectrum is worried that this may be the cause of ridicule.
A CHA from the labyrinth claimed that his group was worried about the Romans from Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wells: "twp" means "uncompressed", and "pwp" means failure.
CHA from the Welsh Party stated that his group was “not satisfied” and offered alternatives.
One of the Welsh conservators said his group was "unwarranted" about the change of name, but pointed out that MWP could quickly become "mappet".
In this context, the verb 'w' is similar to the English word 'u'.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently drafting legislation for the change of names, noted: “The remaining decision on the new name of the Assembly will certainly be taken by its own members.”
The law on the self-government of Wales since 2017 gives the Assembly the right to change its name.
In June the Committee published the results of the public debate on proposals, and the conversion of the Assembly to Parliament of Wales was widely supported.
As for what is called the CCA, the Commission proposes to call them "members of the Welsh Parliament", that is, the WMP, but the MWP option has received the greatest public support.
Of course, it is suggested that alternatives be offered, but efforts to reach an agreement may lead to problems with leading Elina Jones, who should be given a bill on change over the course of a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including the rules for the separation of the CCA and the structure of the committee system.
THE final vote will take place in connection with the new name when the law is discussed.
Macedonians are going to vote at a referendum on the change in the country's name
On Sunday, the elections are announced whether to change the name of the country on the Northern Macedonian Republic.
The vote was organized to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighbor Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Afina has long claimed that the name of their northern neighbour is a claim on Greece's territory, and repeatedly against Macedonian members of the EU and NATO.
President George Ivanov of Macedonia, who objected to a referendum on the change of name, said that the vote would be ignored.
However, the rapporteurs among whom Prime Minister Zoran Zayev says that the change in the name is just the price to be paid for accession to the EU and NATO.
Saint-Marten's calls sound because the churches of Harlem are experiencing difficult times.
"The old people I met say that there was a bar and a church here in every corner before," says Mr. Adams.
Now there's nothing else.
He thinks that the disappearing of the bar can be understood:
"In our time people are socializing with each other.
Bari is no longer such a local health care, where they go on a regular basis."
As for the churches, Adam fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, and “they will be found where they started sooner or later. ”
The churches, he added, could replace houses with condominiums, and there would be people who would not help the saints who remained nearby.
“Most people who buy condominiums in these houses will be white,” Adams explained, “so this will speed up the day when all these churches are closed, as it is unlikely that most of those who move to condominiums will become their neighbors.”
Both churches were built by white citizens before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolitan community was built in 1870, and St. Martin, ten years after it.
It was a white Methodist community that came out of the 1930s.
The black town, which had held a short course, had the right to own property in the building.
St. Martin moved to the black community under the leadership of a similar John Howard Johnson, who led the fight of retail traders in the 125th street, the main street of Harlem, who did not want to hire blackmen and raise them in service.
In 1939 a fire damaged the building, but Johnson’s father’s paraphernalia wanted to restore it and set it up as a carilion.
Similar to David Johnson, the son and successor of Johnson's father in St. Martin, he proudly called Carolyn "the call of the poor."
An expert who played in the Caribbean in July called it a "cultural treasure" and an "exchangeable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first in the world of cartoons to be played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who spent 18 years in higher class in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merrivezer said he had no replacements in St. Martin.
What's happening in St. Martin over the last few months is a complex story of architects and defenders, some of whom were joined by church leaders, others by the Bishops' Bishops.
The Council, the governing body of the paraffins composed of the leaders of peace, wrote in July that it was concerned that the Europeans "will try to spend" the joy of not taking part in the mythical architects and contractors who sent the europeshi.
Some paraphernalia have been disturbed by the lack of electricity.
Acula was tortured by a 13-year-old boy who was beaten by the lobbyists in California.
According to officials, on Saturday, the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and tortured him.
An attack took place about 7: 00 a.m. near the Bikon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV channel in San Diego that the morning of Saturday he had already spent about half an hour with his friends when he heard that the boy wanted to help, and together with a group of people came to him to get out of the water.
At first Hammel thought that it was just a trap for the sleeping lobby, but then he realized that the boy was crying: “I’m hungry!
I have been tried."
As soon as he got to the boy, he saw that his key was completely broken.
"I cried to everyone to get out of the water, "In the water of the eagle!" Hammel added.
The boy was taken to the Güntocrylle at the Children's Radi Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The kind of shark that attacked is unknown.
Captain Larry Jails told the media briefing that a couple of weeks ago, they noticed the shark, but it was established that it was not relevant to dangerous types of sharks.
Jails added that the victim received traumatized injuries from the top of the tube.
For 48 hours, the authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto beach in Casabladi to Svamay in Encinita.
Joels noted that there are more than 135 types of sharks in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to go to the British cosmetic market
Sainsbury's is going to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams using cosmetic islands like those in universities.
In the context of the forced exit to the British cosmetic market, the cost of 2.8 billion pounds of sterlings (continues to grow while the volume of sales of clothing and household goods is reduced) increases in cosmetics will be protested in 11 stores across the country. The next year, if the idea is to be successful, the islands will appear in other stores.
Investments in cosmetics are related to the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the polynomial space that was previously used on television, microwave ovens and household goods.
In Sainsbury's, they say that they double the range of cosmetics and offer to 3,000 goods, among which there are brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees have more space: there are brand zones, similar to those in stores around Boots.
The supermarket also updates the Assortment of Boutique cosmetics: most of the goods presented will not be protested on animals, which are increasingly demanded by young buyers.
In addition, the retail trader Fragrance Shop protests its fleets in two Sainsbury's stores: the first flight was opened in Croatia, northern London last week, and the second was opened in Selly-Ouk, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and shopping for small quantities of food each day in small shops make it possible for supermarkets to make additional efforts to connect visitors.
Mike Kupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, said that their stores would be more similar to the university, because the supermarket network is trying to counter the Aldi and Lidl discontinuants through more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's opens the Argos divisions in hundreds of their stores, as well as a number of Habits. Sainsbury'ss bought both networks two years ago and claims it has increased the sales of food goods and made both networks more profitable.
The previous attempt to upgrade the cosmetics and pharmaceutical sections of the supermarket failed.
Sainsbury's tested cooperation with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended up having disagreements about how to divide the proceeds from the appetite in the supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its appetite business (281) Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, for 125 million pounds of sterling three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds would help to add an extended range of luxury brands to care for the skin, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, commercial director of Sainsbury, said: "We have changed the appearance of our cosmetic islands to make the atmosphere more pleasant for buyers.
We have also invested in highly trained consultants who can give advice.
We are presented with a brandy approach called to satisfy any needs, and a pleasant situation and a handy location means that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which will become an old way of buying".
Peter Jones was released because Holly Willowby had made an agreement worth 11 million pounds of sterling.
Lagvo dragon star Peter Jones "dissolved" because TV broadcaster Holly Willowby came out of his life brand (value of the deal is 11 million pounds of sterling) to focus on new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willowby doesn't have time for home clothes and accessories.
The money business was linked to the brand Goop Gwent Peltro.
The 37-year-old program leader This Morning announced his entrance to Instagram.
Holly Willowby brought the “Ligvo Dragon” star to Peter Jones to the point that at the last moment she came out of their profit business for life to focus on new successful contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Gerella reports that Johns "soldiers" when a gold girl from the television met on Tuesday at Jones's headquarters in Marlow, Bakinghamshire, that her new deal with 1.5 million pounds of sterling means that she no longer has enough time to dedicate her to their common household clothing and accessories.
This business was linked to the Goop Gwenet Peltro's brand and had to double the Willowby article, which is estimated at 11 million pounds of sterling.
When 37-year-old Willowby reported to the Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his homes to rest.
Geraldo reported: “Truly, no doubt, was the chief priority of Holly.
He had to be her long - term future for the next few decades.
Willowby’s decision to leave the business got all the interested parties involved.
No one could believe what was going on in Friday, almost in advance.
At the headquarters in Marlow, there's a lot of stuff ready for sale.
Experts believe that this morning’s arrival, one of the most highly paid stars in Britain, could cost millions of companies through large investment in goods (from shower and candles to clothing and household clothing) and create further suspensions.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willowby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tarry Kapp for ten years.
Willowby and Kapp created Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as head of government in March.
Each week, Johns holds 40 percent of the shares of the Baldwin company, which is owned by television companies.
Willowby will become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Anthony Macpartlin as I'm A Celebrity at the ITV.
Geraldo, who approached Jones last night, said, "We won't comment on his business."
"And then we fell in love"
He was critical of the media for a comment that would be considered “non-presidant” and a very positive attitude toward North Korea’s leader.
“Why did President Tramp go to such great progress?,
said Trump, imitating the voice of the visiting news. —
I didn't go to any steps."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in the Red Sea before the colonization of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization took place in an empty corner.
More than three months after a red summit in Singapore, a leading North Korean diplomat, Ri Young Ho, told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see the "response" from the United States in its first phase of understanding.
Rather, he noted that the United States continues the sanctions aimed at supporting the pressure.
When speaking on his own, the tramp was much more optimistic.
"We have a good relationship with North Korea," he said.
We were going to fight in North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have such beautiful relationships."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim resulted in positive results: the end of rocket tests, the release of prisoners, and the return of the rest of the U.S. military personnel.
He also protected his unusual approach when he spoke of his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to behave as president, but instead of 10,000 people on the streets trying to get into this battle, we have about 200 people standing right there," Tromp said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed hundreds of islands
In particular, after the earthquake in Lombo, international NGOs were told that they did not need help.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombo people have suffered, the national disaster has not been announced, and this is a prelude to international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they clearly understood that they were not looking for international assistance, so it was difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although “Let the Children Come, ” he gathers a team to go to Paul until he does not know if foreign personnel can work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, representative of the national agency for disaster relief, said that the Indonesian government was assessing the situation in Paul to determine whether to allow international organizations to provide assistance.
In view of the continuing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains terribly unsatisfying in nature.
In the province of Ache there are wells built from the tunnels, but they are not characteristic of other coastal areas.
The absence of a siren warning about the tsunami in Paul’s day, though warnings were likely effective, likely contributed to death.
Moving between numerous Indonesian islands is not just the best of times.
Stoic diseases are becoming more and more difficult for logistics.
A medical ship that lived in Lomboto for the treatment of earthquakes flows to Paul, but reaching a new disaster may be at least three days away.
President Joko Wiidodo has improved the infrastructure of Indonesia through his election campaign and increased the cost of road and rail.
But the lack of funding has created problems for Mr. Joko's administration, who plans to re-examine the next year.
Ms. Joko also observes the long interconfessed enemy in those parts of Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority chose a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, tens of thousands were displaced from their homes as a result of opposition to the Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets with the use of sword, spear, rifle, and other lethal weapons.

The status of Cromwell near Parliament is a new reminder that suffers from "recording history"
The removal of the statue would be deserved for the destruction of many of the cultural and religious artifacts of England, which were carried out by its fantastic Puritans followers.
But the Society of Cromwell called Mr. Creek's proposal "the door" and "the attempt to re-write history".
John Goldsmith, head of Cromwell's Society, said: “In view of the current debate on the removal of the status, the status of Oliver Cromwell at the Westminster Palace was immeasurable. ”
The icono violence during the English civil war was not carried out either by Cromwell himself or by his command.
Cromwell is unlikely to be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the first century.
The great statue of Cromwell's sculptor William Hamo Torneicroft is a testimony to the setting of the 19th century and part of the history of the post, which many think is still worth respecting.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, probably more at the end of the 19th century than are now regarded by Cromwell as the guardian of Parliament from outside pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Whether such an idea is accurate or not is the subject of historical debate.
There is no doubt that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has identified the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the most famous institutions that represents one side of this conflict.
His achievement as Lord-Protector should also be marked and respected."
A pig killer has lost a Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, the farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in southern China.
The man, identified only by the name of Yuan, was found dead in the blood with a broken artery near a pigeon on the market in Lipansu, the province of Guijoo, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
In China, China, China, on May 30, 2005, pigs are being vaccinated by pigs in a pig market.
It is reported that in the middle he went out with his twin brother from the nearby province of June to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the brother found his dead brother and saw that the door of the guard was open.
The brother noticed that there was a big box of blood on the floor in the kitchen.
The medical expert confirmed that 249 kilograms of copper destroyed the farm until it died.
“ My twin brother’s legs were in blood and turned into blood, ” said the twin brother, who was quoted as Guiyang Evening News.
The security records show that John went to the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man was not belonging to Yuan or his twin brother.
A market leader told Evening News that when the police collected evidence at the scene, the pig was closed to prevent its attack on people.
It is reported that I am the seven Johns and the market administration discussing compensation for his death.
It is rare, though, but the incidents of a lion attack on humans have been even more serious.
In 2016, pigs attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and hit a man with critical injuries.
Ten years before the pig was weighed 295 pounds [295 kg], the egg farmer was pressed into the tractor until the farmer’s wife had threatened the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon ate his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can be a "trigger".
"They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You should just treat them with proper respect," he said.
Rose’s hurricane remains bring widespread floods to the southwestern United States
As it was predicted, the uragan Rose is weakened by moving over colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the next few days, Rose will bring rain and rain to the north of Mexico and the south-west of the United States.
Rose had a wind speed of 137 km per hour (this category 1) uragan is 5 a.m. in the morning at Sunday's time and is 620 a.m. in the south-west of Punta Evgenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will go north on Sunday.
At that time over the Pacific, it begins to form an input that moves east to the western coast of the United States. When on Monday, Rose is approaching the south coast of Lower California in the form of a tropical storm, it begins to melt a strong tropical wind in the north to the south west of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa brings up to 25.4 cm rain in some parts of Mexico.
Next in the next few days, the tropical wind, which is linked to the approaching storm, will cause strong waves to rise in the southwestern part of the world.
In this area, from 2,54 to 10,2 inches [2.54 - 10.2 cm] of rain causes dangerous liquids, toxic fluids, and the possibility of drying in the desert.
A strong tropical wind will result in an increase in the number of disasters up to 5 to 7.6 cm per hour, especially in some parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
5-10.2 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the south-west, especially in the major Arizona area.
In extreme cases, it may be possible to have severed conditions due to the spread of tropical rain.
We are very happy not to go to the deserts, as possible tropical floods.
A strong rain can cause canyons to bulging rivers, and the money will bring here the waste of wind and dust.
In some parts of northern California’s coastal area, the approach of entry causes strong rainfall.
The number of accidents can exceed 1,27 inches [1,27 cm], resulting in weak flows of garbage and canal roads.
This will be the first river in the region in the rain season.
Some scattered tropical waves begin to approach Arizona late in the afternoon and early in the morning, while in the evening and in the afternoon the rain is growing.
A strong rain will go over For Corners from the center.
In October, intense temperatures can be observed throughout the United States, as the Arctic is colder, but the tropicals remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to a variety of changes in temperature in short distances.
A good example of a variety of temperature changes in the central part of the United States will be observed on Sunday.
It's almost 7 degrees different temperature between Kansas City, Missouri and Omahy, the state of Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and De-Moons, the state of Iowa.
During the next few days, the summer heat is trying to recover and grow again.
It is expected that in a large area of central and eastern America, temperatures will be warm until October, and temperatures from the south to some parts of the north will be 27 degrees Fahrenheit [27 ° C].
The temperature in New York can reach 27 degrees Celsius per second, about 12 degrees Fahrenheit [12 ° C] above average temperature.
According to our long-term forecast, there is a high probability of an increase in average temperatures in the eastern part of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched by listening to Bretta Cavano
Four of the more than 20 million people on six television networks were watching an interesting witness from the Supreme Court of Britta Cavano and Christine Blaise Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual violence, which appeared to have occurred in the 1980s.
Political opposition continued, the channels interrupted planned programs to report on the last news Friday: the agreement prepared by Senator Arizona Jeff Fleck to conduct a one-week investigation by the FBI on charges.
Ford told the Senate's Court Committee that she was 100 percent convinced that Cavano was drinking her drink and trying to take off her clothes for dinner at the senior school.
In her emotional testimony, Cavano said that he was 100 percent convinced that it was not.
It's pretty likely that on Friday, more than 20.4 million people were watching what Nielsen's research company reported.
The company counted CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
It was not possible to get numbers on other networks that also showed listening, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In Nielsen, too, there are problems with measuring the number of people watching television in the offices.
For comparison, such an audience size is similar to an audience that looks at the game of the play-off series or the Oscar prize.
Fox News Channel, whose audiences strongly supported Cavano’s appointment, was the leader of all the channels during the entire day, with an average number of 5.69 million viewers in Nielsen.
ABC was another of 3.26 million spectators.
According to the representatives of Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC - 2.94 million, MSNBC - 2.89 million, CNN - 2.52 million.
The interest remained high after listening.
Flyk became the central performance of the Friday drama.
The office of this moderate Republican has published a statement that he will vote for Cavano. After that on Friday morning, CNN and CBS cameras identified how protestors shouted on Flickr when he tried to go on the elevator to listen to the Court Committee.
He stood with his eyes closed for a few minutes, during which he was lying in a direct ephere on CNN.
“I stand right in front of you, ” said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
They said to him, "You have authority over them, and you have no power over them."
Flyk reported that his office had published the statement and, before closing the letter, added what would be said more to the committee’s hearing.
All cables and broadband channels were transpired hours later when the Court’s committee had to vote on the Cavano's application for a full vote to the Senate.
Fleck said he'd do this only if he knew that the FBI would consider charges against the candidate next week, which requires a democratic minority.
Flyk was partly convinced by his friend, Senator-Democrat Chris Kuns.
After talking to Küns and then with several senators, Fleck made a decision.
The choice of Flyk had an impact, since it was obvious that the Republicans would not have votes to appoint Cavano’s candidate without examination.
President Trump initiated an investigation by the FBI on charges against Cavano.
British Prime Minister Teresa May blames criticism in the "political games" around Bressit
In an interview with the newspaper Sunday Times Prime Minister Teresa May accused the critics of her plans to leave the European Union in "political games" with the future UK and the destruction of national interests.
On September 29, 2018, Prime Minister of Great Britain, Teresa May arrived at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Great Britain.

Who shot Wade Sims: The police arrested Dayton Simpson for suspecting the death of a player at the University of Louisiana
The police arrested a suspect in the shooting, which led to the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the University of Louisiana.
The 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and sent to prison for the second stage of murder, reported to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities published video on the conflict between Simms and Simpson, and the police reported that Simms lost his eye during the war.
According to an affiliated CBS TV WAFB, the police removed the scene of the crime and noted that they had found Simpson's DNA.
When asked about Simpson, the police reported that he had admitted that he had shot Wade.
According to the lawyer, he was awarded a loan of $350,000.
The East Baton-Russia Coronor's office on Friday revealed a previous report indicating that the cause of death is a fire wound to the head and neck.
The Department expresses its appreciation for the search of police fugitives in the state of Louisiana, the state's criminal police lab, the South University police and local citizens for the investigation that helped the arrest.
The sports director of the University of Louisiana, Joe Alleva, thanked local law enforcement authorities for “the effort and desire for justice”.
Simsu was 20 years old.
Forvard grew up 198 cm in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the University of Louisiana.
In the last season, the average result was 5.6 balls and 2.6 teams.
On Friday morning, a basketball coach at the University of Louisiana, Will Wade, said that the team was "lost" and "schoked" by the death of Wade.
"That's what worries you all the time," said Wade.
The Volcano — A Bouncing Sun in Mexico
The populace of Popocatetel reaches the southern regions of the capital of Mexico.
A national disaster warning center on Saturday urged Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, since the crater began to operate and 183 gas and fuel emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was tracking numerous noises and mails.
A picture of social networks shows a thin layer of smoke on the back of cars in Mexico’s surrounding areas, such as Hochimíllko.
Geophysicists noted the increased activity of the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 km) south of the capital, after the earthquake struck 7.1 children in central Mexico in September 2017.
Volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
The police were confronted with the Catholic separatists for a few years of voting for independence
Six men were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protestors acting independently met with the police station. Thousands of people joined in protest protests to mark the first anniversary of the Catalan vote on the division.
The proseparatist group in the masks that the specialists were holding out of them was painted with eggs and rice, which created dark sands of chicken in streets where tourists were generally familiar with them.
The raids took place and later that day, the police used the police to stop the aggression.
A few hours later, a group of independent immigrants who were filming, “We won’t forget, we won’t forgive! ”
According to local press reports, fourteen people were helped to cope with the pain of protests.
A year after the referendum on 1 October, which was recognized by Madrid as illegal, it is marked by Catholic separatists, the tension in the region that desires independence remains high.
The voters made a decisive decision about independence, but it was obvious that the majority of those who opposed the division were afraid of voting.
According to the Catholic authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in severe beatings last year as a result of police efforts to stop voting in electoral districts throughout the region.
The independent groups spent the night in the theaters to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but it was forced to take another route.
68-year-old Narciss Termes, an electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia could gain independence.
"Last year we survived one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out for joy that they can vote, but now we're going to the corner."
Although it is vitally important, but very difficult to win the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan parties, acting as independent, have failed to keep the momentum of this year, as many of their most famous leaders are in voluntary expulsion or in detention in waiting court for their participation in the referendum and further declared independence.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who took a stand for the police on the phone, said that the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
"Divorce is strengthening," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hungkeras, one of the nine Catholic leaders who are in the follow-up of the last year, announced that he will be flying to the European Parliament next year.
"The candidate status in the European elections is the best way to judge the regree of democratic values and the repression we observe from the Spanish government," he said.
Londoners: The men were arrested after the car went into the house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the car took several times to London's house.
The incident took place in Balingard-Crescent at 4:30 p.m. during the British standard time.
Detective Bob Blemmings observed that the door was damaged and that the house itself was damaged.
It is quite possible that at some point in the car, they were shot off the plane.
Mangy's hit provided the "Livingstone" victory over the "Raingers" with account 1-0
The first valley of Dolly Mangy in the "Livingstone" was conquered
Stephen Gerard, who was raised in the Livingstone class, won the Awards and won a second prize with 18 games as the director of the Aybros Club.
The Dolly Mangy strike proved decisive: Commander Gary Holt, a second, rose to the level of the Hibernian.
Commander Gerard won't win any victory on the way out in Premier League this season, and next week he's playing with Harts' leaders, from which she's from eight eyes.
The fourth Reingers will be accepted as Rapid Videne in the framework of the European League.
At that time, Livingstone continued its relentless march to six games in the district, and the chief coach Holt had not been disappointed since his replacement of Kenny Miller last month.
"Levengston" offers opportunities to provide unsolicited guests.
The Holt's command was to be ahead of them long before they were killed, as their directness creates a whole range of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but he hit the door along the door, then Alan Litgo broke through the door after he resisted and accepted the hit by Craig Halkett at the door that he had made with his head.
The gentlemen were pleased that they had allowed the Rangers to play before them, and they knew that they could solve the problems of guests from standard positions.
Yes, and there was a decisive head.
The Rangers missed a free strike, and Livingstone made a discovery, Declan Galler and Robinson worked for Mengo, who took the sword and killed from the capital.
At this stage, the Rangers were dominated by the royal sword, but the protection of the peasants of the field proved to be inconceivable to them, and the thieves of Liam Kelly were no longer concerned.
This trend continued in the second stage, although Alfredo Morelos was able to strike in the direction of Kelly.
Scott Pittman's hit with the foot of the giants, Aun McGregor, struck the door in another standard combination of Livingstone.
After the attack by Halket on Glenna Middleton, who had been replaced, two applications were dismissed after the attack.
Livingstone phenomenon: analysis
Lasmont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Fenomenal game and result "Levenstone".
They all played each other, they continued to wait for this lofty trajectory.
Their style of play and composition has not changed in practice after returning to the highest level, but should be given the appropriate Holt for how he mobilized the team after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett played a great, well-organized defense, and Menga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Warral to keep on the watch.
The Rangers, however, had no inspiration.
They used to play very well under the leadership of Gerard, but they are now largely out of touch with those standards.
They didn't have the last bullet -- they only broke the field-guard once -- and that was something like a wake-up for the Rangers, which was found in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received little attention in Kelney
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, there was a smile and a blue sky.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
Among them were some contradictions between human rights, freedom of press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan moved to Calna to open a huge new dream.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside the Turkish border.
The police didn't allow 25,000 people to meet in front of the meeting, but many of the president's supporters still appeared close to see him.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdotan — among them many lies — have also forced themselves to listen, and they have condemned Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
Bilateral protests testify to the incompetence of a guest some German Turks called hero, while others are dictators.
A road accident in Defordi: a passenger died in a car crash
A passenger died in a car crash in London.
The accident took place near the crossing of Bejjud Street and Evelin Street on the rough road in the Deptford area in the southeastern city about 10:15 a.m. after the British standard time.
The water stopped, and the paramedics came to the scene, but the man died.
This accident took place a few months after another passenger died after the escape from the Chailders Street accident, about 1.6 km from the Saturday accident.
The London police said that they were working on the establishment of a man to inform his closest relatives.
The traffic is banned and bus routes are changed, and car drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six prisoners are tortured in assaults
Six prisoners were injured as a result of a man's incarceration, reported to the prison administration.
The break in her Majesty Long-Larth prison in Woostershire began about 9:30 a.m. after the British standard time on Sunday and still lasts.
In order to stop the invasion, initiated eight prisoners and placed in one wing, a special section of "Tornado" was called.
The officers provided medical assistance in connection with the mild facial traumas received at the scene.
A representative of the prison service commented: "In order to resolve an incident that continues in her Majesty Long-Lartin prison, a specially trained prison staff have been arrested.
Six employees received medical assistance in connection with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we clearly understand that those responsible will be sent to the police and that the burden of their stay behind bars can be lifted."
In her Majesty Long-Larth prison, over 500 prisoners are among the most dangerous offenders in the country.
It was reported in June that the prison officer was sent to the hospital after the prison attack.
In October last year, a police specialty was called to stop serious arrests during which prisoners were attacked with billiard charges.
Uragan Rosa is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with left-wing behaviour (this may be useful in the dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely strikes Arizona, but this may occur at the beginning of the next week, as the remaining uraganese of Rosa are heading south into the desert, creating a risk of harmful behavior.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of the low tides on Monday and Tuesday in the territory of West Arizona to the South and Eastern Nevada, South-East California and Yuta, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaf, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will walk straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, and tonight will be rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that only ten tropical cycles kept the status of tropical heat or depression within 200 miles (322 km) of Phoenix since 1950,
Catherine (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) from the Arizona border.
According to the latest estimates of the National Urban Centre, in the Mogollon-Rome region in Arizona, it is estimated to be 5.08 to 10.16 cm, and places up to 15.24 cm west.
Other areas of the south-west desert, including the central part of the Great Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to be from 2,54 to 5,08 cm west, possibly up to 10.16 cm.
Where there is no risk of harmful habits, Rosie’s rain can be a blessing because the region suffers from drought.
Although this is a very serious problem, some of these evils are likely to be useful, as the south-west now survives the drought.
According to the U.S. Forest Monitoring Center, some 40 percent of Arizona’s territory suffers from extreme drought, which is the second highest drought category, reports weather.com.
First of all, the path of the Rosary leads to the ruins on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rosa, still in power on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 137 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Evgenia, Mexico, and moves north with a speed of 19.3 km per hour.
The heat is colder in the Pacific and thus weakens.
Thus, it is expected that by the power of tropical heat tomorrow or tomorrow morning, hurricanes will cause pollution in Mexico.
The number of accidents in some parts of Mexico may be significant that poses a significant risk to behavior.
“It is expected that the total number of incidents from Lower California to northwestern Sonori will be 7.62 to 15.24 cm, possibly 25.4 cm,” reports weather.com.
Next, Rosa goes north through Mexico as a tropical storm, gets around Arizona early in the morning as a tropical depression, which goes on through Arizona, and then later in the afternoon comes to South Yuta.
"The main danger expected by Rosie or her remnants is the very strong rain in Lower California, the North-West Sonor and the South West of the American desert," reports the National Urban Centre.
It is expected that these rainwaters will lead to life - threatening floods and floods in deserts, as well as droughts in the mountainous region.
An attack in Midsomer-Norton: arrested of four persons who committed murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspecting murder after they found a 16-year-old boy with knife wounds in Somerset.
An early teenager was found in the region of Xelseor-Terras in Midsomer-Norton about 04:00 at the British standard time on Saturday.
He was sent to a hospital where he remained in a stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested last night in Radstok, reported to the Eivon and Somerset police.
The police are asking everyone who can have any video of these events on the phone.
Tramp says the Kawano's "pangs of subversiveness and Anger" of the Democratic Party
“Cavano’s vote is a vote against the ruthless and incorrigible tactics of the Democratic Party,” said Trump at the meeting in Wiling, West Virginia.
Tramp said that the Kawano “ends envy and anger” of the Democratic Party during the entire reconciliation process.
Cavano witnessed before the Congress in four, independent and emotionally opposed Christine Blaise Ford’s accusation that he had committed sexual violence decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness in the hearing of her accusers.
On Saturday, the president stated that on that day “the American people saw the closeness, character and courage” in Cavano.
“ A vote after the Kavano trial is one of the most perfect lawyers of our time, a lawyer with an unencumbered public service experience, ” he said to a group of guests in West Virginia.
The president made a frank statement about the move to Cavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of the efforts of the Republicans in the Middle Ages.
"Five weeks will be one of the most important choices in our life.
I'm not running, but I'm really running,' he said.
That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
The tramp claimed that the mission of democracy was “to resist and prevent. ”
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on the Kavan candidate will take place not later than Friday, a CNN assistant to one of the leaders of the Republicans.
Hundreds of people have died of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, and the number of victims increases
At least 384 people were killed, many fell into the ocean when the giant waves were crashing on the beach as a result of an intense earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Solaves, declared the country’s government on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were resting at the beach festival in Paula on Friday, when they stood up to six feet (18 feet) in the morning and broke down the wall, killing many at death and destroying everything on their way.
After the earthquake, the tsunami struck 7.5 miles [2.5 km].
"When the tsunamis hit yesterday, people were still busy on the beach and did not start running immediately, and they became victims," said a representative of the Indonesian disaster relief agency (BNPB) at the briefing at Jakarta Sutopo First Nogorho.
"It was not just the tsunamis, it drove cars, trees, buildings, it hit everything on the dry," Nugroho said, adding that before hitting the coastal line, the tsunamis passed through the open sea at 800 km/h (497 km/h).
To save himself from the tsunami, some people walked on trees and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Paul.
Aerophotosms published by a disaster relief agency show that many buildings and stores are destroyed, bridges are destroyed and destroyed, and water is flooded.
Posts in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes reached an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy generated by a strong earthquake on Friday was 200 times more than the energy of an atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which was at the end of a long, narrow bow, could help with the power of tsunamis, was announced by the agency.
Nogroho called the destruction “a large scale ” and noted that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels have been destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found under the walls of destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 lost without news.
Nogorho noted that victims and injuries could be more than 300 km (190 miles) along the coastal line north of Paul in the area called Donggal, which is near the earth’s center.
"The communications lines were completely damaged, and we didn't get any information," said Nogroho.
More than 300,000 people live there, as stated in the Red Cross report, and it is also reported that its personnel and volunteers have moved to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can become much more,” said the report.
On Saturday, the agency received a broad criticism of not reporting that the tsunami had hit Paul, even though official officials had said that the hours had arrived at the time marked as a warning.
The amateurs who shared social networks have seen a man at the top of the house echoing a shocking warning of the approaching tsunamis on the streets of the building.
A few minutes later, the wall of the water came to the shore, taking the building and the car with it.
Reuters could not check the accuracy of the frames immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious evasion of electricity that had broken down the link between Paul and the co-ordination of the operation of the tunnel.
Military personnel began sending planes from Jakarta and other cities, reporting to the authorities, but evacuated people still need food and other items first needed.
The city airport has only been opened for help, and it will be closed by October.
President Joe Wiedado had to visit the evacuation centers in Pala on Sunday.
The number of tsunamis killed in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
The workers of the World Vision organization from Dongali came to the city of Paul, where they were hiding in the bronze tents located in their office courtyard, but on the way they saw the demolition scene, said Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he shared.
It's very bad.
Even when relief teams began to take decisive action to eliminate the effects of disasters, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers with great experience would not be allowed to go to Paul.
According to the Indonesian rules, funding, supply and supply of staff from the border can only begin if the place of disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“ It’s still a disaster at the province level, ” noted Auliya Ariani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
As the government says, "Well, this is a national disaster," we can accept international assistance, but this status is not given until it is given."
The other night, after the fifth earthquake and tsunami, and the friends and families of those who had not yet found, were still hoping that the appearance of their neighbors would become a miracle that would delight them to experience natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy got out of the canal.
On Sunday, rescuers arrived with a woman lying in bed with her mother’s body for two days.
Hendon Subandano, the trainer of the Indonesian National Paraplanerism team, trained two missing parapolerists to participate in Asian games that were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other parapolitors who found themselves in the cave in the Roa Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandague, were his disciples.
"As an elder in parapolarism, I have my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Hendon relates how a few hours after the news of the destruction of the Roa Roa Roa Hotel, which spread among the parishioners, he unexpectedly sent a message to Paul’s opponents who participated in the beach festival.
However, his message was marked with only one gray hair, not with double gray hair.
"I think this means that the message was not delivered," he said.
The thieves took $26,750 while filling the bank at Newport on the Level
On Friday morning, the thief stole $26,750 from Brink, who ran a banknote in Newport on the Level, reports the Newport Police Department.
The car’s water washed the banknote in the entertainment complex and was ready to add more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarty in the newspaper.
While he was busy, another man ran back to Brink's staff and stole a bag of money for filling up.
The Witnesses noticed several suspects running away from the crime scene, but the police did not indicate the number of incidents.
Anyone who has information about these people should contact the Newport police by number 859-292-3680.
Canya West: Reper changes its name to E
Reper Canya West changes her name to E.
On Saturday, announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: “It was officially known as Kanya West. ”
41-year-old West was sometimes called Y, and he used this shortcut as a name for his album released in June.
The change occurred prior to his appearance at the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to present his new Yangi album.
On the show, he replaces the singer, Aryan Grande, who lost his part for “emotional reasons, ” reports the director of the show.
This is not just a short summary of the current professional name, West said that this word has a religious significance for him.
"I believe that "yes" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West at the beginning of this year, discussing the name of his album with the radio news agency Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, I'm us.
The canyon, which means "one", was cut to just yes, it's just a picture of our good, our bad, our filthy, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
Kanya is one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddie and Diddy, this year declared that he had chosen the names Lava and Braser Lava.
Former colleague Westa, Jay Z, also experimented with defies and great letters.
Mexican President Andrés Manuel Lopes Obrador promises not to use the army against civilians
The newly elected President of Mexico, Andrés Manuel Lopes, promised never to use the army against civilians.
On Saturday at Tlatelolko, Lopes Obrador promised "never use the army to provoke the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army launched a peaceful demonstration in the area, killing about 300 people, and then all of Latin America began to set up a left student spirit.
Lopes Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those who are being taught and by opening up more expensive state universities.
He noted that the lack of employment and the lack of access to education lead young people to criminal groups.
The United States should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
As China is increasing its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in this hole, considers the investor and practice in the area of the CA-FO Lee, which was working on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were given after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about the SI, although there is no formal strategy in the U.S.
In the meantime, China has presented its last year's plan: it wishes to become No. 1 by innovations in the area of China by 2030.
"The secondary budget for research in the SI would be a good start, considering that all other countries are far away from the United States, and we are preparing for the next phase in the SI area," said Lee.
The double funding can double the probability that the next major achievement in the area of the SI will be made in the United States, said Lee in the CNC interview this week.
Lee, who was published in the book "Sylicon Valley: China, the New World Order" this month, is the Director-General of the Synoving Ventures Foundation, who invested in Face++, one of the most famous Chinese companies in China.
In the 1980s, he worked at the University of Carnegie-Mellon, which played the best American player in Otello, and later was the executive director of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese company Google.
They noted previous technological efforts by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge Agency of the DARPA, and asked when they would be next to help identify future prospective participants.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win the government’s profits, says Lee.
"It's not China taking academic leaders, it's corporations," he said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies in recent years have picked up light from universities to work on the SI.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to increase its efforts in the area of China.
"I think that Green Card should automatically offer science candidates in the field of SCI," he said.
The National Council of China published its plan for the development of the new generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Fund for Natural Science in China grants funding to persons working in academic institutions, such as the National Scientific Fund and other government organizations of the United States, to American researchers, including the quality of academic work in China below, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence established the Joint Centre of Art Intelligence, which aims to connect business and academic partners, and White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Art Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
With regard to the National Science Fund, it now invests more than $100 million a year in research.
In the meantime, the U.S. legislative government, who had hoped to create the Commission from the national safety of artificial intelligence, did not take any steps for a few months.
Macedonians vote in referendums on the change in the name of the country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia announced a referendum on whether to change the name of the country on the Northern Macedonian Republic, which would allow for a multi-year confrontation with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia’s potential for membership in the Euro-Mediterranean and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims that the name of the northern neighbor is a claim on its territory, and has made a bid to enter Macedonia to NATO and the EU.
In June, two governments signed an agreement on the basis of a proposed new name, but the nationalist opponents of the agreement claim that this change will undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slovenians in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov stated that he would not vote on the referendums, and the boycott campaign would raise doubts as to whether a 50 per cent minimum voter would be reached who would allow the referendum to be considered effective.
The question to the referendum is, "Do you support NATO and EU membership under the terms of agreement with Greece?"
The sponsors of the change of names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, claim that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, deserves to be paid for access to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to announce for the future country, for Macedonia's youth, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievski in Skopje.
Although the voting results do not have legal obligations, enough Members of Parliament have said that they support it to make it decisive.
To change the name, two thirds of the votes in Parliament will be required.
The National Electoral Commission stated that no reports of violations had been received by 13:00.
However, only 16% were recorded compared with 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of registered voters were thrown into their ballots.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said 62-year-old José Tanevsky in the capital of Skopje.
On 30 September 2018 in Strúmica, Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, his wife Zorika and his son Dousko gave their voice at the referendum on the change in the name of the country, opening the way for entry to NATO and the European Union.
Before parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Volodymir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed a table in front of the premises organized by those who would fight the referendum.
"We for NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with a proud head, not through the service door," Kavardarkov said.
We are poor countries, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev believes NATO will make a lot of investment in Macedonia, where unemployment is more than 20%.
"I believe that the majority vote in favour of more than 80% of our citizens in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He noted that the result of “that ” would be a confirmation of their future.
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies, 30 to 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum, and this will be the most important event.
According to another study conducted by the Macedonian Telma, 57% of respondents are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
Of these 70 percent said they'd vote for.
In order for the referendum to be recognized as a fact, the vote should be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first major political blow to the Western government since its beginning in May last year.
Look: Serhio Aguero from Manchester City takes over the defense of Briton and kills the head
Serhio Aguero and Rahim Sterling passed the Bryton defense and won the Manchester City account with account 2 to 0 on Saturday at Etikhad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Gol Aguero, at 65 minutes of the match, looked like a funny excuse.
The Argentine attacker had a passport in the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between the three Britons and settled in the open field.
Aguerero then realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He wore one shield, then beat a few more at the edge of the Braton.
Next he made the trip to the left by looking at Sterling.
The English Forvard made the first touch on the stamp to give the sword to Aguero, who had his right butt shot him in the right side of the door, putting a bullet in the big "Bryton" by Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some foot problems," said journalist Pep Gvardioola.
We agreed he'd play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's right.
We're lucky he killed his head at this moment."
But the initial celestial-black preference in this game of Premier League provided Sterling.
This hall happened at 29 o'clock.
Aguero received a sword deep in the Briton territory.
He sent a beautiful hunting dog along the left wing of Leroy Sane.
Leroy made a few hits and continued on the way to Sterling.
Forvard of sky-blockers threw a sword in the door like once before he jumped across the border.
The site will meet with Hoffenheim in the team phase of the League of Championships at 12:55 on Friday at the Rain-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Zinsaghm, Germany.
The artist wants to take his eyes off Rokis
Since the Washington Nassoonals team came out of playoff, there was no real reason to wait for the planet to start.
But the opposition of the Sherzer is expected to go to the Pitcher Hill on Sunday in the fight against Colorado Rokis on condition that Rokis is still having trouble getting out of playoff. Now Rokis is on a game ahead of Los Angeles Dogers in the National League of West.
"Rhokis" has at least a Wild Card to win with account 5-2 over Nasionals on Friday night, but they still want to sign the title of the first division.
"Although we're not playing for, at least we're going to be able to drop the sword, knowing how the viewers are here in Denmark, and the other team will probably play at the highest level I've seen all this year.
Why would I not want to take part in this struggle?
Nasionals still announces who will be the startter on Sunday, but it is reported that they want it to be Chercher.
The cheerleader, for which it will be the 34th start, had a pitching session on Thursday and could play on Sunday, his usual way out.
Washington's right has 18-7 results from 2.53 ERA and 300 cars in 220 2/3 engines in this season.
Trampa in West Virginia
The president briefly mentioned the situation around his candidate to Supreme Court Bretta Cavano when he spoke of the importance of the election of the Republicans in the mid-term elections.
“All we have done will be placed on the map in November.
Five weeks later, one of the most important choices in our life will be made.
It's one of the big, big ones, I'm not running, but I'm really running, so I'm everywhere, wherever I can fight for great candidates," he said.
Tramp continued: "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see what's going on right now.
And they're firmly designed to return power using any means, you'll see poverty, corruption.
Whoever suffers from them, because of whom they have to go through to get power and control, they want power and control, we are not going to give them."
The mission of Democrats, as he said, "stop and stop".
"And you will see it during the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "bad and foolish, hypocritical and lying."
He referred to the Senate Court committee, calling Senator Diana Fynstein on behalf of the audience for a voice of discontent.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you give me a document?
It's what.
No, no, no, I'm waiting for it to be really bad for the thiloruchs -- the worst thiloruchs language I've ever seen."
The Liberian party is no longer a large church.
It is intolerance to those who express their opinion.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to condemn me, that was hardly surprising.
Finally, I'm the last of those lobbyists in Parliament who said they're not happy, and that's all because we're expressing our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in almost the same way because of her resolute stand against anti-Semitism.
I was convicted because I did not agree with Jeremy Corbin.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, and Europe, these questions are ironically similar to those that Germany did not agree with the previous leaders.
"We want meetings to be inclusive and productive," said a press release on Friday about the meeting of the Nottingham East.
Most of the Friday evening meetings of the General Committee for my eight years in the capacity of a local parliament member from the lobbyists were the same.
Unfortunately, many of today's meetings have a completely different tone, and the promise of a "more kinder, softer" policy has long been forgotten if it has ever been implemented.
It becomes even more evident that the Leiborist party does not allow different views, and each opinion is assessed from the position of whether it is acceptable for the party’s leadership.
It started soon after Jeremy became a leader, and colleagues with whom I seemed to have similar political views, began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and take a position I would never agree with, whether national security or the single EU market.
Every time I speak publicly — and it doesn’t matter what I say — it’s because there’s so much going on in the social networks that it’s going to be called off, and it’s going to be the center’s policy that I’m not supposed to be in the Leiborist party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I've been happier than some of my colleagues because I've been approached with comments that are usually political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and the determination of my colleagues who are confronted with the flows of sexist or racist attacks every day, but they never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that equal abuses have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbin stated last week that the Leiborist Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a large church, and each movement of the party's "inconsistencies" or change the rules of the party's election.
Over the last two years, I have received much advice, and I have been called not to complain, not to express myself so loud that I “it was all right”.
But I didn't get involved in politics.
I joined the Liberians 32 years ago in school because because of the lack of attention from the government of Tetcher, my high school class was literally disintegrated, and since then I wish to improve the quality of government services for those who need them most, whether the local councillor or the government minister.
I have never hidden my policy, including in the final elections.
No one in Nottingham East has been disturbed by my political views and differences with today’s leadership.
For those who have contributed to Friday events, I just want to say one thing: under the circumstances when the country moves to Bressit, which is damaging to households, businesses and public services, I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Leiborist Party.
Actually, I have another message, but not for the Nottingham Commentum, but for my voters, both members of the Leiborist Party and not: I swear that I will serve you, and I promise that no threats to me and no political advantage will prevent me from acting according to what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.

"Eir" 38 - 17 "Melrose": Unincreased "Eir" climbs up
The last two attempts may have resulted in some final results, but the Air has undoubtedly earned a triumph in today's great entertainment match of the Prime Minister of Scotland.
Now they're heading the table, that's the only unimplemented ten command.
Finally, the wonderful defense and the improved ability to use the opportunities afforded the owners and trainer Peter Merche the right to be satisfied.
"We've been trying our games, and we're still not able, so I have to be satisfied," he said.
Robin Kristy from Melrous commented: "I know the right Air," they used the chances better than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, carried out by Frasie Climo, led to the "Eir" forward, but a yellow map for the Scottish captain Rory Guza, seen "Verriors", allowed "Melrose" to show the figures, and Jason Baggot used an unrealized attempt.
The letter sent by Eir's leadership through the panel, and immediately before the crash, made and realized the solo test, which gave the account 17-5 for the benefit of Eir.
But the Melroses well started the second team, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, realized by Baggot, reduced the gap to five eyes.
Then there was the severe trauma of Ruarid Knott, who was released from the field on his feet, and the “Eir ” resurfaced by the trial of Stafford McDowell, who was realized by Climus.
Captain "Eir" Blair McPherson then had a yellow card, and Melrose again forced another player to pay for an unrealized experiment by Bruce Colwin under a blackout.
The gentlemen returned, however, when Struan Hatchinson received a yellow card to capture Climus without a sword from the line of the tax collector, Mcferson made a dotdown behind the small "Eir".
Climo realized his attempt to do it almost every time after the restoration, then Kyle Roy got from David Armstrong hit the boat and sent Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt on the master's team.
Looks like the star of the "All Still Game" series set up for a new career in the restaurant
It seems that Ford Kiran has set up a new career in the area of hospitality. This conclusion can be made after it became known that he is the director of the licensed restaurant.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC popular teleserial, the script he's writing and taking off with former comedy partner Greg Hemfil.
Duet announced that the future nine series would be the last in the series, and it seems that Kirnan is planning a life after Craigling.
According to the official record, he is the Director of the Company Affymorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although the Scottish Sun source urged Kirnan to enter the “encourageing restaurant business” of Glazgo.
"Our Sea": Inland Bolivia hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific
The seamen patrol the equipped fleet headquarters in La Pasi.
The city's buildings are building an ocean-block bridge.
The coastal bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted by the device: “The sea is our right.
We must bring him back."
In Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, still lives to remember the loss of a coastal line that went to Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century through natural resources, as well as the desire to relocate to the Pacific.
These hopes are probably the strongest in recent decades, because Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of trial.
"In Bolivia there is an impulse, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, it expects a positive outcome," commented Roberto Calsatia, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many of the painful ones will observe the release of the ICU decision on large screens across the country, and they hope that the Gaza Tribunal will take a decision for the benefit of Bolivia, which, after decades of indiscriminate discussions, will lead to negotiations on Bolivia's surrender of sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, a charismatic native of Bolivia, who faced opposition to his review the following year, also puts great hope in a decision that will be announced on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will either decide for the benefit of Bolivia, and if that happens, it will change little.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, has not yet fully condemned the Czech territory and noted that there will be no possible negotiations.
What ICU's decision, only six months after the final arguments were made, indicates that the case was “not difficult”, said Pas Zarate, an expert in international law.
Bolivia’s law did not apply, for the last four years could help to reverse the situation.
"The request for access to the sea has been used by the current Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
The soldier of the Morales Ritorica fell away with the rest of the Czech grace, and she allowed it.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but then it will be very difficult to discuss.
Two countries did not exchange messages since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodrigues Veltz, a representative of Bolivia in Gaza, did not agree that the court’s decision was unusual.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “a wonderful opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and the opportunity to put an end to 139 years of separation by mutual advantage, ” he said.
Calsathia also argued that Morales — still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America — used the sea as a political policy.
“ The Bolivians will never deny their right to access the Pacific, ” he added.
This is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind.’
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen if it can't trust the United States.
The North Korean Prime Minister Riy Young Ho says that his country will never refuse its nuclear weapons for the first time until he can trust Washington.
Ri was present on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during the summit in Singapore by the leaders of the opposing countries.
His comments appeared when U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of a relaunch of nuclear diplomacy, which went into the silent corner more than three months after a Singapore summit with Kim Chen Inn.
Ri says that the belief that the continuation of sanctions and the United States' declaration of the end of the Korean war once puts North Korea on its knees is “unrealistic dream. ”
Washington is afraid to accept a declaration before Phineyan takes significant steps to explain.
Who and American President Donald Tramp want a second meeting.
But there is widespread scepticism that Pynian is seriously concerned with refusing his arsenal, which the country is likely to consider as the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Phoenan next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
The latest trend of massive peaks, which is already heading to the main streets of your city, has been presented at the risk of fashion exhibitions
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely hide from the sun, you have found what you need.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown showed a number of excentrical main matches in the style of the 2019 spring collection at the bottom of the nearby Paris weekly fashion.
Many in practice hats were filled with Instagram this summer, and the so - called designers had already sent their charming creatures along the path.
Valentino saw an extravagance flight hat with a wide-fledged pair of fields that covered the heads of models.
Among the other accessories are decorated with precious stones of coffee, hats of chocolate and even cape-anas, but they are not to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated the sort of original mask — very early in before Heldon.
Many of these colorful masks had lost their protection and reminded Hannibal Lakker of the highest fashion.
One was reminded of the arrangement for underwater swimming with pipes and glasses, and the other looked like a sailboat that had broken down.
And if you support this serious fashion application, you're lucky.
Stylists say that huge hats can go out to your city’s main streets.
Overseas-capillas entered the mode through "Lia Bomby", a Solomonic hat with a width of six inches, which they saw on all sides: from Riana to Emily Ratajkoski.
The cultural brand, which stands behind a very unprofessional hat, which could be seen everywhere on the social networks, gave peace another creation: a salted beach bag of size, almost like the model in the buyer she had.
A piece of yellow-red rife with brown and white leather hand was the central element of the 2019 La Rivera collection of Jacquemus brand in the Persian weekly fashions.
Luke Armitage's reputationist said to the FEMAIL: "The next summer, I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the city's main streets, as the designer has been so great that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for overcrowding accessories."
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is a responsibility for the world's citizens
Independent schools in Scotland uphold high standards of education, and in 2018 there has been a resurgence of studies that are complemented by individual and collective success in sports, art, music, and other fields.
These schools, which teach more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, are presented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (USA), are eager to provide the best level of service for students and their parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for the further and higher education they have chosen as careers, as well as to make them their citizens in the world.
As a educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable in school.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person who understands the language she understands, she understands it.
If you talk to her in her native language, she will take it to heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot use English only if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The final results of this year's studies show that in independent language schools, they are guided by the rating of the best estimates.
In total, 68 percent of the students who had learned foreign languages had received a higher rate of A.
The data collected at 74 schools in the United States showed that 72% of the students received a high Bachelor from China, and 72% of the students from Germany, 69% from French students, and 63% from Spanish students also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland view foreign languages as vital to life, which children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Languages as an object of choice are now presented in the same way as NTIM (scientific, technology, engineering, and mathematics), as well as in independent school programs and other institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Commission on Employment and Training in 2014 showed that 17% of the reasons why workers cannot close their vacations due to lack of language skills.
So language skills are becoming more and more necessary in preparing young people for future careers.
Since more and more prospective positions are needed to know the language, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if someone learns another language, he'll have a real advantage in the future, because it's a habit for life.
The possibility of direct contact with people from other countries automatically gives a person who has multiple languages a preference over competitors.
According to YouGov, 75% of adults in the United Kingdom in 2013 could not speak foreign languages well enough to support the conversation, while French is the only language spoken by two percent (15 percent).
That is why investment in language education is now important to children today.
Learning a number of languages, especially the languages of the developing world, gives children more opportunities to find a full - time job.
In each school in Scotland, they will learn their language.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others will produce languages that are considered to be the most important for Britain from the 2020 perspective, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest in independent schools, you can always choose a number of languages to study with qualified translators.
Scotland’s independent schools are trying to create a educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to achieve success regardless of what they have prepared for them in the future.
It is now impossible to deny that in the international business environment, languages continue to play a vital role in the future, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages must truly be considered “the traditions of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, variety, and perfection to young people in Scotland.
You need to do it.
John Edward is director of the Scotland Council of Independent Schools
Libron Debts from Lakers in San Diego
Fanatics who want to see the first start of Libron James for Los Angeles Lakers have almost been waiting.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton announced that James will play on Sunday in the first pre-trial match against Daver Naggets in San Diego.
It's not yet decided how many minutes he'll play.
"It's going to be more than one and less 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
The Lakers Reporter Mike Trudell said that James would play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plan for six games in the Leekers Presidency Graph.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-sense games," he replied.
Drag to West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Tramp is starting today a series of preliminary contests from the city of Willing, West Virginia.
It's the first of five planned for the next week of Trip's minglings, including minglings in the friendly developed states between Tennessee and Mississippi.
The remaining vote on the candidate proposed to the Supreme Court was postponed, and the Trump was eager to form support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress after the vote in November.
What time is it going to take place today's Eve in West Virginia, and how is it viewed on the Internet?
Mitting Trapa in Willing City, West Virginia, scheduled for 19 hours in the morning today, on Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch the tram in West Virginia online below in the direct Effrey on YouTube.
The tramp probably refers to the harassment that occurred this week when the candidate was brought to the Supreme Court of Britta Cavano accused of sexual harassment, and to the postponement of the Senate's vote for a week while the FBI continued its investigation.
But the main objective of this series of mittings is to help the Republicans to collect the population before the elections in November.
President Trampa said that these five mittings next week focused on "activation of volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to preserve and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reports.
"The control over the Congress is so critical for its agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible as it is nearing the busy pre-shiping season," said Reuters, a representative of the tramp company who did not want to name himself.
At the Wesbanko Arena Stadium in Willing today, visitors from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh Media, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday's visit will be the second of the last month's Trip's visit to West Virginia, in which he gathered more than 40% of the votes in 2016.
The tramp is trying to help the candidate from the Republicans to the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morris, whose rating is based on the results of the trials.
“ It’s not good for Morris that the president is coming to pick up his rating in trials, ” commented Reuters Simon Heder, a politician from the University of West Virginia.
Riyadh 2018: US team set up to fight and hopes for the previous week's singles
After three sessions that ended with a unilateral victory, the following Sunday's forums can be the only thing that has been missing from this Rayder Cup.
The Chinese master of impulse is a well - known sports concept in which players really believe, especially in similar conflicts.
So when do they say the impulse works?
"They were on the front of six eyes, and now on the four, so I think we'll take it a little bit like impulse," Jordan Spit said when he went in.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of four eyes ahead and twelve other games.
The Americans, as Spit says, feel a little wind in their winds, as well as many encouraging ones, not in the latest form of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long, and each had three eyes with four eyes.
The cold with his killer shots from the thi-migrant to the green shows an example.
These grunts of celebration became more loud when he made a decisive path along his circle and compared the account to the fourth match after he and Thomas left two eyes.
His path, which allowed them to win a match for 15 moons, met with a similar cry, which tells you that the U.S. Army doesn't look like it.
"You really should just try very hard and worry about your own match," said Spit.
That's all that each of these players left right now.
18 moons to become famous.
The only players with more eyes than Spit and Thomas in the last two days — French Molinary and Tommy Flytwood, the undisputed story of Cuba Ryder.
It is unusual, but a wonderful couple from Europe have four or four and cannot admit a mistake.
"Molwood" was the only couple who didn't make gods on Saturday after dinner, they were also able to avoid the gods on Saturday and after dinner on Friday and at nine last moons on Friday morning.
This race and what their energy seems to be going on to this bourgeois crowd and back will allow them to believe that they win on Sunday and that there will be no more popular players, except Flywood or Molinary, to capture the potential victory of the Europeans when the sun passes over Le Golf National.
I want to try on different moons at the same time.
However, talk about the European triumph as early as possible.
Bob Watson and Webb Simpson argued with Sergio Garcia, a hero of morning soccer when he was in a fight with Alex Norren.
One god and two beads on the first nine moons brought the Spanish and the Swedish to the moon from which they could never get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you to get out of the hole.
The forums and forums are very interesting to observe closely the relationship between the participants, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and the interest you can observe in how the strategy can change in one minute.
Europe as long as it plays better than a team and has a significant advantage in the last day, but this forum also showed that the U.S. team is about to fight, why some, especially Americans, are skeptical.
Europe is headed by account 10-6 on the last day of Kubka Ryder
At the end of the day, Cuba's Riyadh Europe will have a positive advantage, because after Saturday's forums and forums, it's the United States with account 10-6.
The inspired poets Tommy Flytwood and the French Molinary have won two victories over the surviving Tiger Woods, and now they have four children at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bourne, who is trying to get back the trophies they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, was headed by the American team in the morning football field with account 3-1.
The U.S. made more resistance in the forums and won two matches, but they could not speed up the break.
Commander Jim Furrick needs eight eyes in 12 weeks to protect the trophies.
Flytwood is the first European novelist who beat four blinds at the same time, while he and Molinari (with Mollywood) are only the second pair who picked four eyes in the first four matches in the history of Kubka Ryder.
When Woods and Patrick Reed broke up in the soccer field, they joined to win the South Woods and New American Brixon Deshambo with even more effective 5ths4.
The Woods, who pulled out two matches on Saturday, demonstrated random genocide, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 matches in soccer clubs and forums and seven matches in the basement.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning football, returned to Henry Stanson's partner in the forums to get a copy of account 2 to 1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, who is the first and third in the world rating.
Europe couldn't do anything more for this nice fresh day in the south-west of Paris.
The three main winners of Jordan Smith and Justin Thomas set the standard for Americans on Saturday with their two eyes.
They won a victory of 2t1 over the Spanish John Ram and John Paulter in the soccer field and later won the Poulter and Rory McClroy with account 4t3 in the Forsoms, losing two first moons.
Only two times in the history of Kubka Ryder's team returned with a defect in four eyes in a single, although the Fury's team needed nothing.
However, after a second two - day period, the week - long contract seems to be inconceivable.
North Korea says "no way" won't be released in a unilateral order without trust
On Saturday, the North Korean Minister said that the continuation of sanctions would undermine confidence in the United States, and that under such circumstances the country would never be able to refuse its nuclear weapons.
Ri Young Ho told the UN General Assembly that in the past year North Korea has used "sustained efforts of good will", such as stopping nuclear and rocket tests, decomposeing a nuclear-tested supplier and the obligation not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see the appropriate response from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be the first to be divided into one international order."
And while Rey repeated the known complaints of North Korea against Washington 'on-the-spot' approach to decollarization, according to which North Korea will be rewarded for further steps, his statement proved important because it did not reject the unilateral decollarization that had been done in the past.
Riy sent to the joint statement by Kim Chen Ina and Donald Trampa at the first time in history between the actual US president and North Korea's leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called for work on the "Declination of the Korean Peninsula", and Tromp promised security assurances from North Korea.
North Korea wants the formal end of the Korean war between 1950 and 53, but the United States stated that Phinenan must first refuse nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposes the call to weaken the strict international sanctions on North Korea.
"All of them insist on the "decollarization of the beginning" and raise the level of pressure by means of sanctions to achieve their goal strongly, and even oppose the "declaration of the end of the war," said Rei.
"To think that sanctions can put us on the knee," the sudden dream of those who don't know us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions undermines our confidence."
Rey didn't mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Tramp, on which the U.S. leader stressed at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to the three meetings of Kima and South Korean leader Mun Zee Ina over the past five months and added: "If South Korea were to be a party to this question, instead of the United States, the South Korean peninsula's decollaration would not be such a deaf corner."
Despite this, Rey's speech was quite different when he told the General Assembly that the targeting of North Korea's rocket in the mother's part of the United States was permanent after the "Mister of the Evil President" Trip called Kim a "human missile", who wants to commit suicide.
This year in the UN Tromp, which threatened the “complete destruction” of North Korea, commended Kim for her courage in using weapons, but said that much more is needed and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea's denuclearization.
In mid-Tramp, it doesn't set up for this period: "It takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Phinenan for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary-General Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions should continue with energy and inexhaustible until we see the full, final, approved denuclearization.”
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea in 2006 with a view to blocking the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles in Phoenicia.
Pompeo met Ri at the UN General Assembly Collars and then said that next month he'd come back to Phoenan to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo had already visited North Korea three times this year, but his final trip was unsuccessful.
He left Phenyan in July and commented that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemned him for the "Gangster Requirements".
During the meeting with Monon this month, North Korea promised to collect a rocket complex, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States uses the "relevant measures".
He said that Kim said he needed the "responsibility" security guarantees that the tramp promised in Singapore and the steps to normalization of the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on how to relax enough
A new course at Harvard University this year gave all his students more sleep, and it's an attempt to fight the growing culture of learning crate all night after coffee.
The author found that students at the university are often neglected when it comes to the very basis of how to care for themselves.
Charles Chester, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a professor at the Women’s Hospital Brigham, developed a course that, in his view, is the first such course in the United States.
He decided to start the course after he gave a lesson on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
Finally, one girl came to him and said, "Why are they telling me this right now, at the last stage?"
"She told me that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep that surprised me," said an interpreter from The Telegraph.
The course, first introduced in this year, gives students a basis for explaining how good sleep habits help them achieve academic and sports results, as well as improve overall well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the executive director of the university’s medical services, said that the university decided to take a course after it was found that students had been seriously out of sleep for a week.
The hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there's a picture of the rooms in the gym where students click on coffee, tea, coaches and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, the impact of sleep deficit on sports shows, and the importance of routines related to sleep.
Another section tells us how persistent sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The accompanying map encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know this will not change the behavior of students in a moment.
But we think they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know about the consequences of smoking cigarettes for health," added Professor Chesler.
The culture of pride for “sleeping all night ” still exists, he added, and he noted that modern technology and constant pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is growing.
A good enough sleep should be a “secret weapon ” for a student to fight stress, stress, and anxiety, even with a set of weights, as sleep deprivation translates the brain into hunger, causing constant physical hunger, he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemistry and physics, helped Professor Chesler develop a course after he enrolled in one of his other courses last year in Harvard during the first year.
He said that the course would tear his eyes and inspire him to create a new course for the entire camp.
The next step, he hopes, will turn to all the experts, asking for a similar program of education to come to the competition facility.
Professor Chesler recommends that students be reminded of the need to sleep, as well as of setting up a building and be in the course of the harmful influence of light, which is produced by electronic screens and light bulbs, and may damage the circumference of a circular rhythm that causes sleep problems.
Levengston 1 - 0 Rangers: Hol Mangy's boys are upset by Gerard
The Rangers survived a series of gruesome shock attacks: the Dolly Mangy attack brought by the various team of Steven Gerard along with account 1-0 from Lvivingstone.
The Aybrox command wanted to win his first victory at the exit game after the summer triumph over St. Johnston with account 4.1, but Commander Gary Holt gave Gerard a second chance as manager of 18 games.
Menga was killed in seven minutes before the quake, and Rangers, who lacked inspiration, did not seem to be able to compare the account.
Now, the Rangers are down in six positions, and the Livingstone is up to three, and they're only known as Hibernian.
In addition, the Rangers may experience another setback, since the Lensman Kalum Spence was forced to treat the head wound after the guest sector had thrown some object into it.
Gerard made eight changes in the team that had once been transferred to the South Coast of Scotland.
And Holt released the same version of "Live 11", which took one eye into Harts" last week, and was caught up in how his trained boys pressed opponents on every step.
Maybe Reingers was mastered in the royal sword, but Livingstone worked more with the captured sword.
They had to kill everything within two minutes of the game, when the first time Mangy in the free zone enabled Scott Pittman to strike at the turn of God's McGregor, but the semi-trailer was mad at this great chance by sending a sword to the door.
A deep free strike by Keagana Jacobs reached the shipper Craig Halket, but his defense partner Alan Litgo hit the back of the station
The Rangers were actually controlled, but at the end of the third, there was more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos, of course, felt that he should be entitled to a panel at the mark for four hours after his encounter with Steven Lauless, but the referendum of Steven Thompson rejected the conversion of the Colombians.
The Rangers were able to do only two rounds in the first team, but the former “Aibrox” thief Liam Kelly hit Lassani Kulibali and the peaceful strike of Ovie Ejaria almost did not break.
And although the last hall of Lvivingstone for 34 minutes may have been in opposition to the game, no one can deny that they had earned it only for their hard work.
The Rangers couldn't cope with Jacobs' supplies again.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Galler sent a sword to Scott Robinson, who quietly chose Mengo for a simple end.
In the spring, Gerard replaced the Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and this change was almost immediately worked when the Higger broke into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly picked up his line to block it.
However, Livingstone continued to force guests to play in the same game that they liked when Litgo and Halquet made one long trip for others.
The Holt's team could have improved the results at the last stages, but McGregor was well opposed to Jacobobs before he hit Liggo from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a replacement in the Rangers, made another later application for the script when he met Jacobs, but Tomson took a look again.
Almanach: Judge of the Geigers
And now the page from our weekly morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago this day, and the time is going... in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Gans Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, a product that in time evolved into a device known as the number of Geigers.
One of these figures was one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of the pop culture, such as the 1950s "Call Coronado" film with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who are playing suspiciously about the appearance of cotton scientists.
The man said, "What's all this about?"
Rogers says: “This is the number of gays used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you look at these particles, you can really feel the effects of the atoms on the radioactive activity in the minerals."
Evans says, "Well, it's really going to work."
Hans died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.

A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see and kill harmful cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify harmful cells that are part of the treatment
The method is to remove the immune cells in the patient and change them in the laboratory.
Then these cells are able to see a protein that is common to many cancers. The cells are re-entered into the patient.
The test vaccine shows many promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify harmful cells, the ovarian cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes removing the immune cells in the patient, changing them into the laboratory so that these cells can "see" together for many types of white cancer (HER2), and then re-inserting these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Cancer, Maryland, noted: "Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine."
" HER2 "incentives the growth of several types of cancer", including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer," he explained.
A similar approach, which is included in the removed immune cells in patients and the “artificial ” to target cancer cells, has been developed in the treatment of one of the types of leukemia.
After attending the SNL show at the MAGA Kanya West baseball studio, the President-in-Office of Trampa,
What caused the negative reaction of the viewers
The viewers of the SNL show (Saturday Evening in Direct Efrey) discovered Kanya after his funeral, during which he hailed US President Donald Trampa and said that he would vote in the presidential position in 2020.
After performing a third song called Ghost Town in baseball with the title "Return America to the First Glory" he fired a trumpet in which he criticised Democrats, and once again declared his support for the Trap.
"When the whites talk, they ask me, "How do you like the tramp?
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd have left America a long time ago."
Shaw SNL began the plot by Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star quoted Bretta Cavano's testimony to the Senate's legal committee in connection with the call of Christine Blaise Ford on sexual violence.
Although West’s speech was not transmitted directly to the Efrey, a video with his tattoo was posted on the social network of Chris Rock comics.
Whether Rock wanted to throw the West out of this post is left unclear.
West was also informed by observers that he had been hit by a bad situation through the main meeting.
As Washington Examiner reports, West said: "When I was behind bars, I was deeply moved.
I was told, "Don't go out to watch this baseball."
They broke up with me!
And then I'm told that I'm in a place where the oppressed talk."
The West continued, "You want to see where the oppressed speak? I'll wear my baseball superman because no one can tell me what to do.
Then try to treat one another with love."
According to Variety's weekly, his comments at least twice caused a negative reaction of viewers in the hall, and SNL actors seemed lost. One of the viewers said, "The studio had a dead silence."
In the last minute, the West was asked to replace the singer, Aryan Grande, whose former boyfriend, Reper Mac Miller, died a few days before the emperor.
The West called for many surprises, performing a song I Love it (I love it) in the costume of Perrier's water.
Vesta supported the head of the conservative organization TPUSA Canadas Terner, who wrote on Twitter: "One of the most courageous: thank you for what you've done to the NATOVOP. "
Instead, the current leader Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West "is who he is, and that's just great."
"That's why I'm not going to reward him (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his "city"), who, in my opinion, tells and exaggerates the ideology that damages my society.
He's a free man.
Like us," she added.
Before the show, the reper announced on Twitter what changed his name: now he's "the one who used to know as Kanya West."
West is not the first performer to change his name. He follows the example of Daddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffie and Pie Diddy.
Colleague Snup Dogg was previously known as Snup Lion, and, of course, the music legend of the last decade has changed the name to symbol, and then became "Artist, earlier known as Prince."
Indictation of a deliberate murder after a knife attack in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with murder in a suicide attempt after he had another man's knife wound in one of the restaurants of East Belfast on Friday.
The police reported that the incident occurred in the Belliegecomor restaurant.
The defendant is expected to appear before the judges of Belfast on Monday.
The prosecutor is looking at the charges.
Kit Herington's series star condemns the idealization of brutality.
Kit Herington became famous for the role of war with the sword of John Snow in a brutal medium-year fictional series of HBO's production.
However, a 31-year-old actor who was convicted of a hero-mate stereotype, asserting that because of such heroes on screens, it often seems to young boys that they should be cruel to respect others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture Kit said that, in his opinion, "something went wrong," and asked how to solve the problem of the idealization of brutality in the era of #Meto's popularity.
Kitt, who recently married his colleague at the "Gree Prestables", a 31-year-old actor named Rose Lesley, noted that he was "very determined" to fight this problem.
"I'm now set up quite resolutely. When did we get on a narrow path to the idealization of brutality?" he asked.
"Why do we teach future men to look at their growth through the strain of the problem we see now?"
Kitt believes that television is partly responsible for the popularity of the fraternity through the image of very brave heroes.
He continued: "What is natural, and what are we planted?
Why does television and the street teach youths to feel pressure to be the same as men?
I think today is a really important question: How can we change it?
'Cause it's obvious that the boys have fallen out of the right way.'
In the interview, he also noted that there will not be any cracks and cracks after the show of the series of the next summer, because "he's already finished with battles and horses."
Since November, Kitt will play in the "Real West" series, Sam Shepard, the story of the filmmaker and his brother-in-law.
As an actor recently realized, he considered meeting with his wife, Rose, the best that he had ever received from his participation in the "Glue of the Thrones" series.
"When I got caught in this series, I met my wife, so he gave me a future family and determined my future," said Keith.
In a fictional series that won the "Emmy" prize, Rose played the game, the love of hero Gerington John Snow.
The couple arrived in June 2018. The ceremony took place in the territory of the Lesley family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: In China, 14% of new cases of disease are reported at risk
In China, 14 percent of people with HIV and AIDS have been diagnosed with an increase of 14 percent.
According to health authorities, more than 820,000 patients are reported in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases of disease have been reported.
In most cases the disease was transmitted by means of an article indicating a change in a previous trend.
For a long time, in some regions of China, HIV was rapidly spreading through infected blood during the transition.
However, as the official representatives of health-care agencies said during the conference that in the province of June, the number of people who were infected with HIV this way was almost zero.
However, compared with the previous year, the number of HIV and AIDS patients in China grew to 100,000.
The transfer of WIL by sex in time is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
The discrimination against homosexuals in China occurred in 1997 but the LGBT community often suffered from discrimination.
According to the study, 70 to 90 percent of men who have sexual relations with other men are further married to women through a country of conservative values.
In most cases, transmission of disease is the result of inappropriate use of protective equipment during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide free access to HIV drugs, thus providing a partial solution to the problem.
Maxyn Waters counters the corruption of data from the Republican senators on the network of her state worker and makes a serious criticism of "hazardous lies" and "Torities of Communication"
On Saturday, a member of the US Chamber of Representatives, Maxine Waters, made a vote on the fact that one of her state employees had posted the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on their pages in Wikipedia.
Democrats from Los Angeles claim that these statements are spreading ultra-right political viewers and websites.
"false, false, and then even more disgusting lies," Wutters said on Twitter.
According to reports, the survey contained home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrina Hetcha from Yuti.
The data appeared on the network at 4:00. They were placed by an unknown person from Capitol during a hearing in the Senate Commission for the prosecution of sexual acts against Brett Cavano, a candidate on the position of the Supreme Court of the United States.
The data leak took place some time after the three senators asked Cavano.
The Hill reported that on conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, there was information about the source of the IP address associated with the Waters office and was able to find the data of her state-owned coworker.
"These irrefutable claims are absolutely wrong, they don't answer the facts," Wutters continued.
"The staff member of my office whose personal data and security have been put at risk as a result of these distorted and false statements has nothing to do with the outcome of this information.
These irrefutable claims are absolutely false, they do not answer the facts."
The Waters statement quickly appeared on the network, and among others was the former White House press secretary, Ari Flecher.
"This opposition is filled with anger," Fleisher wrote.
"This suggests that she cannot be a member of Congress with such a nature.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, there is no need to be angry.
The accused should not act in a cowardly manner.
He should not question the motives of the accused.
He must remain calm and unwelcome."
It seems that Fleischer had a parallel between Walters' reaction and the criticism of the Democrats to the Kawano judge, who was accused of being too upset during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a candidate from the Republican Party, who is working on Waters as a result of the inter-election, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"This is so news, if it's true," he wrote.
In his statement, Walters noted that her office had already reported "the relevant government and law bodies on these false statements."
"We will do everything we can to find the guilty," she continued, "and they have responded to the law for their actions which are harmful and dangerous to all my employees."
Look at the film "Agent Johnny English: New Mission" - a past parade of spy fighters with Rowen Atkinson
It has already become a good tradition to look for every new British film of the meanings of Brexit. They are also in the new series of comedian parades on the battle of Johnny England. The first film called "Johnny English" went out on screen in 2003 and later replayed in 2011 by calling it "Johnny English: Relaunch".
Will it become a ridiculous ironic self-sustainment for what we are short, new export potential of the nation?
Either way, Johnny England with his moving face and his eyes were given the opportunity to make a mistake, and his name is more than anything else indicates that this comical character was created for viewers in non-English countries.
As we know, Johnny is an extremely happy secret agent, who, despite his extraordinary effort to be generous and wonderful, is a little bit from Inspector Clousea, a little from Mr. Bina, and a lot from the guy who played one note from the movie "The Fire Cars" at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony in London.
In the same way, the staff is also a manager and a reminder of the international scale, which has always been left behind by the weakness that Atkinson once had in his long - forgotten television advertising company Barclaycard.
The last film about Johnny England has a few nice moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny England came near the helicopter in front of the helicopter, and the gloves of the Guineans hung around his shop.
In the film, Atkinson's talent is well-opened to set up the buffonade, but the humor is passing, and at some point it's too much, especially if it's compared to "serious" coins, such as Agent 007 and "Mission impossible", one of the "ingredients" which is also a comedy.
The impression is that the jokes are calculated more than the children of adults, and I don't think the stupid attacks that take place with Johnny England are as innocent and as clever as the Atkinsons in their movies about Bina.
As always, the film begins with a serious threat to Britain.
The British supersecret spy network detects hacker and reveals the names of all field agents who have become completely desperate for an active agent. ( Sadly, Kevin Eldon played only an episode in the film.)
This was the last blow to the prime minister – a Pihetate person who has already experienced a devastating criticism and is in deep depression because of the loss of popularity (Emma Thompson tried to convey the image of Teresa May, but the script didn't fully open it).
The intelligence staff informed her that all active agencies had been compromised, and she had to arrest one of the apostates.
The election falls on unhindered Johnny England, who now works as a teacher in some super-skilled facility and teaches children to work undercover (in this part with a spy school year) there were several other games for young people.
The English is quickly delivered to the Witgol at a terminal briefing, where he meets again with his many - suffering friend Buff, who is playing Ben Miller on the other side.
Buff is now married to the captain of the underwater boat (the role of an exhausted person does not exactly correspond to the talent of Vicki Pepperdin).
So when all of her Majesty's Secret Service goes to the corner, Betman and Robin return to the beach and unexpectedly meet the fatal woman Ophelia Pistoletov, who plays Olga Curylenko.
And at this time, the Prime Minister is under the auspices of a charismatic billionaire who has made his article in technology and technology and claims that it can eliminate the problem with the British network, the evil Jason Volt, who was playing Jake Leiss.
The English and Baf are sent on their way and they are reenacted with their funny jokes: the officers are making fires in the French bitter restaurant; they continue to dry chaos by not leaving behind on the coolest edge of the Volt; the English sets up a real mess when they try to use a virtual reality to find out about the planning of the Volt house.
All the obstacles lead us to the final episode, but with his kindness and jealousy he reminds children of something.
Previous movie.
As I look at other artists about Johnny England, I've asked myself the same question: can't the British film industry offer Raven Atkinson a role that really corresponds to his talent?
The Liberians oppose the preparation of a plan for which the British will work four days a week, but they will be paid in five days.
The Liberian party, Jeremy Corbin, has to discuss a radical plan that the British will work four days a week, but they will be paid in five days.
It is pointed out that the party wants to force the company leaders to transfer the costs that have been incurred as a result of the evolution of artificial intelligence to employees, giving them additional output.
In this way, workers will have a third day leave and will bring home the same salary.
As the source reports, this idea will be a response to the party’s economic program and will direct the country’s resources to support the working class.
The four-day work week was approved at the British Congress of Trade Unions, which shows that workers can thus benefit from changing the overall economic situation.
The Journal of the Leiborist Party reported on the issue of The Sunday Times: "The policy will be announced at the end of the year.
The idea of a four-day working week is not going to change in one night, but the idea of a four-day working week corresponds to the approach of the party to change the balance of the economy in the interests of the workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Liberians were not the first to accept this idea, because the Green Party promised to hold a four-day working week still during the 2017 pre-shipment campaign.
However, not all members of the Leiborist Party at this point agree.
Spiker of the Leiborist Party said, "The party's political program is not intended to launch a four-day work week, so we don't look at this idea right now."
"Tinnian" Chancellor John McDonnell presented his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy on the pre-war ride of the Leiborist Party last week.
Mr. McDonnell said it was planned to withdraw power from the "individual directors" of municipal companies and "visitors".
It also means that shareholders of the water supply company can not get their entire share of the capital if the Liberian government initiates the "recovery" on the basis of the alleged violations.
He also confirmed the intention to include employees in the company's government and to create an inclusive fund for the transfer of 10% of the normal shares to the private sector companies, which are expected to meet annual dividends of up to 500 pounds of sterling.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking at the 60 Minutes show (60 minutes) whether the Cavano case led by the FBI can change their mind
In connection with the investigation of the charges against Judge Bretta Cavano, who is led by the FBI, the final vote on his appointment as Judge of the Supreme Court has been postponed at least once a week.
On Sunday's show, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Greem if the FBI could find something that would change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
During the hearing, I told him that I had a discussion with the Kawan court.
I phoned him after everything had happened and the charges had been dropped, and I asked him, "Did you really do this?"
He was determined, constant, uncompromising."
It seems that Graham's mind is no longer changing.
"I think the removal of Cavano's charge is a provocation," he said.
"Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett decided to oppose everything," added Graham, turning to Christine Blaise Ford.
And everyone she calls can't confirm it under oath.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't understand what might change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and how can it affect poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival (World Festival), an annual event in the music world with a host of stars and at least an exciting mission to combat poverty in the world.
During the seventh World Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will be killed at the headquarters of the Central Park, not only to enjoy the events of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendez, but also to pay attention to the real goal of the festival - organizers to combat the ultimate form of poverty by the year 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is the continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international civil organization that is expected to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to get free allowance for an event (if you don't want to pay a VIP ticket), visitors should do less tasks or "actions", such as learning in a volunteer project, writing an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call or anything else to help pay attention to the purpose of the organization – poverty eradication.
So are there any results already, since the goal of Global Citizen organizers has remained for 12 years?
Is it really the idea to reward a free concert -- the general way to convince people to demand action, or is it just another case called clicitism, when people feel that something really changes, signing an electronic request or making a publication on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, they've fixed 19 million "actions" of their supporters aimed at achieving different objectives.
The organization claims that these actions have prompted world leaders to claim financial reconciliation and programs for more than $37 billion, which will help to change lives by the year 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group set out as an example of its 390 financial commitments and public statements, and at least 10 billion have already been collected and spent.
According to estimates, the cost of living has already affected some 649 million people around the world.
Among the main financial commitments, you can mention the Fund The Power of Nutrition, which is territorially related to Britain. Investors and realisers under the project have undertaken to "help children grow" and promised to provide Rwanda with $35 million to meet the problem of malnutrition after they received more than 4700 messages from the Global Citizens organization on Twitter.
"For the support of the British government, the mayors, the governments of other countries and the citizens of the world, like you, we can make a social problem of not having a significant historical fact," said the representative of The Power of Nutrition Tracy Wallman, speaking in front of the audience at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also stated that after 5000 "actions" called for better feeding of mothers and children, the British government announced the cost allocation for the project The Power of Nutrition, aimed at improving the consumption of 5 million mothers and children.
In answer to one of the popular questions on your website, "Why do you think you can fight extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen's representatives wrote: "This is a long and difficult way, so sometimes we'll fall down and we'll suffer failure.
But like the participants in civil rights and anti-partite movement, we will achieve success, because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, the party The Weekend, Sean Mendez, Cardi B, Jeanelle Mona, is just part of the star performers who will be presenting this year at the New York Festival and presenting it to Debor-Le Fernes and Geu Jackman.
Minister of Internal Affairs said the United States could use military-sea forces to block the export of Russian energy resources.
According to the U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, quoted in Washington Examiner, "for the need" Washington may be called upon by military and maritime forces to prevent the release of Russian energy in the market, including the market in the Middle East.
Zinka stated that Russia’s participation in the conflict in Syria, especially where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government, is the reason for the new energy generation.
"I think they're living in the Middle East because they want to be an intermediary in the energy trade, as they already do in Eastern and South Europe," he said.
According to the owner, there are ways and means of solving the problem.
"With the US military and maritime forces it can provide free access to the maritime routes and, as necessary, block them so that Russian energy resources do not reach the market," he said.
In fact, it was a non-profit organization that held the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that held itself as "the voice of every consumer" in the United States.
He further compared the approaches to trade with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually similar.
"The economic strategy for Iran and Russia is generally based on the fact that we use energy effectively and place it as alternative," he said, calling Russia "one-timely developed", as its economy depends on the mineral origins.
At the time when these statements were made, the authorities set the goal of increasing the export of natural gas to Europe, pushing the energy market of Russia’s origin, which is a very low - price option for Europeans.
For this reason, the authorities of the tramp administration and President Donald Tramp try to convince the German government to reject the "inadequate" project of the "Northern Flight 2" project, which, according to the Trampa, makes Berlin the commander of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the "Northern River 2" gas is worth 11 billion dollars and doubles the current gas capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, except an economic project.
Kremler believes that Washington will be against the project only for economic reasons, which is an example of unfair competition.
"In my view, we share the idea that energy resources cannot be a pressure tool and the consumer should be able to select suppliers," said Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Minister of Energy Rick Perry, who took place in Moscow in September.
The U.S. put forward a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
Germany's lead organization of the Federal Federation of German Industry (BDI) has urged the United States not to join the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I don't like it when a third country enters our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Federation of German Industry, after the last meeting of German Chancellor Angel Merkel with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren "seriously Thinks" about the president's vote in 2020
Senator Elizabeth Worren of Massachusetts stated on Saturday that "he's seriously thinking" about the president's vote after the inter-election.
During a civil meeting in Goleok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering the possibility of reaching his candidate.
As The Hill Worren reported, "It is time for women to go to Washington and set up a government job, and for this, there must be a woman."
"After the 6th of November, I seriously think about setting up my candidate as president."
At a meeting with the citizens of Warren, she expressed her appreciation to Donald Tramp's president, saying that he "did not lead his country in that direction.
"I'm extremely worried about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren was open, critical of Trampa and proposed a candidate for the position of Judge of the Supreme Court, Bretta Cavano.
In Vorren's fifth tweet, "...of course, the FBI has to investigate before the vote."
However, according to the survey conducted on Friday, the majority of Vorenese voters do not think it should be fought in 2020.
According to the results of a study jointly conducted by the Political Research Centre of the University of Saffolk and the publication The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the state's potential voters spoke against the removal of their candidate senator.
Thirty-two percent supported the removal.
The results of the survey showed that the former governor, Deval Patrick, used more support.
During the discussion of the candidates of other famous Democrats, who can compete in 2020, they are also known as former Vice-President Joe Byden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Byden stated that he would make a decision by January.
Sarah Pailin tells of the PTSR Traka Peelin during the battle with Donald Trampa
26-year-old Trek Pailin spent the year in Iraq after entering military service in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence, and the incident took place on Monday night.
"What is happening now to my son, because he is coming back, can only be understood by other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and other health problems that our soldiers are returning home," she said to the participants in support of Donald Trampa in Tals, Oklahoma.
Pailin called Trek's arrest "a problem that no one pays attention to," and said her son and other veterans "come back home not as they used to be, and want to know if they respect what their brothers, soldiers and other military officers have done for this country."
According to the spokesman of the police department of Vasilla, Den Bennet, Treka arrested on Monday in the town of Vasilla, Alaska, and filed charges of domestic violence and assault on women, as well as of the fact that he had banned the report on violence and had a gun in the state of alcohol.
18 The United States and the Region of Colombia Supports the Conciliation of the U.S.A.
Eighty states and the Colombia area support the criticism of a new U.S. policy, according to which the victims of gang persecution and domestic violence are denied refugee status.
According to the NBC News, representatives of 18 states and districts sent an analytical note to Washington to support a petition that needed an attachment and made a complaint in court about the policy mentioned.
The full name of the appeals in the case of Grace vs. Xennas is called by the American Union for the protection of civil rights, in which federal policy is challenged and which was submitted in August is not disclosed.
The caller said her partner "and her cruel son-in-laws" were her, but the U.S. landlords rejected her when she asked for the 20th of July.
She was illegally detained in Texas.
State prosecutors who support Grace's call have said that the inhabitants of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (the refugees often ask for shelter in the United States) are often faced with serious problems such as banditism and domestic violence.
The new refugee status policy reflects the 2014 Appeals Council’s decision on immigration, according to which immigrants without documents from domestic violence could apply for admission.
The Attorney General of Colombia, General Carl Reissin, said during his speech on Friday that the new policy "ignores the decades of state, federal and international laws".
"The federal law requires that a decision on a refugee status be based on the facts and circumstances set out in this statement and that the ban violates this principle," says the Court's consultant's analytical note.
Further, in an analytical record, prosecutors argue that a policy that prohibits immigrants from entering the United States is harmful to the economy, as they can potentially become entrepreneurs and "fill the necessary labour resources".
Professor General Jeff Seshns issued an order for immigration judges in June that they could no longer provide refugee status to those who fled from domestic violence and gangrene.
"The petition is given to those who remain in their country through persecution or fear of persecution in connection with raciality, belief, nationalism, membership in certain civil groups or political views," Seshns said during the presentation of politics on 11 June.
It was never intended to resolve all the injustices, even the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Rescuers desperately seek to find survivors, while the number of those who have died in Paul’s city has grown twice
For those who have left their lives, the situation continues to deteriorate.
"Situation is very tense," says a 35-year-old mother, comforting her boy with a lyhomanko in the evacuation centre of the city of Paul.
"Every minute of the relief will bring the body.
The clean water isn't enough."
Some residents return to their destroyed homes, reevaluating the undernourished, trying to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and doctors have been injured by earthquakes, with 7.5 balls on Richter’s scale being overloaded.
Some of the wounded, including Two Geres with a broken back and shoulders, rest near the military hospital, where patients are being helped under the open sky through constant repeated mail.
His eyes were filled with tears when he remembered how a strong mailman pushed the hotel room on the fifth floor where he lived with his wife and daughter.
"There wasn't a time for a break.
I think I was hit in the middle of the wall," said Geres Correspondent Associated Press, adding that he and his family came to the city on Christmas.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and then cried quietly.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "increasing psychological pressure" through "advertising propaganda."
A week after the Chinese newspaper published on four pages of American daily advertising on the benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US Ambassador of China accused Beijing of using the US press to publish the propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Tramp of the past sent to the Chinese daily magazine Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in the state of Iowa, after being accused of trying to influence China's election to the Congress, which will be held on 6 November. China rejects these charges.
According to the U.S. official agency Reuters, Trampa, in which he accuses Beijing of trying to enter the U.S. election, means a new phase of isolation from Washington, the target of China's pressure.
While foreign governments may be able to place advertising for the activation of trade, there is a time-consumption between Beijing and Washington, where they have already raised import fraud.
According to experts from China and the United States, at the beginning of this war, the pursuit of a repressive myth in China was aimed at targeting exporters from such countries as Iova, who supported the Republican Party of Trampa.
Terry Brunsted, a US Ambassador to China and former governor of the state of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural production to China, stated that China had caused damage to American workers, farmers and companies.
China, as Brensted wrote in the column on the Sunday edition of Des Moines Register, "enforces the pressure by publishing a advertising that contains propaganda in our independent press."
"To spread the propaganda, the Chinese government uses the way for the American people's tradition of freedom of speech and independence of the press, which includes a tax advertising in the Des Moines Register," wrote Brensted.
"On the contrary, on the street platforms here in Beijing, you're just looking for a single voice of dissidents. Here you can't see the real picture of what the Chinese people really think about the development of the Chinese economy, which is causing anxiety, which is the conclusion that China's MMI is under the trustworthy control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the most important Chinese publications proposed to publish" his article, but didn't mention what it was.
Analyticals warn that the fall of Cavanaugh Republicans will set up against themselves female voters in front of the inter-elections.
Since many prominent Republicans support and protect the candidate in the post of Supreme Court of Britta Cavano after several sexual charges have been brought against him, analysts warn that this may lead to an unwanted reaction to future intermediate elections, especially in women.
Around this situation, the majority of the Republicans say that they would like to vote.
Such things can't be played back then," said Grant Riger, professor of politics at the School of Maxwell of the University of Syracuse, during an interview with The Hill published on Saturday.
Riger expressed doubts that the FBI's investigation, at which last minute Senator Jeff Fleck (Republic of Arizona), would be sufficient to calm down the frustrated voters.
According to Washington, D.C., the principal adviser and speaker of the progressive group MoveOn (Next) Catherine Jan Perry said on Friday: "Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it either tomorrow or November".
According to Mic, protestors sang "The West is approaching!" on Friday morning during a demonstration at the Legal Committee when the Republicans decided to proceed to the Cavano candidate, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
In an interview with a news website by Steve Rottenberg, a postpartite political observer, said, "People will be extremely interested and motivated."
"They say it's already, and it's true.
However, motivation can be related, especially in women 18-29 years of age who have not yet been identified and often do not vote if they do not like the president."
In addition to the fact that the Forum had given testimony to the allegations of a candidate on the ground of the Supreme Court judge in sexual crime, analysts predicted the negative reaction of the voters if the Republicans were to insist on their approval.
According to NBC News, earlier this week the head of the National Committee of the Republican Party Michael Steel said, "This is an unpleasant story for the Republican Party."
As President of the U.S. Priorities, director of the U.S. news channel, Guy Cecil, "not in the vote committee, the final vote, or in the fact that Kawano was on the ledge, but in the way they responded to the situation and how they went ahead."
However, the American view of the testimony of Ford or Cavanaugh was divided, with a little more support.
As a result of a new study by YouGov 41% of respondents believe or believe in the Ford testimony, while the Cavano witness believes or believes 35% of the respondents.
In addition, 38 percent of the respondents noted that, in their view, Cavano had given or almost gave false testimony, while 30% of the respondents said the same thing about Ford.
According to The Guardian magazine, the FBI, after pressure from the FBI, is conducting an investigation of the charges made by the Ford and another caller, Debor Ramirez.
Last week, Ford gave a witness under oath to the Senate's Legal Committee on how Cavano attacked her, living in a state of alcoholism when she was 17 years old.
Ramierres said that a candidate on the position of the Supreme Court judge showed her his birthday at dinner during their studies at the University of Ellis in the 1980s.
The Internet comes from the world network to start the "new Internet" to create Google and Facebook competition
Tim Berners-Ley, the founder of the Internet, is launching a new start to create a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the world's technology legend, Inrupt, is about developing platforms with an open source source code Solid, which belongs to Berners-Lei.
With a Solid platform, users can choose where to store data and give access to this or other information.
In an exclusive interview, Fast Company Berners-Ley welcomed Inrupt's goal as "world domination".
"We should do this now," he said about the start.
It's a historic moment."
Solid technology is used to enable users to create "personal data storage" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, current lists, calendars, audiobooks, and other tools for personal use and work.
It's like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify at the same time in one browser.
The unique feature of this personal online data store is that it fully meets the user's needs, which can access any information.
The company calls it "increasing personal capacity through data".
According to General Director Inrupt John Bruce, the company is designed to operate resources, processes and relevant skills to make the Solid platform accessible to everyone.
At present, the company is composed of Berners-Lei, Bruce, security platforms for IBM, several state developers, hired to work on the project, and volunteer partners.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own autonomous applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Ley said that he and his team will not negotiate with Facebook and Google on whether to make a full exchange when all their business models are experiencing docturnal changes over a short period of time.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a publication on the Media Berners-Ley on Saturday, the Inrupt mission was "to provide commercial energy and ecosystem and to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on the Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners-Ley transformed the Internet, establishing the World Heritage Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last month, Berners-Lie is an influential figure in the debate on network neutrality.
Even at the time of the launch of Inrupt Berners-Ley, he was the founder and director of the Consortium of the World Heritage Fund, the Web Foundation and the Institute of Open Data.
"I look very optimistic about the next generation of network development," added Berners Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Church of the Cross of Victoria in World War I · Global Voices
The only representative of the Church of England who received the Order of the Cross of Victoria to participate in the war during World War I is respected in his home town 100 years later.
Colonel Bernard Vann, similar to him, was awarded the award for his involvement in the attack under Bellings and Leukour on September 29, 1918.
However, he died four days ago from a bullet wound and never learned that he had received the highest military reward in Britain.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren discovered a memorial stone during a parade in the town of Rasden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, called it "extraordinary symbolic" that the discovery of a memorial stone took place about 100 years after his grandfather made a move for which he was rewarded.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann transferred his battalion through the San Caten channel "through a very thick cloud and under a thick fire of fields and heat."
Later he rushed to the fireplace and with the "excessive hobbling" he pulled a beam forward, one went to the field heat and destroyed three heats of enemy fuel.
Colonel Vanna shot a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — a little over a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather did what he could never do, and he deserves respect.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, put a bullet after a parade under the leadership of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it feels very proud of taking part in this advice" and added that "the duty of a real hero is to show him the chance that so many people show him."
The MMA fans didn't sleep all night to see the Bellator 206 tournament, but instead they showed "Sink Poppu"
Imagine that you don't sleep all night just to see the events of Bellator 206, and you're not allowed to watch the main event.
There were 13 wars in San Jose, including six of the main program units that spent the night in Britain on 5 channels.
About six o'clock in the morning, just before Gegard Moses and Rory McDonald were ready to meet in a unit, the British televisions died from a vision when, instead of a cross-platform, the war appeared on screen.
Some observers were not in the grip of this because they did not sleep until the very morning, waiting for the battle to take place.
One of the fans wrote on Twitter that the switch to a child's multifilm seemed to him "some impossible joke."
"According to the decree of the government of the continent that had been transpired on the 6th morning, it was inappropriate, so they were forced to leave the child transmission," said Dave Schwarz, the senior vice president of the market and connections to the town of Bellator when he was asked about the television station,
"Sinka Peppa," yes.
Bellator Scott Kocker, president of the company, promised to work on a traffic chart to cover future coverage and viewers in Britain.
"I think that if we talk about retranslation, we can adjust this," said Kowker.
"Now it's Sunday, 6 a.m., and we can't do anything until it's Sunday, and it's Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was turned off, we received many messages that we responded to, and the text of these messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical misunderstanding, and we tried to remove it.
However, it was apparent that this was not in harmony with government signatures.
I can promise you that it will not happen again.
We're going to speed up the tournament to five battles instead of six, as usual, and we're trying to rewind the signal for the fans, but until these tests are cancelled.
A really unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Dale felt "best" for others because of his sexual orientation
The Olympics in Water Tom Daily reports that he grew up feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete said he didn't understand that "not all like him" until he went to high school.
Taking part in the transfer of Desert Island disks to Radio 4, which led by Lauren Lavern, he noted that he was openly referring to the rights of gays to give the "hope" to others.
He also stated that because of parenting, it was less likely to win over the Olympic Games.
However, a long time ago, Kirsty Young went to the hospital for a few months.
When she came as a payer for Lavern's first program, Dale said she felt "best" for others when she was a kid, because "the society didn't get when people liked boys and girls."
He said, "To this time, the feeling of inferiority and differentity was the only thing that gave me the strength and strength to achieve success."
In his words, he wanted to know that something was worth not to disappoint all those who finally learned about his orientation.
The two-year-old Olympic Prizer became famous for the law of the LBGT society and used the appearance of this year's Games of Society in Australia to call on more countries to demarcation homosexuality.
He said that he spoke openly about his views because he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and wanted to share this "hope" with others.
The triad champion of the world admitted that his feelings toward a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lans Bleke, whom he met in 2013, had become a real surprise to him.
Daley met with an Oscar prize winner over 20 years ago, but, in his words, the difference in age was never a problem.
"If you're going through so much in such a young age" (in the first Olympic Games he was 14 years old, and in three years his father died of cancer), it's hard to find someone of his age who would have survived the same injuries and falls.
In June, the couple had a son named Robert Black Day, and since then, according to Dale, his "worldly acceptance" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, I'd just think about what to get gold," he said.
"You know, things are much more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he had brain cancer.
Dale says that his father could not cope with the loss of his life and that before he died, he asked whether they had bought flowers at the London Olympics in 2012 because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him "Don't sit in the first row, because you won't be around anymore," said Dale.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and dying, I finally realized that he was not inevitable," he said.
The following year, Daley attended the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"I knew that this was the dream of my whole life: to throw in front of my peers at the Olympic Games, and it wasn't a feeling better than that," she said.
This feeling also moved him to choose his first song, Proud (Goldy) in the performance of Giser Smoll, which resonated with him while he was preparing for the Olympic Games and still calling for the walls.
The Desert Island Discs program is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a year.
On Saturday with a tournament match for the Rayder Cup, Michaelson, who was not in shape
American Phil Michaelson will set up a record on Sunday, playing his 47th game in the tournament for "Cuboc Rayder," but he has to renew his form so that this event doesn't happen to him.
Michaelson, who takes part in the tournament once every two years, released from Captain Jim Furic's game at the time of the football and forsoms.
Instead of staying at the center of the event, as he often did, playing for the United States, the five-year-old winner encouraged the team all day and trained in the side, hoping to overcome emotions.
As Michaelson did not boast of the violent attacks even while he was on his career, 48-year-old athlete didn't go to a difficult field for the golfer Le Golf National, where the raf usually beats with a bluff.
And if that is not the case anymore, at the ninth game on Sunday, Michaelson will have to meet with the open champion and the master of the exact hit of France's Molinary, which in exchange with novelty Tommy Fletwood won all his matches this week.
If the Americans who stand on three eyes after 12 single matches begin well, Michaelson’s match can be decisive.
Furic expressed confidence in his sports career, and he probably had nothing to add to it.
"He finally realized his role today, put me on his back, confessed, and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Furic.
"He doesn't doubt his powers.
Michaelson is a member of the Hall of Fame, who has done so much for the command last week.
I guess I didn't figure he was gonna play in two games.
I predicted more matches, but it did, and so we decided to do so.
He wants to be there, in the field, like anyone else."
If Michaelson goes out on the field on Saturday, he's gonna beat Nick Faldo's record, which played the biggest number of matches in the "Rayder Cup" tournament.
He may finish his career in the "Cuboc Rayder" tournament, which never responded to his individual achievement.
According to Michaelson, 18 won, 20 hits, and 7 hits, but Furic said that his presence could play a decisive role for the team.
"He's funny, funny, sensitive, he likes to chat with others, he's a guy who's a good teamman," explained Furic.
"I think the young players were having a good time visiting him, and this week, and it was interesting to observe.
He's more than just a player."
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bourne, knows that the big deal is not going to work.
Thomas Bourne, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a sensitive gap in front of the tournament's last day's tournament is not yet guaranteed victory.
In 1997, the Datchan argued in the field of the Valderram club, where the team on the head with His Ballesteros betrayed the Americans in five eyes, but won in the match with a small break with the result of 1411⁄2:131⁄2.
"You remind yourself that we had a great break in the Valdera field; a big break in Brooklyn where we won, and in the Valdera field where we won violence," said Bionn after reviewing the winning games of Class 2018 with the result of 5:3 on Friday and teaching at the Le Golf National Stadium, after which the break is 10.6.
So history teaches me and every team player that there's no choice yet.
I need to play with the maximum performance tomorrow.
Get out of the field and do everything you need.
The game will be finished only after the result appears on the table.
We have the goal of getting this trophies, and that's what we want.
As I said earlier, I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we are well aware of those who oppose us -- the best players in the world."
Satisfied by the expression of his players in the hard field, Bion added: "I will never run forward.
Tomorrow everything can be different.
Tomorrow we're expected to have personal matches, and that's something else.
It's good to play on the field with a partner when everything's going well, but just when you're standing there alone, and you can check what you're worth as a golf player.
This is how players should be set up tomorrow: within their capabilities.
You stay with your partner without support, and now he has to show you what to do."
In contrast with Bourne, the opposite number, Jim Furic, expects his partners to play better on an individual level, except Jordan Sparta and Justin Thomas, who had three eyes from four.
In the last day, Furrika's share returned to different sides: he was among the winners in Brooklyn, but he was disappointed when a team from Europe created a miracle in Medin.
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Krenshaw, the captain of the 1999 team, organized players before the last day of the game.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we need to start as successful as it was in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the initiative moves on to someone’s side, players in the middle of the distance experience special pressure.
We've put players in the team, so it's like we're going to get together, type, to do something incredible tomorrow."
Tomasu was ordered to try to overcome the opposition in the group against Rory Makillroy, and the first half of the European team were on Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flytwood and Ian Polter.
"I've chosen these partners myself and in this way because I want to share the effort equally throughout the game," Byron commented his choice of players on individual games.
The introduction of a new German warship was rejected again
The latest flag of the German Navy fleet had to take place in 2014 instead of the old war courts of the Cold War era. However, according to local media, this will not happen until the next year through the unjust system and the cost increase.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, obtained from the military-reinforced officer, the introduction of the Reinland-Pfalz ship, the main ship of the latest class gangs of Baden-Wurtemberg, was postponed until the first half of 2019.
This ship was supposed to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the shipments damaged the implementation of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wurtemberg ships, which the military-morrowings ordered in 2007, have to replace the old Bramen-class frigates.
Understandably, they will be supplied with a strong range of anti-aircraft and anti-terrorist rockets, as well as with some technologies to reduce attention, especially radiological, infrared and acoustic.
Another important feature is the advanced period of technical security. New brakes are expected to be able not to return to base port for about two years.
Journalists Die Zeit, however, warn that modern military vessels that were to increase the military force of Germany at the time of entry into operation will also be old.
A massive F125 strike hit the headline of the Turkish newspaper when the German army forces officially refused to enter the ship and returned it to the Blohm + Voss summit in Hamburg.
This is the first case of the return of the military ship to the shipbuilding company after delivery.
The reason for the return was little known, but the German media mentioned significant "software and equipment defects", which made the battleship impossible for military operations.
The lack of software is of particular importance because the Baden-Wurtemberg class ship is made up of about 120 mariners, only half of the soldiers serving in the old Bremen class.
Furthermore, it was found that the ship has too much weight, which undermines its operational characteristics and limits the possibilities for further modernization.
It is considered that the Rhineland-Pfaltz frigate is twice as heavy (7,000 tons) as the same class used by Germans during World War II.
In addition to poor equipment, the total value of the project has been added, which also includes the cost of preparing the equipment.
An estimated 2.2 billion euros have been converted to 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars).
The problems with new frigates have been particularly important in the light of recent warnings of the collapse of German military and maritime forces.
At the beginning of the year of Bundestag's forced armed forces, Hans-Peter Bartels reported that the WMS had "a large number of ships capable of carrying out military tasks".
The officer stated that the situation had deteriorated sharply over a period of time, since the old ship had been released from operation and the new had not arrived.
He was deeply sorry that none of the bands of Baden-Wurtemberg were able to complete the military-season fleet.
The National Trait will be observed in the Secret Life of the One Who Speaks
A new survey carried out in the area of land management in Scotland is aimed at establishing how landshaft is used in the search for food.
Scientists hope that the data obtained will help to shed light on the conduct of these unique flight crews so that they can take steps to protect them in the future.
In the fields of Inver in Western Russia, the scientists of the National Heritage of Scotland will observe such species as the netopire carlic and the notopire of pigmies, as well as the usual and watery night.
Special registries will be placed in strategic locations in the field of land management to monitor the behavior of speakers during the season.
The workers and volunteers of Scotland’s National Heritage will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
An expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to establish the frequency and relevance of speech calls.
Then it's planned to draw up a report on animal survival and prepare a report to link animal behavior with their environment.
Rob Duar, a natural protection consultant in Scotland, is expected to help determine which areas of living are the most important and how they are used in each of the species.
This information will help to assess the efficiency of environmental management (e.g. the formation of nodes) and determine the optimal methods of forest conservation for species and other related species.
During the last century, the population of the people of Christendom has greatly diminished in both Scotland and the United Kingdom.
They are threatened by active construction and the development of a land that prevents them from cleaning.
Other negative factors include wind systems and lighting, mud paper, chemical processing of building materials, as well as household boilers.
They're actually not blind.
But by fishing at night, they are better able to catch prey than they can.
They use a complex ecosystem method to detect comets and obstacles to flight trajectory.
In Scotland’s National Cost of Over 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of special value, and 76,000 acres [66,000 ha] of land throughout the country, the problem is serious.
Ten special - trained experts regularly conduct research, polling, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization's forces have even created the first and only commander in Scotland. It's located in the territory of Triv in the Dampris-end-Gallow area, and has been found in eight of the ten species of dragons that live in Scotland.
David Thompson, the director of the facility, claims that this is the ideal place for them.
"In the territory of the three wonderful conditions for the speakers," he assures.
"This is old buildings, many large trees and other pleasant living conditions.
But we still need to learn a lot about the speakers, and because of the research we're doing here and elsewhere, we can learn more about what they need to grow."
He insists that it is very important to check the territory of the people before any technical work is carried out, since the indiscriminate destruction of one place of nesting can kill up to 400 children alone, which is likely to cause the destruction of all the local population.
They are said to be protected by the law, and animals are prohibited from killing, torture, or concern.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish Conservative Center, urged the community to join the organization’s efforts.
She said, "We still have much to learn about our stories, and we haven't yet discovered the characteristics of the population of many species."
Ronalda rejects charges of rape and his lawyers prepare calls against the German edition
Cristian Ronald called the charges of rape "indiscriminately" and said that people "try to draw attention to themselves", using his name.
His lawyer was ready to appeal against the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the news of suspicion.
American Catherine Mayorg accused a forum for the assembly of Portugal and the football club "Juventus" of rape, which took place in 2009 in a hotel number in Las Vegas.
As Der Spiegel reported on Friday, Ronald seemed to pay her $375,000 for her speech.
A few hours after the 33-year-old defendant was excommunicated, Ronaldo turned to 142 million of his supporters in the Instagram video transmission, calling the corresponding messages "abbreviated".
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today's charges are a trap," said the five-year-old "Gold Dog" in the camera.
"They want to pay attention to themselves using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to look after me, but similar situations are part of my work.
I'm a happy man and I'm all right," added a football player laughing.
According to the Reuters law firm, Ronald's lawyers are preparing calls against Der Spiegel for published charges that they called "unacceptable reports of suspicion in the field of private life".
Lawyer Kristen Sherc said a football player would require compensation for "a moral damage in terms of serious violations, which is probably one of the most serious cases of violations of personal rights in recent years."
It is claimed that this incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after a meeting in the night club, Ronald and Majorga returned to the player’s number where he seemed to have raped her, such testimony was handed to the district court in Clark, Nevada.
Myorga claims that after the described incident, Ronald fell in front of her and said he was "99 percent good guy," which led to "one percent."
As noted in the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with the model, but in general agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went back to the police and then to the hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later she agreed to a court order because she was afraid of revenge and warned of "public humiliation."
Now a 34-year-old woman wants to cancel a previous contract because she continues to suffer from an incident that, she says, had a place.
At the time of the incident, Ronald was preparing to move to the Royal Madrid FC from the Manchester United FC this summer as a player of the Italian football team, a 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain's "will cause domestic damage" about the loss of automobiles
Britain "will be permanently damaged" if it loses the status of the world leader in the car industry after Brexit.
He added that his statement was endorsed by representatives of Toyota UK who told BBC journalists that in the case of Britain's absence from the EU, the company would have to stop its production and work in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said that the effects of the cut-off on the brakes in Brexit’s case could cost jobs without agreement.
In Bernaston, where Toyota was manufactured by Auris and Avenis, some 150,000 cars were exported, 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my view, if Britain leaves the EU in extreme danger at the end of March, production will be stopped in our business," said Marvin Cook, Director General Toyota in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are also worried about how Britain's exit from the EU without an agreement on international trade.
For example, BMW stated that the factory from the manufacture of the Mini model in Oxford would be closed within a month after Brexit.
The main determinants are the fact that Brexit could cause risks to the supply chain without agreement.
The manufacturer of the Toyota line works in the mode of operational data and materials according to the need, the details are available every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for car rentals.
If, on March 29, Britain leaves the EU without agreement, there may be a delay in supplying details that will lead to delays and lack of material.
As noted in the company, Toyota can contain no more than one day's details. So the production will have to stop.
Greg Clark noted that in the organization's plan, a relationship with the EU, prepared by the Chequers Plan, is "particularly envisaged in order to avoid problems on the border".
"We need a deal. We need to make an optimal deal, which, in my view, will enable us not only to achieve success at the moment, but also to use the prospects that have arisen," he said during today's program at the BBC Radio 4.
"In view of the testimony of Toyota's company representatives, as well as other car manufacturers, we must at least keep up with a high-efficiency range of supplies."
The Toyota company was unable to tell how long the production would be stopped, but in a long-term perspective, it is expected that the cost increase will reduce the competitiveness of the company and, as a result, have to cut down the jobs.
Peter Cavalaris, head of the U.S. Professional Association of Business in Bernaston, who worked here for 24 years, said that other participants were extremely concerned: "From experience, I can say that the short-term jobs do not recover."
The representative of the government noted: "We have set out a precise and reliable plan for forming our future relations with the EU."
The Trip and Rosenstein meeting can be relocated, marked in the White House
According to the White House representatives on Sunday, Donald Trampa's meeting with the deputy general prosecutor General Rod Rossenstein may be "extended for a week", while the discussions lead to the removal of Brett Cavano's candidates as Judge of the Supreme Court.
Rosenstein controls the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Muller, who is investigating Russia's involvement in the election, the relationship between the supporters of Trump and Russia and the potential ban on justice by the president.
For a few months in Washington, they discuss the possibility of release from the deputy general of the prosecutor-general, who poses a threat to Muller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had made use of the microphones to record talks with the tramp and that the President's mandate was to be terminated by amendment 25.
Rosenstein has not confirmed this information.
But last Monday he visited the White House on the back of the news that the officer was going to go to the station.
Instead of this meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was appointed on Thursday.
The tramp said that "I don't want to" release Rosenstein, but then the meeting refused to get away with a meeting of the Senate's Legal Committee, where they had to testify to Cavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
On Friday, Tramp arranged to conduct a week's trial of the FBI on charges against Cavano, which further eliminated the vote in Senate.
Press Secretary Trampa, Sarah Sanders, spoke on the TV show Fox News Sunday.
On the question of the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "The date of the meeting is not assigned; perhaps it will occur this week.
But let's see, I'm always keeping track of the latest information in the press."
Some journalists did not agree: Sanders did not have the BMI briefings at the White House on September 10.
Leader Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the rare performance of the briefings was not linked to a "play on the public" by television reporters, although she added, "I can't deny that they're playing on the public."
Then she admitted that she would have to talk to the press myself.
"The president answers the question more often than any president to him," she said and added, not referring to the source: "Statistics speak for themselves."
Sanders noted that the briefings would always be held, but "if there's a possibility of asking the president of the United States, it's better than talking to me."
We're trying to communicate with the press often, which should be particularly noticeable over the last few weeks, and the possibility of talking to the president of the United States is no longer worse than the press conference."
The tramp is regularly answered to questions during meetings outside the White House, open meetings or press conferences for the participation of senior guests.
Personal press conferences are rarely held.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why this is so, in front of journalists who are shocked and sometimes surprised.
The State Secretary for Health Protection of Scotland turned to EU workers in connection with Brexit's attacks
The State Secretary for Health Protection has sent a letter to citizens of other EU countries working in the National Health Protection Service of Scotland to express appreciation for their work and ask them to continue after Brexit.
Jean Friman, a member of the Parliament of Scotland, sent a letter less than six months before the EU's exit from Great Britain.
The Government of Scotland has already undertaken an obligation to cover the cost of obtaining the status of a permanent residence for EU citizens working in autonomous government services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman noted: "Over the past summer negotiations between Britain and the EU were held on the issue of exit.
But the British government is strengthening the preparations for a possible exit without agreement.
I know that this period can be very anxious for you.
That is why I would like to stress again how I appreciate the contribution of every worker, regardless of nationality.
Fellows from all over the European Union and the countries within it share valuable experience and skills, strengthening and improving health services for the benefit of the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, we really want you to stay."
Christion Ebercrombie transferred a terminal operation after head injury
The commander of the Tennise State Tigers team, Christion Ebercrombie, transferred a terminal operation after a head injury in a week's battle against Wanderbilt Komodores, which his team lost with account 31:27.
The chief coach of the Tennise State Tigers told reporters that the player had been injured shortly before the break.
"He went to the side line where he was hurt," said Reed.
On the side line, trainers and medical personnel gave Ebercrombie a oxygen before taking it to our feet for further examination.
The official representative of the Tennisi State Tigers team told Chris Harris from the WSMV channel (Nashville, Tennessee) that Ebercrombie was operating at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "as long as there's no evidence of type and severity of trauma." The Tennis State Tigers team is trying to find out when the player got the trauma.
Ebercrombie, a fellow coach, spent his first season at Tennessee State Tigers after the Illinance team.
He made five hits a week before he got out of the game, so he had 18 hits in his season.
Foreign buyers will pay more government bribes in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will pay more rent in the event of the inequity in Britain. In line with the new Tori plans, additional costs will be spent on the homeless.
This West neutralizes all Corbin's efforts to connect young voters
Higher government fraud will rise from those who do not pay taxes in Britain
In the Ministry of Finance, additional 120 million pounds of sterlings per year are expected to be donated to help the homeless
As Teresa May announced today, foreigners who buy in Britain will pay more bribes, and additional costs will be spent on homeless people.
This step can be measured by attempting to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin’s efforts to convince young voters to make more available living for high - paying workers.
The rise of fraud will involve natural and legal persons who do not pay taxes in Britain.
An additional myth, accompanied by a two - year - old increase in the second life and individuality, may be three percent.
In the Ministry of Finance, additional 120 million pounds of sterlings are expected each year.
According to experts, 13% of the new unemployment that is occurring in London comes into possession of foreign citizens, which leads to a price rise and makes it difficult for those who only dream about their own lives.
Many productive areas of the country, especially in the capital, are deserted because the vast number of foreign buyers spend most of their time living outside the borders of the country.
The new plan of action appeared only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a government bribe to make life more accessible for young people.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices for non-smokers by buying land without further use of it, and he called on Teresa Mei to refuse the quota for available non-smokers to fix the "fare position on the life market" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a low level of important reforms in the area of non-pollution, including the control of rent and the inability to move without significant grounds.
He also proposes to expand local councils in the area of the construction of a new home.
Teresa May said: "I promised Turkey that I would dedicate my life to the restoration of the British dream – for every new generation of life should be better.
This calls for a change in our imperfect life market.
Britain will always be open to those who desire to live, work, and build their future here.
However, the fact that individuals who do not live in Britain, as well as foreign companies, cannot be called fair, however, buy living under the same conditions as British citizens.
For many people the dream of their own lives has become inadequate, and the problem of living under open heaven remains very painful."
Jack Ross: "I've always wanted to be the principal trainer in Scotland."
The main FC's "Sanderland" coach Jack Ross claims that "more than anything wants" ever to head the congregation of Scotland.
A 42-year-old Scottish man has taken over the club from the north-east of the country, who now owns a third place in the First Football League, on three eyes from the leader.
Ross moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, returning the previous season of St. Mary's FC to the Premier League of Scotland.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to the second congregation in Scotland, but it was all over," Ross said during the Sports Sound program at the BBC Scotland radio station.
"When I was a kid, my father and I often watched the game in Scotland at the Hampden Park Stadium."
The only hope for me is to be successful at the position of the main coach of the club."
The Russian presidents at the Sanderland F.C., in particular, were Dick Lawyer, David Moies, Sam Ellerdas, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gustavo Poet and Paolo Di Canio.
Former head coach Alloa Atletik claims that he did not feel concerned about the transition to a large follow-up club by such authoritarian names, before rejecting the proposals of the FC Barnes and Ipswich Town.
"At the present stage, I'll think it's been a success if the club comes back to Premier League.
Because of its structure and the material and technical security of this club, the Premier League is undoubtedly responsible," he said.
"It will be a difficult task, but the other result I'll either think I'm successful."
Ross was only three years old, and he worked as a second trainer at the Dambarton FC, and for 15 months he spent at the Garts FC train station.
Then he helped Alloa complain after the FC hit the third division, and in the next season from St. Mary's, he went from the flight stage to the winning title of the first division.
According to Rossa, he now feels more comfortable than ever during his playing career in the FC "Clade", "Gartpol", "Folkerk", "St. Mirren" and "Hamilton Academical".
"I've been on my way," he says, talking about the transition to the "Hallelujah" FC.
"I sincerely believed that training was more appropriate to me than playing.
This sounds strange, since I was successful, but it was not wrong for me to earn a certain amount of money.
But playing isn't easy.
There are many challenges that must be overcome every week.
I am still dealing with them, coping with stress and stress, but as a primary trainer, I feel at home.
I've always been interested in training, and I've never felt so comfortable about my whole adult life since I chose this profession."

Research: 17:30 a.m. - ideal time for beer
The summer rains helped to increase the welcome of British popes who do not have the best time, but sent pressure on the restaurant network.
According to the sales figures in beans and bars in July, 2.7% increased, while the income of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
The author of Peter Martin's calculations from the CGA, which is being consulted on business development issues, noted: "With the sun's weather and longer periods than expected, England's participation in the Championship world has gone through the same scheme as the previous month, when the pope's release grew by 2.8%, and it has gone even worse.
The red drop of 1.8% in July was dropped.
Babies and bars, which are focused on drinking, while they have the best indicators, increase their income is equivalent to the loss of restaurants.
Pappas, in which food is served, were also affected by the spasms, but not as strong as restaurants.
It seems that visitors are interested only in drinking.
In the sub-control fields and bars, the monthly consumption increased by 6.6%, while food was reduced by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analysis of the volunteer and hotel business department in RSM, said, "We've been watching similar trends since the end of April.
Time and large social or sports events remain the main factors that affect sales on the internal market.
Not surprisingly, groups of restaurants continue to lose income. Every year sales drop by 4.8% raises a special concern about the need to cut costs.
The long summer was not the best time for the storage of food. Let's see if the temperature we observed in August could give them the necessary rest."
The overall increase in sales in beans and restaurants, including new warehouses, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the release of new brands.

Every five children are hidden from their parents on the social network.
As the results of the study, every five children, sometimes not older than 11 years of age, have been hidden from parents and teachers on social networks.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of active pages in Instagram
This news has raised concerns about the possible location of sexual content
20% of the students reported that they had a "main account record" showing parents.
Every five children, sometimes under the age of 11, create an account on social networks that hides from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of active pages in Instagram — a social network for the exchange of photos.
This news has raised concerns about the possible location of sexual content.
20% of the students reported that they have a clean "main" account that shows parents as well as one or more private ones.
The mother, who accidentally hit her 13-year-old daughter's secret page, saw the call, "Go ahead of me."
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in private schools showed that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two social networks profiles. Half of these children admitted that an additional account is confidential.
The head of HMC Mike Bukenen's association said: "We are very concerned that many young people feel a desire to create an online space where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elyde Doyle will be "a representative of the athletes' interests" at the Scottish Athletics show.
Alyde Doyle was elected in the Scottish Athletics Council as an independent director during the annual general board of government members.
Doyle is the most famous Scottish athlete. The head of Yen Beatty’s team has called this step a great opportunity for those who are leading a sports movement to use it with a wide experience that will be gained at the international level over the past decade.
"Eilida is used with great respect among the athletes of Scotland, Great Britain and the world. We are convinced that, by joining her to the council, the athletic sport in Scotland will be of great benefit," said Beatty.
Doyle said, "I'm going to act as an athlete's representative, and I hope I can really benefit and contribute to the development of sport in Scotland."
An American, a four - story Olympic champion, who won 200 and 400 yards [200 and 400 m] in 1996 in Atlanta, and now a BBC sports viewer, lost the ability to walk through a transhistical ischemist attack.
He wrote in Twitter: "That's why I became an insult.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would show me how much I can recover.
Thanks to my incredible efforts, I have been able to regain my health, and I have learned to walk again, and today I am doing dynamic training!
Thank you for your support!"
Women were compared to cows in milk advertising – Internet users’ thoughts were divided
The milk-producing manufacturer has been touched by a variety of Internet users' reaction to advertising that compares young mothers to active dogs.
In recognition of the release of a product called "the world's first nucleoside milk-smoker", the technology company Elvie released an announcement in the form of a humorous music video to demonstrate the freedom that provides mothers with a new demolition.
Four real mothers dance in a full-fledged sine under the song, which contains the words, "Yes, I love myself, but I don't have the stomach" and "How you see myself, it's not my mouth, it's my chest."
Next, the choir sings: "Shut up, shut up, let the children get ready, shut up, so that the baby doesn't die."
However, the advertising role published on the Facebook page led to a disturbing discussion online.
The video received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, but the response of the Internet users has been very different. Many have noted that the advertising has been undeterred by the "greed organization" of milk production in the industry.
"It's not a very reasonable decision to use the roots for advertising this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and born to give milk, but their children are taken under their roof a few days after birth," wrote one of the users.
Elvie is easy to hide in the touchbox (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment is, "It's clear that it's traumatic both for the mother and for the child.
But why don't you put them in for a milk-smoker for women who need to feed their babies?"
And someone added, "This advertising is very far from reality."
Other users spoke for the advertising role. One of the women appeared to be very happy.
"I think it's a great idea.
It would have been quite strange if she had been breast - feeding.
I felt like a cow when I was sucking the milk.
The advertising is kind of crazy, but I wasn't looking for a hidden content.
It's a wonderful product," someone wrote.
Here's another comment: "A bit of advertising, focused on breast milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
The advertising is not focused on clarifying the advantages and disadvantages of milk industry."
At the end of the video, women are showing milk - growers hidden in their buds.
The idea of a advertising campaign is based on information that many women who use such products feel like cows.
However, Elvie’s democracies work absolutely quiet, without a dress or a tie, and it is easy to hide in a bursgaller for adoption, which allows women to move freely, keep the children and even go out the street.
Anna Balarin, a partner and executive director of the advertising agency Mother, commented on the situation: "Elvie's educator is such a revolutionary product that he called for a clear and causative presentation.
When we had a parallel between women who are interested in milk and real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the particulars of breast - feeding in an interesting and interesting way by demonstrating the incredible feeling of freedom that the new dementor will bring.
Elvie is not the first to be hit by news headlines.
As part of the Sunday fashion in London, the mother of two children appeared on the scene with this product while displaying the clothing from Martha Jacob's model.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to the city of refuge on the Tehao border
The number of detained migrant children has increased dramatically, although the number of monthly crossings in the border remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policy of the Trapa administration has complicated the process of placement of children in the caregivers.
Traditionally, in most cases the caregivers were self-immigrants without documents. Now they are afraid to risk their own ability to remain in the country, offering to take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be obliged to provide fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albens, senior executive of the Bureau on immigration and municipal control, testified before the Congress that the Bureau’s staff had arrested ten people who had applied for care for minors without a follow-up.
Later, the Bureau confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no criminal record.
"About 80% of the people who are caregivers or members of their households live in the country are illegal. Many of them are foreigners who have committed a crime.
That is why we continue to persecute these people," Mr. Albens noted.
According to the appellants, in order to speed up the investigation of children, the officials had introduced new rules that would require some of the children to appear in court within a month of detention, not 60 days earlier.
Many of them can use videoconferencing rather than come to court personally to bring their legal status before immigration courts.
Those who do not have the right to access the appellant in court will be deported quickly.
According to crew members and officials, as long as the children remain under the charge in the last month, they may be more likely to experience anxiety or depression, which may lead to the fear of violence or attempts to escape.
Lawyers claim that these problems are strengthened in larger stores, such as Toronto, which is more difficult to keep track of the psychological condition of children.
They added that by moving the children to the city of refuge and not having enough time to prepare themselves emotionally or get along with friends, we are risking the trauma that many of them have already experienced.
Syria ordered the US, France and Turkey to immediately expel the army
In addition, in front of the General Assembly of the United Nations, Minister of Foreign Affairs Valid al-Mulam called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war had lasted for eight years in the country.
Muala, also serving as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were living in the Syrian land illegally under the leadership of the fight against terrorism, so "the attitude of them will be appropriate."
"They have to go immediately and not put conditions," he said to the assembly.
Mualam insisted that "the war with terrorism was actually over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 men have died since 2011, and millions of people have left their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territory" from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
Nearly 2,000 military officers were deployed in Syria, mainly teaching and consulting Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Basar al-Assad.
In a failed war country, France sent more than 1,000 soldiers.
As for refugees, Mualem assured the country that the conditions for their return were created, and he also accused "some Western countries" because they "are spreading unfounded fears", because refugees are not forced to return.
"We have called for international cooperation and humanitarian organizations to help people come back," he said.
"We're watching the effort to eliminate the whole humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be able to help restore the country until a political agreement between Assyria and the opposition to the end of the war has been established.
The UN diplomats report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of buffer zones around Idliba, the last great wave of rebels, created an opportunity for political negotiations to continue.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has helped to prevent the massive rise of the Syrian forces supported by Russia in a province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement has a "silent term" and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the Jedi, including the fighters associated with Al-Qaeda Front an-Nurse, who "will be destroyed".
UN Ambassador Stefan de Mister hopes to attend the first meeting of the new committee, which will be brought to the composition of government representatives and opposition to develop a post-constitution constitution for Syria and create conditions for elections.
Mualem removed conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that his work should be limited to "a review of the articles of the actual constitution", and warned against interference.
Why the Tramp will be re-examined
This logo of the Trampa can be revised in 2020 if, as many liberal viewers are expected, it does not form the completion right after the scandal and impiety.
Surely this would be the most dramatic conclusion of the presidency all the time!
At the moment, viewers do not give a single mark.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in prime time more than doubled (up to 1.05 million) to CNN channels and actually reached (up to 1.6 million) to MSNBC channels.
According to Nilsen, Fox News, the average 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the program The Rachel Maddow Show on the MSNBC cable channel was at the top of the rating of 3.5 million viewers in the evening when the main news is being discussed.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's beyond our understanding," said Nil Ber, who performs the drama "Last candidate" on the ABC channel on the State Secretary, who becomes president after a devastating attack on Capitol.
Nell Scowell, an experienced humorist writer and author of the book "Spiritious moments: and a few difficult facts about the discovery of Hollywood men" suggests another theory.
She recalled a trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The water told her to vote for Trampa.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because he's making me laugh," he said, telling me that story.
Haos is having fun.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, history from Washington is able to determine the future of Roy against Wade, the possibility of bringing together immigrant families and the state of the world economy.
It is a refreshment that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet you can't say that you're just trying to stay informed by the citizens when you watch the six-hour expert group discuss the use of Bob Woodward's "well-known" source for his book "Stras", the shortcut of Paul Manafort's 15 000-dollar Strauss skin, which was written in The Washington Post, and the surprising results of Mr. Trampa's anatoms published by the Party of Daniels.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be an ex-husband.
"The reality of the show is partly related to the fact that you agree with something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment company and author of the television program "Sirki Lombarde", about rotation in the actor's warehouse and daily accompanying returns to the "Tramp" show (the conflict with the NFL, support of Kim Chen Ina).
If you allow yourself to miss out on a single episode, you can leave without hope.
When I was able to meet Mr. Fleis at his house on the northern coast of the island of Kaway, there was a hot suntime (27 degrees below Celsius), but he sat at home watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He could not get out of the television, not when Brett Cavano was brought before the Legal Committee of the Senate, but the future Supreme Court was sitting on the throne.
"I remember how we created all those crazy shows of our time, and people said it was the beginning of Western civilization," Mr. Fleis told me.
"I accepted it as a joke, but it seems they were right."

External impact of money in the worst middle of the convention
It is not surprising that in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, additional financial impact has been directed, as two actual conventions are being won by one cross through the review of the electoral districts.
In the struggle for this urban area of Pittsburgh, which had recently been changed, is a democracy, a member of the House of Representatives of the Connor Lemb, who won a victory in the other district in the additional elections of the past century.
Lemb is against another real congressman, the Republican of Kita Rotfs, who is now represented by the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is a significant measure of the new 17th.
The Court was recast after the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in the autumn of the year that the old borders of the regions were emphasised on the benefit of the Republicans of the Constitution.
Pre-election movements in the new 17th districts have raised strong opposition between the financial divisions of major parties, the Committee of the Democratic Party of the United States from the elections to the Congress (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Party (NCRC).
The name Lemba became well-known in Pennsylvania after winning a minimum advantage in the 18th district during the additional elections in the Congress in March, which were widely used by the public.
This place belonged to the Republicans for more than a decade.
Political experts have given little preference to democracies.
In the United States, El Salvador was considered to be supported by China, but thought
The diplomats reminded of the weak opposition from Washington to the actions of the Dominican Republic and Panama, who had previously supported Beijing’s position.
In June 2017, Trump had a warm meeting with Panami Juan Carlos Varela, president of Panama. There was also a hotel in Panama before partners came from staff hired by the Trump Organization.
The officials of the State Department decided to challenge US diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama through "the recent decision on Taiwan's lack of recognition", said press secretary of the Department of Justice Geser Noyert at the beginning of this month.
But sanctions were directed only against El Salvador, which received approximately 140 million US dollars in 2017, particularly in the area of drug control, as well as in support of social and economic development.
The proposed fines, which were intended to reduce the cost of financial assistance and the target limit of visa delivery, would be painful for that country of Central America with its high unemployment and murder.
As a result of internal advances, residents from the countries of North and Central America held a conference at a high level, dedicated to security and economic development, and the analogous West went through the past year, and assessed it as a step forward in efforts aimed at curbing the flow of migrants in the United States.
But by mid-September, senior representatives of the administration had come to understand what they wanted the conference to take place. In fact, the issue of sanctions against El Salvador had ceased.
According to diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pines is now planning to attend a conference scheduled for mid-October, indicating that the administration considers this West to be very important.
At that time, three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, for there were no new news or complaints from Washington.
The representative of Mr. Bolton of the White House refused to comment on the details of the internal discussions reported by three U.S. officials, two of whom were diplomats, under the conditions of anonymity.
The information provided was confirmed by a side analysis, close to the administration, who also spoke on the conditions of anonymity.
Learn History
The following concern may be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on possible infringements of justice by Trampa, and the weight of confirmation can be found in the public information now available.
It is reported that in its investigation, Mueller is checking the possible link between the tramp campaign and the attack on our voting system from Russia.
If the impact of the convention is to be seen in the other hand, the Trip will have to report to the conventioners, as well as to the electors and finally to the parties.
In this case a lot of "if" and I don't want to say that the fall of Trampa is inevitable, as is his colleague in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make a choice that determines the duration of the war.
In 1938 the German officials were ready to adjust the coup against Hitler if only the West began to oppose him and supported the Czech Republic in Munich.
We have failed and lost the opportunity to avoid bloodguilt.
History is determined by such extreme moments, and the inexhaustible movement of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are waiting for a couple of such triumphal processions.
What will we do if the Tromp release the deputy of the Attorney General of Roda Rosenstein, the man from whom Mr. Muller's share lies?
Rosenstein was still in the lobby while the paper reported that he proposed a secret interview with the president and shared his concerns about the non-compliance with the tramp.
Rosenstein called the information in The Times wrong.
"How do we react if the investigation against Brett Cavano, which has recently begun by the FBI, appears to be insufficiently fair or honest, or if the Cavano candidacy on the seat in the Supreme Court is confirmed, despite the conviction of sexual harassment and the commission of false witnesses?
And, first of all, will we be able to vote in the medium term for those members of the Congress who will be able to take responsibility for the tramp?
If we pass these tests, there will be bad times for democracy.
But I believe that we will not be led by the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Osven, the same Nazi regime that once occupied my missionary home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to burn Sunday candles on the table with the swastika.

FC Reedgers takes the Rapid (Videnna) in fourth. After an impressive nothing in Spain in the game with the Villarreal this month's victory over the Austrians will provide the Scottish club with a good chance to get out of the G League of Europe.
Because of the trauma of the semi-smoker Graham Dorrance was able to play for the first time in the season only in connection with the "Vilary Real" that ended with account 2:2. However, he thinks that the FC "Raingers" can use this result as a tramplin to achieve more.
"It was a good result for us, because "Vilirreal" is a strong team," said a 31-year-old player.
"We went out to the game hoping to get the gods something and got one eye.
Perhaps at the end of the game, we could go ahead, but at least nothing can be viewed as a fair outcome.
At first the opponent was better, but after the break, we corrected the situation for our benefit.
Fourth, another important opposition will take place in Lisie Europe.
I hope we can get three eyes, but it's not easy, and our future opponents have shown good results in our last game, but we can count on the support of the patients, and I'm sure we can give the fight and get the positive results.
The past year, of course, was difficult, starting with my injuries and ending with changes in the club itself, but now the situation was normal.
We have a great deal, and all the boys are happy.
I hope we can go on, leave behind the last season and succeed."
Women lose their sleep through the stress of retirement
Despite the fact that the investigators had a clear idea of how they would like to organize care for themselves, there was a few who talked about it with their family members.
Nearly half of the people who participated in the study of the nationwide company said that they had talked to their husband or wife about the value of long - term care.
Only 10% of respondents spoke to children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't hurry to talk about it," remarked Holly Snaider, vice president of the Nationalwide life insurance company.
That's what we need to start.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: Your family will not be able to provide you with the care you need if you do not tell your parents your wishes long ago.
Consult your consultant and your family to determine where and how to get care, because this choice can become an important factor in determining the value.
Contact a financial adviser: He can advise you how to cover your expenses.
The long-term supervision sources include traditional insurance policies, hybrid life insurance policies, or self-sustainment (for the condition that you have money).
Prepare legal documents carefully: this will enable you to avoid legal tensions long ago.
Prepare your representative’s confidence that will control your medical care and follow through if you are unable to do so personally.
In addition, we are pleased to develop confidence in the budget.
Choose a trusted person who will make a financial decision for you and pay for your disability.

His injuries are not life threatening, but the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Paul on Friday, reports the government authorities, but the number of victims may increase.
As a result of the departure from the supply chain of personnel involved in humanitarian aid, no information can be obtained from the Dongal Regent, north of Paul, which is located near the planetary center of magnitude 7.5 ball.
After Paul’s natural disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated.
Let us consider a few basic facts about the location of the island of Sulavesi, the city of Pala and the Regent of Dongal.
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow river on the west coast of the island of Sulaves, with a population of 379,800, according to the 2017 data.
When the earthquake struck, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency that extends more than 300 km (180 km) along the coastal line on the northern edge of the island of Sulaves.
According to the 2017 census report, about 299,200 people live in the Administrative Region, located in the lower part of the province.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main obstacles to the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, particularly the coastal region of Dongal.
Nickel production also plays an important role in the province, but mainly focused in Moroval, on the opposite side of the Sulvaves.
According to data from the Indonesian agency, the effects of natural disasters in the last 100 years, Paul and Dongala suffered from tsunamis several times.
In 1938 more than 200 men died as a result of tsunamis in Donegal and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
In 1996, tsunamis also hit the western part of Dongal, and nine men were killed.
Indonesia is located in a seismicly active Pacific volcano and suffers from earthquakes regularly.
Below are a few of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
On December 26, 2004, a powerful earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Achega, located in northern Sumatra, caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, resulting in the deaths of 226,000 men, more than half of whom died in the province of Acheg.
2005: At the end of March, at the beginning of April, a series of powerful earthquakes broke out in the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatra.

The oldest son, Sari Pailin, was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Peylin's lead, the oldest son of former Governor Alaski and the candidate on the position of Vice-President, Sari Paylin, were arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report published on Saturday by the state police of Alaska, 29-year-old Paelin from Vasily, Alaska, were arrested for suspecting domestic violence and accused of interrupting the report of violence and protesting during the arrest.
According to a police report, when a woman tried to call the police to report any possible crime, she picked up her phone.
According to KTUU, Paelin lives under a currency in the next Isle of Matanuska-Susitna with the right to make a loan of $500.
He stood before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself innocent, when he was asked if he confessed his guilt, they reported online.
Pailin is accused of three Class A offences, predicting an arrest for one year and a fine of $250,000.
He's also accused of crimes in Class B, which is due to imprisonment and fines of $2,000.
The charges against Paelin are not the first time they have been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Pailin.
His mother, Sarah Pailin, called the police and reported on a possible attack.
Now the case is in the view of the Aleski Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, as well as with the fact that he banned the report of domestic violence and carried weapons in the state of alcohol abuse when this incident occurred.
His girlfriend said he hit her face.
In 2016, Saru Pailin was criticized by a group of veterans for justifying her son’s harsh conduct after serving in Iraq.
In Indonesia, earthquakes caused tsunamis: hundreds of people died
At least 384 people died after the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulavesi on Friday.
The earthquake struck a 7.5 - ball - sized earthquake that destroyed hundreds of homes.
The network of connections and electro-supply has gone out with fear, and the number of victims can rise in the next few days.
The earthquake took place near the center of the island of Sulaves, located in the northeastern part of the capital of Jakarta, Indonesia.
The video that is being spread on social networks shows the time when the character was hit.
Hundreds of people gathered at the festival on the beach of Paula when the tsunami broke out on the beach.
The federal prosecutors require a rare death penalty for suspects in New York City.
In New York, federal prosecutors demand the death penalty of Saifulo Saipov, suspected of being a terrorist in New York City, resulting in the death of eight people – a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
It is claimed that in October, 30-year-old Saipov, after a car rental at Home Depot Pikapa, went on a bicycle route along the coast of the six of West Side, the Lower Mangetten, and started killing the bicycles and passengers that had hit him on his way.
According to the report on the purpose of helping to cope with the loss suffered in the southern part of New York City in order to justify the death penalty, the defendants should find that Japan "inspired" killed eight people and "inspired" committed serious physical injuries.
According to court material, each of these charges foresees the possibility of a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Court of Justice dismissed Saipou's charge for 22 points, including eight charges of murder, which usually involve federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as charges in violence and car accidents.
According to the prosecutors who described the so-called Saipan crime as "screaming, cruel and malicious", this attack is the result of "relative planning and far-reaching thinking".
Victims who were injured, injured or killed by Syfullah Habibullaević Saipov became Diego Enrique Andgelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Lora Dekadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferruchi, Ernan Diego Mendos, and Alejandro Damian Pagnukko, as described in the report on purpose.
Five people were killed by tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last time in South New York, a crime was committed by the death penalty.
The defendant, Halida Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, and eventually sentenced to eternal imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was brought to effect in New York in 1953, the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg died after being sentenced to a trial for spying for the benefit of the Soviet Union during the cold war two years before.
Both Rosenbergs were shot at an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the Saipov court material, the birth of Uzbekistan did not demonstrate the consent of conscience for the next few days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told his followers that he was not harming the shoe.
According to the prosecutor’s act, the authorities told him that he was excited about the video IDUL he was watching on his phone.
The police reported that he also requested an IDUL proposal in his hospital room.
He did not confess himself to being charged with 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Cyprus, said they were "very disappointed" by such a decision by the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to get a death penalty instead of to accept the confession of guilt and sentence eternal imprisonment without the possibility of release will only send the psychological trauma of all the victims," Patton said.
The Saipa defense party also earlier asked the prosecutors not to seek a death sentence.
Parliamentary MP from the Conservative Party believes that the most important event must be appointed to be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Today, during the protest on the march of the Conservative Party, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the National Army".
The former Head of the United Kingdom's Independent Party stated that politicians should "hear pressure" from Eurosceptics, because one of the Members of Parliament, Terezy May, proposed their candidate for negotiations with the EU.
A member of the Conservative Party, Peter Bowen, said on March in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would have gone" if Mr. Faraj was Secretary Brexit.
In view of the problems that May had faced, trying to calm his deep - rooted line, it was even more evident that delegates from the Conservative Party against the exit joined in a special protest campaign in the city against Brexit.
The Premier of the Zhesil is trying to put into life a compromise plan for the Chequers, despite attacks by the followers of Brexit, those who oppose the exit, and the EU.
The Union insists that she will not try to talk to Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and will force the Europeans and the Liberians to choose between what it proposes and "haosom".
In the midst of Leave Means Leave in Solihali, Mr. Boun said he wanted to "reject from the Chequers."
He suggested that Mr. Faradju leave the darkness and take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had answered for it, we'd already be out," he said.
Parliamentary Member Wellingboro added, "I will support Brexit, but we must reject the Chequers."
Speaking against the EU, he said: "We fought in the world wars not to be organized.
We want to adopt our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bown rejected the assumption that after the 2016 vote, the public opinion changed: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and they don't want to go is absolutely not true."
A member of the Conservative Party and deputy Brexit Andrea Jenkins, who was also on March, said to the reporters, "I'm just saying, "Minister Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan is not popular among the general population, the opposition is not going to vote for it, does not support our party and our activities, which actually go along the streets and fight for the vote of the voters.
Please reject the checks and begin to listen to them."
She added, "Ministers are keeping their jobs when they make promises."
Mr. Farage said politicians should "hear pressure" if they are going to refuse the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"Now this is a question of trust between us, people and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to hurt Brexit, and we're here today to tell them it won't come out of their hands."
In a message to the whole enthusiasm of the crowd, he added, "I want our political elite, who's planning to corrupt Brexit's idea, felt pressure on himself.
We mobilize the national army of this country, which will lead us to victory in Brexit, and we will never rest until we become independent, independent, proud United Kingdom."
At that time, opposers went to Birmingham and then spent a two - hour meeting in the city center.
A number of activists broke off the "Conservatives against Brexit" banners after the group started with these exits.
The Liberian Lord Adonis laughed at the conservators because after the opening of the conference through their party program, security problems arose.
"These people who tell us that they can use IT systems and technologies that are necessary for Canada-plus, well-organized border, free trade with Ireland," he commented.
"It's a whole fascist.
There's nothing good in Brexit," he added.
Warren's planning to "seriously think" about the president's flight.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that after the elections in November, she "has been thinking seriously about voting in presidential position".
The Boston Globe reports that the representative of the Democratic Party from Massachusetts spoke about his future during the general meetings of the Western Massachusetts.
Vorren, who is often criticised by President Donald Trampa, is in a second round of November against a member of the Republican party, Jeff Dila, who was a member of the Trompa Company in Massachusetts in 2016.
They consider it to be the main candidate that can fight the Tramp in 2020.
On Saturday, her 36th meeting with the electors in the form of general meetings took place from the time Trump entered the office.
The participant asked her if she was planning to participate in the presidential election.
Verren answered that "the time for women to go to Washington and set up a government job, and that's why there must be a woman in his head."
They arrested a suspect in the murder of a fire-armed basketballist "LSY Tigers" Sims
The Baton Rouge police, Louisiana state, reported on Saturday that the suspect was arrested on Friday for murder with a fire-fighting battalion bomber "LSY Tigers" Wade Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Diton Simpson at a press conference in 11 o'clock in the morning.
On Friday they published a video recording of the shooting with a request to help you identify the man on it.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot at the University of Southern camp on Friday morning.
"Wide Sims got a fire wound in his head and died," stated 247sports police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday.
Wade joined his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result, it was found that Simpson was in a crime scene, had a gun, and was shot at Wade Sims.
The symbol was arrested without incidents and taken under guard in the East Baton Police Department.
Simms, who grew 6 feet and 6 inches and who grew up in the youth bed, grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games with 10 stars in the last season and spent 17.4 minutes in the middle of the game, collected 5.6 eyes and 2.9 drops.
Gran-in-Russia: Luis Hemelton was short-lived in the battle for the title of the world champion after the team decided to give him victory over Sebastian Fettel
From the moment Walter Botts left behind Luis Gemington on Saturday, it became clear that the Mersedes' command will play a significant role in the race.
Bottas had been running out of half a mile and almost got Gemelton, who tried to hold his position on the first two rounds and gave Fettel the chance to attack his fellow on the team.
Fate was sent to the front five feet and left Gemelton on the track in the corner of the race that had to be resolved.
The captain of the Mercedes team walked out one more round and went out behind the Fettel, but Gemelton went to the leader after a certain manoeuvre on the wheel, which led Ferrari to his neglect of leaving the inner space through the risk that he would hit him, after the result of the double manoeuvre was able to break forward on the third turn.
On the 21st day of his birth, Max Ferstappen began from the back of a series of networks and stayed in the seventh place until the end of the first round.
After that, he led most of the race because he did not change the race to get to the finish and contain Kim Reckkonen from fourth place.
In summary, he stopped at the foot of the 44th wheel, but he couldn't raise the pace to the last eight, so the Riekkonen took the fourth place.
"It's a hard day, because Walter was fully exposed to all the exits and showed honor when he gave me the opportunity to walk.
The command has done an extraordinary job to take the first place and second place," said Gemelton.
The Body’s Tongue Has Not Affected
On Wednesday, President Donald Tramp expressed his firm position by Senator Diane Fynstein that she did not announce the contents of the list of Christine Blaise Ford, who accuses a candidate to the Supreme Court of Bretta Cavano in sexual violence.
During a meeting in the West Virginia, the President did not direct his attention to the evidence given by the Forum before the Legal Committee of the Senate, but expressed his opinion on the events in the Senate that, in his statement, showed the human "fate, ambiguity and falsehood".
"The only thing that could happen, and all the wonderful things that happen in the last few days in the Senate, is anger, you see the wicked people who display greed, deceit and lies," he said.
"You look at the publication and published information, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't.
It's not me."
Do You Remember?
Diane Fynstein, did you publish information?
Remember her answer... did you publish the contents of the documents?
Oh, no.
I did not make a statement."
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't," he added, copying the senator's behavior.
In July Fünstein received a letter from a report of charges brought by the Forum against Cavano, and his content was released in early September, but Fünstein denied that the source of information had arrived in her office.
"I didn't hide the charges of Dr. Ford, I didn't publish the information received from her," said the Finnish Committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it secret, and I didn't break my promises."
But her opposition seems to be not like the president who made a comment during the Saturday afternoon: "I tell you, her body's language has not been impressed at all.
Maybe she didn't do it, but I haven't seen anyone else stay worse."
Continuing to defend the candidate to the Supreme Court, where three women were accused of sexual violence, the president admitted that Democrats used accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to return power in any necessary way.
You see the inferiority, the amnesty, all of them alike, who are to blame for who should be trespassed in order to gain power and control," says the President.
Elite League: "Dandy Stars" - "Belfast Janets", 5:3
Player "Jiants" Patrick Duyer left two chess in a fight against "Dandy"
"Dandy Stars" was rehabilitated for a five-day break in the summer bed by Belfast Janets, winning on Saturday match-up with account 5:3.
"Jiants" got an early advantage in two shifts thanks to Patrick Duyer and Francis Bowley's kidnappers.
Mike Sallyvan and Jordan Connie compared the account to the home game, and then Duyer re-emerged the "Jiants" ahead.
The "Dandy" player French Busher compared the account, and two of Lucas Lundwald Nilsen's balls gave them victory.
This is the third in the season of the summer bed of the command of Adam Kifa, who received a voluntary victory over "Dandy" with account 2:1 last night at Friday in Belfast.
This is the fourth command meeting in the season. Three previous matches won the "Jaunts" command.
The first one, Duyer, stopped at the fourth minute (3:35) after Kendall McFol's transfer, and four minutes later, Bowley, who had received the check from David Reserford, doubled the account.
After the first period of tension in the fourteenth minute (13:10) Sallivan returned the owners of the field in the game, and at the sixteenth hour (15:16) Kouni, receiving a check from Matt Markvard, compared the account.
The Duyer provided Jayants with victory before the first break, at the end of the first period, by the end of his second shift.
The lords of the field were regrouped, and Bushhar again compared the account to twenty-eight minutes (27:37) when his command was exceeded by number.
Thanks to the efforts of Connie and Charles Corcoran Nilsen at the end of the second period, Dandi first launched his team in the fifth half of the last period.
On Friday, the Janets team, which has already won four of the last five matches, is playing the final match against Milton Kines.
Aeroplane killed hundreds of people on the plane to avoid earthquakes
Aeroplanes in Indonesia announced to the hero after he had helped to fly a plane with hundreds of people.
Over 800 people were killed and many were killed after a powerful earthquake that caused tsunamis on the island of Sulaves on Friday.
Strong underground posts continue to threaten this area, and many people are trapped in the ruins of Paul’s city.
However, unlike his colleagues who had fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agong refused to leave his post in a dispectary cage, which was heavily scattered at Muttar SIS Al-Jufry Airport in Paul.
He remained on the ground to make sure that the flight 6321 Batik Air, then located on a flightboat, was safely aired.
Then he was released from the dyspettic prison when he thought she was going to be destroyed.
Then he died in the hospital.
The representative of the Indonesian air navigation service provider Johannes Siritt stated that this decision could save hundreds of lives, reports the Australian agency ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan, where we had to bring him to a hospital in another town.
Sadly, we lost him this morning before the Vertolulus reached Paul.
"We're very sorry to hear about this," he added.
At the same time, the government is afraid that the number of victims can reach thousands, as the agency claims that the effects of natural disasters are limited to the city of Dongal, Sigi and Butong.
"The number of victims can grow, as many bodies are still under attack, and many of them cannot be reached," said the representative of the Sutopo First Nugroho Agency.
The peaks, which reached a height of 15 feet [6 m], have fallen to the city of Paul, where the mass funeral will take place on Sundays.
Military and passenger planes provide help and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute of the relief will bring the body.
Clean water is not enough.
Mini-markettes are everywhere buried."
The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Helfand told CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is quick to help people who have survived this tragedy, but we don't know that they'll be there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can be much worse."
Indonesian President Joe Vidodo came to Paul on Sunday and said to the military officers of the country: "I ask you all to work yesterday and night to do all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?", reports CNN.
Early this year Indonesia suffered earthquakes on the island of Lombok, resulting in more than 550 deaths.
A plane crash in Micronesia: as reported in Air Niugini, after a plane crash in a plane crash, one man loses consciousness
The airline, which carried out a journey that had suffered disasters in the Pacific Lake of Micronesia, now reports that one person lost his safety, although it had been reported earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had voluntarily evacuated from the plane that had been hit.
Air Niugini reported that on Saturday, one passenger could not be found.
The airline reports that its representatives are trying to find a man and cooperate with local authorities, doctors, and followers.
The airlines did not respond immediately to a request for more detailed information about passengers, such as their age and nationality.
The local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water when it was trying to land on the island of Chuck.
On Friday, officials reported that seven men were brought to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and they all stayed in a stable.
The cause of disasters and the exact sequence of events is unknown.
The U.S. and the U.S. airline reported that the plane landed in the bay shortly after the crash.
Some witnesses believe that the plane flew into a plane crash.
U.S. passenger Bill Jens said that the plane was very low on the ground.
"That's very good," said Janes.
Jens told him and others that he was able to get to the emergency exits on a thin plane by sinking into the water.
He told me that the studs were panicking and screaming and that he had a slight headache.
In the United States, the United States reported that seafarers who worked close to modernizing the story also helped in rescue operations by delivering people to the shore by means of a steaming boat before the plane fell 30 feet [30 m] deep (100 feet) of water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network data in the last two decades, 111 people died in plane accidents related to PNG-registered planes, but this list does not include Air Niugini.
An analytics restored the night’s chronology in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor filed a case against a man who was accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
Analytic of the U.S. Ministry of Justice Paul Rowlett testified as an expert in the field of operational development for several hours.
He told the jury how he used the phone records to play a 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Roulette, reports The Clarion Ledger, reported that he had received information about the location from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers that evening when she died that was contrary to his previous claim.
When the data showed that his cell phone was next to Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to the last.
On Saturday, Sanford gave a witness and declared that he was not in town that day.
When the defendants asked if Tellis was telling the truth, when he said that night was in the Senford pickup, he said, "Well, because my pickup was in Nesswell."
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis claimed that he knew Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The phone records indicated that they knew one another for just one week.
He said that some time after the death of Chambers Tellis, he had received text messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
"He's her sister from her life," said Gail.
The protection should set its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be handed over by the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is the known hip-hop?
Trio hip-hop-vicons wants to throw a negative view of the gender by filling their music with constructive messages.
The High Breed Group from Bristol claims that hip-hop has changed its nature – it has come up with political ideas and struggles to solve social problems.
They want to go back to the exits and make a famous hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently become witnesses of this direct birth in the United Kingdom through such groups as Akala and Lowkey.
One more darker?
In New York New York a couple of calls for release, receiving a "racist" message.
In New York New York, a couple called for a discriminatory release after they received a misdirected message from a mother with a charge that she was "one more darker".
The couple argue that they're growing up, comparing calls with "the challenges."
Linsie Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed concern when she saw that the new nest, Jiselle Morris, who came to her first working day in 2016, was dark.
"No, there's another theme on it," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in the press.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she twice sent his Miss Morris.
As New York Post reports, aware of his mistake, Mrs. Plaxon-Flaxman felt "unhandled" and released Mrs. Morris. She said that their previous speech, which was an American, had been bad for her work and that she was waiting for her from the Philippines.
Miss Morris was paid one day at work and then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris is court-martial, hoping to get a discount in the amount of pay she would get in six months of work with her spouse who was first hired, even without a contract, and she had to pay $350 a day.
"I want to show them what they don't have to do," she said, "and added, "I know it's discrimination."
In response to a charge of racism, the couple said that the release of Morris was a wise decision because they feared that they would not be able to trust her after they had been trained.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent her.
She's not growing up.
We don't grow up," said Post to her husband, Joel Plasco.
"But would you have left your children with the man with whom they took the grave, even if it wasn't reasonable?
Your baby?
I'm sorry.
Comparing the call to "the challenge", Plasco said that his wife had given birth to a child just two months ago and that "she didn't complain yet."
"Would you mind someone after that?
It's a bad thing," added the investment banker.
Although the court case is still pending, the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social networks by criticising their conduct and logic.
As told in a new letter, Padington’s readers feared that readers would not understand the idea of a doctor who was capable of speaking.
The daughter of Bonda Karen Yankel, who was born nearly immediately after the book was agreed to be printed, said about the letter: "It's easy to put yourself in the place of the one who reads the book first before it was published.
Now it's funny, because we know about the great success that the story of Padington has achieved."
Speaking of her father, who was working for a BBC operator, before a small gambler urged him to write a child book, he was optimistic about what his job had been abandoned, and he shared how at the 60th anniversary of the release of the book at the same time the father died a year ago.
For instance, Padington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," Karen added that her father was silent about the fact that the book became so popular.
"He was quite a humble man and didn't like to be hungry," she said.
"But Padington was so real to him, not even his own child! Because when the children reach something, we kiss them, though it's not theirs, but our victory.
I think he looked at Padington's success the same way.
Although Padington is the creation of his imagination, he has always described success to him."
My daughter died, and I had to make a phone call
After her daughter was born, she was sent to a hospital named Louis Pastera, in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"I was on the phone regularly, saying that everything was really bad she shouldn't have done this," said Mrs. Ednan Laperus.
"And then Nad phoned me and said she'd die within the next two minutes and I should get along with her.
And I did.
I said, "So, love, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
Doctors who gave her a heart attack gradually stopped acting and left her body.
She died some time before everything was turned off.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing what's going on right now.
I couldn't complain, scream or cry because my family and people were watching me.
I should've really kept myself in my hands."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperus, who was burned because of the loss of the daughter, was forced to fly with other passengers without paying attention to the severe trials she had to face.
"No one knew," she said.
"I let down my head and couldn't hold my tongue.
It was hard to explain, but during the flight, I began to feel very much about hope.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two women who have suffered pain leave their leaves to prevent their own deaths on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones through suicide work hard not to let others put their hands on them.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphres remain at the Wall Street Bridge with telephone numbers that people can turn to for support, as well as the messages they would like to receive.
His son, Mrs. Davis Tyler, was 13, when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18, he laid his hands on him.
"I don't want other parents to feel the same as I do every day," she said.
45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in Lidney, told her son was a prospective chef with a pleasant smile.
"Everyone knew him for laughing.
They always said that this smile made any room brighter."
But he quit his job before he died because he was still in darkness.
In 2014, Brother Tyler, who was then 11, found his brother’s body after he laid his hands on him.
Miss Davis says, "I'm always afraid it's going to work."
Miss Davis created the letters, "for people to know that there are those they can call and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't hide in yourself, you have to talk."
Miss Humphris, who has been married to Miss Davis for many years, lost her husband, Mark, who was 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say that he felt upset that he had depression or something," she said.
"For a few days before Christmas we noticed that he changed."
And when the children opened their gifts, he saw in their eyes neither.
She said that his death had become a great torture for them, but they should survive it: "It has caused a ruin.
You're going to have a family.
But we must continue to live and fight."
If you have tried to cope with the difficulties, you can call good people at 116 123 (United Kingdom and Ireland), send an e-mail to jo@saritans.org or visit the Samaritan website on this connection.
Britta Cavano's future depends on the fact that the FBI is starting to investigate
"I thought if we could get what we asked -- limited time and the nature of the investigation -- we might have reached a certain agreement, Mr. Fleck said on Saturday, and added that he was afraid that the committee would "dissolve" on the basis of an excessive loss of political party loyalty.
Why did Mr. Kavano and his Republicans not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their lack of desire is connected with time.
The inter-election will take place in five weeks, 6 November. If the Republicans are expected to have problems, it will make their efforts more difficult by selecting their own person in the Supreme Court of the country.
George V. Bush telephoned the senators with a request to support Mr. Cavano, who worked in the White House under Mr. Bush's leadership, and he met his wife Ashley, who worked as a private secretary for Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
In Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are now sitting, there will be a vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Cavano could get at least 50 votes in Senate, which would enable Vice-President Mike Pens to solve the problem with the same number of votes and acknowledge his candidate as the Supreme Court judge.
During Kima's reign, the number of refugees from North Korea "is shrinking"
After Kim Chen Inn came to power seven years ago, the number of refugees from North Korea was reduced to South Korea, declaring a South Korean lawyer.
Again, Pon Seug, referring to the data of the Ministry of Association of the Republic of South Korea, stated that last year the number of refugees was 1127 compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Pak said that key factors have strengthened the coordination between North Korea and China, as well as the demand for more money now by illegal contractors.
In the Philippines, public comments were received.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea finally offer South Korea's citizenship.
In Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans were declared illegal after the Korean war ended in 1953.
Most of them run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a well-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between two Koreas.
China views refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, often being forced to repatriate them.
The relations between North and South Korea, which are still in the state of war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of two countries met in Phoenicia and discussed the issue of denuclearization, which had been discussed in the darkness.
This happened after the historic meeting of U.S. President Donald Trampa and Kim Chen Ina in Singapore, where they in general agreed to cooperate on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korea's North Korean Minister, Ray Yoon-Ho, on the basis of the accepted sanctions, accused the United States of not making progress.
"With no confidence in the United States, we can't be confident in our country's security, so there can't be any talk about unilateral interpretation," said Ray Yoon-Ho in his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosy calls Bretta Cavano "hissterical" and says he's not going to work in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the Chamber of Representatives of Nancy Pelosi called the candidate as Judge of the Supreme Court of Bretta Cavano "star" and said that he was not at the time fit for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed his thoughts in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Ostini, Texas.
"I've been thinking about that if a woman ever acted like this, she would be called "asterical," said Pelosi in his reaction to Cavano's testimony before the Legal Committee of the Senate on Thursday.
Cavano emotionally objected to charges of sexual violence against Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Cavano was very emotional, and in time he screamed and laughed, talking to his family and school years.
He also openly condemned Democrats in the committee, calling charges against him "a absurd and coordinated overthrow of the reputation", organized by liberals, who pointed out that Hillary Clinton won the presidential elections in 2016.
According to Pilate, the testimony of Cavano showed that he could not work in the Supreme Court because this showed his prejudice toward democracy.
"I think these statements, as well as his statement against Clinton and the Democrats, will lead to his candidate," she said.
When she was asked if she was trying to announce the Kawan Empire if her wine was confirmed, and if the majority of the delegates were received democratically.
"I'll say so: if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only going to work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he's working right now," said Pelos.
Today, Cavano is serving as a judge of the U.S. Appeal Court in Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a democracy, she was troubled by the possible decisions of Cavano against the law "For access to medical services" or "Roo vs. Weid", because it is considered a conservative trial.
In his hearing the question of confirmation on the Kawano throne was asked by the party about whether he had made certain decisions by the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time when the trial will become a historic, threatened person, and we will tell you how wonderful it is," said Pelosi.
Women should own this weapon.
These are just words that have been in it for months and years, and she could not speak them without tears.
"We're crying when we're worried," said Mrs. Stein to me 45 years ago.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continued: "A woman who was working somewhere with the executive director and who was very helpful to me said that she was also crying when she was hurt, but she had her own method. When she got angry and started crying, she said to the co-ordinator: "You may think I'm sad and because of that I'm crying.
And I'm bad."
And then she just went on.
I thought it was incredible."
The tears are considered to be a allowable expression of anger partly because they receive them differently.
One of my most vivid memories of my first job in the office where most men worked was that when I once cried out in a rage, and the older woman, an unkind manager I was always a little afraid of, caught me in the room and walked into the back of the cell.
"Never let them see how you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're a heart.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be glad they got to you."
Patricia Schreder, then a Congressman from the Democratic Republic of Colorado, worked with Harry Gart in presidential elections.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was engaged on a married boat called Monkey Business, after he left the race, deeply disappointed Mrs. Shreder decided that there were no reasons why she could not fly to the president's post.
"It wasn't a very thought decision," she said to me with a smile 30 years ago.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and another candidate was the last one they needed."
Someone called the "Bilson and Seven Crimes" situation.
Since it was at the end of the campaign, she gave up her money collection, so she promised not to take part in the race unless she got $2 million.
It was a hopeless battle.
She found that some of her clients, who did not charge $1,000 for men, gave her only $250.
"They think they're going to give me a down?" she was surprised.
When she spoke out and announced that she would not have an official campaign, she was overwhelmed by the emotions — the gratitude of the people who supported her, the disappointment of the system that had made money a lot harder and forced her to focus on voters, not on members of the House of Commons, but also on sexual violence.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," said Mrs. Shreder's reaction to the press.
You'd think Klenex is my corporate sponsor.
So I was still thinking about what they would write on my grave plate?
"What is the cry?"
How a trade war between the United States and China can lead to Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the US-China trade war were disappointing, and although far from its conclusion, the long-term prospects of a dividend between countries can benefit Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Tramp made the first warning shot at the beginning of this year by imposing the tax on major Chinese exports, including solar batteries, steel and aluminium.
The biggest situation this week has been compounded by a new trade tariff of $200 billion (150 billion), which actually covers half of all goods arriving in the United States from China.
Peekin paid the same coin every time, recently putting a fine in the size of five to ten percent on American goods at $60 billion.
China has committed itself to using similar US initiatives, and the second largest in the world of economics will not be able to live up to this promise at any time.
To force Washington to withdraw means to meet the demands, but for China President Si Zingpin, public worship in the United States is too disgusting.
However, as experts consider, if Beijing is using the situation properly, the pressure in the US's trade war can lead China to a long-term perspective, reducing the relationship between two economies.
"A quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that can lead to a huge economic downturn in any country, and this is actually more dangerous than observers have recognized before," said analyst Abigail Grace, who is involved in Asian-related issues at the Center for New American Security.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs said Syria was "ready" for the return of refugees
In Syria, refugees are declared ready for voluntary return and return to their homeland with the help of a repatriated war that lasted for more than seven years.
In front of the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Valid al-Mulam stated that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today's real situation has become more stable and safer as a result of the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renew the devastated areas so that people can return to normal lives.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to a country where they had to be abandoned by terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and limited their livelihood.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mulam stated that the Syrian government would be pleased to receive assistance in restoring the war-damaged country.
But he stressed that they would not receive any help or assistance from countries that would support their generation.
Europe Strengthens the Victory of the “Raider Cup” in Paris
The European team won the "Cuboc Rader" in 2018 when it won the US team with a summary account 16.5:10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The U.S. Army has already hit the European territory six times and has not won the 1993 Kubok Ryder tournament.
Europe returned to its homeland when the Danish captain Thomas Bourne's command took 14.5 eyes needed to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Michaelson, who, in all his strength, tried most of the tournament, had his first further hit on the 16th moon par-3 in the water and became French Molinary.
The Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds and became one of the four players who ever had a 5-0-0 account from the start of the tournament in the modern format in 1979.
American Jordan Spit got a hit with account 5:4 from a player with the lowest rating in the European team of Turberna Olesena from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who takes the first scene in the world rating, came with account 2:1 of Jan Poulter from England, who may have participated in the "Cuboc Rayder" tournament last.
Spanish Serhio Garcia, a veteran "Cubca Radera" who had already participated in the tournament eight times, became a European who won the most in the tournaments all the time, carried out his 25.5-eyed career.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't do anything.
It was a hard year.
Thanks to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to bring the cube back.
This is the service of the team, and I am glad that it has been able to help," he said, without holding back his emotions, Garcia after winning in Europe.
He transmits the estafetto to his colleague John Remo, who won the American legend of the Gulf of Tiger Woods on Sunday in a single game with account 2:1.
"I feel incredible pride over the victory over Tiger Woods, I grow up watching these guys," said 23-year-old Ram.
In France Woods won all four matches and now has a career record on the "Cuboc Rader" tournament 13-21-3.
A great statistics for one of the most famous players of all time who won 14 Major tournaments, only Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. Assembly has been trying to reach the farm area, except Patrick Ride, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who have shown a high-quality golf course throughout the entire tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furic said about his team after the unfortunate statement: "I swear to these guys, they fought.
This morning, we were soon in power over Europe.
We fought.
I'm taking the hats in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the Association of Professional Players in the U.S. Golf and the Tournament Committee, Kubok Rader, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We can't thank them.
We've won."
