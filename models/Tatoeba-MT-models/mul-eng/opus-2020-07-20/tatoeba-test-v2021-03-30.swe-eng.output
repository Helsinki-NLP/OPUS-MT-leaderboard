Don't worry!
I like your scarf.
What is she talking about?
She should've done it already.

It's blushing today.
Tom and I were both happy.
I washed while the baby slept.
Can you say these words?
I'll get Tom.
There was a wild crowd living there at that time.
You have to go now.
I can do it, too.
I think it's a positive development.

We love you so much.
It happens automatically.

You have to prepare for the worst!
I'm moving back home.
What a cute girl!
Did you find your handbag?
I appreciate your work.
I'm sorry, but I have no change.
That's all right.
What train do you think you're taking?
I went to the airport to meet him.
I'll go look after you.
I'm an exchange student from Sweden.
The sound woke me up from my sleep.
It wasn't a competition.
I didn't follow Tom.
Try this.
Do we know each other?
One of them was mine.
Tom's going to work with the car.
And then came out as the next best in his annual course.
Tom had Mary's favorite doll.
We're just saying yes.
Jane was always convinced that she was very rich.
She was able to finish the job herself.
Tom's harmless.
That's what happened.
I'm French citizens.
You could have said no.
I've borrowed two books.
He's acting like a child.
I felt like a big guy.
I need to get me home.
I got an old car.
Tom's a smart kid.
Don't I suffer enough?
Wouldn't you like to take some fresh air?
It's best that we do as Tom says.
Hurry up!
Tom doesn't work as hard as he used to.
He can do it.
It must be done immediately.
Take it, I said.
You want something to eat?
John has a car from Japan.
Her dream is to visit Paris.
Tom gathered all her things together.
Everyone's up.
We're almost done.
I'll drive you.
Do you work tonight?
He refused to close the door.
He went up for the stairs.
I have no idea how to play golf.
It's you she loves, not me.
I'd like to study Arabic.
How did you get here?
We're all gonna die.
What are you thinking about right now?
Tom's promised Ruth.
A lot of people were hurt.
Do you like lax?
In general, women live longer than men.
Tom looks look like he's out.
Friday is history. Tomorrow is a mystery. Today is a gift. That's why it's called today.
I know this is hard.
What time does the bus take off to the airport?
I think we have enough money.
Are you coming with us?
This is the house he lives in.
Are we going to fight?
When I woke up, I was sorry.
How can we be truthful if our eyes are not real?
I'll do it.
Tom started going to the door.
Can't we do anything?
They didn't talk.
Tom wants to be with the party.
I can't do it now.
Let's play this game again.
He composed a burial marsh to his own burial.
Tom's dreaming.
The person who ends up learning is as good as dead.
Here's a meaning, with the number of letters, like in a hiaku.
I got married young.
You fit well in short hair.
I've been doing housework for hours.
Do you know who he was?
Do you like orchids?
The water is clean.
How old is your brother?
This is our car.
Can you count on French?
What's Tom writing?
Two people are coming in on this ticket.
It continued to snow in four days.
She did it out of duty.
I'm not schamponing my hair in the morning.
Six were invited, including the boy.
The drums look bad.
Tom didn't seem so happy.
My mom looks like her crossstep.
Tom doesn't drink.
Be the bear.
Unfortunately, he moved to the left instead of to the right.
Show us around.
As you know, life is like a journey.
I had my orders.
His inventions are conventional equipment.
I think I missed my bus.
After the end of the conversation, see if he gives me a friendly advice and wants me a nice night.
Did you read that?
He confessed to guilt.
I swear I didn't go to you.
I want Tom to go to Boston to visit his brother.
No one hacked me.
How'd it go with everything?
Lunchen's done.
People are curious.
You coming, Tom?
When I imagined fantastic images, I imagined that my fantasy ability would impress all the pictures. Think of the fantastic ability of even the imaginations that you can't even imagine about.
Do you own a trade gun?
The US abolished slavery in 1863.
The weather is worse today than yesterday.
I don't care.
I didn't know what to do with all the money I had found.
He sold some apples on the market.
Tom felt something bad would happen.
I thought you liked me.
Tom's staying for three days.
I can be translated.
How's that relevant?
He was at the entrance.
Tom's dead.
This woman has two bags.
He's coming.
Stop the game!
I'm going to take four-foot shoes.
There was no one there except me.
I'm almost never home.
It's on the chain.
Mechanical devices are more reliable than electronics.
It's gonna snow.
I'm divorced.
How does this soup taste?
The birds are laying eggs.
It must be me.
You have to follow the rules.
When are you going?

She had to share a room with her sister.
They live near here.
The reports shall be submitted on the following Monday.
Sami and Layla had a business meeting.
You're so hot.
You have an hour on you.
I know Mary went abroad.
I was trying to swim across the river.
It's cold today.
Why are you home?
What happened here?
Not all birds can fly.
I felt deep.
It's not acute.
Where are you now?
Do you remember when she's full of years?
I know you're just doing this to save me.
Do you know why the sky is blue?
What can you give me?
Has anyone been killed?
It didn't go.
I'm talking to the teacher.
This makes me angry.
Tom was trying to kill himself.
Everybody seems to like golf.
Did Tom promise to do that?
You tried.
Where are you going?
You need to take your passport to the bank.
Some diseases are inevitable.
Did Tom quit smoking?
Did Tom send you?
A little profit is better than a great loss.
I don't want to play.
It's easy like a plate.
Mom, get my jacket!
I already know.
I can't understand everything.
The oldest of us is called Mikko.
A discontinued arrest to the accident victim was held yesterday.
Tom seems to be pumped out.
Look at how I do it.
This doesn't agree.
I learned a lot about Greek culture.
The next song I'm gonna sing is the one I wrote last night.
Mary likes to buy clothes for Tom right now.
It's now or never.
She died of diabetes.
I told the king, Your Majesty, please forgive me!
She kicked him up until he got out of it.
This building is about to grow together.
Carol lives in Chicago.
Tom's busy.
We know what we want.
Come in.
They don't have children, so I know.
You can't see.
What am I gonna do then?
I feel good about Boston.
The police arrested him for smuggling.
We're going back to the ship.
I don't think it's gonna rain this afternoon.
These factories pollute the environment.
I can stand up for myself.
I should get some rest.
I'm right.
There you can eat very well.
She has many friends in Hong Kong.
Mary said she's not ready to go.
She's the quiet one.
There was no cloud in the sky.
What do you got on you for clothes?
I love my mom.
My mom feels a little bad.
We have to go to our classroom.
The club has thirty members.
I feel vulnerable.
Give me a kiss.
I'm going to Boston next month.
Take care of Tom.
All men, overboard!
"Ceb murder" seems to have been solved.
How do I do when I'm NHK?
Give me your arm.
Why is he so quiet?
You look good.
Don't lose confidence in me.
Tom said he didn't want to tell Mary he would.
Come here, young man.
What was the problem?
Have you tried this?
I love rock.
I'm tired of this.
Tom took his rock and his gloves off.
We're not doing anything.
If you're talking about your name for me, I'm talking about mine for you.
He wrote his name.
I hope we have made the right decision.
I want to talk to Tom in a room.
They took Tom on a bar.
I hated it first.
I'm not so excited about green tea.
He shot him in the face.
Now I have a bad conscience.
Don't jump so fast, I won't stop.
She's married to an alien.
The kids weren't impressed.
I'm gonna try to fix this, but it can happen that I'm not going to succeed.
Where are the ladies?
It's very soft.
Listen up, students!
Tom had some muffins.
Where did he go?
You're scared, aren't you?
He's telling the truth.
Money is powerful.
Thank you!
John likes the nurse.
"How old are you?" "Nitton." "Have you legitimization?"
I've got narcissies.
Please wait for five minutes.
It's hard to believe, but that's it.
He doesn't speak English.
Don't you want to hear my version?
They bought a house in Parkgate.
I hope you think you're here.
I hate this song.
I'm on your way.
I don't think so.
After this movie, I'm sure I'll get nightmares.
We planted trees.
Let's do business.
I'm just like you.
This is a very strange letter.
I'll remember you, we met three years ago.
The tigers broke out of the zoo.
How can you create it?
Have you seen Tom yet?
It's much simpler here.

I almost got a heart attack.
Time worked out.
This penguin is so cute!
You're just lying.
When I read to the lawyer, my teachers told me never to ask a question I didn't know the answer.
Life could be a dream.
I thanked Tom for his help.
Tom should've been here at this layer.
What do you remember?
Tom's got a hard time.
You know him better than I do.
Hurry up.
Tom's the perfect dad.
Did I wake you?
It's a gas leak.
This was a bad idea.
In my country, you don't tolerate those who are smarter than yourself.
Take off your shoes.
My knife is washed.
But it's fixed.
Tom's a fireman.
Today is September 1st.
I can confirm that.
He's got a glass bag.
Who did you talk to?
I don't see anyone.
What's your e-mail address?
You want a apple?
I'm sorry she died young.
I still don't get it.
Your question has no answer.
The universe is a mystery.
Boys and girls are reading.
I still want to go.
Do you have a house?
Helsinki is the capital of Finland.
Tom didn't know if he should laugh or cry.
They love each other very much.
I haven't talked to Tom yet.
So tragic!
Look around.
That little one.
What did you learn?
I'm looking at the documents.
Do we know you?
I've been with the dentist.
They don't have anyone else to go.
Do you have to go now?
I'm not a doctor.
Here, try my pen.
Tom bought Mary some chocolate.
Don't cry.
Tom's divorced.
It's my job.
Tom goes on a walk every morning with his dog.
We met in a winter.
We're still alive.
Why did you decide to talk about it now?
Tom's nose was red.
I know you're upset.
You're never gonna give up.
I couldn't let that happen.
Come and get me.
I gave them a thousand yen.
Everything's available.
My brother lives in New York City.
I need my pills.
Oh, the driver is crazy.
She never lies.
Is your eyes open?
She's singing incredibly well.
How did it get here?
We're listening to the ear.
Tell Tom when you're ready.
Could I have a glass of wine, please?
Get Tom out of here.
Did you really see it?
Whose glass is this?
Do you want to get married first or have children first?
I want to know what it is that's fun.
She followed him.
She's nice.
Tom was full of his caffemugs.
I could barely tell who was who.
You have to work fast.
What do you mean?
I have a young wife.
It's too big.
I have to cancel.
It's always dark there.
It's on your table.
I want a lawyer.
Buy me no more presents.
I'm singing a beautiful song.
Where's your brother?
Mix Tom and drink.
Tom's depressed.
I have good news.
A lovely mother has a sharp eye.
It's on your table.
I'm afraid to go home.
It's not my choice.
I'm done.
I'm not on my way anywhere.
What do we tell Tom?
Mary's blushing.
I've never eaten Chinese food.
My French is cash.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
Watch out for a wet ride up on the beach.
My fingers have been judged.
Get out of my bed before I kill you.
Time's running out.
Can you remove it?
I don't have to convince them.
Please lower the volume a bit.
I'd like you to pay in advance.
Tom looked around.
Hindi and Urdu are the same language.
It's empty.
Tom's promised.
She came to us with a smile on the lips.
I'm a woman.
I'm sorry about last night.
Last night, I saw him last night.
I'm all alone now.
For the occasion, I don't have enough money.
Timea is a Hungarian living in Poland.
Apparently Mary doesn't like me.
She looked sorry.
I'll wait here.
Tom decided to blow up the decision.
This is my house.
I can play guitars.
Do you want to join me?
It's been fun.
You can write in whatever language you want. At Tatoeba all languages are equal.
My keys are gone.
Tom is unlikely.
It wasn't as easy as I thought it would be.
He's playing basketball.
I'll cut down on the meat.
Please close the engine.
We want something.
I'm reading.
I bought the cat on the jacket.
Tom's not small.
I don't like your attitude.
When I don't have my cell phone, I feel alone.
He just wrote a book by using his imagination.
I want to have all the time.
You'll always do the right thing.
My dad is stronger than your dad.
I don't know why Tom did what he did.
Thank you for everything you did.
Tom blew out the light.
Can you contact Tom?
He's got cancer.
We haven't ordered anything.
Give them money.
Tom can come to our party tomorrow.
He's swimming in the living room.
I don't stand out with Layla's hair for a long time.
Follow Tom.
Tom locked the doors at night.
We're gonna play a game.
I got my reward.
Tom told Mary to lie.
That's life.
I'll help you.
I'm tired.
It happened so quickly.
I can't dance either.
I didn't have any trouble.
How's your last name?
We have to do it again.
Are you afraid of Russians?
Don't fight against the doors.
I like to play tennis.
Tom went on it.
Tom is the perfect father.
Are you speaking Italian?
Unlike his father, he's great.
Add natural yogurt and soy milk.
Gomorron, days to wake up.
What's Tom's problem?
All students must learn both native languages in the Finnish country.
I'm reading a book.
There's something wrong with him.
Tom found the money missing.
Tom discovered Maria's secret.
Tom's a bitch.
You've had a great time.
We're getting married.
What did you think?
I'm cold.
I was in love.
This is not a mistake.
She's got sunglasses.
It wasn't until yesterday that I got the news.
We're making cheese and butter of milk.
My English isn't good.
I have a terrible toothbrush.
Get your wallet.
Tom must have had a key.
She's a serious person.
Call him tonight.
List the five best things you like to do when you don't work.
Don't take any presents.
This game is based on a novel.
Come back!
It's too much to do.
Get out of there.
You trust Tom?
I'm online.
Tom is unable to drive a car.
You're rude.
The knife is washed.
It was my fault.
It was Tom's mom.
Marconi found the radio.
How do you say "adjö" in German?
Tom always keeps the speed limit.
What's wrong with you?
What about staying?
His Chinese knowledge made it possible for us to implement the plan smoothly.
This isn't my point of view, it's my translation!
We're talking hard.
I wish I could take some time back.
François, is this yours?
Where are you going?
Your cat is black.
Where the student has his own computer.
The situation is much worse than we imagined.
You and your family can go to hell!
What's going to happen now?
This is too hard.
Are you?
He seems kind.
She speaks quite clearly to be easy to understand.
Where are you going?
I knew you'd miss me.
Let's have lunch.
Are you alive?
I like to read more.
Was that you who kidnapped Tom?
I always get up at 6:00 a.m. every morning.
This CD costs ten dollars.
Did you write under it?
I'll call you.
We'll talk about that soon.
This store has been opened all day long.
I wonder what country will censor Tatoeba first.
I made some changes.
Tom couldn't decide immediately.
They're like day and night.
I never saw you.
Looks like Mary's full again.
A man who does not spend time with his family cannot be a good man.
I'm on my way.
Would you like to dance with me?
I have to start walking home.
I've done that a hundred times, I think.
The money was already foreign.
Can I take it?
I saw Tom come.
I thought you hated red wine.
I'm looking for a man to live here.
A cat has a lion and four legs.
Move left.
I think he's honest.
Tom's almost never been on his hat.
What kind of music did you like when you were younger?
He's got a big restaurant near the lake.
What's that worth?
She put her hand up to get the bus to stay.
Isn't that always so?
We need a security network.
Tom can make food.
Of course it may be traumatic, but what about then?
A cat bed and a bed in the bastrum.
I'm from Brazil.
What else do you miss?
That's my wife.
We became good friends.
Go, go, go, go!
Marie believes in a life before death.
We need to tell Tom.
Tom's body was 30 minutes late.
It wasn't an earthquake.
I'll say it all the time.
What happened?
Lock the door!
When did you say that?
Tom's alone.
Thanks for helping me fix the car.
Get out of my fat food!
Stay close.
I'm gonna need their help.
I hate horror movies.
When I opened the door, I had to break the lock.
Women also want sex.
He's never taking a breath break when he's talking.
I couldn't put a band on myself.
We're going home, Tom.
Tom had a nightmare.
She told him to do it even though she knew it wasn't a good idea.
Some people have told me I look Japanese.
Where did I put it?
Your brother's asking for help.
Kate's got two ears.
I'm almost there.
They called for an end to the conflicts.
Hurry up, Tom.
I knew we'd win.
Tom's giving a hand in his mouth.
I believed in Kylie Minogue since June 12, 1998.
A lot of people think I'm crazy.
You'll be fine.
Why don't you talk to me about it?
The tree is broken and crushed and can fall at any time.
I'm looking forward to the summer agreement.
Tom condemned a conspiracy.
Her dream is over.
He had to go to yours.
Every student has his own computer.
She lives alone.
The school is half a mile away from my house.
Can I say that high?
I usually stay home.
He notes equally on others.
You don't talk much.
Do you want something to eat?
I'm avoiding spindles.
I don't want this one.
I love that story.
Tom hated spinach.
I speak Japanese, English and French.
I wasn't aware you seemed so bad.
I've been pretty busy.
We're both very old now.
I never trusted them.
I like that dress.
I hate to come too late.
No, you can't use my car!
I know you're busy.
I'll be alone.
What's that worth?
I'm happy to do that.
I'm sorry, it's true.
We'll finish the holiday.
What did you look at?
The offer was low with the face down in the dining room.
You're keeping me awake.
They married, although they barely spoke one another’s language.
The toilet is behind the stairs.
I want a glass.
Good.
You're the one I love most.
Contact with the number you have selected is not received.
Tom got back.
Come on!
It wasn't great.
Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy,
Have all found their mistakes?
Where's your brother?
The house was quiet.
I let my feelings get the better of me.
Tom took Mary's hand.
People sit on the grass.
I heard a South American camper was attacked by an anaconda.
She felt we were too different.
They look so happy.
The lake had frozen, so we went over the island.
Why does Tom never say hello to us anymore?
It's actually a good point.
Who said I stole the money?
They were vulnerable.
When was this temple built?
Don't you mind?
This paper doesn't absorb ink.
It hurts in the ass when I blow it.
None of this is true.
I lost everything I had.
We have to go with you once.
Tom snowed down.
It's okay.
I'm responsible for his behavior.
Tom's scared.
I got a reading desk in Christmas Eve.
She's playing hockey on the saints.
You don't talk much.
The red paraplete reminded her of her mother.
I remember the first time.
This is a very timely task.
Tom took his clothes off and went into the shower.
The other kids call her Nasse.
It meant a lot to me.
I'm not good at dancing.
I told Tom to take it easy.
I'm an old man now.
Tom's teaching.
She's got too much work to do.
She's right.
Give Tom a hand.
You wouldn't like Tom.
Do you know Tom how you feel about him?
Tom wondered if what Mary said was true.
We'll never agree.
It's not sure if the letter ever came up or not.
We haven't done anything.
You lost your pen.
You're thinking about lying in bed all day, aren't you?
Tom can't do that.
Tom was bleeding under the roof of the day.
I didn't even know what she was saying.
Are you really going to do that?
Give this to Tom.
Tom knows it's true.
She's crying.
Can I meet Tom today?
No one wants to.
Who destroyed this?
How do you think I feel?
A Japanese garden usually has a dam.
I'm not feeling well.
Tom likes to eat called pizza for breakfast.
Tom's down.
You should've seen her.
I need to buy the brand.
Playing tennis is his hobby.
Tom did a good job.
Do you prefer a male or female doctor?
The door is locked.
Now try it.
It didn't really affect us.
Are you mad at Tom?
I'm going like a penguin.
Did I forget something?
You're more than me.
Thank you for your birthday.
I don't even want you here.
I like to go to new places and see new things.
I've got to put myself down.
Aren't we friends?
Her numbers scared me.
I can't eat chocolate.
I think we should do as Tom suggests, if no one else has a better proposal.
The ice is very thick.
Do you understand?
I can only talk to myself.
Tell me what the problem is.
Tom beat Mary.
You should've thought about it.
I've got a few more.
I'm using the computer.
Six were invited, the boy included.
Kate's hurt.
I know you're missing your family.
What was your plan?
Tom seems excited.
He's not angry.
There is no doubt about who is chosen.
He was hurt.
Maybe I should find a new job or an interesting hobby to keep me motivated.
It's weird.
Have you read Sagan about ring trilogy?
I'm a man now.
Greek is not an easy language.
Thanks for taking care of my dog.
She spoke of equality.
What are you looking at?
They died young.
Stop talking to me.
Have a good time, dear brothers.
Where is the Portuguese ambassador?
My friends didn't fail me during the trial.
Tom shot me in the leg.
I was just saved.
Keep it down.
You weren't here then.
Here comes Tom.
I don't like modern jazz.
Tell Tom what you want to do.
We need to talk to you about Tom.
What's wrong with her?
Get dressed fast.
I took the photo.
I said good morning.
The king of the prosthetics called himself through the store.
I need an answer.
I hate my computer.
He lost control of the car in the trunk.
I hope you find Tom.
Mary works in the city's public library.
We're different.
Come back in the drawer.
She helped the old man across the street.
No one's too old to learn.
I'd do anything for love.
Two men with ski masks went into the bank.
This book belongs to the school library.
None of that was true.
There must be a pattern.
I'm sorry to have to say this, but that's the truth.
Tom made me laugh.
Tom's helping.
One morning he saw a pretty girl.
This tree is not even close to being the highest in the juice.
Let me take a look.
Tom wants our help.
Time's up.
My dad's fresh.
We can save many lives.
You don't have any money, so you'll be fine without it.
I'm afraid to go home.
Just say it.
Hel's words immediately filled me with new strength.
Put the card on the table.
I know you're angry.
Do you need anything?
I want a couple of gloves.
That's exactly what I needed.
I'm from Brazil.
I've been here since.
Even Mom knows about it.
He should've done it already.
Room service, thank you.
Who were you talking to?
The boy took the cat's couch.
How do you know that?
I got a lot of stuff.
I'm unemployed.
This medicine will wash your skin.
Does this remind you of someone?
I'd like to talk to Tom between four eyes.
He's gonna fall for the rest of the day.
Neither does it work.
I can explain.
She's acting like a child.
How does it look?
Mary thinks she's got superpowers.
I can do all this.
Everyone needs to know.
After the stop, the train accelerated rapidly.
What does that include?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one has asked you to join, but can you at least admit that there are people who have views other than you?
Tom was loading the book.
I'm the best.
English is hard, isn't it?
I can go to school for ten minutes.
Are you ready now?
She couldn't think of meeting him again.
Even during working hours, I pay for my Internet addiction.
I never thought it would be so hard to create an iPad app.
You weren't away for a long time.
Both Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I can't take me down to town.
It wasn't hard at all.
Can you cool it down?
Tom was blind with the light.
Are you threatening me?
Tom's worried.
I used to think I'd come here.
This isn't a fish.
Tom and Mary may not have done it all they said they did.

I've got a headache.
That's exactly what I need.
