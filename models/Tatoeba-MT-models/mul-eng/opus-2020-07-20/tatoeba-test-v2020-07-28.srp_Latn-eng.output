What are you doing?
Did I call you?
We won't let you die.
What do I say?
I'm a little involved.
You can't sit with me.
She's going to cry when there's no time.
Did you see Tom leaving?
Everyone but Tom knows why his wife left him.
It's hard for me to understand French when they say it fast.
She didn't even move.
What did that mean?
You can't make us leave.
I took the first step.
They all laughed.
It would mean to me if you could do that to me.
You're sad.
Tom worked hard to finish the job in time.
I gave them some food.
You disappointed me.
That's not a big deal.
How much will I get?
I'm scaring you.
If you talk to a man in the language he understands, it goes into his head, if you talk to him in his tongue, it goes to his heart.
We're not done yet.
I want to see you behind bars.
Let's go to the bar now.
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Are you sarkastic?
Let's try this.
Can I talk to you alone?
Did you see the sun's going out?
She put her finger on her finger.
He's as smart as his brother.
Tom's on a business trip.
I can't remember where I left my keys.
Where did you get that scar?
I wouldn't think of her look, but the story of a child who ate two cakes was from her childhood.
I can't live such a life.
Tom's hungry like a wolf.
It was a tough decision.
Everyone's paying.
Octopod Paul was right.
There's a lot of football.
What are you doing down here?
I'm not ready yet.
Will you skip breakfast in the morning?

Do you think games and learning are related?
I think that's pretty funny.
Leila has a wide circle of friends.
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
What's your car for a year?
Account, please.
Check that the cat is out and that the door is locked when you leave.
It remains to see if I can get there in time.
I could lose my job.
Forget about Tom.
I work as a free translator.
Tom was nervous about turning his fingers around the table.
You look pretty bad tonight...
I have a game to play.
That's what a doctor needs.
I like instrument music.
You should thank Tom for the letter.
I'm blind.
What can't you tell me?
What were his first words?
Just be quiet, please.
We have one victim.
You should let me in.

We need to get rid of Tom.
Are you involved in this?
I thought it was terrible.
Forget I said that.
I didn't make it.
Tom wants to work at the same hospital where Mary works.
I'd love to be rich like Tom.
Another store will soon open up in Boston.
I was shocked.
Tom's welcome.
Tom told me this morning he and Mary moved to Boston.
Can you save me a couple of cookies?
I'm allergic to milk.
Do you know what this phrase means?
I ate the chocolate box.
Tom's a real driver.
Eat the soup while it's hot.
I'm not gonna miss this.
Let me help you avoid some problems.
I've never tried to do this before.
Did I let that go?
Mary can't take Tom's boss because he's a man of the Schovinist pig.
I was everywhere in Europe.
Are you coming soon?
It's a harmless lie.
What would I get with this?
The mini-shadows have returned to fashion.
Thank you for the correction.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Tom doesn't care what I do.
If you need help, tell me.
I've been looking for you.
I don't have any high opinion about him as a musician.
Tom's been shot.
Did you tell Tom this?
Everybody's talking.
They're all sick.
My father said no.
Many people pray before they eat.
Where did she go?
I think you'll be able to do that.
And who are you?
Keep working.

Music started again.
I don't think you should tell Tom that.
I'll call you.
The girl let the bird out of the cage.
Does one of your friends play guitar?
I thought you wouldn't be able to do that.
He got what he wanted.
Tom used to be afraid of snakes.
That may not be easy.
Why is the painting of the trains so interesting?
I put every test.
I'm sick of your sweating.
There's only one way out.
What brother did you see?
I'll take a look.
Now he's very busy.
I'm not sure if Tom wants to talk to me.
Should Scotland become an independent country?
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Don't open the window.
I believe in Kelly Mina since June 12, 1998.
You're very rude.
I went to bed last night without crying teeth.
The danger of digging on every bottle.
When I went to high school, I got up at 6:00 a.m.
You're getting unscathed.
Is it necessary to make such a noise?
You never give me anything to do.
Tom was a very old man.
Come and run with me.
He's driving faster.
You're of great help, Tom.
Contact Tom.
What we had was special.
You need to write a new one.
You can't escape from the past.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Tom's holding on to it.
I hope I'll find Tom.
Tom didn't want to write about what happened.
I'm sure Tom didn't want to hurt you.
The dog house is new.
I got an e-mail written in French yesterday.
Why are you so paranoid?
He's the father of a human being.
Tom passed his fingers through his hair.
I wrote some songs last week.
What am I doing here?
Do you have a dog?
They'll be OK.
The family was having dinner at noon.
I thought you were going to the Boston bus.
He'll clean my room.
Tom and I are not friends.

Don't stop.
I always thought it was weird.
I could have gone, but I didn't want to.
Her hands were cold like ice.
One day it'll be mine.

I like to watch you dance.
I'm really proud of Tom.
We have to work hard.
You're very pretty.
Please be honest with me.
I'm really glad I'm here.
I can't answer your question with any security.
God save me!
None of us saw Tom do that.
Let's talk about possibilities.
I was just about to suggest that you do it.
She decided to go and study in the U.S.
It was really inspiring.

Well, what are we gonna do?
This is my third marriage.
Next time it'll be better.
The text is very written.
We're all trying to win.
Check around.

Nothing can stop us.
Tom didn't offer to pay.
I could come with you.
I don't know who they are.
I can't believe Tom kissed me.
I'll try to find them.
Hey, give me a chance.
Tom, are you and Joe brothers?
Have fun as long as you can.
Is that love?
Today the ship was above the Mediterranean Coast - a mountain port situated on the bottom of the ocean, at a depth of up to 1,500 feet [4,500 m].
Yes, I love it!
It was a little awkward.
Do you have a case?
When exactly did you do that?
I watched Tom die.
Do you have a blog?
Parliament is dissolved.
I hope that's not true.
Have you finished yet?
Tom would never agree with that.
You look like a very intelligent person.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
She got up and came to the window.
It was something that led to a bunch of new ideas.
We'll visit you from time to time.
I'm in your hands.
I met some of Tom's friends yesterday.
Think again.
It's hard.
Tom was very nervous.
I've never regretted it.
She's been proficient.
It's getting dark.
We better tell the others.
Tell me about your teacher.
I always think about it.
Tom bought some black shoes.

Don't laugh.
Did you tell Tom this?
You'll ruin your sight if you keep playing games.
I'm the Earth.
I can read different languages, but I don't speak anyone.
Who wants to talk to me?
Bad things will happen.
Say hello to your friends.
You still don't know how to drive?
I forgot.
I'll need time to get used to it.
I'll be there.
We're not gonna get dressed.
You're right.
Although I told Tom not to open the door, he opened them.
Go right away.
It's just a walk.
A lot of things are going well for me.
Tom is playing with his son.
I'll leave school.
We'll visit you sometime.
The distance between my house and your house is two kilometers.
Just waste your time.
That's a lot about you.
I think it was intentional.
It doesn't work too much!
I'm proud of this team.
He was speeding up.
Try this.
There's no consequence.
Say hello to your friends.
Tom's gonna go.
Is there any of this really?
What are you gonna do today?
He's a man of tradition.
Do you have any paper on which I can write?
Is it true Tom won the race?
Can I hear another one?
I'd really like to see you again.
Let's sit down for five minutes.
What a question!
You're very brave, aren't you?
Tom seemed angry.
I've never noticed that before.
It's probably better not eat after seven o'clock tonight.
I'm sure Tom's proud.
Are they in love?
Help me.
Which way are you going?
I like to sleep on a soft bed.
Stay positive.
It's all right with my ear.
I just want to get home.
You were right to worry.
How much money do we need?
I've played golf many times with Tom.
Tom lives in the city center.
Don't be a dick.
Now things are much different.
I'm very interested.

You're infected.
We need your help.
Is Tom informed?
Tofu's going well with Sake.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
Don't swim.
She's beautiful like her mother.
You got a point.
I've lived a long time.
Give us some space.
Don't stop.
A lot more, Tom.
Tom was going to ask his boss for a raise, but he changed his mind.
Come in.
You won!
That's what both of them like.
Tommy said I shouldn't talk to Mary.
I keep saying that.
Most scientists rejected the theory of continent movements, because it was so difficult to imagine that the panels were moving at all and possible.
How did I miss that?
What did you say to Tom?
It was a bad situation.
Give them just as much food as they need them every day.
Tom's gonna change.
I've reacted instinctively.
That's what you have to do somewhere else.
Don't cry.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
How often do you throw photos on Jutjub?
Do you know who Tom killed?
Everyone knows.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
It's not that easy.
I'm deeply hurt.
I'm not worried anymore.
Have you completely recovered?
Tell Tom to come here.
It's raining like a fall.
Tom's sick today.
They both like it.
Is it dangerous when the melanoma spreads?
I'm sorry I'm leaving.
Tom almost caught it.
They're the ones who want to leave.
The teacher told us what the psalmist wanted to say.
What does the doctor think is wrong with your shoulder?
Come in.
We're in a difficult situation.
It's just personal opinion.
I just don't know what to say.
I'm just very grateful to you.
You got everything wrong.
So, what do you think?
Let's wait a minute.
Tom loves you very much.
Start counting.
You can't ever come back.
He's a man of blood and flesh with all his hands.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Come tomorrow.

How much money do we need?
Don't drink water.
I'll always remember your advice.
She wanted me to come.

Say hello to your friends.
What do you think, what does this phrase mean?
Tom doesn't write to me anymore.
Can I see your card?
I'm sorry, I didn't investigate.
Tom knows the procedure.
If a man advances before a woman, it's called favor, if she's promoted, before a man, it's called equality.
Are you dyslexic?
Come back in an hour.
Tom often uses that word.
Tom was staring at his feet.
Are you still jealous?
How is this your fault?
I'm sure Tom would've stayed the best.
Tom got really sick.
Are you sure this thing's safe?
I came here for you.
That's what we are.
He's a biologist.
That was a little weird.
Close that dirty mouth.
Show me the documents.
I still mourn the death of my oldest son.
I'll call them tomorrow when I get back.
Are you coming back now?

Did you eat something?
I was already there.
I've never learned to write.
They wanted to punish me.
I agree with what you wrote.
Tell me what this is.
I'm available.
We need to talk about this on our own.
I'm on Tom's side.
You've lost your breath a few times.
I love this song.
Tom was John's wedding friend.
Plato is a friend, but the truth is a bigger friend.
You're lying!
Even the child knows that.
Who are you describing?
We were the only guests.
Tom's a mole.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Did you decide what you're gonna do?
Are you sure this thing's safe?
My family loved dogs.
You're right.
They can never achieve it differently than by force.
I thought I'd have another chance for that.
He'll understand.
I'm not here for that.
I assumed you were busy.
She finally fell asleep.
Tom laughs at Mary.
It's almost half three.
I don't know if it's gonna be enough money for me.
Can you put on your clothes?
Have you ever tried?
I don't think so.
Did you eat?
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
Would you like some cream?
We didn't see this for you.
We've never played football before.
How did you like Boston?
Tom was nervous.
Tom would still be alive if he tied up the bridge.
It worked for me.
I'm celebrating.
I'm firm against compromise.
It's all worth it.
Tom picked up Mary.
Maybe I'm not sleeping tonight.
Tom comes here three or four times a month.
We've never been here.
I knew you wouldn't be able to do that.

What's your problem?
How would you feel if you left your wife?
They're all laughing.
I'm lying.
Tom's at the meeting.
Don't fight.
Just keep Tom safe.
I'll get it.
I'm in better shape than you.
Maybe they're somewhere around the lake.
At least I knew.
We have a good chance of winning.
Tom's not in shape.
I don't have enough time to explain it in detail.
I'll talk to Tom about it.
I'm hurt.
Let's talk about your idea.
It's normal.
That's exactly what I wanted to say.
I'll call her tonight.
It was a crazy year.
Come on, Tom.
It's impossible to say with certainty.
Tom never left his house before.
I'm not burning Turkish.
It's only been one day.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
What's your story?
Let's go.
It'll last forever.
Why would I want to kill you all?
This knife isn't a sharp one.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom knew French.
These are my best friends.
I'm swimming in the ocean.
Did you see Tom's room?
Let's make some pictures.
I found something, too.
Don't stop.
We've never played football before.
She tried.
I have a serious question.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
I looked around.

Would you like some more tea?
Xerxer blew the rubber.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I'll talk to Tom about it.
Don't stop.

Can I ask you something?
I want us to be more than friends.
Can you explain?
I bought some sandwiches.
It's all over.
You just saved me a lot of time.
He was a dancing partner by himself.
The little bird told me.
Can I take you home?
Tom has his reasons.
Tom said he needed my help.
No doubt.
Just tell Tom I called.
We'd better get some help.
Tom's still frustrated.
Tom made it clear that he wouldn't do that.
Infrared and ultraviolet rays are types of light that are invisible to human eyes.
This is useful information.
Sit still for a second.
I shouldn't have taken that off.
Tell me what you wrote.
"Learn from your mistakes" and "The experience is the best teacher," they say, but on the long run even the best teacher is proud, if he or she has too much to give in too little time.
Share the cards, Tom.
I agree with what you wrote.
You really don't need to do that.
I hope it'll be too late.
Could you just take a look and see if there's enough bread for our lunch tomorrow?
I know him well.
Are they in love?
Nobody knows what's going on behind those doors.
How could I leave?
I bought a lot of stuff.
I'm just not very happy.
Let me see you, Tom.
It's very hard for me to trust anyone.
In our world education is disappointing.
I've read about a hundred books since.
Mario bought a microscope.
I've never been camped.
I'm just listening to you.
It's very rare to be angry.
Why do you want to hurt me so much?
Have you finished the trial?
When he returned from his duties in Afghanistan, Tom went through the night shifts.
I made a decision.
Thank you so much!
It won't have any effect.
Don't be mad.
Do you have a right?
I need your help.
I'm the responsible person.
Add more water.
What Tom suggests could save us all time.
Beautiful!
He's busy now.
We're not proud of that.
It's a Cuban cigarette.
Tom cooks potatoes to make potatoes salad.
Everybody else.
Come closer.
I'm not always right.
Tell me what it is.
This isn't your bag, is it?
That's not a good sign.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
Anyway, you're not right.
It's hard to get rid of long-term love from once.
Tom likes extreme sports.
A strong commitment to the environment is not compatible with large investments in oil and gas.
I have a white horse.
Let's talk about this during lunch.
Say hello to your friends.
How did I miss that?
Is the breakfast included in the price?
Tom hates strangers.
We must respect personal rights.
What's that thing and your right arm?
Can I call you about 2:30?
Anybody want to go to Disnilland with me?
Why is the painting of the trains so interesting?
I don't usually write these songs.
It's really so simple.
That was a ridiculous mistake.
What are you even eating?
Don't talk.
Call him whatever you want.
I feel safe with you.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to do it, but he failed.
Jimmy's gonna be a teacher.
I need you.
Fuck you!
His mother is Yugoslavian.
There must be a better way to do this.
That didn't matter to me.
He loves me tomorrow!
It's too boring for me here.
I'm glad Tom won.
There's no one like you.
Tell Tom you love him before it's too late.
Tom wrote a long letter to Mary, but he didn't send it to her.
He's got a good memory.
I'm gonna get you some ice cream.
Tom's not very nice.
I really need Tom here.
I believe you're right.
Come and play with us.
Do you know Tom's ever agreed?
Mary's a Catholic, but her boyfriend is an atheist.
I'll never tell anyone who you are.
Tom's here this morning.
Now it's pretty busy.
Here's some good news.
I'm proud of my family.
Tom was very confused.
There was a list of available candidates.
Tom never said anything about it.
Don't get out of here.
Tom never asked why.
Come here.
Tom's gonna know.
Her passport is stolen.
Did I ask you?
I've seen enough now.
Turn around!
It took four kilograms of gold to get rid of victory medals.
Give me the sword.
He's not smart enough to collect numbers in his head.
Take care of me, and I'll take care of you.
You have to trust me.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
Are you familiar with the man involved?
Do you want to talk to Tom about me?
We have to work now.
I'm not afraid of death, I'm dying.
Everybody says that.
He's talking clearly.
We're here to play golf.
Actually, I've never met that before.
Don't yell.
This one's unique.
I'm too old for something like this.
We're just gonna follow you.
It's hard to know yourself.
You'll need it later.
Tom's in the garage, working on his motorcycle.
You're just shot.
My income dropped by ten percent.
It can be hard to get used to an unknown area.
They're ready to talk about the problem.
Finally!
It appreciates contemporary art.
After a long discussion, I finally did things.
It's okay.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Does that happen often?
We're down.
Can you talk to me?
Cut the TV.
I'm wearing shirts on short sleeves.
Old people often talk to themselves.
Tom hoped he'd become a famous writer.
Tom became a member of this club three years ago.
Tom showed me the poem he wrote when he was a teenager.
Where's Avis Schalter?
Tom could tell us how to do that.
It's just that I'm on my way.
She spends three dollars a day on lunch and dinner.
See you in your dreams.
Come in here.
I'll be home tomorrow.
I think you're stupid for that.
I've seen enough now.
I feel bad because I lied.
They told me to wait here.
I'm not young enough to know everything.
How would you know that?
Tell me what you know.
Tom's gonna remember.
Why don't he just tell Tom?
If there's no porn with it, porn will be made with it.
Canada is a country-mother hockey on the ice.
What did I forget to say?
How often do you clean your room?
Tom saved so he could go abroad.
I don't mean to change.
I want to go to Bali.
You can do that if you try.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
I'm glad Tom won.
This is no doubt the last unpleasant situation for me.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
She jogs every morning before breakfast.
This time he leads the city.
I'm not happy about that.
These are my best friends.
I have to live.
We have two sons.
Tom was the only boy invited to the Mary's party.
Don't talk.
We had a bad fight.
Stop watching TV and start learning.
We don't know our neighbors.
The police found stolen money.
I've never saved that before.
I got here a few minutes before you.
I didn't do that either.
How much does the beer bottle cost?
Tom is so rich that even his servants have servants.
It's too bad!
I've had enough trouble.
I've got enough space.
Don't yell.
I can't stop thinking about stolen money.
That's your car.
Come see us.
I don't think he knows I love you.
I'm not mad at anyone.
They need each other.
I'm trying to be careful.
Check this out.
Come on!
Where's my suitcase?
He wants to get rid of painful memories.
I'm convinced.
Music matters to me.
Do you have a favorite?
Please, come on.
Just slow down!
I thought I didn't know what was going on.
My friend got 95 points on the math test.
Tom didn't let anyone else enter the room.
I love you better than I love you.
They're waiting for you.
There's no "freedom" in Russian.
I thought you were gonna be busy.
Could that be true?
Just quiet, Tom.
I hope Tom's safe.
We talked about it all night.
What are you gonna do this summer?
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Let's get out of here.
That must have been hard.
I'll call her on the phone tonight.
I had to make some difficult decisions.
Ammonia is the base.
Check it again.
Are you honest?
That made sense to me.
Tell me what I have to do.
Nothing has been said to me.
Tom didn't make friends as easy as Mary.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Bad time prevented me from leaving.
Tom bought the news.
And that's for me.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
The black smoke came out of the smoke.
I know, sir.
You'll never catch me alive!
I was open and honest.
It's time to go to bed.
Give me a dollar for the book.
What's this?
Tom fell asleep again.
Don't move!
Tom's just talking to Mary.
The first lesson is easy.
You've got a quick hug.
Tom's gonna make it.
I got off the train.
I'm pretty good at doing more things at the same time.
Nobody's as fast as you.
I agreed to buy it.
Is it just me going to the party?
I really hope you're kidding.
Please, be honest with me.
Are you a sarcastic?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove it?
You can't go into that room.
It's all here.
Tom and Mary were wrong about it.
I'm not as tall as you are.
How many years have I seen you last time?
Tom was quiet for a moment.
I knew I should never have mixed up in your stupid business.
We worked together.
Do you think I missed something?
Tom's saving to buy the yacht.
I'm all Tom knows why his wife left him.
You're driving me crazy.
I had nothing to do with them.
I'm a klaustrophobic.
The new border to Haugesund will become the main effective route to Oslo and Eastern Norway for the entire Western region.
You've disappointed me.
I'm really happy about that.
Tom suspects that Mary and I were going to have something to do with it.
Where did you find this knife?
You look good for your years.
Tom managed to find Mary's house without difficulty.
It's not easy sport.
I just don't want to do that.
You shouldn't have bought it.
It's their right to vote.
Tell me where you are.
Shall we see Tom again?
My mother cooks for me.
I'm trying to be careful.
A woman eats bread.
I heard music.
Are you involved in this?
I must have eaten something bad.
We'll be going soon.
Is Tom still there?
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here.
I like that one.
Do you like rolers?
Tom says the same thing.
We just want to go home.
Can you laugh at Tom?
You have no idea how right you are.
Tom and I were busy.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom couldn't attend the meeting because he was sick.
Tell me why you did it.
How many people were there?
I'm sure Tom's gonna miss me a lot.
So where did Tom go?
It's easy to associate with Tom.
Mary came back from the school crying because her friends were watching her.
I don't think anyone knows.
Why are you so paranoid?
Tom went back to his room, he couldn't calm down.
Could I have a hug?
I hid an empty cassette.
Relax, Tom.
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you get used to it?
She's wondering how it's possible.
Look at that.
Wake up!
You chose the beauty.
Look at what it is!
Mary's a wedding planner.
Justone, we had a problem.
Why do you always have to get involved?
I have trouble talking about my feelings.
Mary came back from the school crying because her friends were watching her.
I'm not sure when Tom's gonna be here.
You should come home.
Alice laughed.
We can look at Tom in the suit, for a black big keyboard with dramatic fingers, creating music that is very pleasant to listen to.
Strong winds broke a lot of branches out of the steel last night.
Shouldn't you be ready for work?
There are 40 students in this class.
The way to the man's heart leads through the stomach.
It's time to get up.
The house is built of steel.
I didn't write this.
I can't, but I don't feel partially responsible.
People were good to me.
Tom's out of the window now.
We should celebrate together.
Tom and Mary are leaving today.
Have you ever tried?
I could go with you.
Take a moment.
Come in.
You really don't have to do that.
I wonder what Tom's planning to do.
You need to be able to read the notes.
Tom's upset.
They wanted an apology.
Where did I go wrong?
Does that make you angry?
I drink vitamins every day.
I'll call you later.
Why me?
Tom's cooking for us.
We live in the house.
Tom says he's healthy.
I'm the only one here who can do that.
The zoo is closed on Monday.
That's the point.
Knowing foreign languages is useful for everyone.
They don't want to do that.
She let me go.
It is very natural for humans to always give priority to the interests of others.
It's all right.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I've got a lot of planned things for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
Why are you still awake?
I was at school yesterday.
Tom's doing what he's told.
I'm still working.
Otupela, homeless kids can sometimes grow up in sociopaths.
I'd like it to be with you.
Police work is to prevent and investigate crime.
Can you add me a distance?
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
We all work too hard.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I'm not perfect.
Tom learns very quickly.
You're different.
She doesn't know the hatred of others.
This will make our work much easier.
He loves football.
The Monas were able to play tennis in the monastery.
No one believes him anymore.
Keep the kids away from the drugs.
Is he your new boyfriend?
I wondered if I might dream.
Everything changes over time.
No one's going anywhere.
I've been driving to work from hour to hour.
It's right.
Your time will come soon.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
This doesn't matter.
Tom's in the warehouse.
I was in Rome.
I'm natural.
I turned around.
I totally forgot to do that.
Marriage is the main cause of all divorces.
He's here.
I'll figure something out.
Play it again, Sam.
Some of us think such views are crazy.
Someone could be hurt.
Tom didn't write any letters to Mary until he was here.
We've had enough of you.
We all know Tom's guilty.
We should get divorced.
I'll be back.
Look at these.
Don't forget to extend the passport.
I think Tom pulled out the weakest place.
I bet Tom never talked to you like that.
I've changed.
When I woke up this morning, I felt a lot of pain.
Is that the woman who knows the answer?
We hope Tom's OK.
I've read about a hundred books since.
Come and play with us.
And it was just with the big pain.
I'll go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Did you write the number?
That's not a reason for panic.
I only got 20 points on the math test.
I'm really happy to be here.
What are you looking at?
I still don't understand anything.
My mother died the day I married.
Check this out.
My future is in your hands.
He's a liar, isn't he?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
That's what I used to do.
I met him the day before.
Don't stop.
Help us find this card.
I'm not mad at anyone.
I think that's really important.
That's so sad.
How smart!
In short, I don't agree.
I'm a responsible person.
You don't have fun with anyone, do you?
I've been playing the piano for a long time, so I still know a little bit.
Is this your glass, or your sister?
The battle lasted a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Mother and daughter were two generations.
He drew himself that he had to work in the garden for two hours a day.
The apples and the crests, not the gold and the green trees, are cut off.
I'm taking off my legs.
I really like practicing.
I'm really proud of that.
We were in the last place.
I got it.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Isn't that black?
You're right.
Come on, sit next to me.
Let's not talk about this now.
Time to break up.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I was just thinking about you.
I love dogs.
Who are they talking to?
The record of the meeting is ready.
She looks good for her years.
What's this?
What are you even eating?
I don't like being judged.
I've got an appointment tonight.
Man hopes for as long as he's alive.
Be careful.
Let's discuss options.
It was a funny movie.
Bitcoin's a cryptowave.
I think it's a waste of time.
We're trying.
Why is this our problem?
Tom's gonna take care of this.
Go and see.
Some of us hate it.
"This came for you." "Uh..." "He, do you remember the one who sent you when you asked you to take pictures of the Eppljek's brother?" "Yes." And then she said to you to write a criticism of Mek's physical appearance." "Yes." "Then she sent a criticism of Mek." "Yes." "Yes." "What did you tell her that you learned from it?" "I realized that Philips' scarfciger was convincing, but not misleading; and that Reritty seriously paid things I thought to do as a friend."
I've always loved horror movies.
Napoleon's horse was white.
People were nice to me.
How did I know that?
I'm going to church only out of respect for my mother.
It's better to live one day as a lion than a hundred years as a sheep.
Tom won't be able to answer these questions.
I'll do it with pleasure.
You don't have to eat right before you lie down to sleep.
Tom's gonna wait.
The students didn't know how to answer.
I'm not a night bird.
Tom bought me a VIP card.
I'm the one who needs to do that.
Tom's gonna call.
He burned the ball before he went into the cave.
I'm not hiding from anyone.
This is a very good place.
I don't live with Tom.
I heard Tom quit college.
Why do you hate me so much?
Tom will understand.
These girls are very busy.
Give us some space.
There's the truth about what Tom's talking about.
You didn't say anything wrong.
I'm sick of your neck.
You're out!
We have two TVs.
We like to play football.
Make a place.
The horse must have fallen and the knight fell off the horse.
I'm investigating it right now.
She reached her goal.
Tom can do what he wants, what he wants me to do.
Tom said he needed money.
Tom was pretty good.
He couldn't understand a lot of what they said to each other.
Oh, leave me alone.
That's what they both like.
We've been sitting together for a while.
You look great.
I'm home.
He's never driving.
Two sides are gonna keep talking this week.
I'm planning on giving my son a computer at the end of the month.
Why did you wear a beard?
Tom's not a good writer.
I've never noticed that before.
We know who he is.
I need a cab.
I saw the cat.
I'm in the gym.
Mom just went to the shop.
I'm always nervous about passive control.
It needs help.
Stay away from me.
He got a cab to the hospital.
Do you know how to jog?
Don't touch the lava while he's asleep.
Tom's not like that.
Could it be alive?
Did you just meet him?
Honestly, I don't know.
It's your choice.
It's safer.
Tell me about your teacher.
I saw the house.
Maybe she has other plans?
The patient's gone.
Thank you all for that.
I don't see anything suspicious.
Am I so different?
Who's this manuscript?
It's a good feeling.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Let's have lunch here.
I'll find some money.
I shot a bear.
I'm sorry I'm leaving.
He's got a bird's car.
Fire caught the first floor.
Tom was very happy when his team won.
They decided to get married.
What did you two do?
I'm afraid you misunderstood this.
I'm trained.
We have direct access to information.
I'm punished.
The cat was provided for all the length of the sun's light that shined through the window.
Are you going to school with a dog or a bike?
Tom's not much happier.
Will I just go to the party?
I'm proud of our team.
Only Tom and Mary were saved.
I'm done.
I wasn't really impressed by that.
I left Tom 2013.
Maria knows that her main weapon, beautiful face and young body, passing values.
I saw the mouse.
Try it.
Two countries have negotiated a peace agreement.
Tom's grandfather knew my grandfather.
Answer me now.
Looks like they know what they're looking for.
You tried.
We're just gonna follow you.
I'd better go with Tom.
Let's try.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Tom really knows a lot.
It needs a dream.
That's what I have to tell Tom.
I don't live in that town.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
Tom's not a child anymore.
I thought you'd be busy.
I'm a vegetarian.
It's my habit to do that.
I've got a knife.
Tom asked me if he could use my computer.
That's very nice of you.
I've heard this joke before.
I think I've missed something.
Send Tom in.
Tom asked me some questions about what just happened.
I'll let you know.
I've reacted intensively.
The answer to this question is simple.
I'll make sure Tom has everything he needs.
He was naked, and you'll be.
She's out of my league.
What are we really looking for?
Why are you all in shock?
Schools and roads are services that pay taxes.
What does the doctor think it's okay?
Don't push.
Looks like we're just two of us.
Things are very different today.
I couldn't stop crying.
Some religious people can be very judgmental.
I really miss this.
Tom did it in an old way.
Where's Tehran?
Let's take a look at that again.
It sounds like a betrayal to me.
That should be practiced.
Why are you all shocked?
It's part of my responsibility.
Under the chart, he wrote "Get the tops!"
You're driving slow.
What a man you are!
Two measures, one cut!
How long did Tom have it?
We can save some time if we do what Tom suggests.
If you want to talk to a lot of people, you need to learn Esperanto. Why is this language? Because it's still beautiful and stimulates our learning. International language is very important because it has so many people from different countries around the world. Besides, it's not only useful but it's easy to learn. If you're learning Esperanto, you can travel to many countries. Come and learn!
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
Did you sleep?
I'll take you to Tom.
Could it have been Tom?
I have three beautiful grandsons.
Don't fight.
She got her fingers on the table.
I'm learning a few languages.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
I wanted to write to you, but I forgot.
You're good to everyone.
Tom showed up in heaven.
I didn't care.
That's not true, is it?
Tom said he didn't see anything weird.
You're never coming on time.
That sounds like a betrayal.
I'll try not to bother you while you're studying.
Life is short.
They'll know.
All the participants gathered in the main hall.
Don't overdo it.
Hey, relax.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Tom's gonna make progress.
Tom was totally scared.
Who's this guitar?
This won't hurt anything.
We need to get out of here.
We can't stop Tom from doing that.
I'm not selective.
That's what I used to do.
Tom's still at work.
You think better when you're upset.
Are we all here?
I'm sorry.
Tom got out of pain.
Everything or nothing.
Do they love each other?
I got it.
I'll sign it.
Shame on him.
That's right.
We hope you like it.
Will the future be like scientific fantasies?
It just happened again.
How long have you been here?
Tom's rich and free.
My mother bought two bottles of soda juice.
That's not my job.
I turned around.
Honestly, I don't know.
I hope it's gonna be okay.
The wind calmed down.
In the bedroom, I have a mirror from the floor to the ceiling.
I wish I remembered that.
Don't you dare.
What can you do?
Get out of here.
The Czech festival was held in Latvia.
We are what we are.
Where'd you get that idea?
She let me go.
You didn't answer the question.
We're in there.
Nobody's coming to save you.
I don't want to do that.
Tom always bothers me.
Are you ready?
She's proud of her talent.
You can start right now.
You need one of these.
I'm impressed by you.
I can't decide where to park.
Cool!
How is this your fault?
Security has been increased in the city.
Hello!
Tom's gonna stay.
That guy's talking like he's grown up.
Chargage costs three dollars.
My bike's new.
Tom told me he loved me today.
I doubt Tom knows that.
Can I chase you home?
I've already tried that.
Go upstairs.
There's no parking space there.
I'm running early.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's how it matters.
How long have you been?
Tom's a passion biker.
How did you find Tom's shelter?
We want to go to Boston and Chicago.
Let's take a look.
I'm busy at work.
Tom's family moved often.
We liked food, especially fish.
And they lived happily for the rest of their lives.
Tom's too poor to hire a lawyer.
Don't yell.
I'm interested.
What's the problem?
He's not a doctor.
Tom's accidentally made.
Is he a handsome Arab man or Hindi?
Let's meet for a drink.
I forget where I leave my hat.
He's sneezing again.
I want to see the ocean, too.
Don't even write!
Who doesn't?
Tom does it sometimes.
God knows.
Tom loved Mary.
What do you say I do?
Let's discuss your idea.
Tom said he was innocent.
All the girls love Tom.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Cover your mouth while you're up, you're crying, or you're crying.
Tom's Greek nocturnal.
He was a man who never promised to resist.
It's probably due to the periodic appearance of the heat, because floating ice from Siberia can carry polar ligaments on them.
I heard you don't eat meat.
Maybe Tom was involved.
I've got a memory problem lately.
I'm a Canadian.
I'll try.
Do I ever make a mistake?
What's the name of that restaurant?
It's official business.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
Is he your new boyfriend?
Forget it.
I agreed to buy it.
What's the paper?
The temperature of the sun's surface is about 6000°C.
He asked a lot of questions about Islam himself.
If we go right now, we're going to Boston until 2:30.
What did you two do?
Where's Tom going to sleep?
Why would Tom want that?
It's hard to figure out what really happened.
She passed her fingers through her hair.
Tom works hard to support his family.
Tom and I are very close friends.
Tom says he has four houses in five different countries.
Let's see what Tom's gonna say.
I'm freezing.
Don't fight.
Come here.
Just tell me you're okay.
Is he your new boyfriend?
I'm not afraid of aging.
I don't fully agree with you.
There are many possible answers to that question.
Let's eat ice cream now, before it cools.
I'm just doing my duty.
I took the first step.
I like to watch you play.
It's hard to get what we said into practice.
How long has your head hurt?
Ole, the oldest Christmas in the world, she just won, she was about 150 years old.
Come to a meeting.
I'm proud of this team.
I fell asleep.
Your mother put a chair on the top of the police.
Did you see anyone there?
My father is so old that he can't work.
He got what he wanted.
What if I'm right?
I'd like to know that I'm painting like this.
I'll try to find them.
I had a problem dealing with that problem.
I don't know what it's not, still or just before, it was good, but many times when I tried to get on the site today, I couldn't do it.
Do I usually act happy?
I went there with my will.
You think better when you close your eyes.
They really meant that.
Have you ever been here?
Do you really think I'm selfish?
They're all here.
We're almost done.
Maybe they need something to eat.
I thought you'd be busy.
I'm adaptable.
A fugitive from prison was caught fast again.
Everything seemed possible at that time.
I sent a map to Tom's fax.
I have a memory problem these days.
Tom may not get to a meeting.
Tom died almost at the same time.
The judge's got a check.
They also found that the same wrong estimate was made in some other cases.
Try to stay cool, Tom.
We need to find Tom.
I hope this will never happen again.
Please be honest with me.
Tom's been there for a few days.
Tom could be here.
I'll do everything for you.
I didn't understand the question.
It was just a matter of time.
Don't be mad.
It should be possible to change.
Does Tom have a cable?
Those who want to stay can stay.
If the rental period is extended beyond the agreed period, the proportional addition shall be calculated.
Why should I tell Tom?
Let your imaginations go.
Tom knows the names of all his customers.
Tom's saving over 80% of what he's doing.
Are we safe now?
We are what we are.
It's not fair at all.
That's great!
That's great!
Tom knows what he likes.
I'm dyslexic.
You helped me a lot.
Identify yourself.
I'm really happy about that.
It just has to be that way.
I'm coming as soon as I can.
Don't get out of here.
It's not all gold.
Are we all here?
We need to focus on our roots.
How fast!
Vera can move the mountains.
I don't give up!
Tom fell out of the truck while he ate the eggs.
Tom became a plumber even though his parents wanted to carry it.
I think we met before.
And I've been wrong before.

Tom knows it's over.
It's a traitor.
I'm not late, am I?
Let's go get Tom.
Tell me where you live.
You don't remember anything?
Tom drinks a lot.
I'm not from here.
Tom sat on the floor under the coconut tree.
They're all laughing.
I'm more alive than I look.
I don't want you to see me naked.
Can I go?
Tom doesn't like to do that.
Do you have a copy?
Come and help me.
I barely got out of the house when it started raining.
Tom likes to be busy.
First.
Tom's just a lion.
I'm a little involved.
Does that mean you love me?
Check this out.
Is there any evidence?
You have to be strong!
Are you ready for yet?
Tom's included a broker.
Tom always laughs at me.
She rarely, maybe never, goes to bed 11 hours ago.
Are they all crazy?
What are you even eating?
How weird.
Here, I'm drawing a line.
Pay attention to school rules.
Keep digging.
What school did you go to?
Can I hear another one?
They've all escaped.
I already wrote to Tom.
Tom had to re-write the composition.
You want to get involved?
I knew I shouldn't get involved in your chateau business.
Tom asked me for permission to use my computer.
Was I really so happy?
Tell me what he says.
I'm not tired anymore.
Did Tom change his mind?
Get lost.
Do you think what she said was a lie?
His young brother is known as a footballer.
Saosam was too busy.
I already sent him.
How does it work?
Shall we see Tom again?
You're different.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
It's my job, not Tom.
Tell me what it is.
Tell him I'm innocent.
I'd like to help.
It would be hard.
She's preparing his meals.
Where did you learn English?
The beauty lies in the eyes of the observer.
How do you feel today?
That's what you need.
Okay, what's the secret?
Shall we start soon?
Did you see me dancing?
I'm starving.
Naoko lives in a white house.
Tom plays the piano very well.
Tom managed to escape the dark in time.
I don't know anything about her.
You're just hit.
I came here for you.
I'm not rich enough.
Seniors need to pay for their hats and clothes.
Do I like it?
Don't move!
For everything, Tom was guilty.
I've been training for months.
What was the plan?
You need to be here at least half a minute.
Tom said no one was hurt.
Maybe Tom was involved.
I thought I didn't know Tom.
I saw a Dutch horse in a zoo.
I'm thinking about Tom sometimes.
Are you both drunk?
Please be honest with me.
Don't get out tonight.
It's not easy to have fun with Tom.
He's a man of speech.
I'll see if Tom can help us.
It broke into two parts.
It's 20 now.
Have you eaten anything?
Have you gone to see Tom?
Tom's gonna make it.
Why are you acting like a child?
That's exactly what the doctor ordered.
Could you read it?
It's a glass window.
Are you ready?
Does Tom have a key?
Don't talk.
Don't stop.
Are you sure this is safe?
The devil you know is better than the devil you don't know.
It'll be better for you in a couple of days.
That's what Tom would want us to do.
Tom said I'm asking you.
Just tell me the truth.
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not angry at all.
Tom's a bookkeeper.
I've changed my mind.
The problem is it's too much.
Many would like to be motivated, creative, thinking beings, only if we get that chance.
You sound tired.
Tom wasn't right about that.
Tom always makes a mess of things.
That's not the real thing.
Please, write whatever I say.
I wish you could sleep.
Maybe you can't hear me.
We're growing up.
I thought you were married.
I'll find some money.
I assumed you were busy.
I hear Tom's interested.
We need to move forward.
What are your ambitions?
I don't like to eat a white hole in the morning.
I think Tom's very smart.
Do you really want to learn another language?
I think I'm fat.
I think we were lucky.
Don't talk.
Let's have a drink with me.
Stop screaming.
It's Saturday.
They're evacuated to an American police hospital.
We'll run to the park.
You can't sit next to me.
I'm not happy about that.
Could you read it?
We need to call Tom.
Tom's not strong enough.
Tell me what he says here.
I'm staying.
I know Tom disappointed you.
Tom was seriously hurt.
If you need help, tell me.
I took the first step.
I'm still a little tired.
I'm sure there's a better way to do this.
First comes at 17:30 and arrives at 20:25.
That was a little weird.
Does it read and write Japanese?
Tom put the card on the table.
It was just an accident.
Tom never saw us.
I'm not going to do that.
Tom says he wasn't here.
This usually works.
How did you find Tom's shelter?
Go upstairs.
Can you give me a sign?
And now the word from our sponsor.
Do you have a copy?
We can't call him a witness.
That's not the main question.
We're glad we're here.
I'm armed.
Tom can't stand up.
It's time to go to bed.
Tom wanted him to have a better cat than his neighbor.
I'm impressed by you.
Did you get a fan?
I already ordered it.
We'll never know why.
How do you feel?
Bitcoin and esterium with virtual currency.
It's all very cheap.
Anything you remember can help.
Many predictions don't come true.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm still wrong.
It turns out it's true.
I'm sick.
Tom likes a good party.
I don't care what he says.
Mary knows all about the latest fashion trends.
He's a man with many talents.
Where there's smoke, there's fire.
Tom was Maria's first love.
The proposal was made by a vote in favour of raising the hand.
Tom may have to stay here for a few days.
My father doesn't like football.
This hat is from Australia.
I'm not talking to Tom.
Go get a look.
I thought the food was great.
I'm not deaf and I'm not eating.
You look fat.
You have to learn English by step.
It's better now than it was before.
Tom and Mary are different like heaven and earth.
Tom asked me to think about who's gonna win the race.
Man has many desires which he does not want to fulfill and would be mistakenly supposed to be against him. He wants them to remain only desires, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be a deep disappointment for him. One of those desires is a desire for everlasting life. To be fulfilled, man would become completely sick from everlasting life, and die.
Does Tom really speak French?
I'm not a prophet.
I can't fix the car by myself.
She's taking care of her old mother.
Tom had the same problem.
Don't laugh.
Tom and I just wrote a few books together.
There's news coming.
No one really wants us.
They've all paid for it.
Be careful.
I'm alone.
Don't drink water.
I don't want to ruin your day.
The price of gold changes every day.
Tom married.
I could come with you.
Why are you wearing a sweater?
You don't have permission to enter that room.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
Tom hates his little bedroom.
Why is the painting of the trains interesting?
I hope you like it.
He'll be back very soon.
Enjoy it as long as you can!
Tom's an idiot.
What are you planning on doing this summer?
Do you have any questions?
I know him well.
Betoven wrote nine symphonies.
I'll hurry up.
We'll do the job.
It's time for the truth.
Do you like costumes?
I saw Marcus's house.
It's really bad enough.
Thank you all for that.
They wouldn't follow us.
The house in which Ataturk was born in Solun.
People are wrong.
He's got two cars.
That was three months ago.
Let's hear your excuse.
They formed a flood team.
Tom took the package to the orphanage.
Keep digging.
Tom jumped up-down.
Tom's dog was tied.
Don't talk.
This information is credible.
No, no, no.
They're not mine.
I'm ready!
Don't go too far.
I can't approve this project.
You send a message to Mary?
I'll keep your place in first order.
Mary loves her children to play football.
Have they already arrived?
Don't forget to bring my pen back.
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
What did you conclude?
I prayed for you.
The bathroom was on the floor.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Tom deceived you.
It's only a few minutes from here.
What do you know about me?
I got off the bus.
You're average students.
As a child, many violent criminals have deliberately tortured animals.
How long are you gonna get angry and yell at us?
How important is that?
Do we want an appetizer?
If you want, I'll teach you to play ball.
I'm already used to it.
It's not that terrible.
I like to leave the music that my friends wrote.
Tom admitted it.
It's hard to work with you.
Tom's got it.
I'm guilty.
Don't answer.
Bring wine.
Things aren't always the way they are.
Show me the photos!
He needs to break down a few old houses.
What did you do?
I tried to be aggressive.
Tom was quiet at the party.
Tom's very careful.
When are you going?
This report is not written very well.
She points out that this last move of government has multiple meanings.
Tom's here this morning.
It's been about a year.
How did I miss that?
It could be a trick.
Don't forget you're wearing sun cream.
Tom didn't try to break down Merin's judgment.
Tell me what this is.
His hair covered almost his face.
How can I hate Tom?
India is seven countries in the world by size.
How much did you have to pay Tom to tell him to clean up the snow from the roof?
I'll pay you back.
A student from Oslo who faked his diploma to enroll in a college was sentenced to prison.
Tom knows it's over.
I'd like that to come to my mind.
Tom made vegetarian chips.
I wanted to help you.
You were really good to me.
Who are you really?
We all cried a lot.
Did you clean up the courts?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I usually look happy?
It's not my problem, it's all these fatal questions and explanations of words are driving me crazy!
He's been here for a week.
It looks uncomfortable.
What did you both do?
It was a lucky hit.
I thought Tom was incredible.
I've never seen anything like that before.
I'm buying a lot of things in that store.
I wish you were with me.
Try this.
Clean up a little.
Don't cry.
Can we try this?
Most people like chicken.
I didn't do that.
Let's take a look again.
The last time I went to the beach, I got really hot.
Get back.
The city was destroyed during the war.
Take care of yourself here, Tom.
We've repaired some damage caused by rocking on your car.
His girlfriend didn't give support.
Are you questioning me?
Fortunately, Tom didn't seriously hurt himself.
Tom's gonna cry.
We need your help.
I think we've eaten enough.
Are you ready for yet?
Just try it.
Tom's upstairs.
We'll try your way.
How could I leave?
Tom's afraid of death.
I can't fix the car by myself.
Most people think I'm crazy.
Tom says this is normal.
Tell me what you wrote.
I'm confident.
I don't believe it.
My mother died the day I married.
Don't let anyone in!
We're not getting into it.
Hold on, Tom.
Tom's definitely pulled out a worse end.
He's not right.
It's all right with me.
Apparently Tom's sick.
I started to learn English when I was twelve, and then I was interested in languages, but not in that degree. Now I speak English, French, Spanish and Portuguese, so it's time to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.
I can't remember that song.
I need a real girl.
She's a beginner.
Are they still here?
I'm sure Tom's gonna miss me a lot.
Tom won't run away.
I'd go.
Down!
Tom couldn't bear it.
Everything you remember can help.
It's not something to worry about.
I understand they're blind in eyes like you, but this is just crazy.
Tom's gonna make it.
There's no free hand.
Please leave this place clean as long as you want to find it.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
We can only do so much.
Guys, can I talk to you for a minute?
That's your life.
We're lucky, aren't we?
I feel it.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
Learn how to do it.
You'll never walk alone.
Tom is the one you want.
She won't take it.
There is no rule without exception.
Maybe you need a ball.
I'm doing my job.
It's all quiet again.
I didn't make it.
Tom's going to school for graphic design.
Since the message was in French, I couldn't read it.
He's always dissatisfied.
You should face reality.
We managed to get away right on time.
I've had enough.
Tom doesn't fit in here.
I want to talk to Tom about it.
It should work.
She hated him.
I could talk to Tom.
That's just what's going on.
Take a moment.
He's talking about others like they'd like to talk about you!
Tom was so confused that he didn't even know what question to ask him.
Find Tom.
I think I'm okay.
What do you think?
You changed my life.
The reaction is not always the best way to work.
I'm not gonna tell anyone you did it.
Tom asked Mary to take him to the airport.
The Committee recommends that those who have complained should be compensated for the proportional share of the annual tax refund.
Tom bought time.
This is my computer.
It was kind of ridiculous.
It's possible in theory, but in practice it's very difficult.
It's almost worth it.
Please send me your picture.
Tom's upset.
Remember the name of the file before you try to execute it again.
I'm trying to be careful.
Tom ran down the street.
The answer to this question is simple.
Let's get to work.
I didn't get upset about that.
Tom said he won't wait for us.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
We won't let you die.
A lot of things go from my hands.
Tom wants his children to learn the importance of work.
Tom was always a pig.
I'm not married to Tom.
Tom's one of the best lawyers in Boston.
How much am I gonna get?
How many close friends do you have?
It's happening.
How long do you think Tom's been ready for questioning?
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You don't have to fall stones in a glass house.
I'll scream.
Mary was quiet for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
I tried to tell Tom to come home.
I'd get involved.
Not the vaccines.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everyone.
I probably won't watch TV tonight.
Did Tom pull out the softer end?
Give me all the money.
Mer has given great support.
The girl sees the boy.
It's very difficult, almost impossible to find a apartment in Oslo.
My French is still not very good.
It happened right here.
I don't know Latin well.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
I'm waiting for my turn.
I've had a lot of news.
You're not the one who died.
Would you like a cup of tea?
I'll explain.
I'm too busy at work.
Tom asked for help.
They know you.
I put every test.
There's no point just waiting for something to happen; you have to take over.
It's the area with many new houses.
I can't believe all this.
I could have gone, but I didn't want to.
The snow fell yesterday.
We walked through the park.
I've been very well equipped.
Tom hid a reserve key in his garden.
I'm sure Tom's gonna win.
I went out to the wrong bus station.
I only wrote this song for you.
Did you read the Holy Bible?
And if I were rich, I wouldn't give him money.
Are we safe now?
Are you going to send this as an e-mail?
What are you suggesting?
I don't have any homework today.
I was just too busy.
Did you talk about me?
Or it was darker and darker.
Watch out!
We did everything we could.
Am I ever wrong?
Come on, give me that.
Are you blaming me?
I wish I was pretty.
For some strange people the knowledge of some language is kept secret.
I'm not going to change.
They moved ahead slowly.
I survived.
Do you know how to use this machine?
Don't look.
You're in blue.
Come visit us soon.
Were you in an accident?
Tom's worried about what might happen.
He was a noble man.
My father doesn't like football.
We all lost alcohol.
Map, please.
My parents don't like my girlfriend.
Something was lying on the ground.
My friend lives with God behind his leg.
Do you think Tom would like to go fishing with us next weekend?
What are you gonna do today?
Tom looks like a banker.
That's Tom.
Tom still seems worried.
I didn't see anything.
Mary's a very shy girl.
Tom doesn't have any problems like that.
You can't hide secrets from me.
It just happened again.
He's waiting for you a hard day.
It's okay.
Does that mean you love me?
It's really pretty bad.
I'm not going to participate.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Justice must be fully satisfied.
I'm so fat.
Let's stay inside tonight.
I thought Tom was incredible.
People don't always behave rationally.
I didn't even do that.
Did you ask questions?
I strongly support your comments.
I'll try to convince Tom to help us.
Tom's one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
Did we agree?
Let's talk in the hall.
Can you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Tom went there.
Am I safe now?
Give me the number.
I can't, either.
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom was afraid of me earlier.
Tom's got something to hide from Mary, and she's laughing.
Can I see your card?
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
It's clear.
Today is your daughter's birthday.
Would anyone tell me what to do?
It's obviously an error in smoking.
Your book is twice as much than mine.
We're both not rich as much as we want.
Tom wouldn't be happy.
Tom's got a nice garden.
A cup of coffee broke my head.
Do I have a knife?
It just happened again.
It's Christmas.
Tom's got a sudden hair.
I've seen enough now.
I hate that.
We'll miss you a lot if you go to Japan.
Tell me what's going to happen.
He lied to us.
We're trying.
Tom's gonna look.
Here's what I think.
I could go with you.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm kidding.
Can you disable the bomb?
I need five more minutes.
I bet you know who told me that.
Mary used the apples that Tom gave her to make a path from the apple.
How many songs did you write?
We're glad we got you here.
You can write in any language.
How do we manage others when we can't control ourselves?
Don't rush.
You can learn, regardless of your age.
He dedicated his life to the realization of the vision of what he wanted to create for himself and others.
Did you give it to Tom?
Who'd you help in a short time?
Just close your eyes.
Tom's a little worried.
How is this your fault?
How did I see this?
What do I write here?
My father bought me a book.
I'm adaptable.
The state is a voter.
How many times have you been here?
He's fixing the electronic device.
Lose.
I'm ready, bro, let me see you!
Please, shut up as much as you can.
This fish is big.
Follow my sugar, please.
It's nice to need someone.
I hope we get this.
We all have to resist this.
I'm not sure when Tom's coming back.
I thought it was shocking.
Then our guide came to a good idea and we made a great plan.
I just want to eat something.
I'm so tired I barely keep my eyes open.
Give me the sugar, please.
Come quickly!
Where did you find the keys?
Have you ever looked at Jutjub?
I was very interested in participating in the construction of an intensive academic programme for programming.
Just give me the money.
She's pregnant.
Don't let Tom find out.
I'm just waiting for Monday.
Were you here before?
Does Tom have any experience?
I don't understand.
Come here for a second.
So what did Tom see?
I could kill you now.
Mary took advantage of the walking steps that helped her to make and fall on the road.
The compass points north.
Don't talk.
Some religious people can be very judgmental.
Whose initiative is this done?
Finish this.
Who am I supposed to take?
I like cable food.
Where's your friend?
When are we gonna start eating?
The Queen and the King have reunited their powers.
I don't know why my head hurts.
I guess you already know the answer to that.
The flowers have been fully introduced.
"How old are you?" "Sixteen."
I like this book at least.
Blue is good for you.
Tom wasn't as comfortable as Mary said it would be.
Give me that second box.
Tom has an older brother, John.
I'd take it.
They'll know what to do.
Why did you keep it all the time?
He's gone.
It was fun celebrating together.
I'm afraid I dislocated my right shoulder.
You really need to relax.
What is the purpose of life?
He's driving the Pole.
I've had my right shoulder cut.
I don't know anything about you.
Did you do something?
You should probably talk a little slow.
I need a beer.
I thought you were married.
It was a great success.
Sit down, please.
Does that happen often?
She told me one bird.
I couldn't see who it is.
Crazy!
You're paying me well.
I'm glad people saw that.
You need to talk to me.
It was just not our day.
Take it all.
I gave up.
It's all wrong.
It's all ruined.
Marriage between the same sex is now legal in 20 countries, including Ireland since yesterday.
Take this home with you.
She bought bread.
We'll try your way.
It's working.
You deserve to be commended.
Since the message was in French, it was easy for me to read it.
Finish this.
Tom tried to answer Mary from that.
Can you give me some water, please?
It doesn't matter where I am.
Where were you in Japan?
They're all gone.
I'll learn more.
I'm hurt.
I bought them for you.
None of us saw Tom do that.
And you wonder why we can't bring up your company?
You wrote my name wrong.
You're different.
You shame her.
I got two cats.
I already said I don't know how it is.
His girlfriend didn't provide support.
I didn't care.
Some of them were still in constant danger because of political repression and persecution.
I think your plan is too ambitious.
I still think the Internet isn't a place for kids.
That was hard for me.
What did you conclude?
You're created for me.
He needs it.
Obviously it's about typfeller.
Are we done?
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom got into Harvard.
She's my first love.
Have you ever seen one?
Are we safe now?
Tom's not a ninja.
Check it out.
Tell her.
I'd take it.
You're my lucky one.
I'm waiting for a bus.
Bad things happen.
Several of her feet fell during the storm in our neighborhood.
I'm sure I've seen her somewhere before.
They're all laughing.
I didn't know you were so rich.
He refused to comment.
We're trying.
I'm giving up.
Tom looked hot.
Don't overdo it.
I'll have a job tomorrow.
No one cares about me.
So what's the plan now?
I'm sure they need you.
Tom's not a good worker.
I'm here to help.
I'm smart.
I think writing's going very well.
Tom's no longer a member of this club.
That's a lot of help.
I've filled a cup of tea.
I'm not selective.
How many of them and your uncles do you have?
That morning Maria visited the entire village.
The voice was spreading fast.
Am I so different?
Tom took out the keys and opened the door.
I'm just here.
What Tom did helped a lot.
I've never noticed that before.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Mr. Jackson is our teacher.
I'm not worried about anything.
It helps.
Dima slept with 25 men during one night and then killed them.
I'm not doing it again.
I didn't think you'd be able to do that.
We're just gonna follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we coming soon?
I'm not a prophet.
I hope I'm not the only one who's gonna be there.
Are you angry about that?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
That's why I'm very uncomfortable.
Costs will rise soon.
Was I really so happy?
Tom might be the one who did it.
That sounds familiar to me.
I'll go to the sea tomorrow if it's nice.
Tom's gonna call.
I had dinner with her.
You see everything in black.
My car wasn't good enough.
Are they suspicious of me?
What are you supposed to do?
Tom likes to drive.
They couldn't travel because there was a problem.
The winter has passed, the spring has come.
It's really so simple.
Since these papers were written about that no farmer wants to work as a buyer in Vestfold, interest has grown rapidly.
I'm punished.
I have to go inside.
We're a little busy here.
Come on, come on.
It's really amazing.
Have you ever seen an NLO?
You're standing on my way.
It's getting dark.
What's the big secret?
The police are driving me.
I took the first step.
I hope Tom will remember this.
We're asking teachers every day.
What kind of food do you usually eat?
If the world isn't in the state it's in right now, I could trust everyone.
Three wounded, currently unclear in their condition, have been evacuated to an American Polish hospital.
I prayed for you.
Etherium and bitcoin with cryptovalent.
Hey, can you hear me?
We live on six floors.
I'm not afraid of you.
Whenever I see you, my heart tells me I'm in love.
Are you all right, people?
Will you help me?
It's not that bad.
Tom took the chair to a neighbor's room.
I'm destroyed.
I respect people like that.
Did you see it working?
Is that right or not?
Don't laugh.
I'm not a bad student.
We're done for today.
He's a full monarch.
Since the effects are potentially serious, a general precautionary measure is relevant to avoid infection in this type of patient.
I'm a free man.
I don't like deaf people.
The room was dark.
He's going home.
That could be a weapon.
I can't fix the car by myself.
I'd better go with Tom.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
Shouldn't you be ready for school?
I want to feel important.
A second later, his lips were raised in a filthy smile.
My mother was an alcoholic.
Merin's enthusiasm for the course got worse when her favorite teacher moved away.
I don't want to be invisible.
I guess you already know the answer to that.
Tom was nervous while he started a new job.
Help me.
The United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945.
Are you reading something interesting?
There's no smoking allowed here, your blood somewhere else!
I assumed you were busy.
Tom's always very nice.
I barely got my eye closed.
Was Tom here when we got here?
Was I really so happy?
I took off my wig.
Tom won't be happy when he hears that.
Tom's called after his father.
Did he really commit suicide?
I'm going to sleep.
What am I supposed to do?
Don't come to my wife.
They'll know what to do.
Do you have a copy?
I wasn't really a friend.
Did I let it go?
I just want to get out of here.
Why do you think that?
Little kids like everybody to pee.
She put her hair on the papillots.
He's free of military service.
My blood is on my right.
I'm motivated.
Knowledge frees us and makes us better people.
I didn't want to get you.
Are we safe now?
Who of your friends will come?
Can you explain them to me?
I've seen Tom play so many times.
You tried.
I'm taking you to the dance.
Tom might try to convince Mary to do that.
She's from Sloan's comet.
You told me not to lie.
He was a member of the social elite, rather than a representative of the broad mass.
I'm scared.
Help us achieve our goal.
You're sad.
I'm not a rich man.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Don't rush.
Give me the pen.
Just tell Tom I called.
There is no answer to the question of what is best, because it is always individual and dependent on the situation.
Tom thought Mary was cute.
Be careful.
You look like a very smart person.
I have the same wish to go abroad for a year to complete.
The house burned to the ground before firemen arrived.
Months of rain are May, June, July and August.
Do I usually act happy?
I already wrote part of the report.
I was ready for that.
Show me the documents.
It's about what...
That can be hard to be about passion, maybe it's just sex.
Did you finish the court-martial?
Only I can do it here.
Tom's gonna pay.
The money season is over.
I love the cable kitchen.
I'll start with beer.
Thank God.
That gives me an idea.
Is Tom nearby?
I'm motivated.
What a tragedy!
We're here.
Knowledge makes us free and better people.
Don't talk.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
I've almost never been home in a day.
The best parents of all are those who allow their children to follow their birth talents.
I'd go.
You're very unquestionable.
You've disappointed me.
There's a dream on this mountain all year long.
I don't think you should be too busy with anything these few days.
What's in nature forever, when everything's so passing?
The engine's asleep.
See you later!
Without you, I feel lost.
I have to plan everything.
This may not be enough.
That's what you did.
Everything you have one day will have you.
As far as Tom's busy, he never forgets that our email to his mother at least once a week.
The dog is dead.
This is life.
Do we have anyone like that?
Is this your suitcase?
Tom stopped for a second.
Because of the bad weather, the plane's late.
Check them out.
I'm in better shape than you.
I'm not so worried.
Come on, Tom.
I think it's possible to do that.
I'm going to sleep in about an hour.
I'm pretty happy now.
He first performed a preliminary test with a new electronic alcohol test before sending it to the laboratory test.
We went to the park.
I'm sure you're very busy.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Look around.
It was a stressful day.
Is it clear?
Are these your bags?
I don't know who they are.
Tom's been watching the approach.
Let us help you.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't know French.
What's your job?
Let's keep the discussion going.
How much am I gonna get?
I want to be with you.
This was refined and painted in personality so strange, cruel and stubborn that it was a little bit shy that he was close to cooperating with him.
She's pregnant.
Don't move!
I could get there by 2:30.
The measure is Indonesia's largest city.
Tom often came here as a student.
We'll take the next one.
Did you do homework?
Check everyone.
Tell us a story about ghosts.
Check everyone.
The session is closed.
I've got a lot of plans for tomorrow.
We have to follow Tom.
Tom saved $300.
How does she look?
I'm poor.
I can't wait till Monday.
Come with us.
Tom's on his way here.
Tom wasn't heavy.
That's crystal clear.
I'm trapped.
Pick up cheese on the tank of a parcel or on a small cup of tea.
Have you ever experienced a traffic accident?
I'd like to start.
I didn't wear an attractive suit.
I'm fascinated.
Just serious questions, please.
Man, the speaker called for the right choice.
Give the homeless food.
I translated the best song I could.
He left a few minutes ago.
I believe you're honest.
Tom wanted a bigger house than his neighbor.
Tom has an eye infection.
I'm glad we were there.
Although I was sick, I did everything I could.
Big boys don't pay.
I could go there now.
I need to write ten pages for the next Monday.
The situation was finally dangerous; it was a matter of life and death.
I've never noticed that before.
I have to sleep.
Tom usually comes to school before any other student from the department.
I'm in the house.
And if I was rich, I wouldn't give him the money.
Why?

Wisdom is necessary to understand wisdom: music does not exist for the deaf.
I don't want to play this game.
I knew you wouldn't be able to do that.
I'm sure I'm gonna get that tennis ball.
The problem children are often without any sense of guilt.
I feel bad because I lied.
I called him.
Maybe they gave up.
That's why I liked Tom.
Tom's buried.
Tell him.
How do you get out of the garden?
It's Saturn.
My aunt gave me flowers.
I hope that's not true.
Don't stop.
I don't like it when you work at home.
Of course, Tom loves his children.
Where are you now?
It's very likely that FIFA ran into the heart.
She gave me a controversial answer.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
He's wearing a gold chain around the door.
I'm very proud of that.
Ataturk was born in 1881 in Solun.
Tom's at least honest.
I want to answer the last question first.
Did you say this to Tom?
We don't know our neighbors.
It's only five in the morning, and it's already light out.
I hate mathematics.
What's your aunt doing?
If there is, the crossover with it will happen when it happens.
Tom's good government in France.
I can't help Tom do that.
I know this is weird.
He never suffered the death of his son.
I'm just doing my duty.
They're all villages.
If you don't have anything else to do, then the Greek island number.
She's always wearing a dirty dress.
Is that gonna get rid of the thing?
Mary put her finger on her finger.
We've already decided not to do that.
I'm really proud of Tom.
Is that your new boyfriend?
Tom worked older and older than the other boys.
It'll last forever.
The top of the mountains is leveled.
She laughed.
The gifts of the Most High are called the Most High; the gifts of the Most High are those of the Most High.
Tom would like to know if you'd like to come to this party.
You've grown up.
I've completely lost my mind.
I've never regretted what I've done.
I'm convinced.
Are you speaking Romanian?
Tom came to see me yesterday morning.
Hey, buddy!
Tom's still at work.
Did you sleep enough last night?
This must be a place.
If you're not a good girl, you won't get a birthday present.
They must have known all the time.
"I think the end is bad," he said. "Somewhere in things people say I want to see scars, failure, disorder, disorder."
Get everything.
Are these your bags?
I rejected Tom.
I'm not quite sure.
I'm probably never gonna use this anymore.
I'd buy that.
This is crossing all boundaries.
Tell me where you live.
Are we safe now?
Obviously, I was a little shocked.
Don't talk.
It wasn't too hot.
I forgot the passport.
Tom's reading a lot.
I hope you don't talk about me.
You're good to everyone.
I'm not usually so busy on Monday.
Both of my sisters are teachers.
Looks like it's working.
I don't live to eat, I eat to live.
Tom seemed very confused.
I thought you wouldn't be able to do that.
Just tell Tom I called.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "If not Q, then not P."
My wedding must be perfect.
Move.
We should learn.
We don't have a choice.
When it's time like this, it's best you sit home and don't go outside.
I think Tom's hiding something.
Tom, I need your help.
During an experiment on observation power, Tom was unable to describe any picture from the wall of his living room, even though he lived there for two years.
That's good enough.
I definitely had luck.
They all kept their breath.
I'm sure I'm gonna get that tennis ball.
I called him.
How many of this sandwich has calories?
Are you ready to take responsibility?
I like to watch you while you're working.
I hope we'll visit Peking too.
You're my inspiration.
I've been holding back this time from commenting on my dear friend.
I agree.
Be careful.
Did anyone call me?
We'll have lunch together in half an hour.
I'm still a little tired.
To make sure he maximizes his own interests, happiness or security seems very natural to one human being.
I can do it like a joke.
I'm not singing.
It's weird nobody knows the victim.
We're five minutes from here.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Translation isn't as close as many people think.
Tom would never admit it.
That was just the beginning.
Did you finish your homework?
Is everything okay between us?
I've never been camped.
I thought the food was great.
I have to plan everything.
Let's change the subject.
We've counted the caves on the building that we've broken and discovered he's 30 years old.
See you later, Tom.
Do you want a fruit juice?
Let's order a meeting.
I've been nervous about him.
Why can't you get it?
You can't sit next to me.
Did you expect something else to happen?
Tom's still working under stress.
Boston is a great city.
We hope people like it.
Maybe they'll leave tomorrow.
I want to show you something.
I'm remodeling.
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
That's interesting.
I'm scared.
I was happy yesterday.
And I really liked Tom.
He loves ritual.
Nobody helped us.
I don't want to go to school.
How long have you been living here?
Get help.
I didn't ask you not to do that.
Tom writes a letter to his mother every week.
He still has no experience for this job.
Can you help us?
Would you like to take a walk?
Tom encouraged Mary to write about her experiences.
I could have gone, but I didn't want to.
Who can't be proud of what Serbia is, with their greatest historical achievements - a kiss of capitalism and genocide?
Do you know how to disable the bomb?
Where do I leave my keys?
I'm a big fan of football.
She came alone.
I can't believe you didn't recognize a brother born.
Tom's lost his sense of humor.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
Tom's gonna look.
I wonder if anyone could help me.
I'm surprised.
They're all laughing.
I played golf with Tom a lot of times.
You appreciate me.
I don't have a guitar.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Tom said we'd stay here.
We're close friends.
My friend can speak Hindi right away.
Yeah, isn't that great?
Where can I find a tourist office?
I like it.
I already wrote part of the report.
Don't stop.
Please, come see me tomorrow.
It was a little weird.
I really enjoyed it.
No one died... yet.
Can we, people, break the grass and pull the nutrients out of it?
Why don't you play with the others?
We have three dogs, one white and two black.
Tom, this is my brother, John.
Tom wrote on the ground with a stick.
Don't you want another cup of milk?
Happy birthday!
The odds are against me.
I'll cancel.
She expects us to help her.
Did I get fired?
I'm afraid you misunderstood me.
That's good.
I don't want to drink you.
Tell me what's going to happen.
Tom saw enough.
Shall we move soon?
They're selling sugar at the store.
Tom and Mary were watching the sunset together.
You did a great job.
Tom does it sometimes.
Thank you for helping Tom.
What did you both do?
Happy birthday!
The photos of nature and animals, painted in complete silence and silence, are the real remem-pieces.
My mother died the day I got married.
I'll never say this again.
You don't have permission to enter that room.
We have two children.
I think Tom's careful.
The white family will come to Tokyo in half a dozen.
What have you done to me?
Enjoy it.
Let me write your steps.
Tom's probably still hiding.
Mary looks cute whatever she wears.
Watch out!
Tom couldn't provide any evidence to support his statement.
Why would Tom come now?
Are you sure this is safe?
You have a bad nature.
I'm gone.
I bought this yesterday.
I had a lot of bad days.
The whole country's fighting about it!
I'm not a good swimr.
Do you love me?
Tom's prepared the apple.
Let's find out for sure.
I'm desperate.
I was happy yesterday.
By the way Mary shut the door, Tom realized that she was sad.
It's not the best moment now.
He's no longer a child.
I'm trying to spend at least twice a week on the futon.
My education has made me what I am.
Tell her I'm innocent.
Wherever I go, I'm there.
You want to join me?
Leave the book to the top police.
We could be happy here.
Tom made it himself.
Do you agree with what Tom wrote in his report?
Is that what you need?
Take it all.
You tried.
I wouldn't hurt him.
Could you do that?
I just saw Ambassador Saudi Arabia give up.
Be careful.
Maybe something's wrong with you.
I'll drive.
Don't open it.
I had a problem dealing with that problem.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
You're the most satisfying person I know.
Contact Tom.
We've been here all day.
You know I can't give you such information.
I didn't do that.
I'll check it out.
Tom was shocked.
Just a minute, please.
We'll get you one.
Tom still seems upset.
That's what the doctor ordered.
Tom knows what's coming.
I'm impressed.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "(No P) and/or Q."
He speaks English.
I'm writing a message to Tom right now.
That's an exception.
Tom came a little earlier today than usual.
I could ride alone.
Actually, I've never met Tom.
What's easier?
Tom asked for an increase.
I've never seen that before.
This has to work.
I always liked Tom more.
Where did Tom hide?
What can't you tell me?
Tom bought the papers and read them in the car on his way to work.
I have home spirits.
Look at that.
We'll save this piece of cake for Tom.
You're funny.
Are Tom and Mary really married?
Let me try another one.
You're working slowly.
I didn't do that.
Snoria Sturlusona’s story goes further than the rest of the story that Christianity in Norway was spreading violence.
You should answer me.
Feel like you're home!
The students didn't know how to answer.
I'll try to convince Tom to do that.
Am I so different?
I got drunk.
I assumed you were busy.
That elegant-fashioned chain of hearts is a necklace that will "suckle your world."
It all happened at a sudden speed.
Do we have to tell Tom?
She fell a lot of rain.
There's milk in the refrigerator.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
You can sit next to me.
Take another one.
You're irrational.
I'm mad.

The plan is to leave me.

I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
We all have to die.
Who are we?
Does Tom really speak French?
I'm scared.
It's great.
Did you expect something else to happen?
John and Maria always walk around holding hands.
Where did I go wrong?
Tom's trying to help.
I missed so many opportunities.
It helped me a lot.
Give me another example.
Tom still has a little time.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Tom was more than generous.
I was just putting it off.
I'm sure it wasn't intentional.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
We lost ourselves, didn't we?
We won't let you die.
Have you gone to see Tom?
This is the beginning of a new era.
I don't have a card.
Nothing happened.
I've had the apple pie.
He's got a good look.
You can't sit next to me.
Are you coming soon?
Everything's different.
The truth has to be told.
Look at what it is!
We have to go to the shop.
Tom's in the garage, working on his motorcycle.
Are Tom and Mary really friends?
Tom wanted him to have a bigger ship than his brother.
Tell me what it is.
Let's hope Tom's smart.
For breakfast I always eat fruit and eggs.
Who would want Tom dead?
Tom made us know he didn't want to work for us.
I'm happy.
I'll stand.
We suggest that the quality of water is checked once a year in the pipes, twice in the bunnar.
Dear God, it is really difficult for people to pay attention to one or more things about you, your attitudes or your appearance, for example.
What did you say?
Tom could've done better.
I'm sure they need you.
I feel like I'm thrown into a lot of trouble.
Do you agree?
Don't be afraid of the dog that lives.
Are they still here?
Tom didn't write Mary for a long time.
"Yes, I'll help you, please," said Mike.
I'm not going with you.
Be careful.
Could I just interrupt you for a second?
The students didn't know how to answer.
It's a good purpose.
I've been thinking about it.
Stop trying to blame me.
I'll live.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
There was nothing to eat.
The girls were sleeping.
I'm just looking.
Do you want to know something?
We're not sure.
We don't have any food.
Interoperability is compatibility with other systems.
I love you, but not like that.
I have no idea.

Two thirds of the students were at the meeting.
My mother's not like other mothers.
He cancelled the meeting at the last minute.
What do women want?
Tom said you were cool.
She received four e-mails.
You open the door.
That's good.
Who's Tom?
Get dressed.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
Why did you do that?
I hope you don't talk about me.
How did this get me?
I'm fired.
Did you see my dog?
Tom told me he'd do it.
Look again.
I'm objective.
Nine out of ten voters think Mary is the most suitable candidate for the new leader, but Tom won't vote in these elections.
I'm sure you'll be fine to go through.
I'm probably not going to read Tom's report.
I agreed to buy it.
I'm Tom's grandfather.
Make a place.
Tom is also well-known in Australia.
Be careful.
It's cold today.
My mother's Greek.
Be careful with your wishes.
Tom's a third year student.
Who's coming with us?
Sounds like you've learned an important lesson.
We've never been separated.
I've got 30.
Give me my bottle.
I'm really happy to be here.
At that point, it was exploding with a big piece of sand.
That's exactly what I said would happen.
Tom knows that more than 91% of the Norwegian population can drink water from surface sources.
What's she drinking?
Tom's very innocent.
Don't forget to write the date.
Clean up this mess.
Could you read that?
That's quite normal.
It's said a new restaurant was built.
The price of this book is $5.
Can you keep your secrets?
I assumed you were busy.
When the fire broke out, he was asleep a lot.
I never thought of it.
It's a little quiet out there.
Tom explained it in detail, but I still don't understand.
That's not what you'd like.
I'm really glad to meet you.
Tom was parked twice.
Good morning.
Are you sure you're ready for this?
What are you gonna do with Tom?
There was nothing to eat.
Tom signed the account.
The islands are on the sea.
I've never had a problem sleeping.
I didn't see anything.
Is there any other options?
The cost of the work performed and interest on invested capital was several million.
I can't wait tomorrow.
Is coffee good for you?
You never know what's going to happen tomorrow.
How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three boys were laughing.
We're all tired of this.
I have to drink something.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
I don't fully agree with you.
Do you keep this place for someone?
How are you these days?
The week is seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
I wasn't worried about that.
Will you come to Tom and Merino's wedding?
He asked me to help him.
I'll be back later.
The sea is rising, the sea is people.
Tom said he wasn't an expert.
No, don't do that.

He didn't even hear Tom hates us.
I don't want any passports.
It's been a long time since I sent someone a letter.
What is the difference between imitation and true diamonds?
I don't want to grow up.
Tom stopped the engine.

Don't fight.
Did you write a report?
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he didn't have a choice.
Can you go, Tom?
That man is a soldier.
Do you have Facebook?
Tom's working around nine hours constant.
I hope I can do that.
I told you Tom was busy.
For you.
They couldn't all hear what Tom said.
I'm gonna get out of here.
We've got four French hours every week.
Let's start right now.
I can't imagine doing that.
I've been training for months.
I know what you're probably thinking about.
It's our only hope.
Today I have a lot of fun.
I didn't know you were so rich.
It was a presentation he's already published.
Let me show you why you shouldn't do that.
Tom didn't practice.
Thank you so much!
Hold your seat belt.
It's fifteen to two.
I think you should do a test again.
Why would you surrender to Tom?
The Europeans were given the advantage over other civilizations 500 years ago.
I'll pray for your family.
I can't remember what I ate yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.
Even the kids know that.
Don't make a fool of yourself!
That makes me very angry.
Is it still the light out there?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
A lot of birds are on the border.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.
I assumed you were busy.
Do you agree?
I recognized him at first sight.
That's very nice of you.
I'd love to think of it.
Tom managed to get into the house through the window.
I saw the cat.
I saw a cat.
The snow fell in Paris.
I hope Tom will come back safely.
Can you laugh at Tom?
I'd better clean up now.
You tried.
Don't leave me alone.
Wow!
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom's tough or fair.
Are you free this afternoon?
The three of us went up with the potatoes salad.
Come on yourself.
I didn't tell you to do that.
Where are you from?
I promised.
It's not a simple sport.
Their friendship quickly turned into love.
Don't be a lesbian.
I eat a lot of meat.
Tom's a driver.
The future looks dark for Edmond Dantes, since he became a victim of the conspiracy, he was convicted of being betrayed and sent to prison for life.
You're irrational.
Mother chose this commitment.
We're both not rich as much as we want.
Can you let Tom know that I'm back?
She did what she was told.
I'm a celebrity.
You need one of these.
Can you cook?
Tom loves sports.
I learned French by myself.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's his bad point.
You're one of us.
One leg is in the grave
Tom just told me to turn around.
Louder!
I'm sensitive.
Tom's not satisfied.
That would be fun.
He's crazy about the power.
What do you know about me?
I'm reformed.
All the songs I sang to you today, I wrote them.
That doesn't scare me at least.
How old are you?
Tom asked me if I had ever slept last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom was a little sick.
I'll contact you as soon as I get there.
I'm glad.
This place seems quite different from what it was before.
Why are your ears big?
I'm a runner.
I want to help.
I know how it works.
Tom sent his son to bed without dinner.
Tom's a real idiot.
Come and see us.
He lied to us.
That's quite a problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me I didn't talk to Mary.
That's very rare.
What did I just do?
It's best to solve things in the walk.
This is so cool.
I really enjoyed it.
I bought a lot of things.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Kade.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That's a lot of help.
What do you believe?
I'm sorry I was just trying.
That river looks smooth, doesn't it?
I can keep my secret.
Tom helped me write this statement.
We hate Tom.
This one's so cool.
Tom crossed the line.
This isn't so fun.
That's a very big secret.
Mary said she'd find the secrets of all her bosses if they didn't increase her pay.
"Will you think?" "Yes, I will."
Get out of there.
Is there any of this right?
I had a vision.
I'm cold.
Please wait a little longer.
I don't want to do that!
I'm tired of fighting.
How was your day?
What am I looking for here?
She's a singer.
I like to watch you play.
I definitely had luck.
What's the first song you ever wrote?
Tom could get involved.
I just want to get out of here.
Don't let him get you out of this good way.
Be careful.
He's in college for the first year.
I've been looking for juice from the garden.
I was thinking about my family.
Can you laugh at Tom?
My accurate knowledge of language is enough for many situations, but not for revealing my, often contradictory, emotions.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book's on the police.
I often feel a heart attack.
Tom's on a secret mission.
I don't blame you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm afraid of snakes.
I know that girl from somewhere.
I woke up once.
I'm sorry I'm always bothering you.
He's a powerful man.
That's great!
I'm a gorilla.
Can you pick us up?
Can you get in time?
It's weird that the mailman hasn't come yet.
How can we prevent that from happening?
I hope Tom will remember this.
Was I really so happy?
I'll buy a boat soon.
Tom said he won't wait for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
Have you ever been punished for driving fast?
I'll be right up.
We have to go.
Tom's a very good boy.
Tom's on the floor.
There are no girls on the Internet.
She tried.
Like most eight-year-olds, Tom's not sure what he wants to do with his life.
Vivaldi wrote a lot of music works for the fagot.
U.S. Secretary John Kerry broke the right button bone in a bike accident on Sunday in France.
Where there's a lot of grandmas, they're kids.
It sounds simple, I know.
Tom seemed very confused.
The results were incredible.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember your name.
The bones were covered.
Have you completely recovered?
I'll listen.
Tom was talking very loud.
Don't move!
In the accident, he took a look at it.
Did I let it go?
This is the stupidest thing I've ever said.
I wish I knew Tom couldn't speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
It's unbelievable.
Florence is the best city in Italy.
The left side of Tom's house is in Connecticut, and the right side is in New York.
There are indications that it will accept, known for its luxury meal, this year to be something more modest.
What's wrong with you?
You lied to me, didn't you?
I hope Tom will do that.
Tom and I were friends.
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Which way are you going?
I'm sorry if I disappointed you.
Violent criminals were often more violent in childhood.
You owe me a lot.
He's a man who's saving words.
I'm really sorry about this.
Tom came to me for dinner yesterday.
Look at what it is!
It's true.
You're very unsatisfied.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Now it's a great time to buy a guy like that.
He knows the names of all his customers.
Tom got out of it.
Tom got involved in people he never had to mix with.
Tom's been visiting us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and I'll write.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's the problem you have to solve yourself.
I was oversized.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom dropped the book.
This has to work.
You don't have to judge a man according to his appearance.
It's not connected.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thank you for the e-mail!
I thought I didn't know what was going on.
They'll keep talking tomorrow.
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
Tom told me he wouldn't tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
The team's as weak as his weakest member.
I've been there already.
It's different than I expected.
Don't lie.
So what are your plans?
The kids are sleeping.
You need a temporary bridge.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
Tom closed the door.
I wasn't having fun, so I went home early.
Now is the time for the kids to go to bed.
Tom worked very hard and made a lot of money.
I don't like socializing.
He lived a simple life.
We offered help.
It was a dark and bitter night.
The first phase is over.
You'll be known.
He's got enough money, even more.
We're glad we got you here.
Tom was sure of himself.
I wonder how Tom feels.
You're the most decent person I know.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
Today I bought a tusk of oysters.
I'm hurt.
Tom stayed with us for a few days.
Does French teach in your school?
Take a picture of this.
Who lives in the neighborhood?
Tom was in the audience.
Tom's gonna get better.
It's important to me.
Tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see the difference.
Don't worry.
I used to not like anyone.
The bones are covering up.
Find Tom.
You really made me proud.
You see everything in black.
Now I'm a little worried.
Do you have a stable relationship with the boy?
Tom still knows he's quoting the song he wrote when he was thirteen years old.
Did you see Tom left?
Be careful.
How would that make you?
I'm ready to pay you well to do that.
That was a tough decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you'd be busy.
He's having a lot of fun.
I hope tomorrow will be a good time.
Let's sit down.
Come and see.
Tom really does work well.
Do your kids have their rooms?
Tom kept all the letters Mary sent him.
Go and spend some time with Tom.
It's safe.
Tom died in a dream.
A woman's scarf isn't perfect without a little black dress.
Finish this.
Tom helped me save a diner by telling me about the cheaper place where it can be bought.
He can't do anything but admire his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom's been working his whole life.
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom.
Tom's gonna live.
You won!
That's a bad sign.
I got it wrong.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the same day I married.

In this phase of world history, in America there is no such thing as an independent press. You know that, and I know it. If you're not allowed to write your true opinion, and if you would write it, you'd already know that it's never going to appear in print. I get my money regularly to keep my honest opinion out of the news I'm working for. Many of you are similarly paid for similar things, and any of you would write what you'd really think, find out, on the street, looking for someone else's work. If I allowed my right thinking to write it, and when I would write it, I'd never know that it's going to appear in the press.

I'm really happy to be here.
Please don't cry.
Why are you acting like a child?
We could save Tom only if we got there a minute earlier.
I know this is weird.
I'm glad we were there.
Do you have anything to report?
Why did you do that?
Tom was very nice.
I need to buy a new coat because my old man went out.
Trolov's wall is the highest European vertical mountain wall, with a height of 1700 meters to the bottom, of which is 1000 meters vertical.
I'd like to meet you with Tom.
There is little doubt that the cut-out in the already enlarged system will have dramatic consequences for industry and rural areas.
You got hurt because of that, even though it didn't have any meaning, and it was supposed to be something funny on my side, but you didn't see it that way.
Who's got time for this?
I'm still asleep.
Tom's a dealer.
I'm sick of stomach.
We calculated that we could get to that place in two weeks.
I put all the tests.
Mary works as a waitress in a nearby coffee shop.
Let me explain.
I forgot the baby surveillance device.
She's responding to it.
I'm in.
What do you got there?
Well, what's your secret?
This one's pretty cool.
Just be quiet, please.
I don't understand what the teacher says.
I want you a nice week!
Doping is not compatible with my ideological views on sports.
I'm coming to save you!
I'm wearing a flannel pizza.
I'm scared of death.
There was only one small problem.
I'm full right now.
That was terrible.
I wasn't confident at all.
Don't ever say anything.
I participated in the competition.
Did you eat something?
France is in Western Europe.
I hope Tom stays here.
I'm sending planes to the airport.
That's all your wisdom!
Tom wore a black hat.
You did what you had to do.
Tom doesn't always seem satisfied.
We've lost our money.
I think everyone's overrun.
I'm very happy about that.
Tom turned to leave.
I'll never mention this again.
Let me show you where to put it.
Why didn't you let Tommy talk to Mary?
Wake up at 7:00 in the morning.
What would I do without you?
I think Tom will be able to help us manage this.
I'm already paid.
They're all killed.
Did I call you?
Come on Tuesday, if possible.
We need to be realistic.
Don't worry.
They accidentally heard some suspicious activity in the chirp showing that the bear smelled their food.
I was everywhere in Europe.
Can I help you, sir?
Don't worry.
You asked for yourself.
How is this your fault?
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Come to my fourth.
I don't want to live with you.
I'm confused.
Tom's in constant pain.
The other girls from Mary's department laughed at her because of her clothes.
Everyone's either past or passing through it.
I'll be right back.
I'm a witch.
Tom and Mary are enjoying the long journey to France.
Tell Tom I'm innocent.
Can you help me translate these sentences into Chinese?
Did you look?
Are you busy here?
I'm choosing between two possibilities.
We have what we need.
Everything else is unnecessary.
Did you look good?
Tom asked me to wake him up in half seven.
We didn't do that.
Did you raise the courts?
Please, add them to me.
How's Tom doing?
Be careful.
Do you have any paper I can write about?
He was walking along the street.
Do you agree with that?
It's just that we had dinner.
I'm sure they need you.
That's good.
You're one of us.
Do you have a dog?
I saw the cat.
I was there already.
Tom's book is at the top of Christmas books, and it's hard to get some book out of position.
Tom's working for Mary now.
I'm armed.
Is it necessary to make such a galloma?
Did you raise the courts?
Give me another reason.
Let's drink something!
I assumed you were busy.
Are you dyslexic?
That I just knew.
Get over it.
That's all I could find.
A large crowd of people gathered.
I'm working on my project.
Everything's well prepared in advance.
I'm not counting on it.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
They gave water to their horses.
I'll give you whatever you want.
The girls wore grass skirts and had flowers around the door.
I'm not feeling well.
Tom's the only cook in the family.
Maybe he's already gone.
You're wrong.
This could take weeks.
You can format and configure a table for individual budgets, insert and use regular tables, diagrams, formulas and functions.
I'm going to stay at the Hilton Hotel.
Which of you will come with me?
Call me whenever, on my shoulder, you can always cry.
I'm reformed.
What's going to be next?
Doctors are still trying to save Tom.
No one believed her.
Detectives are still investigating.
Tom was prefined.
This sad story was written at the time Tom was in exile.
Tom's not like the other boys.
We'll go to the stairs.
I'm sure I'm gonna win that tennis match.
Do you have anything to report?
Turn around.
We should have brought another bottle of wine.
Men want to feel willing.
She tried.
You don't mind, do you?
How would you feel if you left your wife?
Can you prove it?
Son of a bitch.
It's very easy to write this pen.
Are you ready for yet?
This pen doesn't work.
Have you seen me play?
I'd rather not be involved at this point.
Tom closed the garden.
I had dinner with him.
I really hope I'm wrong.
Are you busy here?
Tom used to play guitar before.
I'm actually a nice guy.
That's what they both like.
It must have been terrible.
I'll borrow you a work-in-law if you promise me you won't write anything about her.
My friends live in the same house as I do.
There's a lot of bad people in the world.
Did Tom find it?
Are they in love?
Where are we gonna meet tomorrow?
Tom saved Mary.
Latin is the language of the future!
I think they're all ready.
You'll see her.
Tom has a dark secret.
Did you eat something?
Let's explain that.
It's a very interesting bird.
The relationship between the person and the blood group has not been scientifically confirmed.
I thought you were married.
Singing.
It's Tom.
I've checked some things.
I'm not singing.
I'd love to kiss you.
The kids are playing outside.
Are you coming soon?
Did you manage to do that yourself?
The Working Group on Data Transfer, led by Ben Mani, will hold a meeting on 14 January 1999.
Some say if you put it on a rain sheet, it's gonna start raining.
In my beginning, it's my end.
I'm just here.
Stop trying to make me guilty.
What should I see?
Have you decided what you're gonna do?
Tom knows it's going very fast.
Are we all here?
I'll be right back with your crew.
My sister's playing with the dolls.
Identify yourself.
Take the money.
I'm afraid to buy a new saxophone.
Don't give up on yourself like that.
I give you what you want.
Who did you write a letter to?
Maybe I'll need some help.
Does this mean you don't love me anymore?
I'm not a specialist.
I'm more alive than I look.
No one's here.
Tom's youngest daughter is his mistress.
Tom bought the papers and read them in the car.
I won't be home next week.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
That would be OK.
What's your name?
How does Tom know French?
I like to watch you while you're working.
Answer my questions.
There's no established policy.
Write down what I'm telling you.
The rain finally stops.
I live in an old house.
Do you love your mother?
It was a big explosion.
Tom moved in.
I didn't step outside today.
Did they tell you why?
Can you give me your name?
Look at this.
She saved her head alive.
I think we should call the doctor.
You've got a terrible morning today.
We got Tom on the job.
We need to be realistic.
She took off her clothes.
Tom's house is on sale.
Tom wasn't satisfied with the results.
I hid myself under the table.
He's holding me like a hostage.
Maybe Tom wasn't hungry.
I've been there already.
Tom asked Mary how she likes her new job.
I'm a big fucker.
What are you going to do with all this?
Mary's making a living.
Can you give me some water, please?
Where's your friend?
I don't know what to think about this.
I don't like it.
Tom's used to winning.
Elementary, love my Votson.
Tom's not sure what he wants to do with his life.
We're here for you.
I'm distracted.
What do you want?
Medicines should not be disposed of via wastewater.
Did you see who it was?
When I woke up, the snow fell.
Some people, regardless of how long they've been, don't lose their beauty.
I've played golf many times with Tom.
Don't talk.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis ball.
That's pretty extraordinary.
Bad things will happen.
Why would Tom come now?
I panicked.
Come on, try it now.
We better get inside.
Actually, I'm not sure.
Check it out.
She was dressed in red.
What's a consultant studying?
It's all a big joke.
Tom was talking about music.
Have you completely recovered?
We fought hard.
Tom's still hiding.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't know French.
Keep working.
Hope disappears when you're experiencing a difficult situation and a pointless beginning.
I was laughing.
The new constitution will not solve the problems of Egypt.
Solar energy is the pure source of energy.
I thought Tom wasn't doing what he should do.
I'm not lying to you.
Did you see me dancing?
Did you eat anything?
Tom's not in any danger.
It's too easy.
All men are the same.
Is it clean?
They haven't woken up yet.
Everything's free.
Welcome.
We don't have a choice.
I've never really been anywhere.
He's always losing his cell phone.
I'm angry.
I think I'm going to Australia too.
I'm sure Tom's gonna win.
Are Americans really so individual?
You can go play with your friends when you're finished cleaning the house.
That's my problem, not yours.
What's your specialization?
I'm twice as old as Tom.
You're the love of my life.
Tom couldn't talk to Mary, and he couldn't influence it.
And now that I remember everything I've experienced, I've really learned a lot.
I wasn't too surprised.
The team's as weak as his weakest member.
I've never been camped.
There are many honest people in the world.
Don't cry.
When was the last time you heard of Tom?
Hungarian is not easy, but it's beautiful.
I think so, too.
I love a tent with a storm cover, along with a cut-off button for the stability of the wind and snowy noses, and this has to be a double tent.
Tell Tom I'll say hello.
I can't be something I'm not.
Where are we going to meet?
Do you think what she said was a lie?
Tom didn't do it.
I'm busy.
Tom's fired.
Are you planning on going to Tom and Merino's wedding?
This candidate is much better compared to his predecessor.
Don't call me while I'm at the office.
Thank you for loving me.
The doctor's investigating the patient.
Tom put his drinks on.
This is a lark of justice.
I could lose my pension.
She's got a bad mood.
I've always known that.
Don't be mad.
Every communication is a translation.
I'm trying to be careful.
I'm really happy about that.
I've never been to camp.
They believe in God.
Everyone's a boss in his house.
Let's hope you're right.
We're breaking up on a bottle.
Are you angry about that?
I spoke the language.
You tried.
I thought I could trust Tom.
When there's no news, that's good news.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
Did that happen to me?
Did you sleep?
They tried hard to get to court.
Is there any reason you're keeping this old bottle?
We've been talking for a while.
Now I have to go.
Can I get your dictionary?
No one else was hurt.
We have to try.
That's not India, is it?
I'll get what I need tomorrow.
Maybe I'm antisocial, but that doesn't mean I'm not talking to people.
I believe you're honest.
I didn't pick anything.
Let's try something.
Are you in Paris?
Don't leave me alone.
Tom started teaching France last year.
Tom's been sitting on the club all day, writing the charts.
Don't you want to eat anything?
It's abandoned.
Don't move!
I've already thought about it.
Money's talking.
I hope Tom will remember this.
Tom told me his father died.
We have to spend less!
I've been parked twice.
I've never noticed that before.
Do you want to live in Mumbai?
Tom broke something again.
Tell me where you live.
You have to teach me these days.
I love this work.
I just didn't go looking for you.
He's leading an angry life.
I'm not a rich man.
I really like your music.
That's what I used to do.
Tom has a right attitude.
Anatomy implants for breast, however, can also lead to the deformation of breast form if they rotate along the side.
Where did you find the keys?
I'm not gonna tell anyone you did it.
She tried.
Tom was a little confused.
I saw a bus.
Tom's smart enough not to do anything like that.
I brought this report to see them in more detail.
We're both not rich enough to want.
Turn around.
Tom's still angry.
Why are you still awake?
Please don't make me eat that.
I think your work is very good.
Tom helped Mary wear a coat.
Have fun as long as you can.
The Internet is not your personal army.
I could go with you.
Sadly, he turned from Almighty God into a helpless, worthless, insignificant man in the Czech small province of the vast empire.
We need to do better.
The weather forecast says tomorrow is going to rain.
Tom's a real gentleman.
I saw a snake.
It's useless.
What planet are you with?
Are you listening?
Am I in love?
Wait, wait, don't go yet.
Did you eat something?
Give me another reason.
What did you two do?
Is this your first exam?
Life's going on!
Tom's already here, but Mary's not here yet.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
Okay, we made a deal.
Let's not be emotional.
Tom's very patient.
Everything's changing.
Tom knows where the wind blows.
Women are the best in a man's life.
When you get your phone, the battery is in front of you.
Tom now knows that.
I volunteered.
Shut up!
Tom likes it most.
Tom's driving me crazy.
This famous actor was also a fashion icon.
I'm not moving to Boston.
I'm impatient.
Last night, I finished learning a waiter at Duoling.
Tom attacked Mary's sister.
Am I safe now?
We'll be right back at work.
I did what I could for him.
I'll just say, you're beautiful.
Are you allergic to any food?
Tom's listening because he's convincing.
I'm not packed yet.
Did you sleep?
The readers were in trouble, waiting for at least three months before they got an answer.
Do you know someone who put up a last year's exam?
Mary took her leave for travel.
They live on high feet.
Tom came out of the limo.
I'm sure I've already seen that guy somewhere.
I'm surprised by Tom's answer.
I'm buying a lot of things in that store.
You don't support me much.
What's he drinking?
You'll see her.
He's all, he's just not honest.
I'll call her tonight.
The police asked the criminal to hand over his gun.
It's human sin. It's divine.
I put all the tests.
I just needed some time.
I have to go.
Please be honest with me.
Tom knows it's hopeless.
What's that?
Man sleeps, God decides.
Tom was wearing black marks.
It must have been fun.
What do you have to say?
That gives me an idea.
Did you just meet them?
It's more art than science.
Is this place busy?
That's right.
Add more water.
Tom's counting the cost.
All parking places are full.
This is my brother, Tom.
Use the device until you are warned to fill the battery and then fill it in 5 hours to achieve maximum capacity.
Tom's still abstinence.
You're becoming unscathed.
No, don't do that.
I had a house when I was a kid.
Tom was with the girl, but he couldn't see who he was.
I'm not asking Tom to do that.
They're all standing.
I said I didn't understand.
Would you like to talk to Tom?
Can you add me a distance?
Why are you leaving?
Now it's time for fun.
Did he meet his goals?
I just want to go home.
Tom's worried about this.
Have you seen my house?
I have a book.
What do your kids usually breakfast?
Am I so different?
We had a terrible fight.
And Tom's a salesman.
I'm twice as old as Tom.
That's exactly what I said would happen.
A new engine test will take place today.
Come and sit.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
I'm sorry.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
Tom wants to pay the money he owes.
All things have to go through.
Come on in the truck.
I've never saved that before.
I don't want that.
I think Tom was great.
I've got headaches.
Tom looks kind of cute.
I liked them that my wife knows how to cook.
I'm proud of my family.
Men have about 7 to 8 times more testosterone than women.
I have to go.
It was a good hat.
The door was closed for something.
Tom left right away.
I had lunch with her.
You taught me so much.
What's bigger, Sun or Earth?
We'll get you one.
No doubt!
It looks like you've wasted ten pounds.
You disappointed me.
We'll be right back on that.
Can I ask why?
I bought this yesterday.
You did a great job.
The insurance officer's overheating.
Are we safe now?
Tom says he'll do it one day.
Otherwise, what's your address?
This one's uncomfortable.

I think you were very generous.
Tom might have something to do with it.
Are you dyslexic?
It doesn't work on me.

I'm not rushing anywhere.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
That's all I needed.
Let me try.
I paid for it.
I bought a new hat in the store.
I wouldn't hurt him.
I have complete confidence in you.
Have you ever heard such good music?
It's okay.
I think you'll be able to do that.
Stop it, will you?
He pulled a ball in the ball!
It's a big day today, son!
We were fulfilled with a happy expectation.
It's just a personal attitude.
I'm really sorry, Tom.
Did you tell Tom this?
My older sister is very talented to sing.
I'm sorry, but I won't forget.
I always thought it was weird.

It's necessary.

I'm poor.
How long have you been living here?
Do you think the situation will improve?

You're driving slow.
Tom must have had a key.
Why is that interesting?
Are you interested in this?
I'm sure Tom didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
You're the reason I came here.
Tom probably hates me too.
You can sit with me.
Oh, gray cats, please, don't move, so he could hear you.
Just give me a chance.
What's your mom laughing at?
How many people were there?
Everybody's quiet.

Do you like it or not?
Life's going on!

That's what I liked.
It must be scary.
Men want to feel important.

It's an idiophony case.
You pay me well.

Go upstairs.
That doesn't matter.

Could we order it now?
We can't stay here.

Hey, give me a chance.
There is also a ethical question that has been asked about this.
It just happened again.
They've all survived.
Bad things will happen.
Do you love your mother?
I'm really proud of that.
This is my third marriage.
What have you done here?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom's a little worried.
I totally disagree with that.
It's a routine thing.
He's trying.
Good evening.
Will someone tell me what to do?

You're doing good.
That's what Tom tells me.
Tom pressed the switch.

I've been looking for you.
I'll go by the car.
Tom likes to write.
Tom didn't know what question to ask.
I'm just doing my duty.
I'm taking a day off.
Do you blame me?
It's damaged the desk's availability yesterday.
I thought you were going to Boston bus.
Tom still has a little time.
Maybe I'm not sleeping tonight.
Just waste your time.
I'd love to know what's going on here.
How many pairs do you have?
I've never had a problem sleeping.
It's locked.
I'll figure something out.
An honest man can't do that.
Watch out!
I'm not trying to predict the future.
What are you doing at this time?
I'm scared.
Are they all strong?
Is everything solved now?
Please send me a doctor's account.
What's this about?
I want a nice day, Tom.
Are you going to Tom and Merino's wedding?
I'm a little new in this.
I improvised.
"Do you know what's going on?"
That's what they both like.
You and I need to talk.
You were spying on me.
The pen I'm writing belongs to Tom.
Where'd you see Tom?
It's time.
What's this gonna buy me?
Wake up!
We help each other.

How did you do that?
I'm not gonna tell anyone else.
How do you know so much?
Tom's got a smile on his face.
I'm scared.
What's your name?
Is Tom really a student here?
Tom's the one who wrote this story.
Everybody's going.
I didn't spend anything.
It's an area with many new houses.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Tom was pretty nervous.
Tom likes sports.
Tom took off the wig.
It turned out I was right.
Her name was unknown.
I'll get Tom.
Don't come to my girl.

I'm not angry at all.
Jumi's one of my friends.
He just needed some time.
I thought you wouldn't do that.
Sorry I'm so late.
Mary started to get out of here.
As far up as you can go down.

I'm sure there's a better way to do this.
I'm firm against this.
You appreciate me.
Tom never makes mistakes when he writes in French.

Close the window.
Tom missed his goal.
I totally disagree with you.
Get out of here.
Let me repeat that.
They live there.
This book will help you write effectively.
Don't talk.
Tom made a fool of himself when he was drunk last night.
I'm working in Milan.
Come back in one day.
There was quite a different effect than intended.
I'm surprised by Tom's answer.
Everybody laughs.
I liked going to the beach.
Where's your father?
I'd agree.
It's all over.
The book's been sold.
Tom almost died trying to save me.
It needs the truth.
I liked going to the beach.
At first glance, it looks easy.
It's time to say hello.
You should have been my friend!
People need to stop hate.
I don't think he'll make it.
I never advised you to do that.
I don't mean to change.
Tom started a car.
My grandmother is enjoying her father's tea ceremony.
She laughed.

You always work.
There are situations in the shop where it is paid to sacrifice the figure to gain the advantage over a long period of time.
Young children should learn to cooperate with animals.
You're not done yet?
You're not the one who died.
It's hard to imagine.
Are you a sarcastic?

She's walking.
My mother loves music.
Would that be possible?
What did you two do?
Draw your house.
Tom left his drinks.
I'm pretty shocked about this.
Space is empty.
Tom decided to go against it.
I'm grateful.
I couldn't do this without your help.
Don't answer.
If you'd do that for me, you'd do a lot of good.
He was naked and naked.
Tom might be honest.
Can you explain to me how to get to the airport?
Look again.
The first step is always the hardest.

I know it's illegal.

The horse's here.
They all fell asleep.
Tom begged Mary not to say anything to his parents.
Would you like to come with me?
Tom's family lives in Boston.
I liked that one.

Are these your bags?
What did you do to me?
Don't jump!
When he was six years old, he taught him how to build a house on a writing machine, and he told the teacher that he shouldn't learn to write with his hand.
I've been practicing.
That doesn't sound quite convincing, but I believe you.
I think I'm going out to eat.
Can we talk outside?
You have good instincts.
I thought I was doing well.
Am I safe now?
Please, write it down.
We didn't have this in the plan for you.
Tom's selling cars.
He started to cry.

I'll never see her again.
Everybody down!
I could talk to Tom.
Do you believe in God?
We fell in love last night.
Was I really so happy?
Tom never had to do that.
You don't often hear that someone bought a thousand dollars hat.
Come here.
That's what I used to do.
Are you questioning me?
Tom's been working all his life.
What language do they speak in Mexico?
That's what they both like.
There's something going on.
Help!
I already ordered her.
I'm sure Tom's gonna miss me a lot.
What's your name?
Where did you get that?
Tom's a really nice kid.
I can't concentrate on this competition.
I'm sure I'm gonna win that tennis match.
Swimming is a kind of exercise.
The government fell after the vote in parliament.
I want to be a swimr.
Shall we see Tom again?
When did you have time to do that?
I don't have a lot of friends.
We don't know what tomorrow brings.
Which instrument did you learn to play?

I have a plan.
You took my place.

People tell me things.
Fuck you!

Did Tom trust you in the story?

It's hard.
Tom thought I was lying.
I don't want anything from you.
How's it going?
Don't mess with me.
Tom's also a salesman.
I want to feel important.
We'd do everything we could to keep it from happening.
I think Tom needs help.
Switzerland needs better apples.
Are you getting involved in this?
Everyone's standing.

You can't ever fuck yourself so you don't smell.
Don't move.
No one can know everything.
I'm objective.
I'm going to leave earlier today.
Are my red ears?
He's not a doctor.
That's enough.
How many instruments can you play?
Employees can be motivated by good, fair wages, the opportunity to work in a good team or on exciting tasks, and with clear economic incentives such as bonuses and opportunities for progress.
I doubt I'm the only one who's noticed.
That's encouraging news.
Give me the sugar, please.
I'm really sorry about this.
You're funny.
Merry Christmas!
Have you ever seen one?
We had a lot to drink.
It's too loud for me here.
I doubt it's gonna be hard for you to get a driver's license.
Did you manage to do that on your own?
Is everything solved now?
How can it be that mathematics, which is still only a product of human ideas independent of experience, is so amazingly adapted to objects in fact?
Look at that.
Looks like Tom's a real person.
I didn't know you were so rich.
Look at this.
The code's Muriel.
I've got my hands on speed.
He's risking it.
His wife had his shirt covered.
Someone told me about it.
Smell the mountain!
In order to change the red meat, I had a sugary chest in the cheese of the bakery for tonight.
I'm always angry.
Tom fights like crazy.
I always liked horror movies.
Something just got out.
I couldn't stop crying.
You've got your hands on it.
They're not mine.
I double prices.
Could you do that?
A video of the interview was made and published on the Internet.
Tom was drunk and drowned his grief after one night of drinking.
Why don't we just rest a little short?
Go check it out.
Tom just wanted to say something.
It's over.
Is it true that Tom killed himself?
I'm here to play baseball.
Do you think so?
I didn't even do that.
Do you have anything to report?
I'm saying it all the time.
Don't lie.
Will you take that?
I just got here.
Is Tom coming back?
You're smart.
How did I get here?
Why?
Tom let down the frozen breath.
There's a lot of work I need to do before I can go home.
By the way, where are you living?
Do you have any questions?
It's hard for me to understand French when she talks fast.
It'll be half three soon.
They'll know.
Tom bought some black shoes yesterday.
I have a lot of friends.
Cirrh is considered one of the major financial centers.
That's a very rare one.
Tom wanted to be good.
I'm just not hurrying.
Don't look.
How desperate are you?
Let's not get out of here.
It's not getting worse.
Answer me.
I'm still making mistakes.
Tom's got a hard job.
I'm happy we won.
You can't go into that room.
"Are you better?" "No, I'm worse."
It's all passing, but good memories live.
I was in the mountains.
It's hard.
What's easier?
Have you finished the courts?
We fought hard.
It was a cup of tea.
He doesn't like us.
We'd save time to get down through Park Street.
The police arrested him for driving in a drunk state.
We'll be crazy.
That would be great.
The knife isn't sharp.
We hope he likes people.
We all have a price.
It gave him an idea.
I'm lucky.
No one knows me in Boston.
Tom thinks something's wrong with some politicians.
Where's Tehran?
Go through any obstacle with this truck monster!
Mary spends a lot of time on the phone, sending messages and e-mails to friends.
He's always wearing dark clothes.
Good luck on our side.
Tom works for his father's company.
I want to help you.
We never lose hope.
Men remain children for the rest of their lives.
Now we need the truth.
I should be here all afternoon.
Didn't I teach you anything?
Why are you asking?
It's big.
How fast it's too hard.
Come sit next to me.
I found his book.
I've barely been able to hide my temper because of her rudeness.
Butter is made of milk.
We can't do anything about that.
Everything's better.
Do you want to see something specific?
I miss him.
I've put an exam!
Let us help you.
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
Please, don't give up.
Does he still have temperature?
Tom was crazy, you know.
Tom put the map on the table.
