China strongly opposed the adoption of the so-called Tibetan Bill, which seriously violates the principle of one China and the principles of three Chinese-American joint communiqués.
This was stated on Friday by the official representative of the Office of the Republic of the Congo of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Taiwan.

TikTok hides inappropriate video from users
According to TikTok, the number of users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of which is younger than 18 years of age.

The Chinese social network TikTok presents video censorships that mention the area of Tianman, the independence of Tibet or the banned religious group of Falungun, The Guardian.
The publications state that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance company) is advancing the foreign policy of China through the annex.
The main part of China's policy violations falls under the “disgusting of hatred”.
In each case, TikTok has an inappropriate publication in the context of general rules so that social networks do not appear to be censorous.
For example, the ban on the criticism of the socialist system of China falls under the general prohibition of “crisis or attacks on the policies and social rules of any country such as constitutional monarchy, Parliamentary system, etc.”.
The ban on the mention of incidents in the Tianmenen or genocide in Cambodia falls under "the history of China or other countries".
The document also included a list of prohibited names of twenty “foreign leaders or public actors”, including North Korean leaders Kim Chen Ira, Kim Ir Sena and Kim Chen Yin, Indian politics Mahatmo Gandhi, American Presidents Donald Trampa and Barak Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Sindzo Abee, South Korean President Pak Khan Hi, President of Indonesia, Jacob Vido and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as indicated in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
Publications from the first category are removed by summary administrators and may be withdrawn by the user's blockade.
Not too strict is the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited by TikTok algorithms.
ByteDance representatives told The Guardian that these rules were old and no longer applicable: "We are now using a localized approach, as well as attracting independent local specialists."
The Russian users of TikTok have no specific publication restrictions, as told by the developer of the Procuring Centre of Boddanov.
The Procurator Center is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All the advertising materials of the Procuring Centre are in agreement with the representatives of the sect, but user materials can be placed without agreement.
On whether TikTok can talk about politics or Putin, the gods are responding positively and say that he has seen such publications.
The founder of Our Digital Roman Zaripov's agency agreed with Goddanov: “The basic rules for TikTok users are set out in the User Agreement: there cannot be a shocking content that discriminates against statements and so on.”
Under these rules, however, any content that does not like moderators may be subject to the observation of Zaripov.
Zaripova is another Russian partner, TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of whom are younger than 18 years of age.
According to the User Agreement, only persons under 13 years of age can use TikTok.
The system administrators check their age with the help of artificial intelligence: neurality analyzes the person and determines how many years a person looks, says Goddans.
If the user decides that the user is younger, his account can be removed, it will be added.
According to RBC, ByteDance opened its office in Moscow in September 2019 in the WeWork covoring territory.

According to him, any country that wishes to enter the North Atlantic Alliance has a duty to meet certain conditions in order to comply with specific standards, writes RT.
In Crimea, they proposed a green alternative course in NATO

"Barcelona" salutes Nimara
The Spanish Barcelona and its former Brazilian football player Neymar are trying to win a financial dispute that arose after the defeat of the French Paris St. German attack.
The case was almost brought to court, but the Catholics suggested that the game be resolved without the involvement of Femida.
Otherwise they will reject him in return.
Nemir and his brother, also a Brazilian agent, took an interesting focus: according to the Barsa agreement, which he signed in 2016, he had to receive EUR 40 million.
However, it was written a year later in the IPG for recorded EUR 222 million.
Nevertheless, he has received 22 million Catalans, and now he wants to remove the remaining 18.
In a short time, legal Brazilians insist that the club should still have a percentage for the payment period.
When it became known in the capital of Catalonia about the claims of Nemara, Barcelona made a request.
The Sine-Grantics insist that the bonus is based on the full implementation of the contract from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club considers the game to be a quarter of EUR 40 million and requires the return of the proportion of the first payment.
But it's most interesting that in the summer, Niemar and Barsa had almost agreed to return the "infamous" game to Catalonia.
It is true, the deal has failed, but the hope of the return of the forum remains.
And here, as Sports.Ru reports, referring to the insatiers, the legal club said to the game representatives that if the issue of financial claims was not settled, it would exclude the possibility of a Brazilian return.
Nemir himself wants to return so much that he asked for guarantees that the Catholics would buy him back.

How to increase future pension and not to re-process
It is possible to pay pensions not only to the IMF but also to non-governmental pension funds.
NPF is private companies, reporting on the Volgograd truth.ru.
They work as a contribution: you make contributions, the fund invests them, and in time it returns your money with interest.
If you are interested in this approach, you have begun to study information on the NPF on the Bank of Russia.
All funds are working on the same rules as federal laws.
Pension balls can be purchased under the law.
The number of missing balls depends on how many years you don't have to pay for a pension.
This approach is appropriate for those who have worked informally.
In addition, contributions can be made to your relative, for example, for a wife-home.
Recommendation for those thinking about retirement at the beginning of their work journey.
The increased amount of pension payments is received by staff of staff, doctors, teachers, agricultural workers and people who have worked for a certain number of years in the region of the North.
In order not to give up on you when you are old, take care of it earlier.
Buy real estate, money, precious books, deposit money.
Above all, always increase your financial literacy.

Three Mass Disorders
"The Moscow case" against the participants of the summer protest action is far more significant than that it falls on certain fragments and loses political satisfaction.
The evidence of the fact that “massary irregularities” is not subject to checks, but in the absence of a political decision, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the removal of charges.
The disintegration of the case should inspire society, but the conviction would leave the most disintegration of the forces whose efforts to fill the case by figures and evidence were in vain.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of the three remaining in the case of vaccinated v. 212 (mass orders) - Alexei Minyailo was unexpectedly released from custody without any obligations, and a few more hours later and all rehabilitated: the CPR has withdrawn his charges.

Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help to prolong youth?
Phytoandrogen's subject is under investigation.
One of the most famous is a drummer.
And here phytoestrogens are carefully studied and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain diseases associated with age (including heart disease, some types of cancer).
The known sources of phytoestrogens are all baboons (the most popular salt), hamel, seed wool.
In addition, many experts believe that such BADs cannot be fully replaced by natural hormones.

The Hydrometh Centre called the faithful people ' s notes
In Russia there are many folklores where people are trying to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
At the Hydrometh Center, all the notes that were working were checked.
Meteorologists have come to the conclusion that only two of them can really be trusted in a short-term review.
As the scientist-in-Chief of Rome, Roman Wilfand, said, if the sun is bright in time of arrival, the next day will truly be as bright as our predecessors have noticed.
And if the sky were to be rent asunder, the next day there would be rain.
The second working note is based on bird monitoring.
They're talking about bats when they fly low, it's usually raining.
It is simply explained that when the air is large, the males are forced to push their wings, and the spinal cord is forced to fall to the ground, says the TAS.

The Petrobras State oil company, which was transferred to the analysis of the samples found, stated that they did not, according to their composition, meet the oil obtained from locations in the territory of Brazil.
"It's hot oil.
It may be removed from one of the vessels after the tank has been cleaned.
Many continue to do so.
It was almost in the ocean," said the Brazilian news portal G1, coordinator of the oil union workers of the state of Pernambuku and Paraiba Rojério Almeida.
He also added that, despite the ban on this practice, many ships continue to waste waste in the open sea.
In the beaches of four of the eight affected states in the north-east, environmental defenders discovered nine seabeds full of oil-covered clay.
And only two of them survived.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Institute of Environment, together with Petrobras, will begin cleaning contaminated beaches.
As long as the institution's experts recommend that tourists and local residents treat oil on the fifth side and notify all known contamination.

The Russians have nothing to do with retirement - B. Matthewnko
The speaker of the Federation of Valentina Matwienko believes that the growth does not have sufficient savings to fully develop a draft law on guaranteed pension products in the country.
The practice of increasing pensions through personal savings in the world is quite widespread.
Another case, as long as it's time for us.
"In my view, a large part of the population now has income, which they simply have to give up on the increase in pensions in the future," said B. Matvienko.
The Russians, in the opinion of the speaker, cannot understand the mechanisms for making and calculating pensions, as “permanent changes in this area have led to an end.”
This does not mean that I am opposed to improving the pension system governed by its legislation.
"Russia is a social State, and we have to do everything we can to improve the size of pensions, the social protection of citizens.
But steps should be taken in this direction to be reasonable, responsible, taking into account parental realities," said B. Matvienko, RIA News.
The Chief of Staff stressed that if this initiative (the draft law on guaranteed pension product) was to be developed, a number of basic principles, including voluntary, tax preferences for citizens and employers and the strict guarantee and responsibility of the State to ensure the preservation of pension savings, should be required.
On 6 September, the Ministry of Finance announced that the draft law on guaranteed pension products (GDP) had been approved.
Among its main elements are the only voluntary arrangements for the admission of citizens to the collection system, the preservation of long-term pensions by citizens by the State, the registration of pension accounts by the central administrator, the tax benefits for business and tax payments for citizens.

The expert told me why I should give up tea in the packages.
A group of Canadian scientists representing the University of McGill found that a five-minute glass package of tea fell to more than ten billion microplastic particles.
The packaged drink may also add portions of the pill, said the National News expert on food safety Elizabeth Tikhonov.
According to agronomism, the consumer cannot obtain reliable information about the composition of a packaged tea. The manufacturer may add ingredients that will not be included in the package.
At the end of the season, the beans are not excavated, so they can be in tea.
"But the packages do not always include tea plants," Tigonov said.
She said that it would be better to refrain from using such a drink for the benefit of the tea for entertainment that is sold in specialized stores.
In addition, she stressed that the danger of packaging tea is not only in composition but also in the way it is produced, the micro-organisms are burning at high temperatures and can therefore start to dispose of harmful substances.
"The best way to get a clean green or black tea is to drink less than any supplement," said the expert.

Regionals have been invited to share business support secrets
As the Parliamentary Journal was known, on 27 September, the Chairman of the Federation's Economic Policy Committee, Andrey Kuttov, sent a letter to the Minister for Economic Development, Maxim Orechkin, and Minister of Finance, Anton Siluanov, on the initiative of the Federation ' s entities to improve legislation in the field of support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SME).
For setting up interregional links
The United Nations Economic Policy Council Committee of the Federation shared information from regions on the ongoing business development and legalization programmes of self-employed persons, as well as on the results of such programmes.
In their letters, the region had told the senators about the development of SMEs and had made proposals to improve the existing legislation.
“To date, the communication between regions has not been sufficiently established, as a result of the lack of information on regional enterprise development programmes in the country as a whole has been identified by the enterprise community in all the regions of the visit to the senators,” notes Andrey Kutov.
In the annex to the letter addressed to the Government, he presented a summary of the positive work of the regions on self-employment legislation and the consolidated data from the regions with proposals and problems (recorded).
In addition to the profiles ministries, composite data from the regions are also addressed to regional executive authorities.
The exchange of information on positive work in the regions could provide insights into the overall development of entrepreneurship.
The first step towards such an exchange will be to send information to the Economic Policy Committee, said the Senator of the Parliamentary Journal.
Practical experience
Today, in many regions, support programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises have been adopted and successfully implemented.
For example, in the Voloyear area, the Business Support Centre operates, which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in the certification of ready-made products.
In the Ivanov area, a business support system was developed to implement the principle of one window through multifunctional centres.
In the Middle East, agricultural consumer cooperatives are provided with loans from foreign budgets.
In the Orlov area, the center of cluster development operates.
The Amurian area under the federal project “Accessment of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises” provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators created on the basis of active non-governmental corolling centres through the federal budget.
In a number of other regions, special support for youth is being taken.
The lonely keep out of the darkness
In the view of regional authorities, a number of amendments to the current legislation should be made to support small and medium-sized enterprises more effectively.
For example, the Algerian area suggested that the term "self-employment" be replaced with "own-initiative activities", since it was "most appropriate to the content of public services for the promotion of the self-employment of unemployed citizens".
In the area of Ivanov, it was considered necessary to make amendments to the list of activities of self-employed citizens, including the type of operation and repair of living rooms, tax facilities, physical training activities.
The Brian area considers it important to strengthen control of poor dairy producers through the Mercuria veterinary system.
In the Costa Rica and Magadan areas, however, the concept of "social enterprise" and the direction of support for social enterprise are strengthened in the field of law.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of public support programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises, and most importantly, development will be achieved in the form of specific legislation.
“All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of public support programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be the development of specific legislation,” confirmed Andrey Kuttov.

Sanctions in Russia fell 100 times
In the RF Governments, the supply of agricultural and food supplies in Russia from countries under the Russian food embargo has decreased more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to President Vladimir Putin by President Vladimir Putin, 31 thousand tonnes of products against 3 442.2 thousand tonnes for the same period were imported from the sanctions countries in the first half of 2019.
The value of the imported product decreased to $226.5 million from $4 billion 975.5 million respectively.
This is about supplies of goods that did not fall under the embargo.
As indicated in the report, the quantities prohibited from imports of products were compensated for increased imports from the SNG countries, Africa, South-East Asia and Serbia.
We recall that by the end of August, the Government extended until 31 December 2020 the period of action of the rules on the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and foodstuffs that were prohibited from import into Russia in contraventions.
The document on the official legal information portal noted that the period of action of the rules was extended for another year from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
The provisions on the destruction of sanctions were extended to production from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Subsequently, on 13 August 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein, on 1 January 2016, Ukraine, joined the list.
The Road Convention on the Elimination of Unlawful Imports into the "Sanctions" country (products falling under the food embargo, which was imposed by Moscow in response to the anti-virus sanctions in the West) entered into force in 2015.
In turn, the Government has allowed for the destruction of “sanctionary” food in any legal way.
As the Western sanctions were maintained, the FF also extended its responses.
In addition, the measure does not apply to products imported by citizens for personal use.
The prohibition does not apply to imports of goods for personal consumption up to 5 kilograms.
However, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr. Michael Fedotov, earlier called the destruction of food products “simply immorally” and that, he said, had a negative impact on people’s education.
In addition, in early June, the Rosporembnavigor launched an initiative to prohibit the destruction of food suitable for use.
The Government then made similar recommendations to the Human Rights Council with the President of the RF.
And Deputy Prime Minister RF Alexei Gordeev said that the destruction of food products was wrong and should consider how to use them for appointment by assessing quality.
