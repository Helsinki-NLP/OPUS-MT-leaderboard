Parliament did not support an amendment to release Tymoshenko
Today, the Parliament of Ukraine has rejected the proposal to reject the amendment of the Criminal Code section in which the opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko is condemned.
The amendment would open doors to the excretion of the Minister, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the alleged signature of an agreement with Russia on natural gas purchase for Ukraine.
The judgment is not yet confirmed, the appeal court has the duty to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political advantage of the regime, and even in the West there were doubts about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Penal Code, which condemned the former Prime Minister, was supported by 147 votes in favour.
226 votes were required for its approval.
Libya's Victory
The story of the liberation of the Libyan, or of the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Gadafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without war.
Stop by defining who's the winner
As usual in the region, Islamists have won the elections, but now they are trying to diluctate whether they are moderate or radical
The Transitional National Council has introduced the traditional law, which we already know in a certain way.
Libya will become a country without crime, because the thieves will be cut off.
Women can now go on forgetting to emancipate themselves and the apostles waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of the person of the dictator, society, composed of three wars, will be united by the Qur'an.
In Libya there will be an order that we can't even imagine and that we certainly can't.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best and probably did not agree with the libel already mentioned.
The truth is that it is not surprising that Islamic fighters will accept the help of faithless dogs.
The only justification was that, from its point of view, NATO's attacks did not lead them to a general U.S., but to a great God, whose greatness followed each of the successful interventions.
When winners are sought in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are caught in a shootout of which Islamists and our politicians are serving to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political alliance without guarantees of benefits.
After the recent poor experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not deal with Libya militaryly.
In this case, the locals do not have a problem getting rid of the "crazed"
But, without occupation, will the oil be made with the Libyan black gold only with good words?
It is quite possible not, but it may be that the West can ultimately claim to protect human rights.
Whenever the followers of the Sharia don't cross us.
Starts a new era of crisis
France and the rest of Europe go to the hunt of the investor searcher
A statistical toll has been extended by Europe
Individual States have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the interquatrimester period has grown, while France and Germany have grown.
However, today's bonus market has been recorded.
Investors are no longer established only in Italy, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
Statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates of economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
Both countries have made the data public in the second quarter, in Germany it has improved more than expected (up to 0.3% instead of 0.1%), although in France a slight reduction of 0.1% (original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% annually in the third quarter of this year.
However, during the interquatrimestral period, gross domestic product (PIB) has been suspended, and according to the ČSU, the trend towards gradual deceleration in economic development is inconsistencies.
The results are even worse than the estimates of analysts.
Main events:
In the interim, the Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year, but it has four-quarters.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to the data previously calculated on a stand-alone basis, increased by 0.5%.
The eurozone economy, as well as the European Union, grew by 0.2% between July and September and compared with the previous quarter, which is consistent with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2% annually.
The interest of its bonds for ten years is 28.45 per cent.
The interest of Italian and Spanish bonds has increased to critical limits.
The problem situation also affects Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The interest in Czech bonds for ten years remains at 4 per cent, although the situation is worsening in the area.
In Germany, votes are raised saying that the ECB should grant loans in the last instance.
Checks are classified for Eurocopa.
They win 1:0 and celebrate the classification with a first 200 million.
The football team completes with the toughest comet ever!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Czech and bright port Petr Jiráček, the victory was given for 1:0.
The Czech team, together with a good dose of luck at the second time, defended the attacks of the local team so that it would not miss the mark of the European champion.
IHNED.cz followed in detail the development of the party in a meaningful report.
There was almost no emotion in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second half.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the end, as well as the excellent game of Čech and the hero Jiráček, won by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrated its passage to the European Championship.
Because of the correct Czech defence, the mountainers did not press until the second half.
The two victims of the party were Damjanovic and Vučinič, who were allowed to pass two large occasions.
In addition, thanks to the great Petr Čech, the Czech eleven will not miss the anniversary of the European Cup, so the ships of the national football will get a graffiti of about 200 million crowns.
It's been a good offense since the first minutes.
Both teams engaged only in maintaining the lines and played nothing more around the center of the field.
There was no pressure on local players in the first half, due to the other field in defence, just what the defence is supposed to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They formed a human escort.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
They want to express their support for the country's nuclear programme before a possible Israeli attack.
The students began to pray on Tuesday morning before the facilities and then went to the U.S. and Israel death slogans.
A number of hundreds of university students trained on Tuesday in the Iranian city of Isfahan human sculptures around the nuclear technology center in which they work with uranium.
They intend to demonstrate that they are willing to defend their country's nuclear programme with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, noted that Iran, according to all indications, is seeking nuclear weapons.
In Israel there is a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began to pray on Wednesday before the Isfahan nuclear facilities and then launched death slogans against the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack, whose aim would be to parallel the Iranian nuclear programme, it would be achieved, according to Israeli sources, not only the centre of Isfahan, but also the installations of Nathanz, where uranium is enriched.
Daily menu of an obese child: do not dissipate and dried dinner
More than a third of children aged between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, with over 9 per cent of the school population and obesity at 5%.
Obese children come in most families with a life-style that is not healthy, according to current research.
The importance of the environment in which it grows for the healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference, is once again demonstrated.
At the table, obese children, for example, are fed with at least twice the usual weight of children in families.
For dinner, more than 19% of the obese had eaten fries the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "Obey is not a coincidence".
In families of children with overweight, there is no practice for sports, which is applicable to most families today, where only 15 per cent of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey conducted in 900 children
The survey was carried out at the end of last school year, and nearly 900 basic education children from all over the Czech Republic participated in the same study.
It was already the second edition of the program "The Obesity is not a coincidence", which supported the General Health Company and the Unilever company.
To date, more than 12 thousand children have participated in the project from 4th to 8th.
An adequate diet and sufficient family exercise are determinants, which significantly reduce the number of children with obesity and even obesity.
"Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five daily meals according to the scheme: breakfast, lunch, lunch, lunch and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," says one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast but with breakfast for dinner
Experts believe that, in a healthy development, it is important, in addition to the details, which they also have, for example, to have a fixed time for family breakfast.
In Chequia, however, only 23 per cent of school families leave at the same time.
In most families, each has its own challenge.
But the worst was to find out that in 10% of the homes there was nothing going on.
Breakfast, however, is the basis for a proper daily diet.
The study shows that in the families of obese children, breast - feeding is more frequent than breast-feeding.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drink to daily sweets (70%).
Generally, more than 40 per cent of the children surveyed, however, this result is reduced to less than half, only 15 per cent.
Make your diet
The next phase of the study enabled the selected couples (204 boys and 172 13 college girls) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children aged between the ages of 12 and 15 from the point of view of healthy food are very far from ideal."
Among its favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets.
"It is particularly alarming about the popularity of sweet refreshments," the final report of the study warns.
As the main food, the palm takes the pasta and keeps looking for the meat of the bird.
In practice, children have always rejected the legume and the taste for fishing and vegetables is very low.
Change to Healthy Habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive accurate information.
"In the study control group, which completed the questionnaire following the completion of the prevention programme "Obey is not a coincidence", an important change was made in favour of the principles of healthy food", focusing on the results of the study.
It draws attention, for example, to the sweet freshness, where many children would begin to prefer normal and current water.
Children would also choose the dog meat and fish for main food more frequently in the questionnaire and would restrict the consumption of sweet food and the derivatives of flour.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, supporting professionals.
In the introduction article, how the estylists learn, I have asked myself a little bit that initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Conferences of three branch professionals, how to wear problem characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of the show.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we are to the final exams, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course develops every Saturday and Sunday, it is no longer possible for an alfiler.
We have once studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) about how to dress a woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And so is the great majority.
Someone's cute, someone's got a stylized figure without the proper curves and someone's suffering too much.
The estylist must be able to gently smooth out a wide range of limbs, expand a neck, or recover the necessary curves
They have given us some tricks on how to highlight the body of women of the type Jennifer López, of huge legs and chains but tight belt and at the same time don't wear it too challenging
If, for example, the difference between the belt and the straps is so large that the slip or the pants do not fit, it is worth at least a piece of extra fabric to measure.
They will certainly not repent, for the garment they feel is perfectly improbable.
With a fall to measure it will feel much better than with someone who doesn't stop moving, get up, dance in the belt, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with velvets, ornaments, bred or worn.
There certainly are many different types of information and bodies, so I am glad that I have every week to order all this information in my head.
And even so, I'm afraid that with the assigned task, I've got more than that.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two famous ones, who will have to design two costumes: one for the day and one for the night.
The current aspect must be taken into account, the fashion style appropriate to the person concerned.
I've been "dressed" to Miranda Kerr, maybe you know the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Crying inside, for me, is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who will have finally weighed a hundred pounds (please take into account exaggeration), or the youngest Selena Gomez.
We need clothes to cut them off from the magazines or look for them online and print them, and then prepare them graphically.
The fashionboard, which is called the complete result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with the graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic aspect of estylism.
The stylist, therefore, not only physically, but also deals with product pages in magazines (for example, on specific topics such as trends, pockets, covers, etc.).
Of all that, the stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us.
But all of this is already for Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three experts encouraged the Saturday conference with information on all types of bodies.
Honza Pokorný estista, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion, and the estylist should know you're out of this.
And a good estylist can work with the same stick to dress in different ways.
Variability is, in this case, essential.
Thus, such gabardin (or, as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed in the classic with varnishes and shirts, but it also serves to wear the naked body with tattoo shoes and photograph it as if it was really a dress.
Or it's enough to tear her down and raise her neck to get a completely different image.
"Judge with it," he insisted.
What is most valuable is the following advice: "To start working, you need to know all the rules first."
"Then you can break them," said Jacob.
Finally, I see why we remember all these formulas, why, why, if it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
That's not talking about the files.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know a estylist has to have more types of clothes in the reserve that he wants to photograph.
So for a fashion history that has ten pages (so, 10 outfits), you have to have ready, lists to use, at least fifteen.
And in addition to the photos the clothes work in combination with other takings, all of them are different to those used in reality.
All of this must take into account the time to design the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and style provide them alone, in many cases, half the success.
Just looking at Madonna, which is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the Marquetin have made it a global star.
In Chequia, for the moment, there is still no clear tendency to use the services of the estillelists.
Even the famous characters also find it useless (I have enough skills, my physical aspect is not so important).
And when someone asks us for our services, it must be borne in mind that it is very likely that they will indicate us a very different size to their actual (minor).
Then you just go and find out if the journals of the heart have already written on the subject, if a certain celebration has been arranged/extended, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted on us not only to guide ourselves in fashion but also to understand outfits.
During his work, most importantly, he must communicate with the people he sees, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he doesn't do anything, he's defending his opinions.
"When a director hires you to classify the dresser and complete it with beautiful picks, you can't take and take everything he had and say, "Today what a horror."
"I find at least a couple of things you can weigh and recommend for someone to put them," says Mario.
He also showed us that everything has to end in the so-called "placovka", that is, the job bag.
This is set around the belt and all the tools needed are there.
They are objects like arrows, such as arrows, cut-offs, or imperceptible. There is also a nylon thread (which serves the stylist during the session of photos of products such as balls or gorges), special pins of hooks in front, if this was bigger (alfilers and other types of traps are not allowed, as they could damage the fabric), or a costume game.
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to cover the soil of shoes.
Even during photo sessions in the study, on a flat surface, the soil could be damaged and much more outside.
And we did nothing but cover and cover.
We couldn't touch the shoes with the arrows so we wouldn't hurt them by accident.
So I had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me the joy of commending my work without reservations.
The truth is, I don't really enjoy those skills.
This is just a small part of everything we've heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I've already realized that dedicating myself to estylism at professional level is not a pink road, but it gives me exactly the same thing people say.
A Need for Speed: The Run competes all over America.
Design
A trip, initially neglected, is complicated due to a number of unnecessary delays of a routine trip during the morning shift.
The expectations were to be met in some way, but this does not serve anything if, in fact, there was no claim to do anything extraordinary.
The new delivery, which is added to The Run, has revealed great expectations before its end.
I promised that I would give new air to the old race set Need for Speed and, as a result of the show, appeared as a game that should not end being a genre of action again.
We are also curious to know how the scenes would remain inserted, where the main character descends from the car and walks by his own foot.
As often happens in the NFS series, the results would not be very much in terms of what we expected.
There are careers that can be given by acceptable ones, but in the total computer, points are lost due to absurd errors, which have been appearing in the series for years.
In fact, mistakes can not even be named, but they are better than the incomprehensible disadvantage of the programmers.
The adventure begins very well.
If you enter into a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has some personal problems; to solve them, you are offered to participate in an illegal career across America.
You sit on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get first to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty roads.
It is therefore deduced that each race has a different path and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite different and interesting.
Thus, one does not have the sense that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasant to view, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to the previous delivery of the series.
So it's nothing in the other world.
But the passage through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high snow covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, careers vary from time to time by a typical element.
Thus, for example, in the desert you will find a sandstorm that reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you must be careful not to bury an avalanche.
According to that, each of the courses is very well developed.
There's only a couple of models, but that's enough.
For a while, try to slow down a number of rivals required (normally in a classic career), then try to win time (croned classic debt) and then wait for a duel against one opponent.
In the middle of all this, the police sometimes appear, which does not make things even more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes out of the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape someone and you have to help him, always pressing the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are quite a few less landscapes in the game of what I would expect (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not get upset and, in the context already mentioned, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows the waves of previous episodes.
That means that today is no longer a big thing, but it can't be said to be bad.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you might already be looking for another one.
But in a race designed with a lot of action it fits enough of this style of conduct, although we can find something better among the games of competition.
So far, it's all right.
But problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correct driving models, the same is no longer happening with collisions.
Of games of this type you can't expect to enjoy complicated deformations and collisions, but actually before an attack on any object, you can't predict how your car will react, which is not everything in order.
It's typical that, when you make a very adjustable advance or cycle the car with a normal traffic, there's only light rocks, but in other almost identical situations, your car is just making uncontrollable pirates.
Even it ended completely destroyed.
Thanks to the immune system, there are no major problems, but it can put us in a bad mood.
The resistors are programmed so that, when you suffer an accident or get out of the track, the game restores you to the last point of rescue on the track.
In each race, however, only five are available.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it's no more than helping if something's not going well, but it's not too hard to trust.
Sometimes, even the restorative help, only helps learn the given stage of memory.
A great success of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, it is necessary to enter in a specific way; otherwise, it is impossible to take.
Sometimes you find 'civil' vehicles in some place always with the same configuration, although you are the first, five or five minutes before or after.
This makes you angry, especially in situations, when you see two cars going to the meeting in opposite directions, your opponent goes ahead without problems, but when you get there, you have to turn or go well.
It's the same as when you get there, because it's programmed because the surprise will always happen in front of your noses.
Opposers also have a more advantage.
During the entire game you will get to places where, without taking into account the moment, the same opponent will always make progress on the same site.
In addition, this happens at the end of the game, at a long point, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at any price.
When you go in front of you, it's difficult for you to see the cars coming forward, so at first you can make the car paper.
The idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspension and adrenaline can be understood, but execution is so apparent that you will surely be disappointed.
And it is a punishment, because although the travel model is simple, the game is fun and action, so it is often impossible to follow the details of what happens anywhere.
And really does the same, if the merit is taken with the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or the classification in the race so that it doesn't end the abuse, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during the race.
You have to be careful with the gas outlets on the side of the road, because just there you have to change from car, although in most cases you'll have enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports is suitable for urban areas, American powerful cars for straight buses and super sports exotics for technical driving, for example, on mountain roads with curves.
In addition, the main narrative figure also appears a figure of parallel challenges, i.e. there are careers in specific places that you will know by history.
Here you will get not only medals, but also points of experience for your profile, which serve both for the challenges and the accounts.
When reaching the top level, the driver opens several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an Autolog function is connected online, comparing your results with those of other players and provides other Community functions.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in history is done.
With the car you reach to the tunnel of the metro (pass), where you will be able to run dark through the roads (pass).
The speed meter marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (passes) and suddenly the train of the metro arrives and takes you forward without further delay.
In the edition we will certainly have a discussion on this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game no one thought a little or if the real authors take us for a bunch of bugs.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the overall visual effects result in most pleasant cases, sometimes up to the top.
It is, therefore, important that, in the most tense times, the quality of image is reduced and, at times, seriously.
This affects particularly the accidents where many participants are involved, when the quality of image is no longer valid.
The audio is good and the sound band is a question of taste.
In order to be pleased with most of the youth group, the sound band belongs to the category "each of its father and mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game only for their music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is quite confused.
If the game avoids absolutely fine errors, we would have problems claiming that The Run is the best game of NFS in recent years.
Gives the feeling that the game is not over.
The fun is assured, but prepared because mistakes will strike you in the eyes with the strength of airport reflectors.
The hearts of the Carolina University will participate in the "Students of Terciopelo" concert.

Ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation for negatives and Eurosceptics.
"The Treaty of Lisbon has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I didn't expect a war without a quarter."
"It will take five, six years before the situation becomes a bit stable, calm, and new players get used to their new roles," the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová, began his conference with conviction at the Law College.
How to avoid serious "clear and open about Europe", which he said at the first part of his conference, when he was able to describe each EU body and its relations with this accuracy and clarity, as it would be the envy of many conferenceers from the U. Carolina College of Law.
Vice-President Herman van Rompuy also took stock of the work of the new permanent President of the European Council:
"The first comes up criticism, that if it's insulin, a gray officer can assume any role, but I have to say that he left all the disagreers, because he takes their roles to perfection."
"He is a man who can listen to the members of the twenty-nine states, communicate with them and has a clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new post of representative of the Foreign and Security Policy explains from the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" It is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of the political union towards States such as China or India.
No one wants to ban Olomouc's cheese.
Vicenová has also taken up the next agenda, followed by and will follow the European Council in the future.
The Czech Presidency was a success two years ago.
The Czechs took care of the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Association.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected Chequia.
Czech representation in the EU currently has many commitments.
In the Ambassador's words, "a good algorithm", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is now being dealt with.
On the other hand, it is necessary to adopt the budget for the EU for seven years, caused by the current economic situation, much more complicated.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive more support and which will be less? That is something that will be present in the next meeting.
The Ambassador also recalled its main themes, with which he came to Europe: "About Europe with clarity".
"The truth is, I don't like fake abbreviations, foreignism or jokes that people don't understand."
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels the puppies are not really invented by curved or round puppies, plates of different sizes or that no one will forbid us from the smell of Olomouc?"
He also wants to bring more benefits from the EU environment and to draw closer to more Czech citizens to European institutions.
We are waiting for Europe of Speeds
According to the ambassador, the Czechs are famous for Eurosceptics and people are better aware of the negative aspects than the positives.
He also regretted the low participation of Czechs in the European institutions.
The guilt is of a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivation messages, but also the lack of support from the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, it highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Group of Visegrad.
"Believe me that when a Polish and Hungarian come to me and I get close to a Slovak, a Frenchman on my side says to me, "What have you left, the Visegrad Group?" and it is seen that he does not give any thanks."
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenová, looks forward to new strict budgetary policy regulations for the Member States.
It is perceived as a very real thing of the concept of both speeds, if not more, in Europe than the new "European Federation".
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
"It has been said for the first time that only the countries that want and who don't, are cooperating outside."
"These procedures will be increasingly and will strengthen Europe of both speeds," Vicenová is expected.
In this regard, it also highlighted the role of Chequia and Herman van Rompuy in applying the principle, whereby all topics affecting the whole of the EU should be discussed between Member States, not only between members of the Eurozone.
Brand history:
The innovative IBM starts its second century of existence
If someone were looking for a term that would accurately define the IBM strategy, the closest would be "long-term".
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is now known as a company and, however, has been through thousands of years since its foundation.
The basis of this longplacent character was laid by the first head of the firm, visualist Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He has already pointed out that many of the world's problems have a solution if people are willing to think.
His title "Think!" became his seal, around which he will build the life of the giant future (also the title of an internal magazine that IBM started publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully raised company culture.
"For us IBM involves a long-term thought, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for hundreds of years for that reason, because he remained faithful to his basic principles, but without fear of the changes around him.
This has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to make further progress in our second century," he said during his anniversary, the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmsano.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in his 30s, was concerned about the care of his employees as the Bața entrepreneur in Chequia (the IBM employees were among the first US operators who enjoyed paid holidays, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated pay system that awarded the best investors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication maintains IBM in relation to the client.
Since the beginning, the company has been supposed to discover talents (by being one of the first global companies to end with any kind of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
On the line of the anti-discrimination strategy is the current IBM plan, so Palmisano will replace it the year a woman comes: Virginia Rometty.
She has been working for thirty years in IBM, where she has been chief sales, marketing and strategies.
Over the last few years IBM has participated in what are called virtual encounters, a flood of online ideas, which arise from the infinity of future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that they have ideas, since almost half a million people work in the company.
A good reputation institution
The business position provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of an institution more than of a technological company," says Harvard Business School economist and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technological company, but a company trying to solve business problems for technology users," commented George Colony of Forrester Research consultant Forrester.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering into business and creating a business directly.
IBM - or the "Green Green" - as it is known in the U.S. family due to its logo has become one of the world's largest companies in the past century.
It is possible that the most Versatile Technology Company ( it develops equipment, as well as programs, infrastructures and web housing services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
The largest number of patents from all North American technology companies and five of their employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among its inventions are automatic cashiers, pay cards, financial permutations, bar codes and discounts.
IBM will bill $22 billion this year. This year has become the second market capitalization technology firm (the first is Apple), when it first exceeded Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations just satisfied the customer's taste and time (IBM did not stop by its own operating system, OS/2, online services Prodigy or IBM PCjr computers).
"If his business is based on progress, he cannot be emotionally shaken in the past," admitted Samuel J. Palmsano.
Therefore, IBM has no problems building its foundations on other platforms (and also, if they do not work, leave them).
And that's the difference of competition, Microsoft, which basically keeps and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Future Technology
In terms of sales, IBM is dedicated mainly to services, of which about one fifth are programme and another five teams.
However, in 1990 the teams represented more than half the number of suppliers.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets at a total value of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis first appeared.
IBM acts according to his first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who, during the great economic crisis of 29, increased investments.
It seems that until now IBM has been able to understand the crisis.
The value of IBM's actions from the beginning of 2008 has increased strategically to 120 per cent, and the company's net profit has not been increased.
The IBM currency is to change everything except its value.
It can therefore be expected that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will grow.
History of IBM: from cheese cutter to space flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, being its original name Computing Tabulation Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was already adopted in 1924 - it was originally a brand used in Canada and South America.
The basis given to IBM's birth stems from the merger of four companies which are restructured in the 1880s.
He owned inventions such as the famous "fichaar relays" that enabled him to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also presided over his supervisory board until 1930.
Flint turned to the head of a competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help with the management of the company.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (Watson's ideas continue to be the firm basis on which corporate culture and identity are supported).
Watson directed the company until 1952.
IBM, as indicated by its name, began production and sale of all types of equipment for business, from meat cutters and cheese to registered boxes.
During the first four years that Watson directed the company, the billing doubled to $9 million and began the large expansion of the company by continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, almost forty years later, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its direction, IBM began working in the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide flights to the area (in Mercurio, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "paces" that established the standard of computers at that time came to the market with the name of IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer full advice and services of added value.
The strategy that IBM has paid for these three years is the concept Smarter Planet, that is, "a smarter planet".
Its aim is to make a more rational use of technology, although the areas have not yet been planned and the circumstances, for example, have improved in relation to transport and administration of cities.
For the trade sector, IBM presented not long ago the "Smart Trade" platform that allows minorities to manage the full commercial cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
In 1932 he opened a branch office in Czechoslovakia then, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates the strategic externalization centre in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. There is also a world-famous research team working with voice recognition.
Reuters about de su Marido infiel:
Iveta, stay in that hole, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Richter (53) says it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtár (53) had become the only protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina continued to hope that Joseph would wake up from his red dream and return home.
However, it will no longer wait and has set clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can come home, but not as my partner anymore," Richtárová explained.
When Darina Rychtářá welcomed Bartošove during the summer in her home, she could not imagine how she would end her marriage.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after Ríčany and Pepe did not leave the singer.
He even publicly declared he loved her.
In time, Darina was reappointed, apparently accepted her husband’s relationship and was even dismissed from him forever.
The Rychittar doesn't care who cares about his wife.
If one day Rychtár broke up with Bartoshová, his wife wouldn't wait for him at home with the open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will fail."
"But here I would live not as much as my dear and old dirty who made mistakes, but as a man who binds me with certain ties," said Rychtárová and added that she had already been disfellowshipped from her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Joseph still doesn't care if his wife has locked the door behind him.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change."
"My wife established this as a marriage over the role and I respect it."
"The company remains in force, I make house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the house, I buy."
"Darina and I usually talk to us, the only thing we don't share a bed is that we don't share a bed," said Rychtár.
If the Richter found a new love, he wouldn't object.
"We don't sleep together and she doesn't care where she's going or if she's got any news.
I know it's my fault, I love Iveta and take all responsibility," concludes Joseph.
The worst vices of women: Are they also referring to you?
If you ask men who are capable of citing some typical vices of women, they will generally be appointed by each of them without any thought.
Dear women, do you recognize in the following lines, where are certain female vices that are capable of producing blood to the veins?
Go to Purchase
Do you blame him for his average orange that depends on the purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one suit a week?
Do you like to buy often on the discounts?
Then in your case it can be said that shopping has become a vice.
Some women are aware that they should be appalled by the purchases, at least a little.
But to see, what woman could resist the temptation to walk away from the clothes store, look for well-adjusted picks and then try them all in the probator (in all different colors)?
Although most women go shopping is a period of time, men can be virtually converted into a hell.
Just remember how many times he told his mate that it was better to wait in front of the door.
The constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"It would take at least five kilos - should you start exercising?"
"Do you really like it?"
Don't you hear these phrases?
What is it?
Then she's one of those women who's obsessed with her aspect.
It's not that you have to stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to listening to your spouse complain all the time about your physical appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the more the frequency of complaints increases, the more difficult women become.
The order and cleanliness first
It's like an infinite uncle.
Clean the windows, pass the elevator, dry the floor, remove the dust, freeze the bathroom, and all of that at least twice a week.
Does he complain to his mate that he has washed his clean soil with a succulent foot, to his children who have wiped out a newly cleaned laundry and a glass stand with glass doors that so much cost him cleaning?
In case you suffer this "development", try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should certainly not be taken as primary in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten their relationships and family well-being.
Make Unfavorable Comments
"The shoes used are left with dirty clothes."
"You want to put those calcetins used tomorrow too."
"He's moved to the ground!"
If he makes these comets to his mate more than once a day, he knows he'll get him out of his castles.
You don't mean anything wrong, you just want to make it all right.
Perhaps, if men were to suspect this, women would not make so much comments.
Crimes and Crimes
Some women are also subjected to abuses, chisms, but also abuses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk together about things like who, where, who, how and why.
To the best of each of us sometimes you get away with a small and harmless chisme.
With the hand in the heart, this is almost all the women.
On the other hand, there are chismous women of those who do not control, whom they like to chismour and do so often, they despise everyone and they become dangerous to those around them, especially in a female working team.
Jágr and Varáček helped with their assistance to win the Philadelphia
Jágr's hockey leader, Jaromír Jágr, attended the NHL meeting on Monday with two assistances that brought the victory over Philadelphia 5:3 in Carolina's corner and again put Czech players in the front of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giraux took advantage of the 39-year-old star's game, and took a step further and was declared the best player of the game.
Two assistance was provided in the party as well as Jágr's partner, Jakub Voráček.
After the meeting, Jágr said to the journalists that Giroux had preached a great night.
"Before the party I had told you I'd do triple."
"I presented it."
"Sometimes they seem confused," explained Jágr, after his performance gave him a bullet to Giroux, due to the first trace of the Flyers.
A short time later the second team's intervention also had a Czech trace.
Voráček made it with the disc behind the Hurricans port and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, which put the gol.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but since the beginning of the second part they have dominated the Flyers.
Especially by Giroux.
After working with Jágr put the third floor, after his shooting was stopped by Wayne Simmonds' room.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't mean to be the best singer of the song, but there's no doubt between the three best," Jagr pointed to his center.
"Never would have happened to me that at the end of my career I was going to play with a athlete like him."
"I'm very satisfied with that."
"I want to play for him."
All these years in NHL, my friends played for me, and that now produces results," Jagr adds.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with the goal of Tuom Rutu and then again of Dwyer, from prison, until he got to a goal of distance.
Matt Read did not allow any more complications, although they ended up in number two against one.
"Pronger had a good act in our field."
"I lost the disc, I took speed, and Read went to the farthest part."
"I'm trying to get you to the disc and I'm happy because I got it," Voráček described the last goal of the party as he lived.
With its victory, Philadelphia has become the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech champion of Montreal, Jaroslav Špaček, did not play until the end of the party against Buffalo, and the second third was removed by an injury in the upper part of the body.
The Canadians not only lost a player with a lot of defense experience, but also for a difference of two, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec is not supposed to use one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local trainer complained of the large number of injuries in the last row, and playing the game only with five defenses.
"That's bad."
"We only play the game with a veteran player, the rest were new."
"At last, but it's not possible to do anything against that, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"We couldn't resist it as long as the players turned against us."
"We had to simplify the game even more, get the disc out of our field."
"And so let's leave eggs," explained one of the defenses, P. K. Subban.
Ondréj Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg interventions to the victory of 5:2 on Tampa Bay.
Jets' throats were marked by five players who ended up in a series of winnings that were already five parties.
How Travel Prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies then sold in most cases only to the socialist block, as travel to the West was very restricted.
Czech tourists therefore took vacations on the beaches of the RDA (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) in Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslavia regime moved to the west and the travel of Czech tourists was then quite limited.
A great barrier to socialism was the fact that citizens of the socialist block (i.e. also the Czechoslovakian people) were not allowed to travel freely and individually, not even by socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, if not, the individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered trips to the West in those days, but one had to put on the hill with a bag of sleep and spend the same night, or have "good-known" in the agency.
Still not everything was won.
The so-called "change promise" that was the condition for Western travel was not granted to the "politically less reliable agent", who could not travel in absolute terms.
The Czechoslovakian currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without the guarantee of change, it was not possible to obtain resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
Most of the Czechs had their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of caravans and summer houses, which the Czechs would buy. This custom still persisted.
The way the Czechs travel has suffered a genuine revolution since 1989.
While it was not until 1989 that the holidays in the RDA or Bulgaria were no more, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million vacation trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, from which today we are no longer aware, the fact that the current favorite destination, Croatia, was unable to travel freely until 1989, because it was part of Yugoslavia from then on.
At the beginning of the 1990s, visa exemption was imposed to travel to the neighbouring states of Western Europe, resulting in a huge amount of short-term visits, particularly in Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, did not see a map of the journeys to the West, everyone wanted to see it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, checkout groups in the parks in the countryside shops were slept, as our income did not allow us to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the checks of that time was to bring with you the food (conservatives, embutes, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so our tourists were finally able, after decades, to buy free Western currency.
Our standard of living also increased the average wages with him, which caused an increase in travel demand about 1997.
With the increase in travel demand, agencies began, from 1997 on a regular basis, to prepare trips using charter flights, which made the prices of travel in comparison with the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts by passenger volume.
At the end of the 90th century, the Czechs had already traveled almost all the developed countries, except the United States, which made our journeys even more simple.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism took place in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from Chequia to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists have taken place. This winter will already fly directly from Chequia to 12 exotic destinations.
The exotic countries are currently visiting about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this time, which symbolizes our post-conflict development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the U.S. removed visas for Czech tourists, with what our country had become among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, have spent abroad on trips to over 15,000 Czech crowns per head, including expenses at the station.
Called the General Assembly to elect the President, which could end again at a dead end.
For almost five months, the Czech football is no president and Ivan Haszek's successor as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) will not be known after the next General Assembly is convened to take place this Thursday in Nymburg.
In fact, an agreement has not yet been reached on the voting rules to be followed.
Without it, no vote will be taken even to choose between the three candidates.
Interested in chairing the Czech football is Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hashek gave up his job in June not without calling his colleagues with a view to finding a strong person who might be able to take care of football in the future.
However, after the completion of the Hashek era, a dispute arose between the two association federations unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evident on 16 September when the new president had to be elected.
Delegations of the General Assembly met in a van in the National House (Národní dóm), located in the village of Smíchov, because the talks had been blocked and not only about the method of election.
No consensus was reached, nor was it about who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or even delegates with full powers.
From then on and due to this only point, a partial agreement was made, also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, which states that full representation is not possible.
However, the debate on the electoral code remains open.
More light on the situation could no longer be drawn from the Executive Committee that, at its meetings, ordinary or extraordinary, it had essentially not resolved anything.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a few times already, but the neural point is still the same.
The question is: How do we proceed in the third round to avoid the point of death?
"The debate revolves around whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or to find another model," says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who, from the direction of the association, represents the professional football.
According to the proposed model in the statutes, the third round will win that candidate who has a higher percentage of support in the federation to which he will submit his application.
The Moravia Region is willing to make a commitment so that it can win that candidate with a larger total vote in both federations.
The Bohemian party, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentages, should have at least two thirds.
"This would, however, remove the meaning of the two previous rounds and completely deny the concept of the bicameral system," it is as Svoboda understands the arguments of the party living, so that it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
It is surprising that it is also in agreement with Tomaš Paclik, although it is assumed that the electoral regulation established by the statutes of all candidates is more suitable for Pelta.
"I would like to vote to the highest level in accordance with the statutes."
"In order to avoid any suspicion of representatives such as the last General Assembly," said Victoria Plzen's owner, who was first called for as a candidate and who directed his comments mainly against Pelta.
She's still an optimist.
According to him, Nymburg will decide on the new president and he believes that future candidates will work constructively.
"All passions will be filled with the party of our national team at the European Championship today.
"The football will become a protagonist again, and thus will be more cooperative," said the representative of Jablonice, who has more experience in football management at both professional and regional level.
Rajchl is the most reticent.
"I hope an agreement is reached, but unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated."
"It's not about the conflict between bohemians and Muslims, but there's an attempt to adjust the rules to their own agreement."
"This may result in a new blockage of the General Assembly."
"In any way, I hope the common sense will be imposed," said Rajchl.
It won't be long before all parties reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who could know until the game starts if the football team is complete?
The special aircraft, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, including the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not leave this morning for technical problems in Prague, having to find an alternative to transport to the Executive Committee to the place where the classification party will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting could eventually be the one that will take place at ministerial level, which, they say, will be held on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would love to include the parties divided into the country's most powerful sports organization in order to reach an agreement.
There is a lot in play: state subsidies, football credibility and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czech Federation of Sport (ČSTV) that will try to get a new direction to Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazka Lotteries House.
Paclik will fight for the presidency, because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of Pilsen footballists, Tomaš Paclik, prior to the extraordinary General Assembly, knew the name of an appropriate candidate who would satisfy all his ideas on the new President of the Czech Federation of Fútbol (FAČR), he would not be presented as a candidate at such a relevant position.
"If there had been an appropriate person, I would be fighting for her and not presenting me as a candidate to the elections."
"But until today no such person has been found," said Paclik to the Czech News Agency (ČTK)
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the supposed winner of the elections, which opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Federation of Football (FAČR).
Paclík also points out that, in the event of a victory, he would only remain in the position of President until 2013, when he would arrive at the turn of the ordinary General Assembly.
In that regard, you would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too related to football events.
"I've already talked to some people I might have in mind."
"For me it was a joke to hear some say that at this moment they don't even want to identify themselves with the Czech football."
"I'd like to change that vision," he added.
What is most likely more disturbing to Paclik at this time is the relationship of Pelta with the President of the Pilsen Roman Berbr Regional Football Association, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates in the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential seal.
"In case you win, you'd keep the status in place and nothing in the football will change."
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious business man, football will bring even less profit," Paclík said.
It also mentions the fact that some years ago the name of Pelta was associated with a telephone hearing during the investigation of a case of corruption in which Pelta was responsible.
"I don't know what prize the football could bring to the victory of Pelta."
"And with what eyes will the UEFA and the FIFA look at us," said Paclik, who also takes with certain caution his previous statement that "the Pilsen Club would sell if Pelta became president".
In the case of winning the Thursday elections, Paclík could develop cooperation with Pelta in the future.
In the same opinion is the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Paclik before the General Assembly in September which ended in a dispute.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"It's very capable."
"I could imagine it, for example, as head of the representation."
"but not as manager of an association."
"I also do not put the narcisses there where I cannot feel capable," Paclík added, who gave much attention in September to supporting the suspension of the Arbitration Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik admits that he would dare to manage the association.
Use its capacity to manage private companies since last summer is also the Director of Pilsen, who, with his support, held the triumph in the first division in May.
"I have the strength to change some things in football and contribute to your safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of certain pressure groups, which are likely to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations, Paclík said without hiding his antipathies to the President of the Sparta Daniel Krétínský.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it exerted pressure on political leaders so that they could spend more money on the sport of lottery taxes.
"It's one of the key issues the new president should be devoted to."
"If they increase taxes on gambling, as political parties announce, they would support their arguments, but, frankly, they have to tell us where this money is going to end," she said.
In addition, Paclík now does not even take into account his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the president of the FAČR must be "non-participative".
Pelta is currently associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla de Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see any sense in the fact that my actions of the Pilsen Club are hypocritically attributed to another person and then back there after a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised FAČR new statutes that would end with the election's dead spot.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates to the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, in the event of being elected, he would ensure that the FAČR would have new statutes that would definitely address the dispute over the electoral regulation.
The representative of Jablonec is optimistic about the meeting of this Thursday in Nymburg, and believes that the pre-election conflict could advance to a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Prior to the elections that were not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, in the event of being elected, precisely on representation and fund-raising.
He decided to participate in the last minute in the last General Assembly, so this two-month delay could go well for him to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on football management.
"People at all levels are taking care of football for a long time and are waiting to meet this Thursday with the new President."
"We feel that it is time for someone to manage the association," he thinks that he is primarily associated with the Jablonice Club, but that he worked in the Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Association.
For this reason, he thinks he has enough experience to manage the Czech football.
It is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that prevailed in the time of Ivan Hashek.
"Unfortunately, in the General Assembly in June, the statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought were adopted."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September," Pelta warned.
The correct re-adaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a sign for the benefit of delegates.
"If you choose me as president, I will take it as a personal challenge and I am willing to respond if this happens."
"It is a matter of principles, without which we cannot exist," says Pelta.
In addition, in theory, try not to argue with your opponents.
In the past, he had already warned that he would be working with Henry Rajchl, who respects his training in law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first Vice-President.
I had spent a lot of time without attacking Thomas Paclik who, on the contrary of Pelta, did not let his head down.
"He's been in the football world for over a year, and he's already achieved some success."
"Their attacks were embarrassing, and many people were surprised by the electoral campaign."
"That's why many of them doubt their true character," said his opposition Pelta, who is still faithful to the declarations announced in September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest competitions to the highest.
This last one is supposed to be an escape from the promotion of football.
"I would also try to solve all the scandals caused by the Bohemians as a consequence of the scandal of corruption last year."
"I would immediately be involved in negotiations with the public and private sector, to ensure that there is enough money for all football," he said two months ago to ČTK the 46-year-old candidate.
He then also promised that his appointment as head of the football team would not involve any personal changes to the board.
"I should first know the tasks of each employee," he said, referring to Strahov, where, after a long period of anarchy, a understandable nervousness prevails.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are being vaccinated before the next General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not travel on vacation this Thursday to Nymburg.
"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly be able to overcome it.
"The football needs credibility, which will only be recovered if it finally has a leader", still two days before the most decisive day in its career as a representative, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises, under his leadership, the FAČR would start working with a win.
If the fourth General Assembly elected current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl as the new President of the Czech Football Association, many people would certainly be welcomed.
Rajchl promises that if he was elected, he would work hard.
He wants to implement a systematic change and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for each football area individually.
It is also committed to resolving the case of the Bohemians, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, making more money for football and continuing with the work initiated by former President Ivan Hasek.
"As president, I would like to fully dedicate myself to football."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the selection, through the professional football or the training of high-performance footballers."
"With this I don't mean I would do it all alone," said Rajchl in an interview for the ČTK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the competences of the Executive Committee so that each member can dedicate himself to a specific area."
"And I'll assign difficult tasks so that the football can, in each of those segments, move forward with a lot of impulse."
"Many people will probably not like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticising the work of others," he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it is said that it has considered the possibility of not being presented again as a candidate.
"Everyone knows I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will stop me and stop me from every step," he explained the reasons for his decision.
"Many people have told me I don't have to give up for victory, because then they would be given for victory also to others."
"It's about having faith not to leave that way, no more," he said.
According to them, he was also motivated to continue the work that had already begun with Hashek.
"For those two years, a lot of work has been done that I don't want to lose now."
"There are processes that have started and that will have their effect within a few years and I would not like to have a father," he announced concerned that if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could be as it was before the time of Hashek.
"I believe in order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta cannot keep.
"After him is above all all those people who would take care of football so that it was only a privilege for a few chosen ones."
"I can apologize a lot of things, but not the fact that I'm in favour of someone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make a football for everyone, because that's just how everyone feels and not just the chosen ones," said Rajchl.
He also rejected the idea that only the president would be disappointed.
"Although some people try to say the opposite, I intend to do the most for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to think about the fact of dividing the second division into a Czech and another dwelling, whose winners would go to the first division."
"There would be no present situation in which we have only three teams of Moravia, which represents a problem for young live players," said Rajchl.
Although the war of presidential elections took place in Tomash Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, Rajchl did not stop believing in its possibilities of being elected.
"I still feel strongly supported by the Czech Federation, which has elected me as its Vice-President and who knows that there are clear successes behind me," said Rajchl, whose success includes the saving of tens of millions of crowns of dissuasive contracts, television contracts negotiations and lottery law negotiations.
On the other hand, he recognizes his part of the guilt in which the federation is not united.
And while he proclaims that Pelta is "disqualified to recover confidence in the Czech football", he considers the other rival, Paclik, as a strong candidate who has something to offer the football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for Pilsen that year."
"In the event of his election, he will probably follow what Ivan Hashek had begun and would not significantly change the staff pattern in the committees."
"I don't want to use it in my favor," evaluates his rival Rajchl.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Blue Drop
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an amazing sight, beautiful bathrooms in Budapest: Anyone who visits Europe can live his beautiful blue, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest his legs washed in bourgeois baths.
A book shows where you can find the best welfare in the water.
When Iris Meder made a research trip during the past year and in the middle, there was something that could not be missed in his team, a bathroom.
Tumbed with wings over the water, he looked at the art capillary at the top, went up to the angels of marble, who looked forward to it at the pool, and was surprised at the modernist covered swimming pool methically restored.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his book at the time of all the interesting details about the building's style and history.
Architectonic historian Meder explores more than 200 swimming pools in this way and presents them in his recent book "Badefreden": the swimming pools covered in Munich, the historical bathrooms in Selva Negra, the "hormigon constructions" in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited locations in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
This 46-year-old German is a true enthusiasm for the culture of the bathroom.
He doesn't want to have anything to do with sports, says Meder, only water is different.
He is only concerned that the bathroom staff have to comply with blue and heder-like needles, while the running crews can breathe the fascinating smell of bees forests or listen to the three-thirds of the birds in the park.
"One day I asked myself why the swimming pools should always be so cool," says this resident of Vienna.
"I started collecting beautiful swimming pools."
The surface of the water duplicates the architecture.
The bed in the pool and the oil stars of the sauna. The factor of well-being in the pools is so great that all senses are touched, according to Meder.
And if the builder strives, covered pools can be a real gift for the view: "In the ground, in the bathrooms there is a surface of water."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of all the building."
Everything is optically duplicated: the tall tubes, the color needles, the trampolines.
The book with small photographs "Badefreden" provides 190 pages of interesting data on architecture and art history in the historical oasis of wellness, but, mainly, it wishes to jump to the blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the examples highlighted in his research in Hungary.
Along with the magnificent medical baths such as the pool of Széchenyi of Budapest, 100 years old, water is found with nitrates in a single cavities (cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as some termites, whose swimming pools are of alkaline waters and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városio Termálfürdö in Jassberény).
Many swimming pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While all the city places its eyes on Zurich's covered swimming pool, it can be seen in Arlberb, snow cover, from the outdoor swimming pool in St. Antón, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which the practice can be observed on ski tracks.
The design, perhaps more extraordinary, awaits customers in Längenfeld: Ötztal's water cathedral seems to be an ovni that just landed in the Alps.
Three open sources rise up in the winter, while the mountains of Ötztal are basically raised in the sky.
Alhambra in Selva Negra
Meder, the pool collector, didn't invade the smell of chlorine in all the pools.
Many thermal baths call for water, in the baths of Árpád in Békescsaba, Hungary, the gas plague is so strong that people think they have reached a sanitation bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters containing bicarbonate and alkaline and whose legume is attached to the skin when entering the pool, a special enjoyment of well-being.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place in his search for nice places for the bathroom, when he wanted to visit discovered swimming pools and sun baths in the Czech bathroom of Luhatschowitz, he met with a blocked land.
The 1902 bathroom of the Duan Jurkovic architect was closed.
When Meder looked through the disoriented windows of the red, white and yellow modernist building, he saw the pain grow between the steels.
The decadence was contrasted with a lovely swimming pool in the Selva Black: the Termal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three stages of construction behind them; they can not only be found neuromanic elements of their construction time in 1844, but also an Arab Alhambra style hall, added in 1900.
Since its modest modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bathroom of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not just because it is natural from the Selva Black.
"It is very important to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit," Meder says.
In such a palace, the entrance to the thermal pool appears to be of little importance.
Agrarian Speculation
Deutsche Bank analyzes the business of raw materials
Christian Teevs
Does the Deutsche Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to information from SPIEBEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to test the impact of speculation on the world's poor.
In January, the Consortium Chief wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the issue is clear, according to one study, 84 percent of the Germans do not seem acceptable to banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of the respondents claim that the Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions are withdrawing from this business because it intensifys the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of an investigation by the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foowwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann points out that global prize bags are cost-effective, and banks are responsible for the global hunger problem.
The consumer defence campaign is directed specifically to Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, premium claims were considered to protect merchants from price oscillations.
The main experts agree that players have been decoupled from the bids and demands, and have gained from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann responded to criticisms differently from U.S. competitors: He promised to review the claims and said that no business "should compromise the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the requirements of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be finalised at the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank Directive, together with the recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the bank's management will inform the consequences.
Finally, there could be a reduction in the business of raw materials, or even their total absence.
Ackermann is trying to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, Founder of Footwatch, welcomed the news, but reaffirmed his criticisms to the financial sector: "The rising price of food is particularly tragic how the banks currently damage public well-being."
Ackermann is the largest banker, especially in obligations.
"Deutsche Bank must cancel all its investment in which it plays the money for food price deposits," Bode said.
"As if Ackermann is dealing with the subject of people who experience hunger or the fame of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's inspection is surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the director of the club wants to offer a perfect image a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the President of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors would change something different from what was not planned in the Board of Directors.
With the absence of the controversial agricultural speculation, you can perfect your image.
And he needs only to care for possible losses, so his successor will take care of it.
Two thirds would cancel investment in premiums
Footwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
To date, more than 30,000 netizens have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Institute may have asked 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 10 per cent considered it legitimate that Deutsche Bank would offer investments in which food prices would be adjusted.
Many bank clients showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was participating in such businesses: according to the survey, two thirds would cancel all investments from agricultural speculation money.
43 per cent would advise a bank so that its acquaintances, 49 per cent would request, after reflecting, cancel their account and change to another institution.
House 21 in Vienna
The moved palette
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with high heights and a happy ending, the pavilion of the Austrian universal exhibition of Brussels in 1958 received prizes, was in Vienna for a museum, became empty and disappeared.
Now it's reopened as an exhibition house.
Modern postgerra architecture is fascinating, clear forms, crystal halls, valid curves and new construction materials, typical of the thinking about technical progress, so the Austrian papelon of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 universal exhibition of Brussels is an appropriate and well-known example.
Schwanzer's Babylon then obtained the Grand Prix of Architecture by its light and floating construction of steel and glass.
The construction is still considered a contemporary site of architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built Austria's palace at the next universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent building planned in Munich, it became internationally known.
His palace, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions, arose after the universal exhibition at Schweizer Garten near the southern stage of Vienna, was reformed in 1962 and a 20th-century museum was opened.
The building was suitable but lacked the space and technology suitable for a museum; no wall to capture art or a good environment.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001.
Currently, architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the palace, now called "house 21" and will be used in the future as a contemporary art museum.
On Tuesday afternoon the beautiful museum was opened, which belongs to the house, with the first exhibition, a successful strike in a certain way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new head of the Austrian beauty gallery since 2007, has achieved a new start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor in the history of art with a considerable career, among other things, an artistic painter on ice in his youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum and the founder director of the modern art museum in Salzburg, made reforms with the persistence of politicians and defenders of monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
Except for contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotuba of the humane foundation should have a cafeteria and library and also an office building.
strictly controlled, budgeted below
Krischanitz was the best choice to make.
Not only because Joseph Olbrich's section in Vienna was substantially reformed, it expanded and the competition was awarded to him, if not because he studied with Schwanwer at Vienna's Technical University and the pavilion was for him a "important and immense place", where he considered the exhibitions "nearly every weekend".
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with his transfer to Vienna in exchange for generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are major problems, the building was "a waste of energy," Kristianitz said.
The window profile of the glass façade was changed, an insular crystal was installed with glass fibre and the glass roof was replaced by a special safety crystal.
The thermal bridges and steel jars were strengthened or replaced and the roofs were re-habilitated.
Two soybeans were used for the new use, a light panel down between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter almost new building, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original external doors remain, the house is painted in old brown tones and protected from oxidation.
And the cinema room is exactly like it used to be.
And all of this with strict control by the monument office and a low budget.
"I often had to find material that was good, cheap, and also taste the monument protection office," Kristianitz says and warns of an open ground in the basement.
Despite all pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and light.
The phrase "the wine of Brussels" has been difficult, said some time ago Krischanitz, a typical "case appearance in the history of the city".
A architecture like this is "always in the wrong place" and therefore I wanted to "warn the right conscience".
In this case the house 21 is not in the wrong place, there has been an urban accident. The completely new and planned "barrier of the central station", with housing and offices, is located alongside Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another strike of luck occurred: The house 21 could be strengthened by another construction of Krischanitz, since the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlinian contemporary art room and, as you can see, negotiate with the city about a nearby place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a package of winter crisis that rises to millions
The company has developed a crisis plan, which would avoid the injuries of trains in winter.
The number of personnel must be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against the avarices and delays of trains caused by winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent over 70 million euros this year, according to a periodic report.
The "Bild" newspaper reported, calling for an internal crisis plan of the group, of the investments planned up to 2005 of a total of about EUR 300 million.
To achieve a better availability of vehicles and the railway network, it is still extremely timed.
Among other things, it is planned to double internal and external employees to 16,000 posts to remove snow from roads and roads.
The aim is to clean snow and ice waves for operation and 90 per cent of the water required for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of accidents and delays in trains also during this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
The past winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the transport of passengers, as, among other things, he lacked reservations against adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years for authorization from the Federal Railway Office.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axles of high-speed trains often in the workshop, after a high-speed train will suffer the rotation of an ice at the central station of Colonia.
Deutsche Bank pays millions in the United States.
After the riot over President Josef Ackerman, a new U.S. problem appears, the Deutsche Bank has to pay a millionaire there.
As if the problems were not enough for Deutsche Bank, its past in the United States, the Frankfurt Institute paid $145 million in an agreement to end the content due to the demand of five large credit cooperatives during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage securities.
The NCUA Financial Market Regulator is critical to many large banks to lead credit cooperatives with false promises to buy financial products; the risks have been minimised.
Such securities lost value during the financial crisis and led banks to the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the subject without the parties having to go to the courts," said a spokesman from Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank does not accept any guilt with the agreement.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which required a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, President of the NCUA, observed the difference between the two financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit cooperatives and provides support in case of cash to protect customers' investments.
The NCUA is trying to reintegrate the losses of millions of people.
Currently closed agreements are their first type.
The regulator had also asked for account to other large banks and in summer filed disputes against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of the two hypothetical titles, the so-called values supported by hypotheticals are addressed.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. real estate borough was set up in 2007, it lost many financial entities.
In September 2008, in the light of the financial crisis, the United States Investment Bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results have occurred a few years ago, it is currently a complicated wind for the US banks.
Investors and inspectors have established countless procedures to receive compensation or to punish errors.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) has produced the largest number of applications.
He called upon the 18 major international banks that the two U.S. mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had benefited from the mortgage business in a volume of about $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has a request from the FHFA, which is a business of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to respond to "substantial losses", without specifying an exact number.
Deutsche Bank rejected debts as unfounded and explained that he wanted to defend himself.
Warren Buffett contributes 10 billion to IBM
The financial burden, Buffett, is strongly invested in the IBM Information Technology Company.
Since March, actions have been acquired at a value of more than $10 billion.
So far, US big investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in computer companies or Information Technologies because long-term development forecasts of companies are negative.
But he has read the IBM commercial report and changed his opinion on investing in the sector.
He had to understand much before IBM offered all of the services and sought computer systems for the Information Technology Departments of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primaryity of Information Technologies should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has now discovered at the CNBC economic station that has acquired IBM shares of $10.7 billion since March.
His Berkshire Hataway has invested with it to one of the largest IBM shareholders with a 5.5 percent share.
Buffett said IBM didn't know anything about the commitment until now.
He commended the direction on the normal benefits in the economic crisis.
"They've done a great job," Buffett said about the strategy.
IBM has long established the services of Lucrative Information Technologies such as the operation of calculation centres.
The older computer pioneer over 100 years also offers software and advice as well as powerful corporate equipment.
Buffett avoided technology companies until the date.
He said he would only invest in businesses whose businesses he would understand.
On the contrary, Buffett took advantage of the occasion in a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
His Berkshire Hataway has about 80 own branches, as well as part of all of a series of large companies such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, ancient Municher Rück.
Buffett, aged 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hataway in the 60s and, with wise investments, expanded it to become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his life - style is humble.
That's why it's an idol for countless investors around the world.
His quick and infamous sense of winning money has given him the nickname "Omaha's Oracle".
After finding Buffett's investment, IBM's shares in the bag amounted to one percent.
"The blue giant", as is known to IBM, has a value in bags of over $220 billion and figures, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the world's most valuable technology companies.
With Microsoft, said Buffett, he doesn't want to cooperate.
Bill Gates, his founder, is an intimate friend.
The threat is concrete
After the discovery of the "Zwickau cell", Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology" that returns to life.
The killings of eight small Turkish and Greek businessmen between 2001 and 2006 have a right-wing background.
In Turkey and the German population of Turkish origin have responded with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost that was believed to be dead some time ago, since fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there had been no more violent episodes with extreme right background against Turks.
However, it has never been asked that there is xenophobic in Germany.
The discovered ultra-director network reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were neither, nor much less predictable.
"Do you want to reinvigorate the bloody ideology?", titled the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The "Sabah" newspaper stresses the contrary that one of the perpetrators of the crime was a reporter of the Federal Office of Defence of the Constitution and was concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the ultra-rightal screen.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted with compassion, and the weekend reminded the victims of racist violence with a guard in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, reflected in a solemn act of the fifty-year anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
Conviction was shown with happy colors, such as a story with a happy ending.
The information came to some Turkish media as a buffet: "The German gift for the fifty-year-old", says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the murder chain.
The German "Hürriyet" issue also does not insist on drawing this mental connection.
"Starting to smell bad," says the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He stressed that the killers were persons who paid their taxes and made an important contribution to Germany's reconstruction work.
In the online forums of Turkish transit Germans, police behaviour and their subsequent success in the search are critically discussed.
The authors are surprised that the German authorities have not sought much before suspects in the circle of the ultrasound.
One is less retortory about the media: "From now on, immigrants are lost, they are left with no more than self-defence and arms."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"The internal peace of Germany is strongly dependent on the quality of the clarification and adaptation of the sanctions to the whole network," writes "Selen".
This means that, if Germany's internal peace is at risk, Mölln and Solingen's attacks will be revealed in nine years.
The image of the ruins of Solingen fire has been recorded in German and Turkish monuments.
No other event has made it clear to the Turks who live here that there is a particular threat and, to the Germans, that distrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks anger the Turkish party's group's feelings.
Do not repeat past errors
The Turkish press then mainly criticized the lack of German policy following the attacks, Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the shooting of Solingen sent a telegram of pessimism to Turkish President Klaus Kinkel, his Minister for Foreign Affairs, replaced it in the Colonia funeral. In his speech, Kinkel described what the Turkish people in Germany contribute to taxes.
It is clear how the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current information of the Turkish media again shows how deeply it has since been the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the efforts of a broad explanation and a reassessment of extreme right terrorism in Germany, this time there is a lack of French words.
The bank of the Zurich lake scandal
The most risky bank in Europe is neither Italy nor France, but Switzerland.
The UF almost got into a banknote in the financial crisis, and since then a crisis has been eliminated.
Now he's running a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think about it.
After its spectacular departure from the federal bank summit in July, it was known that in 2013 it would start in a new and almost spectacular work: President of the executive council of the large Swiss bank, an unexpected and lucrative step in its career.
Axel Weber is happy publicly, congratulates Switzerland for its beauty and for its recent acquisition of strength and lets you drop kindly comments on your future partners.
"The USB has achieved a revitalization."
"I'm glad to work with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A USB financial operator in London avoided all banking security systems and denied EUR 1.7 billion.
Oswald Grübel, Director General of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The president of the Governing Council of the USB has since been considered equally touching, and all have asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
Weber was known to advise the bank since February 2012.
And it will be the presidency of the Administrative Council in May, not at the beginning of 2013, as the bank communicated on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather, a professor of economics and counsellors and has certainly had a period of adjustment necessary.
A bank's strategy, which has just proved to be worth the title "the largest bank in Europe's scandal" for a long time.
On the one hand, the USB is huge, until recently it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, it has been down from a scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems like it's saved to the old Swiss bank so proud.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had a great reputation until 2007.
The image of the Swiss administrator of discreet and solid assets, but also early, was combined with ambitious objectives, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 billion, the USB manages more money than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it advanced as an investment bank in the link of the world's big banks.
This is impressive.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later banker in Zurich for many years, explains: "Before my students, I have always qualified the USB as a model of a good bank."
"From the current point of view, one is asked: How could I make a mistake?"
It was a big mistake.
In 2007 he went out to the light that something went very bad in the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, Director-General, who has so far been regarded as a great and very intelligent banker, was amazed.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank's investment fund was in losses with high-risk securities and had to be amortised by thousands of millions.
To accomplish this, the USB announced a capital injection of nothing less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, of course, that some had looked with contempt until recently: an Asian and transparent state fund in Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, which had never been heard of.
This was just the first hit.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare the loss of thousands of millions, Marcel Ospel, President of the Administrative Council, in 2006, in the second best paid Administrative Council in Switzerland, declined.
In October 2008, the disaster continued, in view of its misprovoked investments, the UF found itself in the financial crisis before the strike and had to be saved by the state.
The national bank bought trouble-free values for the UF billion, the Helvetica Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bonus, which would become the bank's co-ownership.
All Switzerland was affected, the dramatic fact that this was for a small country was confirmed if it accommodated so large banks.
Finally, the 2007 balance sheet balance was more than five times the Swiss economic results (see chart).
"We can't rescue the U.S. again," said Geiger, a bank expert.
The first disaster united the second.
A few months later, the U.S. government was capturing in a fiscal conflict with America and was willing to deliver data from the affiliated customers, who may have been taxing with the bank's help.
In addition, it has approved a figure of $780 billion, reimbursing the benefits of these businesses with a payment compensation.
As a result, the U.S.A. confessed more or less to helping in tax fraud.
At the same time, he lost something that had always been his capital in competition for rich customers: the aureol of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This followed the resignation of the President of the meeting and the President of the Administrative Council.
And the exodus of customer funds.
Thus, within a few months, the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in the investment bank through incorrect speculations and in the management of goods through the aid to tax fraud.
And just when I came back to be something calmer, just when I thought the U.S. was going back to get it, it happened this decadent story of the operator, an individual operator denied EUR 1.7 billion before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And, of course, this still does not work well with risk management in the investment bank.
"In the case of Aboboli it is shown that risk controls have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Bankary Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is also confident: "The problem of the U.S. is that it does not dominate risk controls."
As a result, the idea of caution, with which Swiss bankers have been present for a long time, is the guardian of the world's greatest goods: no too large risk, however, the security of money wants to break on the other side of the Alpine Republic.
The Swiss banks' security deposits were the symbol of inexhaustible reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of authentic chocolate.
The Zurich BG centre does not match the Swiss private bank's click, it's just a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its main seat on the Baynhofstraße street of Zurich, which goes directly from the main station to the lake of Zurich, marked by the snow covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are hostile, the rentals are one of the highest in Europe.
Here are joys such as Tiffany's among Swiss traditional businesses such as Springli's confirmation.
Here the Swiss banks have lived for many years: from the national bank, passing through the credit Switzerland palace, to the private banking elites such as Julius Bär.
It enters the UFO reception room through a heavy gate.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, there are large leather syllons, along with the bank logo there is a large letter to indicate "security".
The U.S. knows what the client is looking for here: Security.
The two large Swiss banks, the UF and the Swiss Credit, have at times moved the idea of the large Swiss bank, or have betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, at the end and at the same time does, like all Swiss banks, also with the businesses of both large banks.
The UF has become too big, he thinks, especially in the investment bank, where the Anglo-Saxons have won land.
There the Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And they've been accustomed to English customs for a long time."
In fact, the UK has changed its investment bank, gave its first big gain and then came the disaster, no European financial entity had lost both money in the high-risk jungle and the large Swiss bank.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was evident.
"These Wednesdays the government coalition of the small country of seven million has decided the biggest rescue operation in the history of its nation," writes author Lucas Hässig in his book "Der GUW-Crash" ("The Crash of the U.S." in Spanish).
Politicians gave up to 68 billion francs or about EUR 45 billion to save the large bank of the bank.
How do they happen?
We are talking to Swiss bankers, so we see the problem in the U.S. dimension.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks were merged into a powerful partnership.
It is a bank that, due to merger, was too big for small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
It therefore served to complement the two different leading banks of the UFL: a rich but sleeping bank with the center of the administration of goods in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, the internationalised investment banks arrived at an opportunity with a lot of money, with which they could round up a large financial bike.
There are two names related to this rise of the UFF: Peter Wuffli, Head of the FWC Board from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the Administrative Council.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuition that was able to open up from learning in the bank to the summit."
Finally, Ospel was born of Wuffli.
And finally Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were a reality," says Geiger.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It's clear: The desatino arrived before the case.
The staff of the UFW clearly agree with the director's meetings, in which Wuffli, head of the corporation, always repeated the same theme: Download from the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
They headed the "League Tables", the classifications that then documented the success of the banks.
The U.S. wanted to be on the summit.
Some steps went well.
The exchange operations and the negotiation of actions were higher.
However, the business counsellors in charge highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the banking language "fixed income", there is a huge compensation for large banks.
The U.S. is empty in the hypothetical products.
To fill these gaps, the U.S. began an adventure that almost cost him his existence.
Growth revealed both the same bank and one of its high-risk funds created in US high-risk investments.
He became a powerful machine to title American mortgage credits and then sell them, maintaining certain risks to his own account.
And also, like other banks, he's been looking for the download for a long time.
"In the summer of 2007, as the US real estate market was on call, the U.S. bought there," said Geiger, a bank expert.
So big the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to go, as his attempt to order was more complicated than they expected.
Posts in the IPB have been converted into projective seats and have been uncertain to date.
Currently, who runs a large bank, he's got almost impossible work.
A strategy for a bank must be found, before all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, a bank expert, has an idea, put an end to the investment bank, concentrate on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to get so far (yet).
But the investment bank has to decrease much, it's now clear.
The next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new bank president, will present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, only the 51-year-old Italian-Suit was thought to be a transitional solution, as the bank was miraculously separated from its predecessor Grübel.
However, he insisted: The U.S. business should be managed permanently, the Bank of Zurich communicated on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return to the investment bank to its state by mid-1990s.

But this isn't enough.
The U.S. needs a vision.
Who is it?
What does he want to earn money?
These are the questions that are sure to be done by Axel Weber right now.
Until now, he only says that he will first find a home with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.

Intelligent grasses spread in cities
In many places grasslands are considered "problem birds": they are not expelled from these most intelligent animals of cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the grass has been part of the city's image for many years, but in many municipalities there are complaints from neighbors about the poaching and the noise of the animals.
Although there has been no means against the "problem birds" so far.
The grasses are no longer out of the cities, the experts in the first exhibition on grasses in Leer, East Frisian.
There, experts from all over the country are discussing possible solutions.
Search for alternatives in cities
Ecologists address urban problems in the migration of the field of certain protected grasslands; chemical applications in agriculture have apparently ended with traditional vital areas.
The hunting, the growing building and the fall of trees that host them make life difficult for birds.
The grids are protected.
There are large colonies with over 600 players in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project to kill in mass at the grasslands of the district was launched by the negative owners of the press.
Critics have qualified the hunting of animals by trappings for birds and killing with sticks as particularly brutal.
"Shut them out and raise them normally nothing is achieved," said Werner Klöver, urbanist and landscaper of Leer.
Shooting the nests with water or shooting the trees is often an unwanted consequence, says Manfred Kaiser, an environmental expert in Lahr, Baden-Wurtemberg.
"The animals are disintegrated, the great colonies divide and distribute elsewhere."
Helping them is only imagined as an exception to hospitals, homes of elders or colleges.
"We must live with them, we can't catch them anymore."
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in the cities, according to Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
A combination of sheltering animals in sensitive and blind residential areas is possible for them to be re-located elsewhere.
"Intellectual panels instead of chains of chain" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist makes advertising against the purpose of dealing with animals in a completely different way: "The best thing is that we can hold a piece on the face with a tear."
Jürgens buried in Schleswig-Holstein the teaching circuit on Ascheberger's graces, where letters tell about the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on the criticism of birds' noise: "All are forms of communication, they have much to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the grasses not only use resources to access scissors, but they do not make tools to use them as resources.
Recently, scientists at Cambridge University tested the intelligence of birds in four degrees.
In an experiment, birds quickly learned that they had to let a stone fall on a platform so that it would reach a pool of pollen.
Without much training, they recognized with determination the size and manner of the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second test, gray astutes had to solve a complex problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a polyline lamp on a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't reach their prey with the pike.
But the investigators left them a piece of silver.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the cube in the tube shooter.
Three of the four degrees achieved it in the first attempt.
Portugal in Eurocopa 2012 thanks to Christian Ronaldo
The Bosnians and Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favoures, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be in Eurocopa 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed the latest tickets for Eurocopa 2012 in Poland and Ukraine in the playoffs.
Guided by the Christian Triunfante Heroe Ronaldo (8., 53), Portugal hit Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1), and, after the 0-0 of the old party, made the following five Eurocopa participations.
The Czechs obtained 1-0 (0-0) on the back of the playoffs game with the outside Montenegro, after that in the game of Ida (2-0) they left the clear things.
Croatia did not allow it to be marked in 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland received a fleet 1-1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72, 82) and Miguel Veloso (80) marked the other hills of Portugal.
The former professional of the Bundesliga, Zvjezdan Misimovic with a prison (41) and Captain Emir Spahic (65) cut off twice for Bosnia.
Sana Lulic received a red card (54).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the 2010 South Africa World Playoffs.
At the Liz Stadium in Lisbon, Portugal started perfectly.
Ronaldo performed a direct release of more than 30 meters to put his head on the points.
A quarter hour later, Nani showed his skills to mark from the distance and achieved the 2-0 to 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not shine in the first half hour, had their first clear opportunity thanks to gladiator Edin Dzeko.
The former player of Wolfsburg's team, leader of Manchester City, sent a head to the tree, but the balloon didn't cross the port line (33).
Jiracek addressed to the Czech Republic
Next, the colleague Wolfgang Stark, from Ergolding, was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penal area, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card to get to the ground (36).
On the opposite side, Stark asked for a criminal dispute after Fabio Coentrao's action, which transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European vice-president explained everything with 4 pounds.
The checkouts ended with the last doubt at 81. with Petr Jiracek's throat.
The 1976 European champion is classified for the fifth consecutively for the Eurocopa.
The trainer's team Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionaire Michael Kadlek (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Pekhart (FC Nürnberg) were also successful and had to overcome a second reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, the porter Petr Cech avoided a possible hole in its own door by Thomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had more possibilities with both Stefan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic marked the 40th minute of the turning of the front, very upright in the port of Cech.
After the rest of the Czechs had to protect the length of the world's famous port, the FC Seoul's front returned to escape (50).
Finally, the goal before the final judgment was the party.
In the meantime, Turkey did not take advantage of Zagreb's football.
Four days after 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not move from 0 to 0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that the national coach Guus Hiddink had to leave his seat in the world's Third World in 2002, Croatians held their fourth participation at the end of the Eurocopa.
Before 13,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost achieved a principle of study.
In the minute seven and with a long break, Selcuk Inan only managed to touch the post. The attacker Kazim Kazim was unable to send the balloon inside the door either.
After the second reaction, Croatia increasingly took control.
After the break, Croatia did not allow him to be put in any hole.
Together with Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who took a seat at Ivan Perisic, Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern de Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Intracht Frankfurt) are the legionaries of the Bundesliga in practice.
Trapattons go to Eurocopa
In Dublin, the Irish held their first participation in the Eurocopa since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took the team of trainer Giovanni Trapattoni, who raced with the 4-0 in the lead game prepared for a previous decision, took his head in the minute 32.
Konstantin Vassilijev (57.) felt with the invited team.
Ireland was pressed from the beginning, but it had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had his first big chance.
Since the first moment, the defense season has prevented possible advantages.
But in the 32th minute, he made it.
After a defense from the porter Pavel Londonk, Ward appeared and hit the balloon through the line, gaining the 1-0.

Mask to Personal Level
The intense and generous new book by Peter Englund, The Beauty and the Pain of the Battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow): An intimate story about the First World War, "starts with a long personality drama of the type that can make the soul fall to the feet.
Here are some suggestions for action: Launch this page slowly and convert it into your page brand.
You will get to know these people very well in Mr. Englund's novelistic narrative, and this personal drama will work as his GPS, a spell during those few moments where, as one of his men and women, he is confused and disappointed in the clouds of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which grants the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What he wrote here is a little running book, which describes exactly as "an anti-historic work".
It contains some remarkable names, important treaties or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions on tactics or materials.
It's not so much a book about what happened, it explains, as "a book about how it happened." It's about "sensitions, impressions, experiences and state of humor".
"The beauty and pain of the battle" combines experiences in times of war with more than 20 ordinary men and women, both sides of the war, from colleges and botanists to scalers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrations.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, become crazy or die.
Their lives here look like candles burning in a church; some new ones add to the mix while others close.
Mr. Englund's book is a deviation from the books of standard history.
It is also a correction to the notion that World War I was only the raging war of tanks in the western front.
"The beauty and pain of the battle" is expertly moved through other war theaters: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall upon their shoulders; one passes the Navigation in Egypt under the pyramids; the skeletal muscles are an intrepid problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
The war burns the lives of these people as a natural disaster, a Hurricane Katrina that closes the door.
When the artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you're a woman who's at home with your children, do you stay or cry?
Who comes anyway?
Almost no one understands what's going on, not even why you have to fight this war.
"Curence of facts," observes Mr. Englund, "has been filled with concepts, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, theories of conspiracy, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and pain of the battle" continues to individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German mariner from the high seas fleet.
His stories have been obtained in most of his memoirs, letters and other material previously published.
The explanations of your life may be terrifying or moving, but they are more full of life in the accumulation of small moments, lost details, of Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about privacy and how to fix them with what they have.
About telling the history of a German college says, "Succedanes, for all parts of the world."
"Coffee juice, fake aluminium, imitation rubber, paper sales, wood buttons."
He continues to talk about the food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from cooked rice and printed in meat fat (and finished with a false bone made of wood); tobacco made of roots and paintings of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden soils".
Here, notes, "837 meat-producing substitutes, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and value.
An American recognizes his own impulse to salvation and manifests about war: "You feel that, after all, this is for what men are designed and not to sit in cells with a cigarette and a whisky, the newspaper of the afternoon or a best seller, and pretend that this barnitz means civilization and that there is no barbarous behind that buried and sealed stone."
Instead, a British soldier is aware that he will probably die and that no one will bury or import him.
"When one surrenders to the thought of sacrifice, one would like to think that it could happen before the public," he writes.
On the contrary, it looks awfully like "a convicted person being kept out of secret".
Other comments are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has become more and more economic competition," writes Mr. Englund, "a war between factories."
Reflect on the arrival of what he calls “a new species in the young animal: The killer in a eloquent mass and ideologically convinced with good packaging clothes that executes his pet while sitting behind a desk”.
People behave in unexpected ways; there is both innovative and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund spoke of soldiers who were actively trying to catch a veneer disease of prostitutes as a way to avoid service in front.
"The greatest expression of this can be seen in the trade of gonocotics, which soldiers buy and exchange with it their genitals with the hope of ending in the hospital," he writes.
"Those who are really desperate will throw it over their eyes, which is often from the place to a life-threatening blind."
In this translation of the Swedish made by Peter Graves, the prose of Mr. Englund agile but not extravagant, is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, it reflects the way the war has been "exceedingly uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start to wonder why their leaders are fighting them.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and Paul Fussell's modern memory, or novels like New Year's before Erich María Remarkque, instead of comprehensive stories.
The volume of Mr. Englund joins in a little conventional pantheon.
Your book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a non-fiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's like I'd come from your book, started from between your fingers that page of characters dramas, and burned it with a mirror.
After a false step, a minute's scheduled advance
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing helmets of anti-disturbation.
The Monday night was chosen on Tuesday, because the Zuccotti park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling others that they were joining in a exercise.
The police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, his presence undercovered how the operation was affected by the police department.
The episodes of recent weeks could not be repeated, such as the piantic spraying of sprays on the protesters, infringing the department's standards and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the "occupes".
And that's why the police operation to disarm the Zuccotti demonstration park was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
Agents had been prepared to see how occupations in other cities had been developed.
A major disaster simulator was taking place on Randalls Island, with an eye looking at Zuccotti.
The agents increased the so-called disorder training - counter-terrorism measures that involved rapid mobilization of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the side of Manhattan of the East River.
The orders to enter the park came in the "last minute", said someone familiar with the orders, which referred to the mission only as "a exercise".
"To the few police I know who were called for this, they didn't tell them it was to enter Zuccotti Park," the person said, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to the Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department."
One reason for secretism was a lesson learned by the city.
On 14 October, some agents wanted to leave the park, but they disappeared when hundreds of protesters arrived shortly after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved agents from several police units, including special forces from all over the municipal district - dozens of mobile agents who usually used to insulate the neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, like those who travel daily to work, had been coming and coming from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to enter.
"It was appropriate to do so when I was the smallest number of people in the park," he said.
Cars of the Emergency Services Unit with focus and loudspeakers gathered on the Pike Slip cross with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and prerecorded messages that had been dropped from high school seemed to frighten many protesters.
Community affairs officers went to the park with their clear blue shorts, many demonstrators simply gathered their things and went away.
No store was touched until 1:45 a.m., said the police, giving the protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen meeting at the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave it.
Paul J. Browne, head of the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said that they were trying to prevent police from entering the park, and that they had been treated harshly by the agents.
Mr Browne said that the mobile television units in Church Street, along the western edge of the park, could capture images.
As the police moved to the west through the dense array of personal effects of the exhibitors, including paper and plastic bags cut off, the crew of the Department of Cleaning went after them, collecting what was left behind.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were dragged out, showing images on the Internet shortly thereafter.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camp kitchen area, near the park center.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them methically.
About 10 people in the camp center were thrown between them by the arms.
And two people fell into trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency service officers were called to cut off the candidates.
There were no arrests in the park until 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The waste operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr. Browne said some 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were due to "change of public order and resistance to authority", he said.
The senior officer in the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department, the senior officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the department's detectives, was there too.
Mr. Kelly, while I was present, "I wasn't directing the operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of agents were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street, if they had to enter.
They were set up on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
From these positions, he saw the police expanding the perimeter even further beyond the Zuccotti park.
At a given time, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people outside.
There were 28 people in the north perimeter.
Some of the most shocking action of the night took place in the south of the park.
About the 5th century B.C.E., on the south side of Pine Street, a manifesto jumped over the head of a police car, and others were seen leaving the air of the wheels of a police van.
At a given moment, a piece of counterattack came out flying from the crowd.
Finally, an agent and a manifestant were hospitalized.
The union of support workers will demand the city for the displaced
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month planned to ask the city for Wednesdays, claiming that the dissidents were unnecessary and discriminatory due to their disproportionate impact on schools dealing with poor students.
The demand is possibly the last weapon available to the union, the 37 municipal district, in its effort to revoke the dissidents.
Six hundred seventy-two school assistants, parents coordinators and other employees who were among the worst paid in the city lost their jobs on 7 October, in a movement that the union leaders described as a political vandalism by their negatives to allow, last spring, access by the city to a health assistance fund for working groups to close their budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically rejected this charge.
In a hearing in the Assembly last month, the Education Adviser, Dennis M. Walcott, said that the dissidents were part of the budget approved in June.
A member of the Council objected to saying that nothing in the budget specified that the school support staff would be fired.
Officials of the municipal district 37 said they had submitted the claim in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be requested. A press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the official submission of the claim at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The demand will include Mr. Walcott and the City Education Department as accused, and it will have eight dismissed workers as claimants, all black or Latin women, as much as the majority of the participants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the City's Legal Department, said that the city had not seen the demand and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a questionnaire from The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of displaced persons in the schools of poor urban areas to support a claim for unjust treatment, saying that poor schools lost more assistants, since they had been temporarily subsidized.
It is noted that although there were no departures in Staten Island and a few dropouts in schools in Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school attendances lost their jobs in the District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were dismissed in the Districts 8 and 9 in the South of the Bronx.
Taking into account the loss of five of the eight participants employed by the 36 Public School in Harlem, where 68 per cent of students live in poverty, the demand says, "This is not a neighborhood of grown-up parents who can raise funds to cover the budgetary deficit".
P.D. The budget of district 36 was reduced by 3.26 per cent this year, and also lost money when the city changed the way it calculated the additional funding for each poor student matrix in schools.
The union also claims that secondary school directors may have been deceived by language into a memorandum allowing parental coordinators to pass on.
The memorandum used the word "extended" to describe the action, although "extended" more often describes the act of transferring a teacher from a school nomine to a work bag, whose wages are paid by the central office.
"Sixty and six parent coordinators were fired," said the complainant, "and not only in excess."
Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that the Republicans and Democrats in the Chapter are finally willing to agree on something related to the rise in Libya.
All that was needed was that the rebellion had succeeded, that the Veteran dictator Muamar the Gadafi was captured and killed and the United States' participation reached its end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs will consider a resolution sponsored by President John Kerry (Democrated by Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republic of Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (depending on Connecticut), commending libidos for their successful rebellion and US troops for their "valentity".
"This resolution is to honor Libya's volunteers when they start rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"It is a statement of bipartidist support for its democratic aspirations."
Language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, the legislators of both parties fought each other and with the White House on the drafting of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of U.S. soldiers in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution authorising the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the Chamber by a broad bipartidist margin, and it never came to vote in the Senate.
But the same day that the bill was rejected in the Chamber, the camera also rejected a measure that would have reduced the funds for United States operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a kind of legislative cleaning - with Congress it's pretty complicated as to criticize Obama's management of the mission, but not as hot as to actually dry the grass under its feet.
The decision of the Congress was subsequently exceeded by the events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gadafi was murdered on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs "Happy the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to self-defence" and "delegation to the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya by their extraordinary courage and professionality".
The resolution also "declars the United States' national interest in a successful and irreversibly transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the Commission's full support for Foreign Affairs be given the new measure, or will it divide the legislators into the draft law of June?
The last version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (India), the chief Republican of the Committee.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other hand, the Chamber will vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican Congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by the Republican Bob Goodlette (Republic of Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other item that actually achieves a vote of all the Assembly in the Chamber or Senate at this Congress.
Other legislators have not succeeded until now in making their amendments to the Assembly, but not because of attempts.
Goodlate is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, which cover a wide range of topics.
Some are duplicated - the same bill is proposed both in the Chamber and in the Senate - and others with slight variations between themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the amendment of the budget balance only in the Chamber, and another footnote that "will control federal expenditure."
Some of these bill projects are also identical to one another, but they give their sponsors - especially the new republics who seek to define their curriculums - the opportunity to tell themselves that they were the "authors" of that measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was adopted in August, required that both the Chamber and the Senate vote in favour of an amendment to the budgetary balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of the amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that Congress members can fulfil, while representative José E. Serrano (Democratized by New York), wishes to remove the two mandates for the Presidents.
The representative of Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrated by Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other things.
An amendment that prohibits homosexual marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one that prohibits the burning of flags.
Some legislators also want to allow the annulment of federal laws if they are rejected by two thirds of the states.
So excited that the members have been at the time of proposing amendments, they are not moving at a speed faster than in previous years.
At 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments and presented 66 to 110th.
The rate is unacceptable in comparison with the 1990s, when members regularly presented more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they didn't have much more success then than they have now.
The last amendment, which was added to the 27th, was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by the Convention in 1789.
"Golped but Not Destroyed," Giffords spoke in his first interview on TV since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him to the fire in an act that constituted Tucson, representative Gabrielle Giffords (democrated by Arizona) appeared on the national television on Monday night, singing accompanied by Broadway's melody "The sun will come back tomorrow" and said he wanted to recover more than he wanted to return to Congress.
In his appearance in ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help to walk.
The program documented its difficult way back from the injuries caused by a bullet that broke his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he returned surprise to the Chamber to issue his triumphary vote in the debt roof agreement.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, he killed six and shot 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "hard".
When Sawyer asked him how he felt, 41-year-old Giffords said, "That's good."
The interview with Giffords and his husband, astronomer Mark Kelly, was part of a special program of "20/20" for an hour, which was released the week of publication of the new book of the couple, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special programme reviewed the recovery of Giffords since the shooting on 8 January.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her head covered and a long scarring through her face.
She can only keep one or two fingers up while her husband is alive.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting in a wheelchair while therapists teach him how to perform simple actions.
A head movement.
A cut of the lips.
And then, his first word, "What."
In a few days, Giffords spoke another word - "tossed", a change request in his breakfast menu.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: You see the congressman singing along with the therapists the songs "Girls Just Nwana Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spent two hours in therapy every day, he said he didn't remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he was reading to Giffords an article in the newspaper on the murder of 12 March when she stopped him for the first time to ask about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspect gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and is being drugged by the force while waiting for trial.
"Many people died," said Giffords to Sawyer.
"Dear, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at a time of his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I told him, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,' said Kelly.
"You've just been attacked.
And you're gonna get out of this, and you're gonna get back and you're going back with more strength than ever."
The troops make me feel colder than I respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that cost millions of dollars for homeless vets in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ball on impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots, and children of marines broke into their positions around him.
The crowd of labels fell on their feet and cried out.
"Men and women were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fund recovery.
A high-ranking military officer in the Gale, also known as the then president of the United States, the admiring Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops differently.
"They showed them as a sort of gerfan child," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really, it was love.
Markively contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between soldiers and a public in the United States, often far away, sometimes worshippers.
They are sold to troops with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, the members of the service say.
The public is increasingly acting as if those uniforms will be punished.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who ordered troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way that some show their support is to put us in the role of disunited souls."
The topic is a very sensitive topic for military leaders, who do not want to seem ungrateful or in disagreement with the public to whom they serve.
It is also noted that the anger faced by the troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam war was much worse.
As a result, most of the talks on the Last Supper are held in silence and in private between war veterans.
After their two children returned to fight the Marina Infantry, Colonel Mark Cancian told them that people outside the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of fear due to encountering insurgents and traveling to exotic places.
Others would be asked if there would be a "injurious and violent veteran under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to high-level government work in Washington.
During his search for employment, he said, he felt that some interviewers had asked him out loud if he could be able to cope with the pressure of a demanding work in Washington immediately after his fight cycle.
"When you talk about your service, you need to face negative impressions," Cancian reminded her children.
It monitors the military concern, in part, of the United States' indifference to wars.
The achievements in the battle field are rarely chosen for the praise of a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefits from the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were common in the Second World War," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who ordered U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public focuses on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
The troops are recognized by the number of rounds they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries.
The army is facing a growing pressure to end the rape
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their alleged pacifism before the rape.
If not, hundreds of applicants are being organized for the following.
The first soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 and 11 weeks pregnant the night she said he was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he returned to his quarters at the Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague who was carrying a 12-scarp package.
He asked if he could join her in her room to take a drink.
"It was a warning signal," said Lyman.
However, the native of Texas left one side of its concern.
I thought, no, she's 19.
"It's from Texas," he says.
"Oh, I wish I had listened to my instincts."
In a few minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached him from behind, dragged him down and raped him, he said.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other members of the current and former military personnel eagerly await a judicial decision in a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the appeal they have filed against the Defence Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought to trial.
The claim states that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce the generalized violation of military law, in violation of military constitutional rights.
Presented in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the demand initially involved 17 applicants, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of whom claim to have been raped or raped sexually by their companions, and that the army failed at the time of investigating, processing, or administering appropriate justice after the alleged aggression.
Burke says he's going to the army's biggest plan, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a structure up to the bottom," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of repressives? The High Command."
Burke also says that since February, close to 400 more survivors have been contacted, many of which could be part of future demands.
Its strategy: Instead of accumulating all the applicants in this case, putting all the eggs in the same basket, so it will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defence team for the Department of Defence, headed by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has presented a motion to discourage the case.
The documents of the court, obtained by Newsweek, describe the defence strategy - essentially, that soldiers cannot be questioned by current or former soldiers for injuries suffered by the armed forces.
The federal government is not responsible for the damages suffered by staff in active service by the Supreme Court of 1950.
"The alleged damage is part of the military service of the applicants," the documents say.
The Department of Defence refused to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially prohibited from serving in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, military women's teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.
As a result, 150 women of war have died and two thirds of them have been killed in combat situations.
It's time for the army to modernize, says Burke.
She's not alone in her struggle, and three other questions are on the way, in addition to her.
At Yale Law College, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academys for supposedly promoting a mission environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is making a complaint against the army focusing on the diagnosis of " personality disorder" assigned to victims of violence in order to give them the high service - a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhaguti of the Women's Action Network in Service, a human rights group.
His group filed a complaint in December against the Administration of Veterans, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way it handled claims of benefits for persons who said they had been sexually engaged in the service.
Nine draft laws have been submitted separately at Congress by a bipartidist mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported, according to the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Aggression and Response of the Department of Defence.
However, the aggressions are markedly low, and by the very estimates of the Pentagon, which is estimated to be 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19000 incidents that took place that year.
The report, published in March, also examined the procedural indicators: in 2010, 20 per cent of the cases reported in the army were judged as half as in the civil justice system.
The complainants in Burke's case described their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.
In the case of Lyman, he accused the alleged violation of the military police less than an hour after it had occurred.
That night, he said, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 times apart from a crowd of police, doctors, and commanders.
She was subjected to akit of rape, and the blood of her attacker - from a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked about having sexual relations with his girlfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons declared themselves to be witnesses of personality on behalf of the alleged author, who was finally absolute.
"I remember the day the Verdict was read," said Lyman.
"I thought I was going to work. I found myself screaming from the room."
"They put me in the Psychiatry unit, and when I went out, I remember I told my command officer, "That wasn't his judgment. That was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed a personality disorder, which he did not qualify for service.
In January 2010 it was disbursed from service under less-than-honourable terms, which prevents it from receiving any benefit.
As to whether the case presented by Lyman and his demand partners continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, professor of Law at the George Washington College of Law.
However, she said, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
What is interlocuted between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I've been a permanent critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and discouragement as it assumes responsibility.
And he adds, "Probabilities are strong against them... but it's important for them to try it."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not go on its way, Burke, a lawyer of the applicants, will put his other hundreds of applicants in charge for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until the reform takes place," he says.
"As long as we are walled, what happens first.
The walls have eyes: How researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another type of person who had taken his point of view of online immigration.
The Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having committed a murder in Norway in July, which left 77 dead, faced his first public hearing.
While Breivik could have acted alone, he was far away from being alone in cyberspace: he had spent most of his time in front of his computer attack, talking to some of the millions of nationalists who support rights groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how can I find them?
Easy - you just have to enter Facebook.
"We realize that it was not so difficult to reach them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report on European digital population by the British study centre DEMOS.
The Facebook personal information alliance is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers could just use the advertising tool to determine their demographic characteristics desired with a scientific precision - the way vendors have been using it for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right groups throughout Europe and then led them to ads, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey on their educational level, attitudes towards violence and optimism about their own future.
Upon reaching Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 parties on the right in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
"It's a completely new way of doing an investigation," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not surprising: Right-wing parties tend to be young, male and enthusiasts by immigration.
However, in a kind of turn, "those who combine their online activity with online activity are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind the screen of the computer".
The work of DEMOS is just an example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything, from health problems to social trends such as those expressed in the "I like" messages on the walls and updates of the state.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day, Facebook's "data supernova" is creating an increase in research, stimulating the number of academic work with the name of the site to almost 800 per cent in the last five years.
For some researchers, Facebook beauty is that allows you to study people you can't approach with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you tried to investigate people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to go through the party, and they'd never let you access," Bartlett says.
"Facebook removes all that--go directly to them."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno, of Wisconsin-Madison University and fellow students found that university students who spoke of their drinking habits on Facebook were significantly more likely to have problems with drinking than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as resident advisers, could control the site and intervene to help a student who publishs too many state updates with his drinkers.
"You can't handle a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Children's Health, Behavior and Development Centre at Seattle Children's Research Institute, said Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify children at risk that otherwise would not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly "pinching" its own population to get data.
The Site Data Team has developed statistics on the status of the relationship and San Valentín Day, the expectation of electoral participation in the mid-2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using information that can be accessed - digital freedom defenders have long been claiming that the site should make available to others its vast amount of data for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, they like it or not - the sacrifice for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to share your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users fail to form part of an investigation they don't even know?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data out of line, online is a free bar for everyone.
"I don't think that many of the users have even thought that a researcher could be examining his profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a 2006 study that led to the public walls of the students' Facebook.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even out of line, there is no guarantee that a subject of research is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know that part of the profile information of a user and of the messages of the wall is true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two things completely different," says Selwyn.
That's why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a subject paper and a bibliograph are still the best research tools no one can use.
"There is no substitute for entering the real world and talking to the real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about society - and a lot of society is still happening outside the line."
"Free and Inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to be the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a fighter of "resistance" during his first public appearance in the Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Norwegian Temple Horses," he said in front of a room full of 500 people.
"I objected to the court because it received the mandate of organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts, but I don't say I'm guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because "he didn't want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express his views".
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who gave a written speech in advance, to address the families of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik under custody for 12 more weeks, prohibited him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities should have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and family members of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came with the hope of looking at Breivik in the eyes, others to confirm that it was locked under the key.
All attended with the aim of moving forward towards the conclusion.
"I thought it was cold and inhuman," said a Utoya survivor at the Norwegian NRK station.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark and red suit, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked at journalists and survivors at the eyes when he entered and out of the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a major "resistance" movement, the judge decided that he was not a mental illness, and said there was no evidence that he was acting with complicity.
It is possible for some to advise that the attacks of 22 July appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically soften the pain and confusion that any nation still feels.
"I'd like to look like a monster, but it doesn't look," said a victim's family member.
"It would be much easier if it seemed."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' missing interview, are shown in a theater this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans could find more revealing, in an interview with Jobs recently discovered, which has been developed as a slowing down of a series of special projects in the largest markets this week, is how much this creative thought about the trade processes and the flow of products.
It was no doubt a self-recognised designer, dreamer and hippie, but it was also a meticulous organizer and a nykki of the flow diagrams - a man who thought that many executives would suffer "a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds on the personal computer trees, and he sat for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At that time Jobs had recently been forced to leave Apple, and had worked hard in his new NeXT computer company, waiting for popular Internet adoption.
While a small part of Cringely's interview was used in Nerds, he said that the originals of the interview disappeared during his transport.
It was only after Jobs' death that a complete copy of VHS was found in the director's garage.
This file material, slightly reeditated, is based on Steve Jobs: The interview was lost in 68 minutes, which comes to the Landmark cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating the interview in depth, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose their technological philosophies and commercial strategies.
And very thoughtful.
In four different points across the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, where Jobs is clearly covering his thoughts, seeking accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism goes to the surface, where it seems impatient because of Cringely's questions, pushing him to go faster on topics or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the Pixar era, the iPod or the iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic in the lost interview, when Jobs evaluates what other companies see doing good and bad, and offers their own vision of the future of the computer.
One thing is to read posthumously evaluations of Jobs' career, but there is something cruel and inspiring in the Jobs that we see here, the anxious dreamer at the edge of greatness.
He has a vision of how they can and must be things.
Not long after explaining everything with details here, he went and did it.
A quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of the missing interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"Over the years in business, I always asked, "Why do things?" and the answers that give you in an invariable way are, "Oh, that's just the way you do it."
No one knows why he does what he does, no one thinks about things very deeply in business.
That's what I found.
Jobs takes their efforts to simplify Apple's accounting.
Unconcorded by the way the costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was made to the eye of good copper, and that was then adjusted with a "variable" - it developed an automated factory that would ensure that the commercial costs could be determined in detail.
About Dad's smile:
Jobs told the "Blue Caja" that he himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to hack effectively the phone company and make calls for a long distance free of charge.
It has been written extensively about the device, but Jobs' euphoria here describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
Describe how he and Wozniak tried the box using a public phone, making a call, and then connecting from an AT & T network to another, while creating a loop with the largest number of satellites possible.
"We were engaged in things around the world a half dozen times and yelled through the public phone and came back a minute later to the public phone on the side," Jobs says with a smile.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
We both didn't know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think that Apple had ever existed without it.
Jobs continued to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost left, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to talk to the Pope, while making his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two stood in custody just before the same Pope was awake to answer the phone.
About loving technology (and selling it by phone with Bill Hewlett):
At 12 years of age, in the spare room to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett on the phone and made a call to him.
Shortly after his 20-minute telephone conversation, Jobs obtained part-time summer employment in Hewlett-Packard.
"That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company that had seen that age and formed my vision of what a company was and what it was dealing with its employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desk computer never done".
It was as big as a suitcase, I had a small catholic tube screen, and I loved it.
I would get a trip to HP as a teenager and lose time with that machine and write programs for her.
About improvising innovation:
In several points of the interview, Jobs is talking about inventing new products on the way.
Soon in his career, as he was dedicated to selling a basic pile of money, he asked a client if he could mount all the equipment.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to check the installation and delivery of the completed devices.
Later, while in Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in the development of a computer mouse:
"I agree to have dramatic arguments... they shouted that I would need five years [to create a $300 bike], and I got tired and went out and found a designer.
Nine days later, we had a bike that we could build for $15 and that was completely reliable.
On major companies losing power:
Long before Apple’s rebirth led to the rebirth, Jobs prophetically predicted the way many industrial leaders would trope in their vision and lose control of their market share.
"He says you work in IBM or Xerox, so why do you make better photocopiers and printers, and what?"
You have the monopoly of the market share, so the company has no more success.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so they are the kind of people who end up leading companies and people responsible for products are expelled from the decision-making forum.
The generation of products that led to this monopolies position is led by people who do not have the concept of good products vs bad products - the knowledge of the necessary office.
That's what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could have been introduced from all the computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been Microsoft of the '90s...
They took the defeat of the victory.
On innovation as an artistic expression:
"There is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as it evolves the great idea, changes and grows."
Much is learned about the subtleties of the same.
There are sacrifices you have to do - some things you can't do to make electrons, glass does them, robots do them, factories do them.
You have to keep 5,000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
In the end, everything is reduced to pleasure - try to expose the best that a team of people has done, and then try to adapt those things to what you are doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've never been ashamed of stealing big ideas.
What he did most to Macintosh was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were sometimes the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for the computer, it could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas eat with the rules of health assistance while the court accepts the case
On the day when the Supreme Court met at the door to discuss the politically controversial issue of whether they would accept the challenge of President Obama's health assistance law, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were detained at a trial sponsored by the law firm to present the case before the High Court.
The occasion was the past Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to finally study the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a request submitted by 26 states to challenge the overall reform of the health assistance approved by the Congress last year, a law that has been a call for war for conservatives throughout the country.
The judges agreed to accept the request and, in fact, a historic appeal of 5 hours and a half in March is expected, and the outcome will probably further disturb the 2012 presidential career, which will be fully supported at the time the court's decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and claim that the law must be repealed will probably be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. general tax during the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's Lawyers' signature, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped to sponsor the Federalist Society's annual dinner, a group that has been dedicated for many years to the defence of conservative legal principles.
Another sign that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Trades.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., who has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel, hours after the preliminary hearing of the court on the case.
There was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opposition to health care law.
The special guests at the dinner?
There is nothing new: The two judges have been attending the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And it's not something that goes into conflict with ethical standards.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they did not, it could be said that they had fallen under the Canon 4C Code, which says: "A judge may attend events to collect funds from law-related organizations and others, although the judge may not be a speaker, an guest of honour, or appear in the program of such an event."
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with a huge financial interest, was sufficient to alert ethics activists in the government.
"This impressive break of ethics and indifference towards the code runs counter to the demands of several judges who deal with the court for the same rules that apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause (Common Cause).
"The judges were caught in a fund-raising appeal with lawyers who have outstanding cases before the court."
Its appearance and assistance in fund-raising for this event made any claim for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in critics who say that the court's activity is too easily mixed with the agenda promoted by groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Gini, is an outstanding conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is the Magistrate Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as the Attorney General of Obama's Administration when the first legal challenges were presented to the Court of First Instance.
His critics have pressured Kagan to avoid seeing the case, saying that he was too involved in defending the law as for now being impartial.
Kagan has not given any indication that he's going to do it.
Boeing receives a record request of $18 billion
Emirates Airport requires 50 double-pass Boeing 777 aircraft, with 20 more options.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner planes to Oman Air, an operation worth more than $1 billion.
It is rarely known when a company receives a request from 50 units of its product.
But it's a big deal when the company is the manufacturer of Boeing Co. planes and the sale price for 50 planes goes up to a record of $18,000 million.
It is as great as the place where Boeing received the order: Middle East, a gold mine growing from future plane requests.
In a study on Monday, Chicago's company estimates that over the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need $2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced during the weekend his biggest request from history for commercial aircraft for his value in dollars - 50 jets Boing 777 double-pass.
The successful request came from the Emirates Airport in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more planes, which would raise the total sales price to $26 billion, Boeing announced in the Dubai Aeronautics Room 2011.
Then, Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had requested six Boeing 787-8s, called Dreamliner, which assumes a fuel savings and services for spectacular passengers.
The sales price for six of them is over $1 billion.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect on Boeing," said the analyst of Morningstar Neal Dihora.
"The quality of these customers in particular is very strong."
Many Eastern airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, they have not only the money to pay the aircraft, but an increase in fuel prices - generally harmful to airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - is not so harmful, because the country is making money with increasing oil prices.
That is important because they have less chances than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices increase, said Dihora.
"They have a natural protection," he said.
The request of the Emmiratos strengthens Boeing's leadership in the broad fuseling market and helps keep his competitor Airbus SAS’s attempt to invade his domain with the A350 passenger plane.
Boeing's victory in the air fair occurs four months after Airbus said it would delay the launch of the largest A350, which is directly linked to the 777-300ER.
It delayed the start to add more momentum after customers require an increase in the useful load and range.
Boeing Co's actions amounted to $15 per cent to $67.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico, in the opinion of the vote taken by Michoacán
Luisa María Calderón says that drug dealers helped his opponent of the PRI, Fausto Vallejo, in the governor's content.
The sister of President Felipe Calderón seems to have lost her candidate to the governor of Michoacán during the elections of the violent state, and she confirmed the Monday that drug dealers helped to turn the course in favour of one of her opponents.
The preliminary results led to the advance in the run for governor of the Western state to Fausto Vallejo, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of the crime organized throughout the electoral process and, above all, yesterday is alarming, not just for Michoacán, but for the whole country," said Luisa María Calderón in a radio interview one day after the vote on Sunday.
"They sent our candidates, our electoral workers... supported themselves from the Urs, installed the barracks... and ordered the people to vote" in favour of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until the presidency was lost in 2000.
However, it is the stage of a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have passed a few marches to Calderón, who had led the polls before the elections.
Calderón, a candidate from the Conservative Party of National Action of his brother, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvana Aureoles, the candidate for left-wing by the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who is currently in charge of the governor's position, remained thirdly, a great defeat for the divided and unsuccessful left before the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureols also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, exalcalde of the capital of the state of Morelia, denied links to drugs and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has been dominated for a long time by drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the birth of President Calderón, and he elected Michoacán to launch a military offensive directed against traffickers in December 2006.
Violence, however, has continued.
A PAN mayor was murdered a week before the elections while campaigning by Luisa María Calderón, and many candidates left the local candidates for fear.
Although for the PRI, because of the disgracing of the Michael elections, a victory will help to push the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging in the next year."
The BAsD urges Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (BAsD) has made a call to India and China to prepare themselves to help save the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term recession that would prevent the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, Director General of the Asian Development Bank with headquarters in Manila, said that the two major world's fastest growing economies had to "do everything possible" to speed up recovery of the economic block already outside the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that observed Europe's difficulties in a "incomparably" manner and said that Asia's financial assistance together with European leadership and resources would help prevent a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all together in this."
"So whoever can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," said the Financial Times in an interview with the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected in a certain way, but can't be immune."
"So if China and India can help, whatever the means."
The European monetary union has been seriously affected by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In the last few days, Italy's debt costs have gone down dangerously, and the first ministers of Italy and Greece have given up.
The current crisis of sovereign debt in Europe has increased the fears that it might push the world economy into recession and has generated calls for major emerging economies to unite to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but he said that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of EU rescue funds, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered more negotiating power for Asian partners in Europe.
And Sharma, India's Minister for Trade, said that "India is going to do everything possible" to help the eurozone because its own economy was now suffering the decline in exports and the loss of foreign capital revenues.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an imperative, because where we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies as India have no responsibility to help rich Europeans when facing their own and deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically difficult to sell aid to Europe for the thousands and hundreds of thousands of people in India, of whom up to 800 million live with almost $2 a day or less.
"At some point, it will be noted that the Greeks are young at the age of 50 and go on vacations on the beaches and that will not work well," he said.
Lee Howell, Director of the World Economic Forum, was also asked why India's reserves should be used to keep the number and well-paid public sector workers in jobs of mismanaged enterprises, as well as the generation of losses such as railways.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis threatened with "important chain effects" throughout Asia.
The Asian Development Bank's estimate of 7.5 per cent of economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now faced with the "risks to low" due to the threat of Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets needed to make "continence plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outputs from their economies.
Serious warnings of the Pentagon about possible defence cuts
The Secretary of Defence, Leon Panetta, urged the Congress on Monday, warning that the automatic budget cuts accompanying them could undermine national security and cause a financial reaction in chains from the Pentagon, to the Afghan war camps, to civil assembly chains.
The Pentagon has already reached $450 billion in reductions over the next decade, but it is now afraid of an additional reduction of 600 billion or more in shorts that may be imminent if Congress is unable to reach an agreement on expenditure.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina.
He said that the failure of the Congress to reach agreement on the budget and its consequences would result in a 23 per cent global reduction and a high number of new projects.
"A brief so large, thus indiscriminate way, would make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects impossible - it is impossible to buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be obliged to rely on many of our civil servants voluntarily and, given that the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to licensed civilians in order to meet the objective."
"These changes would break faith with those who keep our army and seriously harm the good will."
The shorts with time would reach the combat troops, Panetta said.
"Although the financing for wartimes in the accounts of overseas contingent operations is not directly affected by kidnapping, the efforts of the war have been adversely affected by the serious disturbances in the basic budgets," Panetta warned.
"The recruitment of personnel would be reduced, which would lead to delays in contracts and the monitoring of the contract supporting the war."
"The nominee staff would be reduced, causing delays in payments to suppliers during the war, and legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information on the possible impact of automatic cuts in the Department of Defence.
"The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defence would cause a rapid decline in the United States as the world's main military power."
"We are firmly against this dragon action," the senators said in a joint communication on Monday afternoon when they published the letter of Panetta.
"This is not a result with which one can live, and certainly it is not one that we should impose on ourselves."
"The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and should not be allowed to happen."
If the letter of Panetta and the recent warnings of senators will increase the pressure for a budgetary commitment or will intensify the calls to release the snippets' Pentage is due.
Panetta has been more and more frank about the possible cuts, despite the fact that she was able to work on the Pentagon with years of experience in budgets in Congress and the White House and knowing that she was faced with difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defence painted a dark panorama of what might be before - an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a ship without mariners."
"It's a fight without bullets."
"It's an airport without enough trained pilots."
"It's a piece of paper, a quartet army, buildings and without enough bombers trained to carry out the mission," Panetta said in her opening words at the Pentagon.
"It's a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is unable to maintain daily with potential opponents."
"In fact, invite aggression..."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta tells new details of how the reductions "will generate significant operational risks: stay in response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely restrict our ability to be deployed and committed in advance around the world; and pose an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the major defence projects could face the challenge, including those that are already being tested and some alone in the first stages of planning.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft, a new planned bomber, the ballistic submarine of the new generation, the new coastal battleship and the new earthly combat vehicle that the Army and the Navy need to replace, the Humvee.
Detention of F35's development and additional evidence could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is the next vital step to improve and cope with the potential threats of China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A view of the most recent headlines tells us when serious and overwhelming are deception and lies in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging sexual charges with several women; each party is accused of lying to the other.
The administrators of the State University of Pennsylvania have been accused of perjury by supposedly hiding reports that a retired football trainer was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was "fucked" with an open microphone saying to the U.S. President Barack Obama that Israel's first Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and confused countries.
The congressman by New York and Internet exhibitor Anthony Weiner made the ridiculous with his quick-rebuked dissidents by the irrefutable proof.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with crimes in the financing of the campaign related to the coverage of an extramarital relationship.
And again, no one who lives will ever forget the media circus condemned by President Bill Clinton lying during his second mandate on his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
The readings on the trams in school and university exams are very extensive.
Cases have been made in which teachers have responded to students' examinations with a view to improving their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching the opposite are sending the message that lying and deception are acceptable.
How stupid are we?
One day, studies show you can lie anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That's sure, many of those lies are popular lies.
Another study showed that unknowns lied three times in the first 10 minutes to meet.
Discovering lies, or "the location of lies", is an essential skill that we all must acquire, for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game of table like, for example, Charada, where the aim is to declare: "I have you", the detection of deception is a branch of scientific data obtained during the last six decades in prestigious universities that carried out research projects in depth, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the investigation is that the old lies about lying have been rebutted.
The liars look at their eyes.
They're not always tartamuded, balbucean, if they steal or worry.
Nor can it be concluded that lying people are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained liar can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the declaration, the micro-facial expressions, the formation of questions and times.
I've spent several years researching scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and always emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that detection of fraud is a modern technique that is easy to learn and help to navigate through our complex world - especially if their professional responsibilities include contracting, interviewing, or management of negotiations.
Good liars have the ability to read well to others, to make them feel good, to manage their own emotions, and to feel intuitously how they perceive others.
We know from research that extroverts think more than introverts, that men say more "directed lies to themselves", while women say more lies "directed to others" -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people think less often to their mates than those who are not married (but lies that often say they tend to be "big").
We also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer, others will feel less guilty when lying to you.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, observe the usual conduct of the subject.
This is called "Create a base line".
Help to provide reference points to measure later changes.
Note the position of the subject, rice and vocal characteristics.
It's better to know if someone normally hits the foot all the time so as not to make unjust accusations when he sees his feet hitting in the middle of the meeting.
Then search for misleading, verbal and non-verbal behavior groups.
Consider these behavior groups as alarm signals, not as evidence of fraud.
People who cheat can freeze the upper part of the body by trying to remember their history, they can point their feet to the door, turn to a exit, change their position significantly, or show a "post-enterprise" -- that excessive breath of relief and change of position once all the difficult questions have ended.
The questionnaires often fail to see that the interview has ended only to seek this post-interview relief.
He also paid attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson put the boat to the bottom and used the past time while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, launching a search for her at the national level.
People who cheat can also use a distant language: "I didn't have sexual relations with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or to repeat a difficult question together.
The most common word indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a set of "restrictive language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... until I... understand."
This makes the answer a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning signal.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but developing skills to discover the deception is possible.
These skills will improve the possibilities of anyone to avoid being victimized by stage artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial plan of the oleoduct released after the threat of the US delay in its approval
Days after Obama's administration threatened with delaying the approval of an oil pipeline planned from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- strengthening trade unions, while the ecologists -- the company seeking to build the oil pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to re-direct it.
TransCanada said on Monday night that it would move the planned olive oil out of the ecologically sensitive Sandills area in Nebraska, and trusted that the project would win approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference in the capital of Nebraska.
The director of TransCanada, Alex Pourbax, says that the company maintains its confidence that the oil pipeline will be approved in time, although it is true that it is with a different route.
This came after the announcement last week by the Department of State that the decision would be delayed by a federal permit for the project until new potential routes to avoid the Sandills areas of Nebraska and Ogalla, a vast subterranean water supply were studied.
"This is a real step forward," said the representative Lee Terry, Republican of Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review organized by the Department of State is possible to separate any decision by 2013, after the elections of the next year, even though officials denied that the policy would be reversed in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the request of the Department of State, and expressed all its support.
The oil pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico from 1,700 kilometres.
He would bring 700,000 barrels per day from Alberta Province to the refineries in Texas.
To that end, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by the ecologists, but loved by the working groups, who have stood for the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the olive oil.
But the Nepalese legislators against the plan are underpinning legislation to strengthen a derogation from the Sandhills region and the Ogalla River, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact study of the Department of State found that the project had only had limited environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said that the Department's general inspector had ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the member of the lobby hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was consultant of the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008, represents a conflict of interest to the program.
The other is if a firm that was hired to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle claimed to cause a child to be terrified
A New York family claims that the sound of the disc music, Patti LaBelle, was acting like a lousy in the vestibule of his building in Manhattan, landing his little daughter to the point of being scared.
The singer's diary of "Lady Marmalade" attacked Genevieve Monk, 18 months old, so he suffered "pity changes, sleep disorders" and "he increased his fear of strangers," says his family in the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was November 10th last year when traumatist Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, professor of childhood garden, and Genevieve was preparing for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was driving the car, Roseanna Monk sat down at the table of the Riverside Boulevard building, with his crew, taking to Geneva.
Roseanna Monk said he stopped by the door and put his daughter on the ground for a moment.
"Someone approached behind and said to me, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said, 'Yes' and I went to pick her up,' he said.
LaBelle was angry with the pregnant woman.
"He said in an aggressive tone, "I shouldn't have left his daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said, "I don't care what you say or think."
He was infuriated and began to use bad words - word C and word J in high voice...
I had a bottle of water and I started to draw the water from the bottle over me."
He said Genevieve was hysterical.
"I told this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," the girl's mother said.
LaBelle boasted about the mother -- who was still subject to Geneva -- and had to be contained by her environment and taken to a car she was expecting, said Roseanna Monk.
The little one was crying so loud that he gave up, he added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but I didn't get an answer.
The lawyer and the representatives of LaBelle did not return their calls to comment on what happened.
The application seeks for non-specific damages, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he took the case freely and that the family plans to give all the money that can be given to support children with cancer.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for her conduct," Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when it comes to a child garden teacher who carries an 18-month-old child in his arms."
Climate change has hindered the economy
During the first year of the management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa, unemployment and informality increased, undermining foreign investment and countering the economy
It is a year to be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, which is the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, called the change, which has generated great expectations for economic progress, but given the climate aberration of the beginning of the year, growth is not observed, but a deterioration is recorded in the main economic development indicators.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing millions lost to the agricultural sector, limited the possibility of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, largely justified by the historical fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other economic sectors.
According to the report on the effects of hails issued by the Mexican Council on Sustainable Rural Development, there were damages in 582,835 hectares, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and 21.07 per cent had partial damage, the main left-wing crops were the vegetables, maize and wheat.
The fall in economic activity has resulted in a constant increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, the rate of state unemployment during the first three quarters of the year was accelerated, as between January and March 55,053 signallings were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the Economicly Active Population, for the second quarter the rate rose to 5.28 per cent, and between July and September the average increased to 6.19 per cent, an increase of more than 74 thousand unemployed persons, a increase in the first half of 18 000 969 individuals.
Decrease liquidez
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the U.S. Department of Economic and Social Sciences, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been taken since public policy.
"What is seen is an increase in unemployment which has to be seen with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market for the effects of a resource restriction by the legislation adopted at the Congress to combat money laundering, since it is not easy for people who illegally seize dollars that they work, invest and use them in something," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that there is also a demographic factor in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people who leave the state looking for work abroad in the United States has been limited, first because of the difficulties in entering, and secondly because they are already having many difficulties finding work, those people are staying and are looking for sources of work here in the state, which makes unemployment rise," he said.
Information
The analysis of the labour market signaloense increased by considering the high level of informality that prevails among the working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the working population in the labour state without being working as a worker before any social security institution.
Together with unemployment and informality, other than the labour wages of the state, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labour and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of signal workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 weights, much below the national average, located at 7 thousand 375 weights.
IED Contraction
As a result of the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, the biggest reduction in the Direct Foreign Investment over the past 10 years is recorded in 2011 according to the State IED Economic Secretariat for January to June, was $630,697,677, which represents a drop of 87.74 per cent for the $5 million,143,312 registered during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the State Government's Economic Development Secretariat accounts for a total investment of 17 thousand 280 million pesos per year, mainly by third-party enterprises.
Debt
At the economic contract stage, the Government of the State requested the State Congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would have been earmarked for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities, with a view to rehabilitating the economy, the approval of the local convention was by a total of 2 billion,600 million pes, and until November it had not observed the benefits of debt in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés showed a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 there was a lack of harmonisation of the will of the different sectors, including the State's own government.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, it is necessary to work hard to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012, we have to redouble efforts, the effort of all and, above all, the good pace of this new government team, we hope that the next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López showed that events such as the year's beginnings held the state economy and limited its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is a product of several events, including heat, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not return fast enough to generate an economic dynamic that allows us to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and thus, at the end of the year, we are closing very much under our expectations," he said.
Can not open message
For Theodore Salazar Uriarte, President of the Confederal Confederal of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, it was clear that the state needs to move towards productive activities of greater dynamics.
"In general terms, we have observed that it has been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme in which the state's vocation and economic course are redefined, because it is important that all the potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has is being lost," he said.
Work to do
The President of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that is better suited to the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has been working to deliver good results on various matters, there are some progress on economic development but it is important that a long-term programme be developed," he said.
It noted that the current administration has made progress in its way of leading public policy.
"There are elements that allow the Government to say that it is becoming more inclusive, I can say that there is work done and I think the Government is aware that there is work to do," he said.
They condemn it for 8 kg of mariguana
At five years of imprisonment and 100 days of torture, a neighbor of Navolato was sentenced to eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney-General of the Republic reported that the convicted drug user is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, because of the offence against health, in his Marigian possession variant for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by elements of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010, in a surveillance operation on the Cipriano Valdez street, in front of position 80, in the village El Castillo, Navolato.
The Narcommendiist was traveling in a truck type pick up, white, where he carried a black bag in the car box and in the baby's seat a small mochila, where the soldiers found eight kilograms of marijuana 23 grams.
For these reasons, the insured was made available to the District Second Court and the judge continued in the Centre for the Implementation of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
Should contributions be made to the work
Social work on programmes such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants is at risk of being uncompleted or having serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda noted.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that while the work programmes have been advanced so far, they are at risk of failure to comply with the State Government's contributions to which an amount higher than 11 million weights per programme.
It noted that investment in these three programmes totals almost 50 million weights, 25 per cent of which the State represents and so far only the Federation and the municipality have provided resources for the work, so that the possible delay in the conclusion of these programmes is being made.
"It's almost 12 million what touches them and even though the year is about to end, they haven't given us a fifth, when since July they've had to give us a piece," he said, "we've started the work and are very advanced, but we need the money."
He noted that last year, in the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with their contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the municipality had to request a loan to cover the more than 7 million people that did not contribute to the state administration at that time.
"We had been through the previous sex because the State had no economic capacity to participate and the programmes were continuing, and this year we had to get access to these programmes, we had to get the resources to cover what the State had left pending," he explained.
Despite the commitment of the State authorities to meet these resources, he commented that the request was made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to speed up the management so that the percentages corresponding to them can be reached as soon as possible.
"It's almost 12 million what it's about to bring them, and even though the year is about to end, they haven't given us a fifth."
Valid Court "analogous Apangón" in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the United Nations (SCJN) condemned the constitutional dispute between the Senate and the Chamber of Members against the presidential decree that led to the so-called "analogous attack" from 2021 to 2015, when the eight votes needed to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed in his duties by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be followed to establish the transition to terrestrial digital television.
As a result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic was rejected by not reaching a qualified majority of eight votes in order for the Court to speak on the constitutionality or inconstitutionality of the decree, and this remains.
The draft judgment, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed that the decree be declared inconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television material is a legal authority reserved to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), contrary to the principles of hierarchy and law-servicing.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Members promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree, and when the applications were accepted, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions in it available for digital transition.
The full ministers also resolved to reject the request submitted by the House of Representatives, without entering into the discussion of the project, also under Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his intervention, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive could not structure the measures for the preparation of public administration by general standards.
"I also do not think that this would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector would correspond to the Federal Executive, who has constitutional mandate, the State's directorate.
The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years, and is translated into a better use of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more channels.
To delay the change, supported, would be to continue the benefits of digitization, which involves a decision of public interest, which does not only have a technical dimension, "which may cover national economic, social, political and security issues".
These issues, he stressed, "needs the operation of the entire system established, in accordance with the principle of state economic governance, to include a group of attributes that the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already concluded the digital transition, and has done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that when the Executive issued the contested decree, which had in some way invaded the area of Congress's competences, as compliance with the laws issued by the Act was being provided in the administrative sphere, it ensured.
They analyze the possibility of a "vote vote" content in Michoacán
According to the data set by the PREP, the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 per cent, without counting the votes corresponding to 879 out of the total 6 000 74 acts.
The possibility of the "vote vote" content is a reality with regard to this year's electoral process in Michoacán, where according to the data set by the Preliminary Electoral Results Programme (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 per cent, although the votes corresponding to 879 out of the 6 000 74 total acts are still not recorded.
In this regard, the President-in-Office of the General Council of the Institute of Electoral Affairs of Michoacán (IEM), Maria de las Langes Zaragoza, recalled that just a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body adopted a series of lines to harmonize local standards with federal electoral reform.
As it will be recalled, Michoacán did not approve his Political Constitution or the Electoral Code of the State or his Electoral Justice Act, although the Congress adopted reforms shortly before the end of the legal period so that they could enter into force this electoral process, and Governor Lionel Godoy Rangel denied his publication in the deadlines provided for in the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that he had some objections.
On the same 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the United Nations (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the local legislative power and qualified as "valid and illegal" the vote of the State mandate on constitutional reforms, although it does not have the right to "sanctify or reverse them".
Interviewed on the possibility of "vote vote", Maria de las Angles Landeland said that it would be possible, through the approval of the relevant lines of the IEM General Council, to carry out partial and total accounts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial account of votes, one or more electoral packages, may be made on the assumption that: the results of the acts do not match; there is no act of extraterritoriality and computer in the issuer of the case or does not open the President of the House; or, where there are obvious errors or alterations to the acts.
In addition, the total account of the vote received in all the electoral cassettes may be made when there is a indication that the difference between the alleged candidate to win the election being dealt with and the second place to the vote is equal to or less than one percentage; always when the party's representative and/or coalition were present at the beginning of the meeting, the request was expressed by the representative of the party and/or the candidate who requested the second of the candidates indicated.
The total voting account may also be carried out if, at the end of the ordinary computer, it is established that the difference between the alleged winner candidate and the second-hand candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, whenever there is an express request from the representative of the political party whose candidate is second-hand, where the electoral packages that have been subject to partial account will be excluded.
It should be noted that in this situation, the choice of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and the second is only 0.16 per cent, although not accounting for 129 votes in 923.

The new Italian government will form Wednesdays
The appointed prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed that country on the edge of the economic disaster.
The first Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with the Italian President to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy in line with the economic disaster and has put the whole eurozone at risk.
A communiqué from the Presidential Palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitan, to confirm that he can form a Government.
It is expected that a office composed of most of its technocrats will be present, although it is not clear when the new executive will assume the task.
Monti said he would present to the President the outcome of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that a government could form, but the tone of his comments indicated that obstacles have been overcome.
The "mark is now well-designed," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the costs of its debt to unsustainable levels.
The new administration directed by the former European Commissioner Monti must adopt a strong package of austerity required by European leaders to recover the broken trust in Italy.
By raising the pressure on Monti to be taken, the instability of the markets placed the performance of the Italian BTP bonds to 10 years above 7 per cent, the level in which Greece and Ireland were forced to be redeemed.
Emma Marcagglia, leader of the Italian patronage Confindustria, said to the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were significantly boosted by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, to whom the crisis was forced on Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are intended to have a good outcome," said Angelino Alphano, secretary of the Central Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the Government of the majority of the technology that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monti must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be implicated in austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in their efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks was forced to warn that Monti's failure would be a disaster.
On Monday, Monti began his consultations with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women's organizations.
It will end your round of meetings tomorrow night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitan, which has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a short breath at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would decline, the costs of the Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between the uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Rescue to Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.8 billion, would be too much for the current financial defences of the euro area.
Monti said that his Government should remain until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite the generalized forecasts that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before the elections are resumed.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his office, but the big parties insist that he should be trained only by technicians, an indication of his repairs to a process bound by financial pressure.
Political sources indicated that mutual mistrust and discrepancies between the parties were making it difficult to include political figures.
The rose of the Spaniards is higher than the ticks
Of the 22 footballers called Spain, ten are based on 50 international games.
On the side of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 called arrived at the 50 meetings.
A mausoleum contrast to Costa Rica, if compared to the 22 invited by both countries for today's friendly, at 3:05 p.m. in the National Stadium of San José.
While World and Europe's champions, one of the FIFA's monthly rankings, account for a wide range of Class A interselections games, the Tricolor only holds the champion Michael Umanña as the only one with the 50 international parties.
That figure reached her last Friday in the game against Panama (0-2), in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballists who play in the League of Stars and powerful clubs of the League of England's Premier League maintain an intense activity every year in league and domestic football champions, and high-level shocks in European Cups such as Champions League.
The experience with the Spanish Furia is first taken into account in complicated eliminations of the Eurocopa and the World of Football.
Tician footballists, on the other hand, have a limited international rock in a zone, such as the Concaaf, which is considered the lowest level within the FIFA.
We see that the maximum registration of the Spanish Selection is from the archaeologist Íker Casallas, who on the previous Saturday before England (down 0-1 in London) equaled the registration of exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today in front of the Tricolor and will print a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, a celebratory flight from Barcelona, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi, including the previous week, were recognized by UEFA along with the other centurions of the Iberian team, the name Zubizarreta with 126 and Schalke's aerite Raúl Gonzalez with 102.
Nearly the century's number is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
Shabi Alonso followed him with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Inniesta, with 62; Cesc Fabregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tactical side, and near Michael Umaña, are the left side of Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and the painter Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five were over 30 parties: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
At least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not close to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar owns only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson still don't start.
The Spanish historical golator is David Villa, 50 days old, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
By Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one that registers more than nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintito included the country in its two-year journey tour
"Go to Costa Rica is a dream made reality"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Basil Jeff Ament, from Pearl Jam, said the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the band ensures that for them, it will also turn the dream of playing in the country.
So he assured the founder and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil last week.
The group is located in the South American branch of its two-year work cycle, and on Sunday 20 it will make its only scale in Central America.
That day will be presented at the National Stadium, from 7:30 p.m., along with the English band The X and the Nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an extract of the conversation, whose complete transcription is in La Nación on the Internet.
For your Costa Rican followers, is it a dream real reality that Pearl Jam is going to play in Costa Rica, are they aware of what their fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream real real for us too.
This is only our second time in South and Central America and has so far been great.
I've been in Costa Rica only once and for holidays; it's such a beautiful country and I think we'll be able to stay there for a few days.
So we're excited to take our music there.
The question is, because there is a kind of devotion to the band, fans live intensively in previous days.
What do they tell their most zealous followers?
Thank you for staying on our side through all these years.
It took us nearly 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thanks for waiting so much and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add some pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played in the last 21 years have happened during the last few weeks.
We played a couple of giant shows in São Paulo and we hope that this has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
Actually, we're very eager to play there.
We love that country, we love surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its oals to surface?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a big friend who lives in Tamarindo and the glasses there are incredible.
My friends were always going to surface in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we were buried, through people who love surf.
On seeing the tour, they've come to deliver huge shows with many songs.
What have they planned for their presentation in Costa Rica?
As we've never touched before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and different repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's this supposed to be?
I think it's partly because we have nine discs and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we took a chance not to touch, it keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons we liked these songs and that we could have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and, therefore, I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this cycle, they're celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything they've achieved?
Yes, absolutely.
Firstly, I think none of us imagine we would be in a big rock band and have done it for more than 20 years ago it seems like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and feel a lot that we can keep making music together.
We all love and love to create music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world where we always want to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the rise of the grunt?
It has always been an honor to be part of that group of great bands.
We're very friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's amazing when a movement comes from a group of friends and it's a little bit common.
Sometimes, a band of a city arises, but it's much more strange when five or ten bands go out at the same time of the same city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them once in a while.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on his tour, so we were lucky to be friends of all of them still and we were honored to be part of that Seattle sound that arose.
It is also very strange that a band like you will remain united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, of course, is much longer than many bands.
First of all, I think we're all lucky to be still alive and secondly, we're all worried about the others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical adventures have also opened up to each one to experience.
We trust each other with each other's music and can't be better.
Your relationship with the famous word has not been easy; however, thanks to its success, they have been able to do what they want.
How do you find a balance?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.
We make sure it's not too round because it's easy to fall into that game of the great crowd and the people who love your music.
While you remember that people are there for music, that reminds you that you must respect music and what brings it, without being caught by being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really cares about.
How do you remember your other project Mother Love Good?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first was something great.
We were a band for almost three years and never published a disc until after Andy died (Andrew Woods).
There were many frustrations because it would last so long and most important is that we were still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I heard a song or saw a photo I thought of the amazing person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and more.
It was a wonderful human being and we were surprised.
The national band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know your work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why they chose it for the opening?
Yes, production sent us videos with various proposals and that was the band that we liked most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer in life and must be very interesting.
Why do they always change Yellow Ledbetter's letter alive?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings and I think he does it with the first thing that happens to him.
As a bully, what are his influences?
They're so many.
Among the first things that happened to me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
They're so much I could talk all afternoon about the bass who love me.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the gray relevant despite being no longer a fashion?
I think that all of us always feel a little disconnected from the Grunge word.
When I think about it, I remember the bands I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that came up at the same time, and, if there's relevance now, I think it's something wonderful because it's music that's worth listening and bands like Mudhoney are doing better now than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now became more positive.
What does this change mean?
It's interesting because I think there's a couple of songs in the new album that may look more livid, but there's also songs like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs though they can sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed touched me, I wept when I heard them and they were deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there's some trauma in your life and you lose a family or a friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs, of course, represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that's dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is reintroduced again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be evaluated by the loss of muscle strength present on his legs, informed his head doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years old, who served a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffered several diseases, including cancer in the language by which he had been operated four times and was kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Agouñaga, who is his personal doctor, told TV channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplasic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and the loss of strength of its lower members.
Agugugaga commented that in her opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the offender for humanitarian reasons, however, said he did not want it because he was innocent.
It was operated four times by cancer in the language, has a weight loss of 18 kilograms that has been combined with other pathology such as severe gastrointestinal gastritis, pancreatitis, renal calculations, arterial hypertension and blood circulation problems, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been arrested since September 2007 in the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people in the hands of a army-acquired army army force who operated in the first years of his government.
Music travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official committee, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and integrated by several ministers and entrepreneurs, will begin a visit to Mexico this Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
The next Wednesday will meet with his Mexican partner, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial and community authorities in Mexico, according to the agenda circulated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "an approach to the exchange of information in all political matters between the two nations", the South American Presidency published on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France when French mandate Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country in a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that continue to be fiscal paradises, a statement that caused Uruguay's refusal and the call to consult its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been the president of the G20, a group composed of the most powerful and emerging countries in the world since November, and has been living with the South American country since January this year, a treaty to exchange tax information with a view to avoiding double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayn Government has tried to accelerate the establishment of tax exchange agreements with a view to leaving the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), formed by countries that have not implemented all international standards of fiscal cooperation.
From 2004 onwards, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Treaty (TLC) which has increased the exchange of goods between both nations.
The bigoted font is the three dimensions of "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought, incansible, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the tears of evil Bowser, but he has never done so before in three dimensions: "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month to the shops all over the world, has been designed from a principle to use the features of Nintendo 3DS portal console, which allows to play in three dimensions without needing to use gloves.
"Mario is the person who has to say how the wireless stereoscopy should work," advised Nintendo's specialized press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally thought for that support", since so far successful as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's portfolio has maintained that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a video game "accessible" that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid game.
Álvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "sancilla" to trap the less skilled users.
Once over, the most experts can give a "second turn" to the levels of the game, which this time presents more difficulty.
In addition, users can choose in real time between a "D aggressive" or one that only affects the depth of action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "do not indulge in optical illusions".
This three-dimensional Super Mario intrusion also implies the return of the person to a portable console, which has not been produced since 2005.
In this video Nintendo leads the followers of the saga and repeats the formula of success of the previous delivery, which means that the bigote source will have to use dangerous platforms with the aim of releasing Princess Peach.
Although the player will find innovations in movements, environments, distractions and enemies and also a "jugable" Luigi.
Colom evaluates Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced this morning that he had handed over the extradition of ex-prisonant Alfonso Portillo to respond in the United States to the conspiracy for the healing of US$70 million.
It thus ends the process so that Guatemala will respond to the request from the northern country that it called for Portillo to judge him there.
At a press conference, Columbus stated that his decision was subject to the independence of judicial and executive authorities, bearing in mind that a court had already ordered extradition.
He noted that during his mandate he "did not put his hands" in judicial resolutions and gave it through all the extraditions he had known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited by murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both by drug trafficking.
The fact by Colom implies an enforcement procedure after all judicial and constitutional authorities have been seized to process the claimant between 2000 and 2004.
In accordance with the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once its legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was excluded from the disappearance of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the process prior to extradition, but the Ministry of Public Affairs appealed and responded to the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid falling into the marginality of untrained children
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support institution is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to cope with a difficult situation throughout this quarter of the century.
This is added to the hundreds of long-term jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday for a balance in an act held in the old Fabra and Coats factory where more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the village of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with dograding problems or in a situation of falling into marginality.
The evening celebration in Sant Andreu focused on a large number of responsible bodies and institutions that have collaborated with the association for the past 25 years.
The various political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary nature of the work performed by Trinijove.
Together with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor, Jordi Pujol, the former socialist education adviser Ernest Maragall attended the event, and the extensive mayor and current eco-socialist councillor Richard Gomá.
They also attended the great Chamber of Fabra and Coats, the current councillor of Social Welfare and Family, Joseph Lluís Cleries, and the director general of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that it is also now, but he added that the work that has been done so far "is a good basis".
The President gave Trinijove an example of how to fight bad circumstances and how to hope people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not new to the entity and to the work it does," he said.
Displace a busy flag where macrofiestes were made
Invasors had been added from 11 of the 13 buildings, in Balmes, 51
The 12 employees left the prison on Wednesday morning without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the pesadilla that lived near the 51st street of Balmes has reached its end.
Twelve people had voluntarily left the property that they had illegally occupied, and where they had organized macrophytes that were desperate for neighbors, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the door lock was changed to avoid repeating the situation.
"From now on there will be access control," the administrator said.
The occupations, which had invaded 11 of the 13 buildings - the rest of them are inhabited - took all the electrical installation and part of the water, in addition to painting the walls and leaving wastes of all kinds, especially sides of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the stage of multi-tudinary festivals, which lasted for up to two days and were desperate for the inhabitants.
On the side of the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europe Press that since the building was occupied, the business has decreased by 80%.
The disc owner points out that the invasives of the slots had made him unfair competition, since they sold the copies to three euros, while the disc is worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the restaurant had to respond to complaints by noise, while, as he pointed out, the disturbances did not cause customers of the discotheque, but the residents of the house occupied and, above all, attending the festivals organized there, who had increased their frequency and intensity in the last few weeks, according to the nearby neighbors of the area.
The discotheque officer explained that the disturbances were so large that he even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago "forgive" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that over the past few weeks, it had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the PP's municipal group at the meeting, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "to immediately remove the furniture to end the problems of convivency and civilization that produce neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular manager explained that before the summer there was only one plant of the building occupied, but over the past few months the occupations had gone into all the buildings and almost all the floors, and that in some place there have been thefts.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to end impunity and be guilty of the incisiveness that has been generated in the castle."
Also yesterday, the Mossos left a building in New Barris.
At 15.30 p.m., the police headed up to 35 Mont-ral Street, after receiving the call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
The four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
Architects match the opportunity of the call beyond the fees pollutant
The municipal competition on 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
As of the 80s, in full support of the already extensive Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this administration printed a package of Collserola's promotion.
The booklet defined the mountain as the great park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, he was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the Neo-Yorquin Central Park.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park was again in the imagination of many, such as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the small ones that are not guided on the north-south axis but up (mountain) - down (sea).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park runs in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with jaballis in the role of the Yogi mouse.
These were until, in September, the assembly called for a megacompetition composed of 16 competitions for many other ports of access to Collserola.
A door leads to the idea of park, no doubt.
Or that or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question comes out alone: Collserola, why or mountain?
The competition, both by its veritant only organizational and by what it suggests reflection on the city, is the subject of conversation among all Barcelonan architects.
It is almost a recurring theme to which to turn your hand when two members of this former election castle are recognized in an elevator.
And this fact is just one of the few similarities between what three Barcelonan architects, and university professors, have been presented.
Miguel Rolldan, Daniel Modol and Martha Bayona: the competition is an opportunity.
For Rouldán, after addressing thelitoral front "if necessary" to discuss "the mountain front", although the talk of Ildefons Cerdda, the green manganese, has not been carried out.
"It comes from the basis that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, his great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," the architect argues that the title of "Collserola gates" introduces a "legislical trap": there is no need to think about them "how access to a park, but the delimitation of areas where there is to be action."
Modol, like Rollan and Bayona with experience in the urban world, qualifies the proposal for "intellectual network" with "some dangers".
Dangers arising from the "insure that it is today to project public space" after the experience in the 80s and that it was in the Forum area "song of the cysne".
The first fear is the delimitation of borders on which to build.
"Limiting something is already fixed the next step," that is, its excess.
"It must be considered in new urban planning instruments, because the current [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (GPM)] can cause real disasters."
More hidden from the question, Modol thinks that, simplifying, the veritable Valais de Collserola "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, no," for a purely topographic question.
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "shouldn't fall into chaos", although thanks to the opportunity the association offers to its firm to intervene in this project "from the first time".
And more, I understand that the approach of the mountain with the city is the rescue guide that allows architects to enter into the debate, but "doubt" about whether this technical profile is what must lead multidisciplinary teams ("all an accident") that have been created: "Architecturals should be only one tool".
Bayona points out that the answer to the question entitled to this piece is complex, because on the basis of the competition there is a global view of Collserola: "16 cross-border competitions have been called - say- in the sense of mountain-sea, but there is no long-term reading, which sees and understands the area in its entirety."
This is because, at least in its case, it has chosen to participate in the 16 competitions.
In other words, a project for one of the doors can shock in program and definition with the architecture of the door on the side.
In its opinion, that is, the assembly should ensure that the branch immediately higher than the Dalt Round should provide, throughout its extension, an area of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal and will be released
After 72 days of arrage, the legal deputy of Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the Monterey mayor of the process that followed him for alleged songs
After 72 days of detention, Manuel Jonas Larrazábal will be released after his release from prison by the Legal Officer of the Casino Red gives him forgiveness before the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a singing process against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After attending the Royal Casino, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, made a series of photographs and videos that supposedly required Manuel Jonas to pay for an economic quota so that the regional merger would allow the clandestine operation of the house of asylum.
After the public complaint, the state prosecutor opened a criminal trial against the Panist mayor, and on 2 September he was arrested and arrested for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Ministry Agent 3 in Patrimonyl Crimes, he was transferred to the House of Arraigo 1, located in the Old Barrio de la capital of the State.
There he remained for 49 days after a second order was issued after the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs deplores the offences of fraud and organized crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to Cadereyta's prison suspected of singing with one and a half million weights to the owners of the Casino Red; however, he remained only a few hours in the media security prison as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolas de los Garza.
On 25 October, he was ordered to be arrested by the Secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that nearly two months of aerugation had tested enough evidence to determine Jonah's guilt, such as the sum of 1.5 million pessims to the police officers in exchange for the operation.
This month, the legal deputy of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appealed to Judge José Luis Pecina to apologize to the brother of the mayor of the region, so he could recover his freedom in the coming hours.
During legal duties, the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and which of the partners in the asylum house had granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of the letter 197/2011, a legal apology is granted to Jonas Larrazabal and no claim can be made about the process that followed him; in addition, no damage or punishment will be required for him.
After hearing the legal appeal at the police station, about 15:50 the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Breton was ordered.
The judge's secretary, Jorge Yánez, was transferred to the prison in the municipality of San Nicolas de los Garza to notify Jonas that he has been legally forgiven and his envoy will be archived.
He will also notify you of the order of freedom immediately issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air accident where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake, lost his life, and seven more people
The Department of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident lost the life of the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven more persons, indicate that the helicopter was directly affected on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to try a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that prior to detonating the aircraft, the pilot found that climate conditions were suitable for flight.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the land, the asphas had contact with trees 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
It also reported that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so it had the requirements for transportation to staff.
In addition, he said that investigations in the impact area did not report the appearance of particles on the ground.
"In a search it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was structurally presented.
"The helicopter's design was for 19 passengers, with adequate requirements for transporting passengers.
The ground has a slope of seven degrees to the 30 degrees of inclination.
At the moment, the Secretary ensured that it was a priority to count the results as soon as possible; however, the investigation may take several months, even one year.
On the other hand, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that at the moment of impact, the helicopter of the Presidential State was operating at a cruising speed and that this occurred in an emerging white field.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cross operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the title of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the research:
Visual flight:
According to the aeronautics policy, the flight was carried out under visual flight rules, which implies that the crew should have visibility during flight and land.
Weather conditions:
Reports in ICM placed appropriate conditions at the disposal, as the aircraft advanced to the border area between the DF and the state of Mexico presented low-level cloud layers.
Selected paths:
It is likely that because of the weather conditions, the crew has sought a area of less altitude and greater visibility towards the valley of Cuernavaca.
The location of the impact.
The impact coordinates and the latest registration of the radar aircraft are consistent, probably prior to the impact, there was no loss of control or change in flight trajectory.
Dispersion of remaining aircraft in a reduced area:
The information available until now allows us to assume that the impact has occurred in a straight and side track.
The aircraft's waste dispersion pattern allows us to assume that the helicopter was affected on the ground under structural integrity.
Explosion evidence has not been detected:
At the scene of the ship, there is no evidence of any kind of explosion or fire in the rest of the ship.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that there may have been multiple contacts with the land.
During field work, parts of the aircraft have been found at an altitude of 9000,200 feet above the average sea level, the ground has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was expected to be dissipated along that route.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter could have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After the thorough search in a wider area than the site agreed, around the accident, there have been no dispersion of the aircraft, which strengthens the assumption that the impact was presented under structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find obese gene
Directs Social Security to investigate the gender of obsessiveness in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is conducting a research to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people, called the 'Genetics of obese childhood and adolescence' protocol, which will allow you to count on obese markers.
In a communication, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemicals of the National Medical Centre Specialities Hospital of the 21st Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by experts and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Politécnic Institute (NIP).
In the investigation, the population is invited to participate whether or not it is entitled to attend the IMSS participating sports units in the Gulf of Mexico, where tests are carried out on minors every Saturday from 8:00 p.m.
He noted that the protocol had begun in the Cuahtémoc Sports Unit (Mexican State) and that since 8 October, the activity was carried out in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (United States of East Mexico).
Once the objective of meeting 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Independent Sport Unit (in the Federal District) and finally in the Sports Unit Morelos (in the north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research was to identify the components and importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in children and young Mexicans to prevent the occurrence of degenerative chronic diseases.
When the World Day of the Diabetes was held on 14 November, it was stated that the goal was to gather three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about the physical activity and previous inherited diseases, with a view to avoiding risk factors that cause diseases such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
It explained that Saturdays were applied to all participants in anthropometric measurements (weight, size, circumference of the belt), blood pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (if it is to identify genes associated with child obesity).
Cruz López pointed out that this research is subject to the concern of health professionals by alarming increase in weight in children.
" Health surveys for 1999 and 2006 indicated that there had been an increase in the number of children, 77 per cent in obese and 47 per cent in obese women, and in terms of overcompensation, a dramatic rise was also observed," the IMSS expert noted.
He pointed out that the justification for the search for markers is supported by the fact that the country's population differs from others by their genetic history.
He reported that, on average, Mexico has 65 per cent of American Indian inheritances, 30 per cent of Europeans and 5 per cent of Africans, and this condition is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that generally the genetics of obesity are translated into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calorie) and stored in fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the full assessment of children, which enables them to detect whether they have some degree of obesity or obesity.
Including, he said, the presence of cloudy color patches (acantosis) in the neck and the front, indicating the likelihood of metabolic changes and even prediabetes.
The information is managed confidentially, the doctors deliver it in writing to the parents, who are told each of the measurements and changes in the life-style that must be made to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause obesity, obesity and other chronic disorders: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, to stay most of the day sitting in front of the TV and to use means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to the high caloric ingestion, i.e. the highest consumption of sugard beverages, of carbohydrates (tams, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high content in fats and proteins and the genetics analysed in this protocol.
UNAM's asphalt would avoid bugs
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the UNAM Chemicals College, develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signs that the floor was sent were observed, it would not be necessary to repair about 200 thousand baths per rainy season in the Metropolitan Valley area of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Najera, researcher at the UNAM Chemical Faculty (FQ), who ensured that if the construction and maintenance of an asphalt floor is the appropriate process, the baths could be reduced in quantity or, even, completely eliminated.
At its conference A technological opinion of the baches, delivered in the framework of the International Year of Chemicals, made it known that the laboratory in its charge develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Najera believed that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve its performance and therefore the formation of baches.
He explained that the asphalt, the most heavy part of petroleum, is a set of hydrocarbons molecules, some of the high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and others of low molecular weight, called maltens, which together give the floor its characteristic viscosity.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, behaves as a liquid, at 120 degrees centigrade its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees it has a nearly solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes broken, added.
The previous means that in the streets the asphalt resistance is not uniform, but is changing during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, the specialist warned in chemical engineering.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City in most of them are covered by flexible flooring, consisting of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve asphalt.
Among the most surface layers is the asphalt folder, which is made up of small asphalt stones and then compacted.
Each of the stones that forms the folder, he pointed, is bathed with asphalt.
By transferring vehicles and generating efforts, this allows the forces to spread very well on the floor.
If modified asphalt were to be treated, it would be even better spread, the chemical engineer thought.
On the asphalt folder, it is sufficient to place a last layer called a rotary folder, which is made of a fine stone material, i.e. an arena which also falls into asphalt.
As it is about the layer that will be in contact with the tires of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the road.
When the floor is part of the floor that will receive and spread efforts, the rotary folder also requires the appropriate thickness and the material of what is done must be taken care of.
The climate, particularly humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, in particular water, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the ground melts, the water spreads in the bottom of the folder and it is difficult to escape, this causes a re all the layers of the floor and therefore the formation of baches.
In the process of training a bache, he said, the first thing to waste is the film of rotation and only then the asphalt folder is affected, but the damage does not occur instantly, but it is a process that should be addressed to the first signals with appropriate maintenance programmes.
The member of the National System of Investigators explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the training of tyres and therefore the thickness of each of the tyres must always be relative to the vehicle load and ensure that it is carried out, in order to avoid frequent noise.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to study and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which are already found in other countries even on the market and allow for easy repair and without the need to use high temperatures.
What's wrong with Valle's candidate for the new Lady Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that took place so that Melina Ramírez Serna did not reach the crown of Ms. Colombia.
The Valley receives its title number 14 from Princess.
Again, the Vale del Cauca remains with the crowns of Missa Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to comply with being in the winning podium, to shine the crown of silver and the band that they believed as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where the Atlantic lady was raised with the crown and the crown, the department has already taken 14 titles from Princess and Melina to the law of Valecaucacan women who have been near the crown but who were princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanca, Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Rome (1993), Giselle Garces Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garces Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many are making is, What's wrong?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favour which in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Lady Colombia, not in the van she was elected Queen of the Police and Best Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that obtained queens such as Italiana Vargas or Natalie Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered to be the key to the decision that the jury took to appoint First Princess Raquel did not agree with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why? made by Martin Murillo Gómez, of the Literary Leamos Road.
In questioning the Valecaucacana answered:
"Leo much, I believe quite in literature, I think it's a way of culturalizing, definitely I think that the book that marked me as a child is "the beginning", it's a very deep book.
Currently I read "Crimen and punishment", is a universal literature book that we all must read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nimirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The Burning of Blood".
A response that rarely liked the term "culturalize" first and second by not explaining in a concrete way how each of the books quoted have marked it.
But at the end of Melina's ceremony, he showed himself to feel calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise to pass what it has to pass.
And for all people, please read a little bit, "The beginning" is a big book.
Among the hypotheses fired it is said that Valle burned her favoriteism.
A bogotian journalist pointed out that by being the preferred, the occupier and candidate who took all the preliminary prizes (Oster gastronomy network, the public vote for the best craft, and Queen Madre), "it woke up the feelings of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore did not shine in the stage".
And that was noted in his first presentation on bathroom in the beach of Hilton and his two files in the coronation glass.
Although in both secure lights, it was noted that he lacked the strength and strength of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osoriio, journalist of the program "As Home", of the RCN Canal, said that the fact that Melina was named Princess "confirms that the candidate who won the most prizes during the contest does not remain queen".
In addition, Valle showed himself to the last very wrong with the press, and there he went wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Belleza Competition.
For one thing, two days before the election, international jury Lucy Dougty showed that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social needs of her father.
"The beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, it is necessary to look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, which is already involved in projects before entering the Competition," he explained.
It is also estimated that Valle sinned for his faults in the latter and the fibrosis that was noted in his abdomen, but it is quite contradictory because the jury chose him as the candidate 'natural beauty' with the healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queen prepared by Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, which was better, "but her problem of fibrosis in the womb, that the truth for me was not very noticeable, made her points in the last day."
Among them, journalist Guido Hoyos, of the Cromos magazine, considered the error of the Valecaucacana to be the surgical interventions that took place.
"The surgeons are fine, but Valle is not supposed to do them.
His body was never his strength and here he was buried."
Because of this award, which for the first time delivered the National Beauty Competition, after the bath stand, a terrible Vatican came up last night, because it was said that this was the joy Raymundo gave to Melina in order not to give her the taste of the crown.
Indeed, whether or not, it is true that Melina has since begun a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as princess, position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international certifications for the designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will go through history as one of the queens who, despite her circled walk through Cartagena, was mistaken for the crown.
So it was the work of the camel that identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano.
Cali's lophoscopist went through history like the man who confirmed the death of "Alphonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
Last November 4th, a cali CTI lofoscopist passed through history as the man who confirmed the identity of the greatest chief of the Farcs: "Alphonso Cano", through the chain of his digital needles.
Of the seven lophoscopists working in the CTI section, that week he was touched by the "availability" tour of Eliazar González, a man in Puerto Tejada who has been working in the judicial investigation area for 21 years.
When he started his career, González worked in Chocó municipalities, where he often had to enter the forest for more than five days in order to reach the site where the corpses were to be identified.
In 2000, it was transferred to the capital of the Valley and, after performing the corresponding courses, was specialized in lophoscopy, which is the study of the skin of friction, namely the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against Alphonso Cano's aliases to Eliazar warned him to wear the minimum clothing for three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
Friday night he went out to the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that he was suspected that one of them was the man who led the world's oldest war, so they asked him to take Guillermo León Sáenz's Decadactial Card (his true name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the corpse was found, he did not recognize it because of his physical appearance, since it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was without beard, dressed as a peasant in the area, without gloves and much more delicate.
But the wolves don't believe.
Along with a galtonian lamp, tinta, a transplant and a linterna, Eliezer compared the dactaric impressions of the dead with the leaves of the map.
His eye didn't fail him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for confirming him to the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón, who was the chief of the Farcs.
Searching for the Hole
For a dactiloscopist of the Sijün de Cali, the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González in the press wheel by the operator against "Cano" is very significant.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactiloscopy is an exact science, without a margin of error, which can become the key to the resolution of crimes.
Apart from the identification of corpses, lophoscopists support investigations for crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the persons captured.
When they are caught, many criminals present false testimony or have no papers.
We take them with us and look for them in the database.
The investigator said that, in a hurry, he was moved to remove a piece of wall from a house, since in that place the thief had supported his hand to pull out a strong box full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to remove a dactial impression, but in that case we could get the hole from all hands and identify the offender, who had participated in different noises," he recalled.
The needles can also dissipate or reaffirm suspects in cases of murder.
A few years ago they found a dead man with licory bottles around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a family member could be suspected of the crime and, in fact, a hole in the matching bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that he has been the killer, he is located in the scene of the crime.
A CTI dactiloscopist explained that in the objects "the eggs are taken with chemical or physical reactions".
When they appear, a transplanter is used to lift them up.
After this, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI TV program.
Like not everything that shines is gold, not everything that touches turns yellow.
However, if it can be used, if the quota is carried out.
The "indefinitely" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators fell in front of the Zuccotti square to camp.
A large part listened to the departure order and moved to a nearby parking lot.
The integration of the Occupa Wall Street movement this morning challenged New York's authorities when they tried to enter again, under a court order, at Manhattan's place where they were expelled from the madrugada and when they tried to take another park from the Grand Manzana.
Hundreds of demonstrators flocked to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access a court order that allowed the "independent" to camp again in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the departure by occupying a park more north of the city, where there were new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp back in the square, we will install somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sittings and demonstrations," said one of the drivers of the "Occupa Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the "inhibited" to the departure of his campaign personally condemned by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced eviction of the place and allowed the protesters to remain in the camp.
In addition, the "independent" were in the occupation of a new park located in the confluence of the Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which is a New York and New Jersey, and property of the Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they were able to take over the place, but then the police called and tried to stop some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the actual number, while he assured Efe that he saw several journalists who were also married.
The organization ensures that there are several hundred people who have been installed at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already been moved in a demonstration of support to the elements of the movement and has tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti square - which is a recent private property - remains closed to the expectation of the celebration of a judicial view scheduled for this same March in which the legality of the eviction of this poor must be analysed.
Some of the delegates who were moved there carried and distributed copies of that court order these hours and even delivered them to the officers who kept the square, which caused "some small confrontations," reported Bray, who complained that some officials had caused attacks on the protesters.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities from disseminating the members of Occupa Wall Street or applying "laws published after they began the occupation or prohibiting the protesters from re-entering the park with shops or other properties they used earlier".
The mayor Bloomberg pointed out in front of the press that because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and to the demonstrators, who warned, however, that local laws would not allow them to re-install with camping shops and sleeping bags.
The director personally defended the eviction carried out by the Zuccotti plaza, an operation in which about 200 arrests were committed and which was decided because the protesters were "inviolating the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered that the square be evacuated because it was being converted "to a place where people would not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to harm others", because "some businesses had received threats" and neighbors had "for their quality of life".
"The removal of this drug was harsh and shows that in the Bloomberg fund it is more interested in preserving the financial interests of the US workers than it is," added the spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of "missing respect for freedom of expression".
The "Occupa Wall Street" officials also indicated that they were thinking of organizing "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community and union organizations, to commemorate the two months during which the protests began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on a special television tour
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television program "It's to Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1st
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant at "Home Improvement", assistant at "Baywatch", known as "Playboy", the wife of the rock music Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Canadian television Christmas.
The private CTV TV channel announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (baladist) Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television program "It's to Russell Peters Christmas" the next 1 December giving life to a very particular Virgin María.
CTV distributed today images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide distribution on the Internet of a pornographic video house in which it appears together with his then husband, the battery of "Mötley Crée", Tommy Lee, appears dressed like the Virgin Mary holding a baby who represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a Canadian comical native who recently acted as a representative in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears like Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the special tour of CTV has the Canadian singer Bublé, who finally married Buenos Aires with the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and who is not foreign to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the U.S. Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan rebirth after the earthquake
GDP increases by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the drop spiral that started in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still convalescent by the earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the country has suffered since World War II.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo accounted for the material losses of $300 million, a blow that, despite the difficult world context, seemed to have been slowed down.
After three consecutive trimesters of fall, the date of the Gross Internal Product between July and September served as a page, definitely: the GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% at an analytic rate.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also suggests the highest growth rate from January to March 2010.
The recovery is, in part, explained by the response of the purchase of machinery to restore the areas of seismo and later tsunamis.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the decline of 0.9% in capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first delay after six months of uninterrupted rise.
However, the real revolving Japanese economy is not based solely on the Kenyan impulse that invites the crisis to be used to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructures, to use the gaps to grow from zero.
Japan has, above all, woke up due to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60 per cent of Japanese GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, driven by increased expenditure in vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The y-axis
Tokyo has been ordered to the internal market, when the yen - the Nipon currency - has become one of the "values of refuge" selected by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro area and the U.S. forecasted turbulence, a privilege that weighs as a burden on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products become more expensive abroad, a serious return to a country whose economic fluctuation line is determined by the health of the major technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, had their weak results between July and September at the cost of yen.
While markets continue with their asylum in the peripheral countries of the EU, Yoshihiko Noda's Government is not under guard.
"You must be aware of the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand's floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And, in fact, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most member countries had presented in September the most recent signs of economic slowdown.
The indicator that anticipates the global economy's inflation points has highlighted that the main powers are undermining.
Since it fell four decades to the 100.4 points, compared to the 100.8th of August.
The euro area, even below the average, which is at level 100, was estimated at eight decimal places up to 99.13 points.
Atenas re-eats the doubts
Papady says the adjustments will be approved, but the conservators will not sign any written commitment.
With lost peripheral risk premiums and the uncertainty re-installed in the parks, Greece continues to grow in the labyrinth leading to the emergence of the major debt crisis in Europe.
The sense that the "consensual" of the new Greek Transitional Government is more taxed by the requirements of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lucas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days agreed upon in his appointment might be short to apply them, the leader of the Conservative Party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his requirement for new elections for the scheduled date on 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the summit on 26 October," Papadimos advised us to open yesterday a parliamentary debate that will conclude tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to encourage employment, reform of the disciplinary code of staff and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
The message of Samaras, however, does not raise doubts about its position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the Transitional Government, but we have committed nothing more."
The conservative leader was a longer step in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that need to unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not give a good look at any sign of compliance with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, which is still affected by the order of the Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its requirement is firm: it will not block aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that Troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "what is needed to pay the sixth tramo" of 8,000 million, although there is no final date.
The Greek madeja still has hair for the wheel.
Ms. Sofia: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Kingdom highlights Spain's "premier" position in relation to this type of funding
Spain "has reached a world-wide position in the role of Microfinances".
The Queen of Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has been converted into the second donor of the plant in relation to this cooperation instrument, whose "exit" pointed out to be a " instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity, based on confidence in human being".
The Queen opened the World Summit on Microcredit in Valladolid yesterday with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations in the 2015 horizon, and "very, particularly with the goal of reducing the volume of people living with income below a daily dollar, which sets the "poverty threshold".
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task "responsibility", said Doña Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions originating in the Summit, which will extend until Thursday, "ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
They are "many achievements" and "many challenges we face".
The Microcredit Summit was raised not only as a forum for debate but also as the platform since which to push "two basic goals".
Thus, His Majesty explained that it is hoped that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and hundreds of millions of these households will come from the poverty threshold in which they are raised.
The momentum in the design of microcredits in Spain and in the rest of the world "has followed the campaign launched years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighting Doña Sofia as a "cause of justice and recognition".
And it is that he described the father of this tool as a "adorable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work has been known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about the land her loan policy.
A year later, the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Costa de Marfil in 1999, Canada, and "I have all been able to identify the continuing evolution," explained His Majesty, whose connection with this project was worth yesterday the qualification of the "family head" gathered in Valladolid by the "poor boat".
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded its intervention by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and seeking solutions to advance the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity is "a ethical imperative" for all democratic states.
In this sense, it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries in times of economic prosperity, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered microcredit to be "a serious and strict policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and now "more than never" the Governments of developed countries should work under the criteria of solidarity and not let it be the victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit consists of "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
On his part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, commended "the success" for giving "trust" to people "excluding those who closed the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens their infected doors of the solid spirit".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President for universal surcharge
The first day of the Christian-Democratic Union Congress (CDU), on Monday 14 November in Leipzig, has passed without great difficulty for Angela Merkel, Canciller and President of the Christian-Democratic Party.
At first, the future of Europe had not been included in the agenda, but the issue was put forward in autumn, in particular in order to satisfy the soldiers who consider the government's policy to be too narrow with the Greeks and could be in a future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Directorate, was adopted unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against and ten abstentions were recorded.
The standing ovulation of several minutes that were won, with its interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Eurofilo Minister of Finance, cast any doubt.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summarized in a note: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe represents peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
To Canciller, "the time has come to open the way to Europe."
This could be reflected in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to allow for the strengthening of the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also take place in the election of the President of the European Commission for universal surcharge in order to "be a face to Europe".
In any case, that is one of the motions adopted by the Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
Without a doubt, it is unlikely that the Ventitians will quickly come to an agreement on this radical change: Great Britain is hostile to him and the CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates have rejected by a large majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country in the European Central Bank Directive on the basis of the weight of each economy, which would obviously strengthen Germany's weight.
Concerned about calming the souls inside her party, the Chancellor has increased her references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has not tried to win her convention at the expense of the "little" European countries or countries in difficulty willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the movement on Europe devotes a part to the importance of "the French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except for the past.
Remember, two centuries ago, a bloody battle took place in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for the Napoleonic army.
The incidence of fraud in the poor by disease
After subsidies, the UMP and the Government commit an offence against the poor by disease.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday 15 November in Burdeos to visit a responsible family subsidy box and to give a speech on the topic, which has been running since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which is part of the will to save in a strict manner, but still remembers an axis of the presidential campaign of right, most want to focus on the lows by disease.
Firstly, in order to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose a fourth day of unemployment on private workers before it is able to catch the down.
Finally, unless a specific company agreement exists, a worker who falls sick would lose four days of pay, i.e. a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
It is a measure that could raise an oil of anger, but that would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose on employees a day of unemployment without wages in the case of low wages (to date, they do not have a shortage, against the three days that apply in the private sector).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority are refocusing on the table as well as the issue of fraud, this time leading to the abuses of workers.
"There will be considerable increase in controls and, in addition, if someone is found guilty of fraud, he will have to reimburse the amounts," Xavier Bertrand warned speaking in the RTL on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement seem slightly disproportionate to the reality of the fraud in the labour market.
In fact, there has been a constant follow-up to this issue since 2002 and various offensive policies have been launched that have usually resulted.
The French do not suffer more than in the rest of Europe.
Let us note, firstly, national figures.
According to the French Institute of Social Security (CNAM), in 2006 more than EUR 237 million were allocated to low-employment benefits.
According to the French Institute for Health Research and Documentation, low-income subsidies represented 5 per cent of health expenditure in 2008, rising to EUR 11.300 million.
Of this sum, 46 per cent corresponds to maternity and occupational accidents, while 54 per cent is related to the disease rates, a figure of up to €6,200 million.
As a result, 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French had taken an average of 14.5 working days, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
A media that certainly conceals deviations: another survey published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management of Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed that they had not taken a day off by disease.
Another study, in this case of Assurance disease, indicated that in 2010 37 per cent of patients had a duration of less than 8 days, 22 per cent between 8 and 14 days, 15 per cent between 15 days and one month, 15 per cent between one and three months and 11 per cent were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbours, French workers are not more suitable than in other areas to take lows by disease.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall unemployment rate (both for health and other reasons) was between 10 per cent and 11 per cent in France, compared to 20 per cent and 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom or between 16 per cent and 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The fraud in the poor by disease is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
The fraud has a very limited scope.
The strengthening of legislation, since 2002, has resulted in the systematic monitoring of disease-related diseases for more than 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, CNAM verified, in a 13 per cent of 285,000 conducted, that short-term lows were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37.050 cases.
In the case of lows of more than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, 11 per cent of the cases were considered to be "dependable or unjustifiable; a figure which, having a total of 1.2 million, amounts to 132.000.
As a result, a total of 169,000 "unjusted" cases are achieved among several million workers who were suffering from a disease.
There is no doubt a significant figure in comparison, for example, with black work.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a loss of tax revenue of between EUR 9000 and EUR 15 000 million per year, i.e. more than the total cost of low subsidies and, of course, considerably more than the fraud in this last area.
Papadémos: Greece must apply a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to address its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémo said on Monday 14 November before Parliament; he also added that the hundreds of days that had been granted to his Government of Union would not suffice to achieve that goal.
"To make efforts to recover the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who delivered his first public talk during the opening of the debate on the vote on confidence in Parliament Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro area Summit on 27 October will be the "primary task" of the new government, since "is in play" the country's country's stay in the euro area has been added.
As a result, Papadémos has foreseen that the country's public deficit will be reduced "to around 9 per cent" of GDP before the end of the year, after reaching 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, head of the right group, expressed his support for the measures already adopted to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not compromise with additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said during a meeting with the members of his "New Democracy" party.
He pointed out that he was in agreement with the objectives of reducing deficits and debt, as well as combating deficits, but against any policy that prevents economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not block the loan of €8,000 million needed without a written guarantee of support from all parties to the measures envisaged, Antonio Samaras has replied that his word would be sufficient and that it would not sign anything because of external pressure.
A Committee of Experts states that euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized
Canadians live by refusing to die, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
In relation to palliative care, the Committee claims that Governments, health care institutions and doctors cooperate to ensure better palliative care, not only in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives by denying death.
In fact, only 9 per cent of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they wish to die and take provisions for this purpose.
It is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included the participation of six experts from various areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee recommends that the Government amend the Penal Code so that the assisted suicide and euthanasia be allowed when the patient is raised and has been judged competent to take the decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent survey of the United Economist of Intelligence that compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the world.
Although Canada holds the tenth place, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to deal with the subject of death".
With or without medication, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And although most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6 per cent of them have died in the hospital.
In total, the highest rate in this regard is Quebec, where 86% of the deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that do not match the federal government's position, which has already stated that they do not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, experts say that they have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they have not been considered a criminal offence has not caused an abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or suicide assisted with non- competent persons or that they have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, the co-rapporteur, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, there were more excesses in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
"In Canada, euthanasia is practiced, although clearly illegal."
"In Canada the assisted suicide is practiced, although clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downnie.
Canadians, in favor of euthanasia
We recall that 85 per cent of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia, since they believe that it would allow people whose death is near to ease their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
In addition, 66% believe that the fact of legalizing euthanasia will not make it clear that the lives of elderly or disabled people have less value.
With regard to persons who have been involved in the murder, 41 per cent of the respondents felt that a process should not be initiated against them.
With regard to the maintenance or interruption of health care for a patient, the situation is not so clear, as the authors of the report indicate.
Furthermore, among its recommendations it is suggested that the Criminal Code indicates that withdrawal of health care, if legally refused, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained to respect the fact that a patient rejects assistance at the end of his or her life without fear of facing a complaint.
In relation to palliative care, the Committee claims that Governments, health care institutions and doctors cooperate to ensure better palliative care, not only in cancer cases.
Finally, in relation to the palliative or terminal session, which is already widely used in the health institutions of Canada, the Committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it be considered euthanasia and subject to the same procedures.
Other experts show reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed their reservations with regard to the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a health specialist, has qualified as "extreme" the position of experts who sign the report, among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to terminally ill patients.
"This leaves the door open to a situation in which someone who is tired of living and has more than 18 years can ask for help to kill himself," Deschamps said, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
Now, add that "in society, there are labels and limitations".
Health expert Margaret Somerville also expressed his "strong opposition" with regard to the conclusions of the report, which qualified as "manifest for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, is particularly critical of the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan urges President El Asad to abandon power
Damascus charges a "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bachar El Asad's supporters appeared yesterday before the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday the diplomatic pressure on the Syria of Bachar El Asad was intensified which, with Russia's support, resisted and complained that there was a "complot" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened the sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, have demonstrated their support for the withdrawal of power by President Asad.
King Abdalá II of Jordan was the first Arab leader to ask President Bachar El Asad to "remove power" in Syria, where a quarter of civilians and members of the regime have already disappeared.
"If Bachar is really concerned about his country, he should give up, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview to the BBC.
On the other hand, the chief of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has regretted that the mediation efforts that have taken place in Turkey since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have failed.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their people and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, saying to Syria, a neighbouring country with regard to which Turkey is adopting a more difficult position.
On the other hand, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has observed that it has "encouraged the consensus against Asad and the actions of the Syrian regime".
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the League of Arab States and other countries, such as Turkey, are taking a more difficult tone" with regard to the repression in Syria, notes Mark Toner, spokesman for the Department of State.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians have already lost their lives and at least 19 members of the regime forces in the region of Dera, south of Syria, as the Syrian Human Rights Observer (OSDH) has announced.
Other two civilians have fallen "in the face of bombs and shootings with heavy amplifiers in Jobar" in Homs' city, according to the NGO.
During a press round, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem considers by his side that the country "progresses towards the end of the crisis".
In addition, he has responded firmly to the Arab League's decision to suspend its functions, which, in its opinion, constitutes a "hazardous step".
Syria's "will not fail," he added, ensuring that "computers caught against Syria will fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a " civil protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé has also expressed support for the sending of UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which, in his view, is rooted in "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held in Rabat in the morning to highlight the implementation of the outcome plan adopted on 2 November, which provides, in particular, the withdrawal of armed forces from the cities in the hands of opposition and the release of detainees.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov considered yesterday the Arab League's decision "inaccurate" while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, although it did not express its support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Mounting takes time for markets and sacrifices to Italians
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to train their equipment and launch a programme that will include "sacrifices" aimed at recovering the credibility lost during the last few months of the Government of Berlusconi.
The former European Commissioner discussed with political parties yesterday, and today he met with trade unions and patronage.
It should form a relatively restricted office, composed of external technologies to Parliament.
"Monti has talked about a broad programme with numerous sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups who participated in the meetings after meeting with the President of the Council appointed.
On the other hand, the President of the Chamber of Members, Gianfranco Fini, has stated that he expects Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence in Parliament before Friday to ensure that the new Government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation, by Mr Monti, of a limited list, of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitan.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of the bourgeois market and the mandatory yesterday, asking for time.
In the "democratic, there are times that are necessary" to form a government and prepare its programme, he stressed, adding that it is "sure that markets will have patience and understanding".
Its appointment by the President was initially blessed by the markets, but then concern was raised, particularly after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should create a team primarily formed by technocrats, even if he has emphasized that he would like to include "politicals".
The new Government will have to function until 2013, the date of the next legislation, considering.
According to the President of the Chamber of Members, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will receive Parliament's confidence vote before Friday.
Monti has committed himself to working on the task, taking into account the urgency and with the aim of Italy "recovering its protagonism" in Europe.
A spokesman from European Commissioner Olli Rehn pointed out that "including a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of achieving a budgetary balance in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted over the past few months, has requested the adoption of new restrictive measures.
The Italian "chief of chiefs" Emma Marcagglia, who will see the scale, also insisted on the need to push the economy, "because a country that does not grow cannot respect the requirements on deficit".
Monti, famous for its competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "time change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconomism"; the "profesor" symbolizes "the challenge of the seriousness" and "other Italy", according to editors.
The great unknown will be the length of your team.
The Napolitan President wants to avoid early elections, as Italy has to put some 200 million euros in State bonds before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, according to an American NGO specializing in atomic risk on Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that United Nations agency.
The IAEA expressed its "great concern" last week by a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based extensively on AIAA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear center in Cheliabinsk (Ural) and had participated in the production of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, it would have left the centre to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamantes" in Kiev.
The economic problems of his company would have led him to contact Iran's Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Subsequently, it is believed that it cooperated with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its final report, the IAEA stated that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert who not only knew the technique but also, according to a Member State informed the Agency, worked during most of its course in that technology in the military programme of its country of origin".
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by nearly 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while, during the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased slightly, according to the statistics published by the FBI on Mondays.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence against Muslims from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, that is, has increased by 49 per cent, compared with a rise of 13 per cent in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4 per cent in anti-religious crimes and a total increase of 14 per cent in the number of crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has increased slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% are due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that this type of crime and crime has again increased," stressed the Human Rights First Human Rights Organization, "the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First takes a long time to point out that violence against Muslims, as well as all kinds of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds an organization's official, Paul Legendre.
"The United States Government can and must strive to put an end to such abuses," he added, considering that such efforts could include an improvement in police reports on "hate crimes".
The "violence crime" in the U.S. federal law was inherited from the time of the civil rights struggle.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging Twitter site changed Monday's presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people who follow, which causes their service to look a little more like Facebook.
A new "activation" tab and another called "number" allow more legally and directly the activity of other "Twittos", i.e. those online whose messages "tweets" continue on the Internet or follow you.
This lets you know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they prefer some message, etc.
This new Twitter formula was approved "with a small percentage of users in August" before spreading it to the rest of the network on Mondays, according to the AFP Twitter portal, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its functionamento little instinctivo, with terms slightly esoteric (RT to send a message from another person, followfriday to recommend follow another user) doing the pleasure of the initiative, opens a wider audience with a more comparable management than that of large public Facebook and Google+ networks.
On the network, users have debated the "tweets" hit with different opinions the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, it's invasive and it looks too much on Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The function Activity will help me follow some elements of my Twitter stream better," writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a budgetary "gold rule" in the Constitution
The Government of the Great Social/Democratic Coalition that is in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a budget rule to reduce public deficit and thus avoid a possible degradation of Austria's sovereign note by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when Austria's public debt reached 74.6 per cent, a very higher figure than the maximum 60 per cent limit set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly lower than the debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency is reduced at a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay 3,000 million euros more in interest every year," said Vicecanciler Democrat of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindeleger.
Austria therefore responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to the euro area member countries on 26 October: in it, Heads of State and Government requested the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a Law with equivalent value.
The device adopted by the Austrian Government is closer to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt that "rule".
Prior to 2017, the structural public deficit should be reduced annually by 0.75 per cent of gross domestic product (PIB) and, from 2017 onwards, the federal government's structural deficit should not exceed 0.35 per cent of GDP per year, while regional States, as well as the municipalities, should submit balanced budgets.
The objective is to reduce public debt by 2020/2021 under the 60 per cent criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A Strong End
Threat node with a new intervention in the exchange market
The Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene in the marking of the change if it continued to increase.
"We'll enter, as we did last time, if we'll check that there's too much flying" in the kind of change of yen, explained Noda to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to a level close to the greatest historical developments that had taken place by the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
That day, Tokyo sold massive amounts of yeen dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared with the US currency.
But the yin has been constantly reimbursing since then, driven by the purchases of investors who consider it a "value of refuge" in these times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar to be reimbursed on Tuesday at least 77 and the euro has fallen below the 105-year symbolic bar, reaching near levels that have led to the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was estimated to be around 120 and the euro to more than 160.
This explosion of the Japanese dividend damages the exports of the archipelago, as it affects Made products in Japan and reduces the value of foreign revenues obtained by Japanese companies when they convert them to the national currency.
"Japan is fighting for reconstruction" after the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March, which destroyed the region of Tohoku (norest), highlighted Noda, who fears that the incarceration of the yen cut root will be the weak recovery.
The third world economic power has recovered growth in the third quarter (a 1.5 per cent relative to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister considers that the high level of yen did not reflect the "economic bases of Japan".
Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy Council on Tuesday, which takes all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the Deputy Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", making it clear that more monetary flexibility should not be expected for Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the Emission Institute increased its purchases to five billion yeen (EUR 47,000 million), bringing to the 55 billion yen (EUR 519 billion) the threshold of the funds devoted to the acquisition of various financial securities in order to distort the liquidity market.
Euro area:
growing type, floating boxes
The risk of exposure to the debt crisis continues to damage the European index.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the types of weaker countries continue to grow.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, European bags are being thrown a little further in the negative area on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 hours, CAC 40 loses 1.4% and is located at 3.064 points.
The Dax lost a 0.4% in Frankfurt and in London a 0.1%.
"In view of the new tensions with regard to the performance of the most affected euro area loans, the world's burgeoning markets continue to be part of their recent gains."
"Inverters, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contact," explains Terry Pratt, institutional director at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Bolsa has closed with a drop of 0.7%, renewing market stakeholders' concerns about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed view in Europe and exchanges will continue to be made in a margin of reduced variations, so that investors will not have proof that the situation has been stabilized," believes Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The recovery of concerns over the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to fall in March.
The euro has remained at its lowest level for a month and a half.
At 10 hours the European currency was worth $1,3570, a fall of 0.4%.
According to the corridors, it has lost value after the CDU Party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who met on Monday at Congress, adopted a motion which provides, in particular, the option of a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish types exceed 6% growth
The types of credit from Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of the Italian obligations for 10 years reached 6.85 per cent, while the Spanish securities at the same time offered 6.2 per cent.
These tensions with regard to the types of interests of the countries of the South, even in France, continue to feed the fears of the stakeholders.
The head of the future Italian Government, Mario Monti, has asked for time for the markets to improve the situation in Italy, which is at risk of putting up with the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, on his part, has stated that the implementation of decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be the "main work" of his Government.
Spain is located on the market point of view, while the legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The "spread" difference between commitments to 10 years in Germany and Spain has reached a new maximum historical level.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
From the statistical point of view, France has recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, i.e. a more favourable figure than the projected 0.3%, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has reviewed the second quarter's figure below, with a reduction of 0.1% of gross domestic product (PIB) instead of an excretion.
In addition, the fourth quarter is what really concerns economists.
Germany, for its part, has recorded an increase of 0.5 per cent in the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are foreseen at 11 hours after the European Commission has warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must be worth more than the dogmas
If there is a subject that cannot be dealt with taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an electoral meeting be the time to reflect on these issues and on the location of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it examines the whole of the economic, social and environmental consequences of the options proposed.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7,000 million people on the planet, demographic developments will double the demand for electricity by 2050, unless it is devoted to a large part of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, there will be a growing lack of fossil resources to continue producing electricity, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
That is not the case in Belgium, which underlines the need to find a source of the ability to replace it, nor Switzerland, which aims only to build centres of the last generation.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, by citing some examples, continue with determination with their projects.
The United States, on the other hand, after Fukushima, decided to add a unit to its park, re-establishing the construction of a interrupted centre following the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on renewable energy, is presented on occasions, for example, the reality goes against such speech.
Berlin's election will provide a guarantee of electricity price, a greater energy dependence on the increased demand for imported gas, in particular in Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions by the construction of gas and carbon centres.
Within a few months, harmful effects will be noted.
You need to think about Denmark's case.
Europe's field in the green sector, of which 30 per cent of its electricity, is also one of the major coal and gas users due to wind intermittent; therefore, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are 65 per cent and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the constant nature of our energy policy, our neighbors make an electricity bill up to 40% higher than the French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from Europe's cheaper electricity.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would entail a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would remain realistic to the wonderful declarations on the re-industrialization of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.
It is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, they do not manifest a principle of opposition to that type of energy, according to the survey.
We recall that our country's energy policy has lost building an industrial sector with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely oriented to export, it covers a galaxy of pymes specialized in international markets and which can create non-local jobs.
If France decided to give up nuclear energy, it would subsist most of those SMEs and the loss of EUR 6,000 million per year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician would be responsible for an EPR designed to work for sixty years when its manufacturer's destruction is planned?
In order to solve the equation of nuclear energy, it must be admitted that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, as well as no diabolic source.
The development of low CO2, nuclear and renewable solutions by Areva demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the maximum level of safety.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises strict and transparent control over existing centres and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognised professionality, are also obsessed with security.
In the middle of the century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, on Three Mile Island, was produced under normal operating conditions; it did not cause any consequences for people or for the environment.
In Chernobil, the accident was due to the reactor design and some unforgivable human errors.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude, which caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this incident, as did the previous two.
Thanks to these progress and cooperation between the security authorities and the French and German operators, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While studying it all the electrical actors who want to build a center, the interruption of their construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the Areva and EDF competitors, as they would be free to assume leadership in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and divisive manoeuvres dominate a very important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a load or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from various points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the digital policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France's "State of Human Rights".
More recently, it is the administrative appeal of foreign students that has jumped to the titlers, with the Minister of Interior (see the release newspaper of 23 May), declaring in the past that France "does not need foreign talent, workers or maids".
However, it is rarely examined from the economic point of view.
The question is that, on this issue, there is enough consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac stated in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country with about two million migrant workers", while on the left, the tone fixed Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot be responsible for all the world's poverty" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both left and right shared the fear of invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish sources.
On both sides, immigrants are considered to be a burden to the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which immigrants act.
In its programme, François Holland is limited to include bananas, indicating that the code development will allow for the solution to the "a problem of migration".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be selectively cost-effective, but economically it's going very far.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work that summarizes the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exclusive People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
The limitation of immigration weakens growth and affects employment.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, in particular the low-qualified, with pressure to reduce their wages.
But experience shows that immigrants are, in fact, better complementary than substitutes from national workers and are mainly engaged in professions in low-employment sectors.
Low-qualified immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where training does not meet staff requirements.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a lack of anaesthetics, complementaryity between national and immigrant immigrants has led to a positive impact on national wages and employment.
In view of the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% of the migration flows would result in a rise in real wages in the long term between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of the Nobel Prizes of nature and businesses such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, as they contribute an average of 1 per cent of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization, for example, calculates that a 30-year-old immigrant in Germany will make a net contribution of EUR 150,000 to public budgets throughout its lifetime.
At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go looking for the growing points that he lacked "with his teeth".
These teeth, which disturbed immigrants, had exactly the reverse effect.
Europe has invented democracy, only it needs to be thought of in a European democracy
Democracy is a precious asset, but it is also fragile.
The European continent should be able to agree with this because, although it was invented in Athens over two thousand years ago, throughout the 20th century, it has suffered the tragedies of World War, totalitarianism, Holocaust, Google, but also in France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonies in Greece.
Some may have thought that, in order for democracy to be definitively triumph over its enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise the vote and in a more direct manner possible.
We know, since Napoleon's "the Little One" it was about something to think about.
The universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough alone and can even be converted into a "pressure instrument", as former Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, education, Light, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we live in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek reference had, in this regard, a dual revealing effect: it showed the need for a strong return from the political sphere, but also the worrying feeling of its incompatibility, of its incomprehensibility.
You have to think about this ambivalent to overcome it.
The truth is that the lines ahead of the democratic battle have now been moved and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer making good progress.
We will not succeed if we require a succession of national references, organized according to needs and inseparably.
A signature in white to the absolute European monarch or a high to the vacuum of the nationalist yoke: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to make any attacks, but a common exercise of full law, peace and continuity, of options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to end the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that falls under the orders of the markets and the rating agencies, which suffer from their impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers from international humiliation.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is that popular sovereignty will recover the team of the European project.
Because only together can Europeans reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare their future through investment.
The outcome of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
After a long struggle against this proposal by socialists and Jacques Delors, the whole world is currently asking for a European economic governance.
That's it.
But thinking about it without more political and democratic integration, and without living as such by citizens, would be a new joke and lead us to a new point of death.
We must take a new stage in European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
The Revolution motivated by interest would not be sufficient.
This lesson is still applicable.
We must build a more integrated Europe from the economic perspective.
Only a more democratic Europe can be achieved at political level, a true European popular sovereignty.
To build Europe, we make Europeans.
Cards with no "Contact" chips are generalised
The world chip card world salon begins Tuesday in Villapinte, near Paris, with an optimistic environment.
In fact, 2011 should end with an increase of 11 per cent in global card sales with microprocessors (banknotes, SIM telephones, etc.), with a total of 6,000 million units, according to estimates from the Eurosmart office.
The most powerful segment is the technology without contact, which allows you to subscribe to the common transport or purchases by simply approaching the card to a reader.
This year will be sold worldwide 460 million cards with no contact chip, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share should continue to grow in 2012 (580 million units) and represent about 10% of the world market for chip cards (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which takes a long time for the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining land in the non-contact payment sector.
About 26 million bank cards Visa already have this function, which is accepted in 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa cards are being used without contact.
But the big surfaces work for four.
Carrefour sent this year 2.5 million cards Pass MasterCard without contact.
In order to take the lead, however, banks need to make them available to their customers.
"There are two large French institutions that have committed themselves to systematically disseminate in the future, among their clients, bank cards from the non-connected system," Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France, announced.
Banks proved the payment by mobile phone
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment for the future: mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC technology (Near Field Communication), which are essential for carrying out transactions.
"They're cutting."
"But in order to experience a real increase in the coming year."
"We expect to sell between 80 and 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The Agricultural Credit Bank announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Cain.
The iPhones will be equipped with about 200 clients and collaborators with a fund that allows the payment to be paid without contact.
The ECB has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marsella.
And the General Society has also stated yesterday that it is preparing for the marketing of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact through their mobile phone.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is rising
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the Al Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Magreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, which had been suspected for some time, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even said that Argel already "has the certainty".
"The way both organizations operate and the intelligence services reports show that they are cooperating," he explained, without adding more details.
Paris seems to reach a similar conclusion.
The investigation of two French kidnappings in Niger last January would have reopened the passports.
Arrested at a Niamey restaurant by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the following day with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
On the scale of the intervention, French and Nigerian researchers discovered several telephone chips belonging to terrorists.
The enemy of terrorism.
The study of the calls carried out indicates that several participants based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria are involved.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers especially caught the interest of researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who has stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, where Boko Haram and the other to a man who is apparently close to Aqmi and the sect.
"It is progress, but we must certainly expect to have more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "supports" have been more and more evident in the evolution and speech of Boko Haram or in its operational ways, which now involve the use of increasingly complex Kamchatkas or explosive devices and the same style as used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pressing Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, take time to consider the group as a community of liters of little interest.
A Speedy Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and an Islamic fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (which means, at home, "western education is a sin"), encourages the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing a rapid success.
It is political and requires strict respect for the Sharia, while its soldiers are engaged in the fight against the central impudent government.
These last are primarily directed to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram's militias were particularly active and the attacks against the commissioners were multiplied.
Abuya's reaction was, as usual, generalized.
The army attacked the city and 800 deaths were recorded.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, receives death in prison.
Since then, the sect is radicalized and leaves its flames in the north.
The Navidities Passes require an alert that causes 80 deaths in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuya, in particular the police security headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of this type.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters became its first international objective.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would cover from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, concerns all security experts.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and Al-Cebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all information".
The World According to Republican Candidates to the Presidency
With regard to China, Iran and Israel, Mit Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry, they revaliate in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
A America weakened by the crisis, can you manage a complex world with simple ideas or, even, simple?
By listening to Republican candidates for presidentials, voters might think so.
A few days ago, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates made more upbuilding statements and foreign policy commitments, traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.
The lips, often unfounded, over China, Iran, are extended to help Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best candidate on the road to the designation by the Grand Old Party, has threatened to bring the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "by manipulation of their currency", a key issue in a America that is expected by the migration of entire segments of its sector to Asia.
As if that meant the explosion of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, an ancient Obama Ambassador in China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost closes to an attitude that "abulls" emotions.
He has requested a strong, but constructive dialogue with Pekin (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who remains in the depths of the probes, remains unheard of.
To Reagan Style
Romney has also promised military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to break its nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he whispered.
"If Obama gets re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of failing his obligations in relation to that partner.
Businesser Herman Cain, the second best-classed candidate, shows shameless ignorance of such topics.
Recently, he tried to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "has tried to develop nuclear capacity", apparently ignoring the fact that China has already had the military atom since 1964.
Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says that he is willing, on his part, to deploy the US Army in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The resort to torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, also preconceived Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are significant with the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
The opposition of the current President replied that Reagan also had simple ideas and that the Cold War had won.
They remember that Obama himself was an abetted and that he had to put the pistoon on combating terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their innovative dialogue with Iran, the premature exit of Iraq's "boys" and its tertiversizations in Libya, and label it weak.
But the attacks don't make them easy.
The population judges in a more positive way the national security balance of Obama, which ended with Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, there has been a lack of confidence in military intervention that generates a defeat.
And, arguing that it is necessary to rebuild America economically in order to raise its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more just.
The North Stream, new Russian gas entrance door in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, which directly communicates Western Europe with Russia through the Baltic Sea, has already been in service.
Gas must be provided to meet the needs of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great pump.
Last March, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated in the streets of the Baltic, between orchestra music and a delicate buffet, in the opening of the North Stream, the new gas pipeline that directly communicates, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Accordingly, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, have driven along the wheel that controls Russian gas entry into the western European network.
With this new pipeline, each year it will reach 27.5 million cubic metres of additional Russian gas to Western Europe through a 1,224 km first tube that communicates the region of St. Petersburg with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube should be concluded at the end of 2012 to provide a total of 55,000 million cubic metres of gas, i.e. sufficient to cover the entire French consumption.
In addition, it is already about the possibility of building a third pipe by the same route.
For Gazprom, the end of this huge work presents a win area.
Poland and the Baltic countries had firmly opposed the project.
In fact, the North Stream will allow direct gas supply to Germany, avoiding land transit by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Unfortunately, these two countries lose some of their power: it will be more difficult for them to influence Russia by putting it in danger of closing access to the markets in Western Europe.
In the light of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the North Stream as a "new fraternal-Soviet-Soviet pact" with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the subject is politically delicate.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of Europe's energy, as the project has generated a gap between the Western and Western Europeans.
Russia has been able, in just five years, to triune its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, large gas consumers and with increasingly limited reserves.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our association with Russia, a new artery that unites us organically," François Fillon confirmed during the opening of the gas pipeline, demonstrating to what extent the large gas sector contracts are as political as economic as possible.
All of this explains the broad sounds in the faces of the Gasprom directives, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline also implies technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of cement-recovered steel to protect it from the waves of ships.
It is supported in the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid mines from World War II.
"It was necessary to withdraw or destroy a hundred of them, by caution," says Jens Müller, a spokesman for North Stream society.
It was also necessary to eliminate the protection measures for the fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal mirror that weighs as 242 Eiffel Towers and is not interrupted throughout its length: either by valves or by maintenance stations.
A control platform was foreseen in the waters of Sweden, but the project's managers gave up on the fact that the Swedish people were not very willing to allow a Russian state society to be established permanently in the sea at its shores.
"In case of averaging, we'll interrupt the gas step in less than a minute," needs Jens Müller.
In the case of escape, the gas of the pipeline will therefore be released to the atmosphere.
However, constructioners consider it unlikely that a flight will occur, as they have planned alliances that, according to the forecasts, will have one flight every 100,000 years.
The control of the status of the gas pipeline shall be ensured by a submarine robot drawn by a vessel carrying out external inspections, as well as by a device that circles through the gas pipeline inside.
With the shape of a pure, it enters inside the tube, which has a diameter of a meter, and moves with gas.
At its arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible metal deformities.
The gas pipeline has been designed to operate for five years without any need for repair.
Gas circulation is guaranteed simply by pressure.
At first it is 200 bars and, at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have united their forces to carry out this project.
The lead company is Gazprom, which holds 51 per cent of the participants.
To her, the Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French GDF Suez group (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint company called Nord Stream, responsible for building and exploiting the gas pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Later, Gazprom rented to that company, for a period of twenty-five years renewables, the total capacity of gas transport.
"Gazprom will pay for its total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," needs Jens Müller.
The funding for the construction of gas pipelines has been completed by 30 per cent with the contribution of shareholders and 70 per cent with bank loans.
The total cost of the work should be EUR 7,400 million for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure that they will not exceed their investment, as Gazprom takes the risk of spending alone.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on an arena coast planted with pines.
A few valves, with 4.5 meters high, form the gas exit door.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas to arrive before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last March, the terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
Total capacity will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand book.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants people to return their taste for writing.
It's got an adventure air, writing hours in the light of a sail.
The Moleskine book is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pasta, its rubber, its white-red leaves, as ageed by time.
However, the books of Moleskine with the current aspect were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a book of design notes to the market, but different.
Maria Sebregondi, therefore the company's consultant, was responsible for launching the new product.
The book is inspired by an ancient production technique, the mole skin (top) which refers to a browned cotton used, among other things, to cover the banquets.
This type of book was highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the current taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of the vanguardic artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become responsible for the brand in Mode Mode.
And it worked.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 per cent, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
The secret production of the first years has remained far away, where only 3,000 books have been designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer's profile, as the notebook attracts both business and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open spirit and cults.
The small Italian company, which had twelve employees at its beginning, now has about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his library tables from Fnac to small shops in the city center, and has learned to impose his identity.
"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the age of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural firm goes from hand to hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the "Detour" exhibition where architects or artists exhibit their own library.
In August, he also launched a table with leopard tapes, due to the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has learned to diversify its products: pockets, agendas, bibliographies, computer bases... The brand covers a wide range of support.
A success that provokes envy: in October 2006, Mode Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, in the current Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
The XV Week for the employment of disabled people begins today.
Despite a public policy resolution, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled persons doubles the average rate: 19 per cent, compared to 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
Dissatisfied?
"No," says Éric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of disabled people.
"The progress achieved over the past 15 years is considerable.
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"However, there's still too much to do."
It should be noted that disabled persons continue to face numerous obstacles to access to employment.
They tend to be older: 37% is over 50 years old (17% average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% has not finished the study, and only 10,000 of the 2.3 million students in higher education are disabled.
Finally, the long-term pairs are very extensive among them: 53 per cent for disabled persons, compared to 38 per cent of the average.
In other words, there are many issues that are particularly difficult to return to the working world and that "constitutionally constitute the problem," says Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
These are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those who are not mentioned; people's mentality progresses, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS- Entrepreneurship for the City indicated that the managers concerned had "a level of knowledge on low disability", with "extreme representation of people in wheelchairs, physical or intellectual disabilities".
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the goal of hireing 6% of disabled workers, a target set in a law of... 1987.
According to the latest available figures from 2008, a ratio of 2.6 per cent is reached.
"We are now reaching around 3%," said Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the agency responsible for revoking the contributions of companies that do not respect this law.
The proof: the number of establishment "submitted to this contribution", as well as the amounts paid, has decreased between 2007 and 2011, ranging from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, has generated a great pressure on companies," Pierre Blanc explains.
"But this improvement also reflects true consciousness, especially among the large groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of the companies that have between 20 and 49 workers have employees who are disabled in their home, compared to 82 per cent of the companies between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: "A Joy"
To meet the Blues on Tuesday night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that this friendly party generates.
We won't dare say that there was confusion between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting together, at the exit of the Auditorium of the City of France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after the gesture of recognizance against Turkey, the Belgian elector has no more than praise for him.
"I am very happy for Eden, for its progress and for being Belgian."
"I want to move forward," answers Lille's front.
As to the contrast between their presentations in your team and in the selection, "it's a set", it has been justified.
"In Lille, I am all year round, which does not apply to Belgium.
"I have to sit down."
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this party against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "brella".
Don't forget the pleasure.
She has been encouraging the Bleus since she was seven, as well as during the 1998 and 2000 victory campaigns.
"I've always been his fan," he says.
This will undoubtedly strengthen the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because you will face "Mathieu (Debuchy), Johan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami), " remember.
"We just had to face it a little while ago.
"To play against them is always a joy."
With simplicity, Leekens has made his part reference to the "haughty."
"Orgul" for arguing "a game of gala."
"Orrgulo" also for checking, as "neighbor", that France "was a very high-level team", about a year after Knysna's traumatism.
"Laurent Blanc has done a wonderful job," said excitedly.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technique would be pleased to be able to share a plane with the Bleus towards... Brazil, in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing up," he said.
"We're building something; players are ambitious, they're ambitious.
"You can see it in the next parties." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows great trust
Portugal of Paulo Bento faces great optimism at the turn of the turn against Bosnia (22h00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the game of Ida, they lacked realism on both teams.
"When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt about it; the Election, which runs since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 Eurocopa.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there's a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Given the ageing party (0-0), Friday in the fire of Zenica, it seems clear that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the party for more than an hour, yes, but could not mark the precious goal that would have given him peace.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it's a risk, because we haven't marked out of the house."
But at home, at the shining stadium of the Lisbon Light, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, before a public should be equal to enthusiasm, even if it turns out that the party is "very equal", said an optimistic but luxurious Bento.
"We hope the party is very equal, but we are fully convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have a 50% chance to participate in Eurocopa 2012," however, said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The winter meal in Bosnia requires Portuguese to mark and win.
The Bosnians could get an empathium, although they also need to be marked.
"It's a good result, but once it took a risk, because we haven't marked out of the house," Bento laments.
"We're going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and has players with a great individual quality," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will have the intention of exerting, from the outset, a maximum pressure on Bosnians to "do not allow them time to think".
A good idea, always, this time, be realistic.
