What's going to happen? CSSD did not know Voldemort or pacistry in Prague.
The new CSSD elections at the capital's headquarters will obviously have to overcome a real linguistic barrier to understand at the municipal council with their former and new colleagues from the ODS.
The daily Current.cz "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to the CSSD, namely whether they knew the Argot who was born in recent years at the fair, when they were the partners of the current coalition who were leading Prague.
The vocabulary coded that Prague's political cremation took place during the previous age of mayor Pavel Bem described some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It is surprising that it has been discovered that the new elections do not fully understand the terms known.
At least they say it.
"Who's Valdemort."
"I don't really know."
"I am a young man in the Portuguese politics who responded to Lucas Kaucky, the challenge of culture to the "parrain" vocabulary test.
And with regard to the political vector, the island Karel Brezina reacted the same way.
For example, the word "golf tree".
"That's the only expression you suggest I use."
Otherwise, I don't use Argot.
From the vocabulary, including the daily Current.cz, published the words in June of this year before the ODS Pre-Electoral Congress, the edition selected 6 examples, in particular those related to the Prague Mary.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf course in Prague", "to the landscape", "to the borough", "to the capital" and "to the end".
Three of the elections were agreed for the eighth, the fourth Antonin Weinert, who has to lead education in Prague in the future - has first promised an interview but then did not unlock the phone.
The fifth election of Petr Dolinke successfully rejected the test.
"I don't care about all these things here and how the representatives of citizen democracy show up: I won't give my opinion."
"I currently deal with how we will understand ourselves in the framework of our programmes," he said.
As we have already heard, Lucas Kaucky's election would not appear in the legend above, but it is about the influence Janousek has on the entrepreneurs and friends of former mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucky and the only expression he has become in the test is "the largest golf course in Prague".
"It's about the Blanca tunnel," Kaucky said, adding immediately, "But I know the newspapers."
"I'm going to have to pay for a language course," he said.
Not only the Killer Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the Elu for the Environment, know that the golf course is the White Tunnel.
The two social-democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Plachy know where to find the person - he thinks about "to go to the cemetery".
"It's about, I think, going to a company," Plachy is ready to become the headquarters of Janousek's companies.
At the same time, Brezina remembers that he takes his knowledge rather than the newspapers and not any vocabulary he would use.
According to the candidates for tests, there is no lexic of argos in social democracy.
"I have consulted with colleagues and it seems that we really have nothing like this."
"The names are sometimes used for abbreviations and symbols," said Peter Hlinsky, President of the Socialist-Democratic Party, who members of the Party call Hulda.
"I was called Briza at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me like this, as Karel Brezina says about the nicknames.
The current.cz day tested the name and it goes.
The Elu Weinert is Papy for the party's members, or at least the least friendly Little, representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the election by the scrokers during sponsoring the party, is called "the little jockey".
Surnames are also the only ones that allow the social-democrats to use within the party.
Hulinsky seems to not like much to hear Hulda, but Akutel.cz has recorded another nickname for this grieving president.
"Matraque-right Doctor" recalls that it appears that Petr Hulinsky received his doctor's title in law JUDr at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to reduce the tortures of "sorages", published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, voiced women have common treaties.
They are part of the old generation, they can't work for health reasons, they're free and they don't have children.
The one who becomes "sorrow" is isolated from the rest of the village.
"Man rarely has this destiny."
"We no longer judge young women in good health because they participate in work and raise children," said a sister who is in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special facility of over 100 women who have been rejected by the company.
The local government decided to act against this unusual "social measure".
He has published a brochure that should help to limit the hunting of the bears.
The case is a hic.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," warned Die Standard daily about the inconsistencies in written education.
The charge of sorcellery is current in other countries of Africa.
In Ghana, near Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman was killed after being tortured by three women and then burned with the oil they had poured on her.
This is the BBC server that sent this information.
The criminals claim he was a bad eye.
According to their version of the oil used for ritual ions, the woman was enflamed in contact with the woman.
The oil was flammable, it seemed, when the team wanted to "shape the bad spirit" of the woman.
Insulation of "sorages" is approved by people at all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying: "Human spirit eatingers have always been a danger," he said.
While Burkina Faso strives to reduce the fate of the sisters, Gambia soon saw the President himself participate in it last year.
"After the death of his aunt, President Gambien Dzammi launched a broad trap against the sisters who seemed to have participated in his death and would be forced by the black magic to kill the President as well."
"From the names of Guinea near the referendum, they led to the presidential farm in Kanila, under the protection of the police and the personal custody of the President, men and women elected to the Hasard in the villages of Gambia," said Amnesty International in a message.
Prisoners had to drink a plant-based potion based on hallucinogenic effects, which produced further effects on the kidneys and the intestines.

There are about a thousand people who have been released from international pressure.
The location of Baal: The poles are heated, he has signed a higher lodger.
An old taxable man comes from the door of the company RPG Byty's "carbon baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments to rent in the Czech Republic.
He carried under his arm a folder with three new rental contracts for three apartments: the seine, the one of his daughter and his son who is going to clean up a penalty.
Deregulation has increased the renting of these three persons.
Instead of paying 3500, the son will have to settle from the next year for a 2+1 second category apartment 4400 crowns.
"And there is no hot water, and heating works on solid fuel," the man who has the power to sign on his son's new contract.
"But I signed it at any time" explains it to you because of anger and half-signed.
The citizen association of BytyOKD.cz apartments that described the new conditions of rental as "immoral and indisputable", advises the tenants not to sign and wait until 7 December, the date on which a notice will be published to explain the method to be followed.
But man reacts to it by hand management.
"One says it, the other says another thing" frowning the sources.
The region of Ostrava becomes the deregulatory laboratory.
After the New Year, that is what most apartments in the Czech Republic do not meet the market price.
Current.cz has therefore decided to visit the "laborator" personally.
The RPG waiting room in Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 09 a.m. in the morning.
Just next to the door is a security company with a device to call customers.
A special button, "loyer 2011", is highlighted on the touch screen.
A single pressure and a paper with a number of devices.
You don't have time to read your number "157" that your number is already starting to shine on the big screen at the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second, it's your turn.
After a short time, an old couple arrives to learn about the rent, but the new tenants don't seem to care about people in the waiting room.
Most people have come to address current problems such as demand for repairs, insurance events and others.
In the Ostrava region, more than 44,000 people from the RPG portfolio receive mail with new pay contracts in their wallets from about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers them an increase in rent from 15 to 38 percent.
the special ticket for new rentals has been open to the public since 18 November.
"he's been working for nearly a week, so it's still in the test" answers, after a pause, the employee behind the tape when the client is presenting as a journalist.
The degradation and old minor apartments of Baal are a very sensitive local subject.
The vice-president of the Parliament and the original of the region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaaralek of the Democrats has been sufficiently supported before the elections and is now filling the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new plan."
"They haven't even changed a patch in the toilets, the man mentioned here is relieved.
However, in particular, employees say that there are withdrawals that come to be sure that they will receive a return on the new rent price if they now sign up as RPG has promised in a special offer.
It is a return of half of the rent that will be received by the other tenants who will sign their new contract before 15 December.
But the "deregulation" giraffe of the Havirovaska Street is not really able to deal with the issues.
"For the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for the rent," says the employee at the ticket.
And yet RPG puts both on its website and in the vineyards of individual entertainment on the houses when necessary.
If both parties do not agree on the rent, it is an independent court that will decide.
'It is not a threat, but only to inform you about the unique and legitimate way to act legally,' says the RPG on its website.
"No one's going to the court" thinks one of RPG Byty's employees and the man in the street in front of the client centre gives him reason.
"I have 13,000 crowns and I have 5000 crowns to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he said.
The employee immediately feels bad at ease.
"We'll come."
"Mr. Zaaralek in the media asks that no one sign and therefore people wait," she said.
The lease regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, current rentals do not always reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the resident portfolio of RPG Byty, who is just the lack of funds for housing that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in the rent.
However, in the five years between 2005 and 2010, RPG has been able to invest in 4 billion apartments, in four years 2011 to 2014 that should make 5.2 billion.
The large screen expanded to the ceiling in front of the refurbishment of the Havirosvka street waiting room, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
'The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 per cent and does not affect less than 31200 apartments or more than 90 per cent of RPG apartments".
"And this will always be up to 7.50 Czech crowns the m2 per month," says the screen.
The increase of 38 per cent concerns only 400 RPG portfolio apartments.
"In these cases, this is an increase in a very low amount of 19.66 Czech crowns to m2," added the RPG.
The next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but progressive increase of 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the increase in rents (see graph) is made to apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the increase in rent have priority.
The mother school is part of the office, as well as the architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint de Brno is the new headquarters of the Society Arch. Design.
No one could have expected that he also opened a small mother school with everything he needed - colorful walls, imaginary furniture, toys and finally a field of minimizing games on the terrace.
Since October of last year, children can become employees of Arch. design.
The project-architectonic Society Arch. Design. whose workshops have produced a large number of buildings in Brno, has imagined its small business home school since the first buildings of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially children, and it was important to him that architects and project leaders be able to return to work quickly.
At the same time as reduced working hours contracts, the mother school is a bonus offered to its employees by the Society Arch. Design. in the framework of its social program.
Constructors and architects thus have the opportunity to engage in a work that takes care of children.
These are the employees of the Arch.Design.They themselves who imagined this mother school and with the support of the leadership they were able to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The native school is funded through the European Social Fund through the operational programme of human resources and the statistical budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to funding grants (up to 2.8 billion Czech crowns), they were able to buy equipment and equipment and, after two years, to provide qualified personnel as well as travel.
After the use of funding grant (two years) the Company Arch. Design. has been required after 3 years to operate the minimum maternity school on its own funds.
The project was prepared for a year and is the Economic Rating company that helped to make the grant application.
Children's care is provided by a qualified staff, a nurse and a nursing institution care for children every day. Children can go to the maternity school without age limitations, but they have more than three children.
As is the case with a "maternity school" it can only have 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more who are replacing.
The school function is flexible according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use this school regardless of the hierarchical position.
Although individual care and education are concerned, the programme of the mother school is comparable to that for pre-school education.
Children only play but a quality education is also ensured - from the beginning to the preparation of school banks to the English language.
The class is equipped not only with imaginary games and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their children and do not have the stress of a delay to go to a school away from their parents' place of work.
Parents therefore use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that there is a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is thus included among the companies that offer an election bonus for recruiting new employees and who are friendly to the family and through this program strengthen the marketing of HRs.
The house in os fascinates again after 100 years. Leave an eye in the interiors of Gaudi.
The toy resembles the two of a prehistoric saurien, the scaffolding to a vertebral column of dinosaurs and the balconies to open fish holes.
So is the house Casa Battlo in Barcelona of architect Antoni Gaudi.
Because of its organic forms, the house received the name of the house in os.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, car and mosaic fragments, reminiscent of the scales and all the curves present, that's all that's true for the New Art of Antoni Gaudi.
The front face of the house covers its dream lines, its beautiful colors and textures that remind nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation, we see the geometry, rhythm and order thought with precision.
During the night the face of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit up in such a way that the impression of color brightness is strengthened.
The confusion and distortion of forms also appear in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood copies the windows frames, the balustras, the decorative elements of the doors, the oelstone and the lammes.
The Battlo house, which is located in the Eixample district in the street Passeig de Gracia at number 43, was founded from the construction of a house in 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
Investigator Joseph Battlo, a rich entrepreneur, first emphasized the demolition of old construction and construction of another new but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of unusual reconstruction and better market.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a house for multiple housing was not meant by Gaudi alone.
The architect Joseph Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is just on its project that decorations are born for a representation apartment of the owner of the furniture and the use of the museum for the façade.
Other artists and artists also worked for the stage.
The joint work on the house plans of Casa Battlo was initiated by successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and Guell Park where there are other works of Gaudi.
The houses named the hot house just after its completion because of its organic forms "the House in os".
In addition, I looked at the specific window opening mechanism called "the house that is empty".
It is said that at the top of the building there is a sword similar to that of Saint Georges the patron of the Catalan.
Other building sculptures contain hidden religious reasons.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time, with typical air events and routes.
Their 45-degree inclination seems strange.
During Gaudi's creation, he did not fully respect the construction directives and did not allow them to interfere.
At the beginning of the construction, he obtained permission from the city to build, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years after the end, the municipal council was Horrified and called for changes.
For example, he did not like the members of the municipal council as much as the construction pillars prevent on the public trottoir.
There has never been a change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call from the city of Joseph Battlo requested (and received satisfaction) permission to praise the two highest floors.
The owner would move to the lower floors.
In the gallery at the second floor there was a common living room and the third room and a private part of the apartment.
The cut-out was praised for a bijouterie.
The entire six-stage house is divided by a ladder that reaches up to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and right lines were cancelled by the basic elements of reconstruction and replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi is also working on the modern space connection concept.
The common party can be fully connected by opening the doors of the halls and the high society can communicate comfortably or well to limit private space for more intimate entertainment.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi has also received new forms of non-traditional towels and two additional stages.
Gaudi's game with the light is also impressive, with blue and white vitrets with which the inner court is decorated and with lights.
The two-colored game provides maximum light in all stages of the house.
It was simply enough to compare the principle that white reflects more than the shadow that, in contrast, absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house that was registered in 2005 in the World Heritage Fund of UNESCO may be visited by everyone.
At the first floor of the house is the most spacious and beautiful apartment available to the public.
The owners decided to break this step in 2002 on the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the visits because they found that it was a lucrative business and extended the field of visits to the common spaces and to the border, including toy terraces.
The ticket to the monument is not really expensive and costs 16.50 euros; students, discounts, groups and tourist card holders have 20 percent discounts.
The sum is even above the entry price in the other buildings of Gaudi in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic towers, you must quickly find a friend among the inhabitants of the apartment and visit the whole house.
How to choose a mate and a roommate: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentator frame, but rather the quality of the area reserved for bed, so the matlas and summer provide a real basis for a good bed.
Of course, they must complement each other in a harmonious manner to please a particular user.
During the selection several things are decisive: weight, size, age, health status, and the owner's sex.
The type of interior in which the table will be placed and the summer is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the camp house where the latex mats are not always worn, they are not appropriate because they are "swift" gently.
In addition, they have a higher weight than standard polyurethane tablets.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilation channels in their heart and they remain, in addition, on a solid plane, they maintain moisture.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
The one who spends the light of time abroad, often using very spacious materials with a rammollising layer, will find it difficult to feel well on a low and hard surface.
"That's how all the hockeyists who come back from NHL complain that they can't sleep there."
"For their tired shoes, feet and bones, they needed mats with a rammormulating layer of parses."
"These are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that therefore takes over "information" of the joints and the skin," explains Sylva Adamczkova, who specializes in the reimbursed furniture.
That's why a couple of years ago the matales with the Persian mouse won the hockeyists and other customers.
"Today everything goes well, Tempur, Italian Magnifex, but also the Tropico Czech also have suitable materials.
You don't need to be a guy from NHL to be able to appreciate a beautiful mouse.
That "miracle" just works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the absorbable heat or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing pushes you and you won't come back at night like after a hard game.
You just sleep better.
The Parisian mouse also serves as a protection against the shadows.
To choose the mats according to your size, add the length of your feet, either about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of a size of 180 cm therefore need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each double bed should be 90 cm or 180 cm.
For single beds, singles, for example, are recommended to take at least 120/140 cm.
It's comfortable in case of a visit.
'However, it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you're sleeping on the second floor you should put your hands comfortablely with the slightly flat beds. Helena Prokokova, President of the Association of Bourreliers-Massian and Decorators who have been devoted for several years to the problem of a healthy summer and the ergonomics of furniture and teaching in specialized schools.
For a bed in two places each needs its own shade and mats, however, attention is paid during the cost of choosing the height of the mats.
Otherwise you will only be able to mount the summit at different heights and this is not possible on all bed frames.
Mushrooms should have a minimum height of 14 cm, bearings of at least 15 cm, of which for the shape and aerospace layer of at least 3 cm.
"When you touch or sit on the table you don't have to feel the resources," says Héléna Prokopova.
Each table requires a well-defined type of summit.
The bed-timer, when the matlas and summers are united as symomous sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms to sleep.
The meals were very bad; we don't have to wash, what's happening today.
And since during the night it is normally transpired from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sugar it is clear that after 5/7 years, the meat begins to remember a large (and squeal) Tamis.
For this reason, specialists refuse to make the claim on a 25-year-old life-long claim for a materiel or a life-sustainment guarantee.
But it's all about it.
And for this, an expert advice from the sellers' side: for a 120/140cm table, cancel, for refilling the table, for hygiene or washing but add rather a protective table that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if in our days it is common to make coatings with glazing closures for the whole, it is to say that after opening there are two parts (for washing and washing machine size is very important!) but manipulation for large models (and for one person) becomes when they are removed from a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a rigid plan in your bed instead of a summit?
Never!
Maximum for a bed for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the floor (if not available) of airtight pipes and use the ground floor with a minimum height of 15cm with sachets (from Germany Taschenfederken) and an airtight layer.
A powder in polyurethane must not be part of a bed of this type.
For latex or sandwich mats (maybe the combination of latex and coconut nuts) are ideal, but this will always be better for you to have a mat with more beads, 28 and above, where the beads are doubled in the bottom of the kidney and that it is possible to regulate their rigidity.
For multi-position tables, do not need to be taken out of tables because it does not respond to changes in positions.
In addition to the regulation of the rigidity of the blades, what it is called an epale root can also be installed.
This is a special link between the legs that allows pressure to insert the needle so that the shoulder of the bedroom "integrates" well.
For men who have "the shoes as wide as the two," it's really an important thing.
This is already considered by the masculin manufacturers who have started using a rammollising area at the level of the shoes.
But they also think of women - they offer them a softer surface at the level of the hips.
For the most difficult customer there are short- or flats with what is called a multi-force suspension.
Pressure decreases in more points and decreases tension.
But of course, as soon as you use a bad ear (great and windy) on good materials and summers, the "plus" disappeared.
The basic rule is a simple earring: the earring must support the head and its points must only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinavians simply prefer.
When extended on the side, the rim must set the height of the pellets (with the pellets of the pellets or the shoulder area in the matlas).
Modern mats still have something in common with the first ones based on straw and herbs.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also to biomass.
The raw materials based on petroleum, from which polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oils, such as soya oil.
Nearly all known manufacturers just use the soya.
"The Bio Qualification for the Matals means that the heart is made from natural products," explains Petr Vasicek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for the coatings of the materials; one of the first was true gold.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop forest or lavage perfumes.
There are differences between man and woman.
While the extract of boulevard plants to absorb heat and cool the body, "refried" the man, the coatings "frozen" the women.
The extract of red powder accelerates blood circulation and is therefore hotter for the weak sex.
The current favorites?
Meats made from frozen mosse (it has more gates with a cell structure that is therefore more respiratory than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of the frozen molluscs gives polysonic mats that know exactly where the head, bottom and foot are located.
You pay for a quality table from 7000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters are less than VAT and are treated as health instruments.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex has reached its first place.
Saving for the matlas and the summit is not easy.
There may be time in the context of special actions by manufacturers or manufacturers of two materials for the price of one single.
For example, the Magniflex company that offers Duofreze matulas with the Memory Memory Museum due to the repertoire for 11990 crowns.
Of course we can take the second free.
The age of parsley or viscoélastic mice with an open cell structure and a large spacer was started with the Tempur material at a "cosmic" rhythm.
This began as a matter for NASA because astronomers were subjected to the launch of enormous load factors.
The Tempur is fraught with heat and, on the contrary, it is cold.
He therefore adapts perfectly to the hot human body and distributes an optimal pressure.
It is ideal for this against bad sleep and for an increase of comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic muscles are used not only for fats but also for products for health, such as special shoes for feet that relax the legs and the vein system.
Czech manufacturers use, for example, the EucathermC or Twinsaver mouse or the same type.
The devices to monitor people are increasingly requested by parents who want to monitor their children.
The fear for their children is growing in the minds of more people to monitor them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars, can also be well used to track people's movement and help in some cases such as that of little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is now as big as a drop of lightning but will soon be the size of a display.
The case of little Anicka has attracted a large number of people and they have started looking for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to ruin their private life.
"We strive to tell everyone that it is not a spy but only one way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy," said Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, who is one of the suppliers of tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I assume there may be cases of bad use of such devices, such as putting them in the bag of someone who is not present, but I haven't met such a case yet."
"Most people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons, Pilin adds.
According to him, children should always know what purpose is used "the bottle" and how to use it in the event of an emergency.
The psychologist for children, Dana Bockova, draws attention to the fact that if the child doesn't want to bring on him something like that, he'll get rid of it.
Even the smallest can show a great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something when they don't want to be controlled."
"Portable phones, which can be cut like these tracking devices, have already brought parents to long-term expectations," says Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in case of aggression is very controversial.
"If it's a prep, the author will do everything to make the child have no electronic device that can locate it."
"At the moment, it's the phone."
"As soon as the tracking devices are developed, they (the criminals) will also search them because the sale will be supported by a advertising campaign."
"In such cases criminals will always be on the police," says the psychologist.
She calls everything as well as such devices can help when an attack is not prepared by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of the RC Monitoring company, who offers tracking services for both cars and people, claims that having this type of device can help, even if it has been destroyed in the event of an attack.
"The device may be set in such a way as to be in regular emission after a specified period."
"In case the device is destroyed, it remains the last position of the person concerned."
'The most expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately indicates the position of the person who has moved and is located in a long position without moving,' says Cech.
According to him, the portable telephones of intelligent speakers who are equipped with a navigation system can offer a comparable service after having trained with a special professional.
The problem of current tracking systems is that it is either of a device similar to the one that is being carried with the size of a rubber bottle or with the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil, why tests are currently being carried out to make devices similar to common digital displays.
"This will have the advantage that the attacker may not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Or he'll count on it after a while, which will have given the police a little more time," he added.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as to track cars.
It is a combination of purchasing systems of a GPS position (which is used continuously in auto navigation) and a function of a mobile phone that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonators that it could make the turn of the Czech Republic with it, but it can only have two years.
The army bought 445 km of wires used for explosives.
The Ministry of Defence has already bought 224 km in the last year.
The army therefore has reservations for 225 years.
The problem is that the life span of cordages is two to four years maximum.
The army has purchased codes for anonymous STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The general government has given as a result of the purchase of a huge amount of detonators in MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the maintenance calculations made by the military pyrotechnics, which MF DNES contacted, it was noted that even generals, officers with a warrant, secretaries, or household staff should have an annual exercise for explosives.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, the commander of the army are not exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of detonators.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it was true, the military reserves could come down there for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it is true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals, it is sufficient to cover more than 2 m of detonators, as experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has also ensured - with the consumption of special units and genius - reservations for the 225 years mentioned.
However, the soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade have recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their punitive weapons and that withdrawal meetings are limited because of the need for money.
We're not talking about the lack of body line.
"And I don't take my head if they buy us a lot of detonators."
"And that's their decision, and they really know what they're doing."
"for us the army is a good client that we strive to be happy as merchants," said STV Group Jan Decky's commercial director.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, argues that hundreds of miles of detonating wires will be held by the army for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group, however, was only four years of life of detonators and police and army pyrotechnics for only two years.
"If they are perfectly engaged in deposits, it can go even to four years," said one of the two who did not want his name published in connection with the military criticism.
The duration of life has passed, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains integrated and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the Department is a huge amount of 445 km of detonators.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's delivery of 245 km," says the Pejsek spokesman, who interprets the opinion of the buyers of the Department of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of detonators of police pyrotechnics that neutralize the munitions of the second world war or even after the Soviet army does not exceed 1500 metres.
And the police always only order the amount of ammunition needed to be used before the end of their life.
This has been established for the safety reasons of pyrotechnics and for more flexible access to more modern and more reliable types of detonating wires.
the Department of Defence today has serious problems for the neutralization of tens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the heavy two hundred thousand men were preparing to move, none on the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometres of old detonators that it buys today "good market".
To this day, I benefit from contacts I have received through the competitions.
The French sales of his hotel helped Lucas Pytloun to win the best individual entrepreneur's competition.
The winner of the competition of the best individual entrepreneur for the past year was Lukas Pytloun, a 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure towards success is like in a movie.
Lucas Pytloun is a traveler.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberia there was a lack of a quality accommodation site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had gained when he worked abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small apartment of 5 half-demoli apartments.
Knowing that he was still studying in the third year of higher studies, it was an act of courage.
"The relationship between the quality and the price of a accommodation in our region has given me a desire to do something," said Lucas Pytloun.
He started renting the first apartment rebuilt by foreign workers.
He reinvests the benefit in the property he transforms into pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneur's action has allowed him to open 4 pensions in Liberia, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of almost 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable one of them has been until recently the four stars of the Pytloun hotel design.
This year, he had a different quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our concept of franchise and other candidates to the franchise of the Pytloun hotels", number 1 of entrepreneurs last year.
"And for the sale of the licence for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory in the company of the year has served well, adds Python with appreciation.
The victory brought him more popularity and fame in Liberia and around him.
"People recognized me in the streets, they often congratulated me and, I must say, it was very pleasant," he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition to all those who strive to do something.
This is not necessary to win, but every opportunity to be visible is good.
He said he used his contacts and knowledge so far that he could not otherwise obtain it.
"With those I met through the competition, I began to maintain business relations regularly.
According to him, the reputation of success had also had an impact on employees.
And it's about 70.
"I observe in them the loyalty and pride of being engaged in something that was generally recognized."
"It is not, and far away, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work for all of us.
"Only my name is pushed forward," said Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a year better than the one we took to Farmet.
The victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the objective of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came looking for the price in Slovakia for the first place of the competition for the Company of the Year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky, owner of the Farmet Company.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it transformed a tool workshop in Ceska Skalice into a firm in the business number of 100 million korrones.
I can say that the reward has not only encouraged not only my partners but also increased our confidence in combating competition," says the winner of the competition in the last year.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet, there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed to the father of Karel Zdrasky to rent the small workshop as compensation after the goods were confiscated by the Communists, he did not hesitate long ago, refused a career in a firm where he was working at the time, and created a company with some friends in his father's surroundings for the manufacture of plastic baths.
Not long after they began to specialize in the press for vegetable oil.
He became the largest manufacturer of automatic press in Central Europe after eighteen years.
The company was known even in the non-specialized public after the success achieved in the competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers start to really get to know the Farmet brand but also foreign partners who started to realize that they were working with a company that had achieved the greatest success in their country of origin," says Karel Zdarsky.
But the school year did not pass to Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The company's assessment was made from the 2008 and 2009 economic results.
And just in 2009, this was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
In addition to the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were obliged to stop their investment projects and start limiting their purchases of new materials and technologies.
"We have obviously not escaped from this situation."
"The business figures have fallen by 40 percent, and we have to limit our production and even license," says Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that it is time to take unnecessary measures.
But they managed the situation correctly and maintained the results even if they were lower than those they had before the crisis.
However, in Farmet, they continued without commitment to invest in research and development.
"We have built a training and research centre with the allocations, strengthened society's presentation in international exhibitions and won the main rewards in national exhibitions," says Zdarsky.
Let all of us think that the crisis is behind them.
The number of employees is also renumbered.
"In a new winner I want this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that deletes unintended regulations.
The survey on the Absurdity of the Year is for the fourth time part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations may have been deleted.
The most famous winner of this year's Absurdity survey was the obligation to bring it to the offices of documents that officials can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted for it.
For example, social affairs administrations requested a paper extract from the trade register, while the employee could obtain it in two clicks of tears.
It changes because of the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer require the exit of the trade register for insurance checks," said Jana Buranova, a spokesman for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
Making all the regulations and orders that companies and entrepreneurs must fill in the Czech Republic and remove those who are absurd is the meaning of this year's Absurdity competition.
This investigation is still this year for the fourth time part of the business chain organized by Hojórske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If the last year 3000 voters appeared, at least 4,000 of them have voted in favour of this year.
And it is not surprising that in our country, there are already the most various legal obligations that make the company more and more fragile.
"We may be in the number of documents to be completed for the first place in the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Enterprises of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneur activity becomes a proclaimed goal of all Governments in recent years.
Compared to the whole world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is located at the 74th floor for business conditions, 8 more than last year.
The Year's Absurdity competition was first launched in 2006 and continues each year according to the same scenario.
No one can make this year the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities of April to the end of September, the last time before the end of the competition.
To take account of the website www.ffaroku.cz. Afterward, the competition organizer selects seven candidates for "antiprix" and lets the public vote during the month of October at www.ffaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
Absurdity who received the largest number of votes was declared winner.
Until the last year's investigation, it's a hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and decrees that have lost their sense of existence.
The notes are sent by entrepreneurs but also professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, for example, are the obligation for road maintenance vehicles and fast roads to pay payments, or even though entrepreneurs with twenty employees are two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which starts at the beginning of November on the Veneslas Square in Prague, is part of a hapening that regularly participates in political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium Enterprises of the Czech Republic or Peter Kuzel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the event of the competition.
'Economic prosperity cannot work when the State puts barriers on the shoulders of entrepreneurs, and for this reason my aim is to eliminate, each year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only make business more complicated," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove absurd wastes is not a drop in the water.
In 2007, what was not pleasing to people was the obligation of entrepreneurs to declare three days before the office for the individual company to the place where the company is located, the intention of going to an exhibition or a parking lot.
This obligation was deleted with the amendment of the individual enterprise Act.
The second most popular obligation in 2007, which was to declare a service trip to a foreign employee for 30 days to the Labour Office, was deleted with the text of the Act on what is called the Green Card.
And it's all okay until the third session of the competition.
Absurdity of 2009 was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their office, a refrigerator and two automatic balances.
This has been amended by order from the Ministry of Health last year, and the obligation to have a refrigerator has been removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Ecological, humanitarian, training and other sports projects have been evaluated.
The novelty of this year of Homórske Noviny’s competition, which has existed for five years, is the category called the 2010 Responsible Company.
The objective of this competition is to support the reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support companies that monitor the impact of their business on the environment and conduct a socially responsible activity," says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the telephone operator, the Vodaphone firm, who is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the competition for the rebellion of the year.
For this first year of this sub-categories of the 2010 firm, organized by the Vodaphone firm, companies that have not succeeded in a single long-term objective for the company have been registered.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspiration and an independent article should be edited.
Although the object of their enterprise is different from one another, their support and forecast activities can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
For one thing, this applies to persons with disabilities and to the personal or health problems of their employees.
Of the fourteen finalists for the entire Czech Republic, there is no example of the company of Prague's prologians and Netera who support the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in a number of tournaments in various sports disciplines.
Another example of the firm responsible for the Pardubice region is Isolit-Bravo, who has been the main contributor to the grant fund that sponsors children with disabilities for 17 years.
As employees with health problems, the old Podebrad paper manufacturing plant, which employs more than 70 per cent of them, has received the title of the company responsible for the central Bohéme region and is thirdly located in the region in the competition of the company of the year organized by Vodaphone.
At Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, which has earned to introduce busy hours and even reduced to 35 hours a week on average and, without, proportionally, less pay.
The jury also owes its title because it has priority over the purchase of Czech producers, supports ditoyan activities in the vicinity and is concerned about the environment.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least impact on the environment," explains Miluse Ryzarova, the company's executive director.
the company responsible IT Sign up from the Usti Region also thinks about the health of its employees and has set up for each portable computer a chair and ergonomic keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services of a local protected facility for their actions.
"We also support the foundation Man in the dream that helps the local Roma community," said Ondrej Suchy, the representative of society.
At all latest, there is also a Lavage and Cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the retirement insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above the standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transportation, increased qualifications and leisure," said Joseph Strapac of the Czasch brontal construction company, winner for the Moravia-Silesia region.
They were automatically included in the responsible category, all regional finalists for the Vodaphone Year's Company, who had answered the questionnaires in a joint room of the registration document and sent it to the organizer before 15 August.
The incomplete or incomplete replies in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the trade unions had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the responsible firm but were not qualified for the "principal" competition of the Vodaphone year".
"Individual subscriptions are not possible because they are a sub-categories of the main competition of the Year's Company," explains Karel Goldman of the Bison&Rose organisation agency.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, the police conducted arrests during a public competition
In the building of the Land Fund in Plzen, the anti-corruption police have been under arrest these last days.
The detectives passed the minutes to the local entrepreneur and traded with Lubos. G.
This was an effort to just manipulate a call for public tenders for the regulation of a refund application in such a way that the proposed land is obtained by a specific candidate.
He had to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For the moment, I can only confirm that the police continue a criminal offence in the context of a tender and a public competition." said Pravo, head of Plzen Park Antonie Zelena, knowing he is not allowed to provide more explanations because the investigation is ongoing.
The police returned after 24 hours this 46-year-old entrepreneur free.
In order to know how it could influence public competition, we can only specify whether there is any official information.
In a question of Pravo, the spokesman of the Lubomira Cerna Land Fund indicated that police had actually been arrested in Plzen on a separate job site, which was during the public competition.
"It was a client and in no case an employee, she explained.
The public competition according to Cerna has the real name "Call for rights for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and is set up when several legal beneficiaries are present.
"These persons propose, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their right to reparations that must be settled before the land value is announced."
"The proposed rights include a classification of buyers and the Land Fund then transfer the land to the person who has proposed the highest rights," explained the Fund's spokesman.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, information about the persons who were registered in the appeal and how he was also a beneficiary because he had purchased a large number of rights to return, he had proposed that candidates in the field not participate in the competition.
And he was no doubt able to get away.
What would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his interpolation.
Lubos G. had extensive contacts above standards in FdT (Funds des Landins).
It was in the case of FdT ex-chief Vaclav Sankot who continued to be in prison to have lands for which the decision to install a construction had already been published.
Just Lubos G. had obtained, for example, land for the construction of public communications, in particular in place and place where access to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he will exchange it with the Mary for a building in the historic center of the city where the value is much higher.
The mayor was obliged to accept because otherwise she was at risk of putting the construction in jeopardy by a blockade of lands.
Houses will pay a supplement of a hundred crowns per month for the accommodation.
Since January, households will have to pay a supplement not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places the rent will also increase.
The families will therefore have to draw from January to a hundred more monthly than now.
The electricity increased by 4.6 percent, the gas of almost 2 percent more, in some locations you have to pay up to a tenth more water supply and in many places the central heating supplies will also be expensive.
The increase in electricity should be expected for households in apartments with 100 corners per year more than at present.
However, all suppliers have reduced electricity prices by providing sensitive development to encourage the production of renewable energy, including photovoltaic batteries.
The gas increases slowly but certainly when people need it most to heat and thus have the biggest consumption.
So we can also count on a hundred more crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating varies from city to city.
This is mainly the largest communes that plan to increase prices.
For example, homes in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will be paid in January for the central heating of nearly 50 korongs per month, the Liberian families will pay more than 1,000 korons annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague, an increase of 9 percent is prepared for water and sanitation in case the city increases infrastructure houses.
If the rents do not change, a 6.8 per cent supplement will be paid.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest compared with the whole country.
In Bohéme of the north, where prices are already part of the highest, water and sanitation are increasing by 7.4 percent.
For example, rent prices will increase significantly in the 450 thousand rental apartments from January to the end of the regulation.
For example, the CPI Byty company, located in Usti nad Labem, has decided to increase to 100 percent.
Those who do not agree with the new increase in rent will be referred to the courts by society.
Regular rents for people in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase the next year by 10 percent.
The Czech children swam in the rhumm and fernet. The beer is no longer fashionable and does everything mildly.
The fernet, rhumm, vodka and otherwise the best whisky brand are also stolen to parents.
These are drinks that are most common to those who are pregnant, who are not yet fifteen years old, between the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated at the hospital for reciprocity are not the exception.
This results from the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to the admissions of children from hospitals.
"Births or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be drunk."
'The trend is really strong alcohols,' says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of the Horovice Hospital Children's Department of Central Bohéme.
"When they succeed in picking up a bottle of Daddy in the arms, it's about some whisky but it's the fernet and vodka that prevail."
"The vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with the fruit juice and thus do not hear it," explains the Chief of the Department.
Eva Jurinova, the hospital spokesman Motol, also gives him reason.
"In general, it's rhum or fernet."
"It is today alcohol in fashion, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it has become slivovy that they have left the house," Jurinova added.
According to the Chief of the Pélikan department, seeing children aged thirteen to fourteen years of age at hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovic for the last year, he was in Motol, where he spent ten years just in pediatrics where ambulances threatened schools of the whole world.
"A young girl was hospitalized four times.
"She started her career at twelve years of age when she was breast-feeding with 3.5 for a thousand alcohol in her blood with an extra mix with ecstasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibitions Park at a party."
"What's interesting is that he didn't seem to be surprised to his mother that his daughter was missing 48 hours," said the Director of the Department.
It is just the disillusionment of parents or their tolerance outside the community to the fact that their resistance to alcohol is the main cause of the development of children's alcoholism.
According to specialists, however, we do not speak of independence, in its strict sense, for children.
"A chronic dependence on alcohol for several years is understood under the alcoholic vocabulary, with all the phenomena that come out of it, but that it is not found in children."
"For those who use the alcohol repeatedly, it is rather a socio-family background that is significantly distasteful," explained the Chief of the Pélikan Department.
According to Jurinova, about 40 Irish children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the paediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with a severe intoxication requiring hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Children born after emergency care collected in their home by parents or by the police are excluded.
In addition to the cases of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, there are three seasonal baths with which we can count: the day of the nursery, the holy Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"Whether they're drinking after bad results or they're celebrating the start of holidays."
"Of course I have lived on the day of the sisters a seven-year-old child with only one pair," Pélikan emphasized.
The Hebrew child who spent the night at the hospital in decontamination under medical control is paradoxically in a better position than the one who comes home and suffers the next day of the "wood hole".
The headaches of the morning caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"They are for this better lotus since they spend an excellent night and then a gentle wake and nothing harms them."
"They're just surprised at the place where they're found," Pélikan adds, knowing that from time to time the good humor of patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
The transportation by ambulance and hospitalization on intensive care can reach tens of thousands of people.
"From time to time, I have applied it as a means of education for these children according to the cost of their income and that they could spend the entire summer working to pay a single night," Pélikan added.
However, he said that health insurance companies in their regressive management, who should recover from parents the care-related burdens, are not dealing with the cases of ill-treated children.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two L-159 of the five aircraft in all, to which the Ministry of Defence has changed the transport aircraft Casa C-295M, landed on Tuesday for Seville in Spain, where the manufacturer of Casa-EADS was located.
This is the first time that devices of this type become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad in terms of exercise or demonstration flights.
This is a biplatic version of the L-159T1 that has so far been in service in the Czech army and which has been in flight.
Other devices are monoplaced versions of L-159.
These stationed for the moment at Aéro Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the company Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Ministry of Defence's Press Department, the physical departure of Vodochody's aircraft is for the unknown moment.
"The L-159 trading monospaces were taken on long-term aircraft without causing additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence."
"The L-159 T1 libraries have been changed in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He pointed out that the army will not remain without a Biplacium because in May 2009 the Department signed an agreement with Aéro Vodochody with a value of 200 million korons for the transformation of four L-159 monoplases used in two Biplaques.
The army took delivery of the first device in July, the second being scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS, he committed himself to introducing aircraft into the equipment of certain countries of the Alliance.
"In the contract it is clear that the one taking the L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and that they will serve as pilots in NATO's member countries."
"It is therefore the case of the one taking into account how to accomplish this," Pejsek said.
Mr Homoarske Noviny announced that the Spanish army was not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was completed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Department of Defence has not launched tenders and has contacted EADS directly.
The defence management argued that the exchange would ensure future exports of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 devices at Aéro Vodochody and used only 24, which wanted to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa planes will probably have judicial implications.
However, the European Commission filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been selected in the form of an appeal for tenders at European level and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already delivered three cars from Casa, the last should arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than an invalid is a low risk sign of cancer
Men who have a longer index than the unladen are exposed to a less risk of having a prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of male hormone testosterone.
"Our conclusions show that the length of the due process serves as a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men 60 years ago," said the co-author of the study Ros Eeles, professor at the Institute for Research on Cancer at Warwick University.
The right may thus help to determine which men should be subjected to the test of prostate cancer, in particular by combining genetic risk or other growing factors such as family health events, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009, she followed with her colleagues in Great Britain more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index of the right hand shorter than the cancellation.
For them, as for 19 percent of those who had the same length, the same probability of a prostate cancer was found.
In the case of those who had the longer index than the casualty, however, the risk fell to 33 per cent, for men 60 years ago, the risk reduction reached 87 per cent.
The long-term report of the two cities - formed during the prenatal period - indicates in particular the different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterine.
At least testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research had shown that it is just the testosterone that helps to develop a prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Peacees, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said to CTK that he was in the course of this study, but that he does not seem to think that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under the snow, the D1 and D5 road is closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is this morning's Sunday covered by snow.
On the roads and trottoirs, there is much of the time of the compact snow, the developers worked all night in many places.
The D5 highway is closed in the morning between the 89th and the 93rd km of Rozwadov due to several car and car accidents and the D1 noise in Brno in the direction of Prague subsides the same fate.
The driver of the Central Car Club (UAMK) told her about the information
In the 91st kilometer, a truck was injured, and in the 93st two heavy weights were injured, the accident was damaged.
Several cars have also been found in the woods.
The problems are also on the D1 highway to 185 km from Prague.
Two trucks have been hit.
Drivers should get out just after Brno at 190 km or go through Brno and then enter 182 km to Kyvalka.
A number of miles of cars formed in this area.
Also on the D11 highway, there's an accident and, that's just the way to Prague.
In Prague, there is a snow layer of several inches of thickness, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Car lines such as Prosek, the Sterboholska street is also busy.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The tramways take, for example, the line between the Place Charles (Karlove Namesti) and the Place of Peace (Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning the major state of the Prague crisis must still meet.
Railways and airports also face problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to delete because of the snow 7 fast links.
The lines such as Prague to Kralupy or Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzine airport was closed from Wednesday 11 a.m. in the night until 5 a.m.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already roulable but with a double guard.
On Vyskov's road, three side roads are impracticable, on Brno's road it begins to have snowfalls and on Blancko's road chains are required to pass some communication routes in the higher places.
Vyskov region is part of the most affected areas.
To date, the shares are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kücerov and Saratice-Milesovice
In order to clean them, you may need to send snowflakes and cold phrases.
We can't estimate when they'll be roulable.
On Hodonin's road, caution is strict in the white Carpathies region.
On the roads that are, with regard to the protection of nature, held only by the austerity of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimetres of snow warned CTK.
In Czechia, he fell between two to 10 inches [10 cm] of snow; he fell most frequently in Bohéme of the north, with up to 18 inches [18 cm] of snow.
In the region of Moravia-Silesia, it fell to 15 inches of snow.
The explosion in Chequie gradually disappeared.
The Americans have a new "intellectual weapon"
The U.S. Army sent a new "intelligent" weapon to Afghanistan, known only as XM-25 code.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an impact on the conflict there with the Taliban and "will change the game" for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super precise cannon
Its designs are guided by laser with a precision of a few meters.
The 25-mm calibre special ammunition developed for this rifle and containing a highly fragile explosive actually works as small granite.
The ammunition can be programmed in such a way that they will explore the target but also at any point in their ballistic tractor.
So we can use it against an enemy hiding behind a barrier, a wall or a hole.
He is no longer protected above and when he falls over a deadly rain of steel, it can also put him out of battle.
According to Richard Audette, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first weapon of childhood that uses "intelligent" technology.
"The soldier uses it essentially as he finds the target, sends it a laser beam that determines the distance, thus receives a specific point of view, according to which he corrects his target site and supports the prisoner.
"Let's say you looked at 543 meters."
"When you press the prisoner, the weapon is loaded and taken to 543 metres more or less 1, 2, 3 meters away, Audette said.
400 delocated jobs
The Fujitsu group delocates its Bad Homburg branch to Frankfurt.
The next year in July, 400 employees will move to Astro Park, which is currently located at the premises of the Place Mareinbader in the Bad Homburg area.
The Japanese group Fujitsu delocates its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As Mercredi said the engineer specializing in the manufacture and maintenance of computers, next year in July, the place of work of 400 men and women, located so far on the Marienbader site of Bad Homburg City, will be transferred to Astro Park, a complex of offices located on the Lyon Street Street of the Niederrad Quarter of Frankfurt.
A voice from Fujitsu explained that, in the medium term, the group should group 100 other jobs that are still available in the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive. In addition, Astro Park's open-air offices are better suited to the working mode of employees.
In Bad Homburg also, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
Director-General Bernd Wagner said: "Fanfurt-Niederrad is our primary location with a remarkable infrastructure."
He claims that the connection to the airport is just of great importance for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new move of an important enterprise within the region caused the joy of the winners yesterday and caused the disappointment of the losers.
Mr. Markus Frank (CDU) said once again that a "planetary actor" had been so successful.
It's an "extraordinary profession of faith about the place of implantation".
Fujitsu agrees with the city and its implantation is an important element for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (greens), regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The direction was very early to inform the municipality of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this company," said Mr. Korwisi.
However, friendly relationships would have nothing to do with the difficulties of the computer manufacturer facing the owner of the Seanbader Place furniture.
Finally, economic reasons would have been determined.
It is now a matter of avoiding that such an exceptional place remains occupied for a long time.
"I hope the owner and owner of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the furniture of the Place de l'Hotel de Ville, used so far by the nearby Fujitsu company and the nearby "vertical pet" company, as well as the rest of the buildings of the Place Marienbad, were part of the construction project in question at the thermal station.
Fruited by a joint project of the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance from the city was created between the station and the City Hotel. This led to many criticisms, not only because of the impressive layout of the areas that sometimes served as part of the parking lot, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, Feri, computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, computer manufacturer at the time associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German Group of Frankfurt Specialized Immobilien-Chancen acquired buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the Morgan Stanley real estate fund. A year later, these buildings were sold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group located in Tokyo is considered the third largest supplier of information products worldwide.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to companies and also provides essential services.
Its subsidiary located in the Rhine-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has more employees in Munich.
The subsidiary, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to install in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other branches present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this, 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park apartment.
This twenty-year-old complex, whose name reminds of its star-form plan, opens among others the headquarters of the Confederation of Electronic and Electronic Industry.
Exclusion of the server by Amazon - Menaces against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing more and more difficulties.
The Internet service provider Amazon released the site specialized in the disclosure of confidential documents from its servers.
This attitude may be hidden from political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, is apparently staying in England.
In the United States, Wikileaks is attacked with increasing force.
The "Wikileaks" cyberactivist group has no longer access to its host in America until now and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, US Senator Joe Lieberman called the other countries and companies Wikileaks Boycotter.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is researched by Interpol, is likely to live in Great Britain, according to the information published by newspapers.
"Wickleaks except the Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom," the cyber-activists pointed to the origin of revelations through the Twitter social network.
Earlier, the cyber-enterprise, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks' documents from its servers.
After the publication of secret diplomatic notes, cyber-activists had used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to access the largest number of documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues his announcements: "Formible, our dollars are now spent to care for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem in Amazon, "they should stop selling books".
The CNN television chain, quoted by Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon prevented Wikileaks from using his servers after the investigation by Senator Joe Lieberman's collaborators.
The President of the Senate Committee for the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against it, reported the British newspaper The Guardian.
"I would like Amazon to take this step earlier with regard to previous publications by Wikileaks of classified information," said the senator.
At the same time, Mr Liebermann called on the other countries to refuse the use of the platform servers.
"Wikileaks act illegally, as a monster and without scruples. In doing so, it endangers our national security and endangers life throughout the world," according to a communication from independent senators.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks to disseminate the content of the stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is researched by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of violence, is listed by Interpol.
According to information published by the London newspaper "The Independent", Australia, 39 years old in Great Britain and Scotland Yard, knows exactly where to find it.
The cyber-activist has consistently qualified as an orchestrated intruders for the follow-up made to him by Sweden.
Wikileak's spokesman, Kristin Hraffsson, told London that threats were posed against the site.
"Calls have even been launched for Julian Assange's murder."
That's why Assange was especially afraid of his safety, said Hrafinsson.
That's why Wikileaks' founder continues to hide.
Hrafinsson was clearly responding to statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, called for Wikileak's disclosures to be continued and executed for trafficking.
In Canada, the Chief of Government, Mr. Stephen Harper, announced on television that Mr. Assange should be "killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a drone".
During this time, a polymeric emerged between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesman of the American President, Barack Obama, has qualified as "frequency and absurd" the fact that Mr. Assange has demanded the resignation of State Secretary Hilary Clinton if he is responsible for the order given to diplomats, and has recently declared himself free of spying activities.
"I don't know exactly why we have to deal with the opinion of an individual owned by a website," said Mr. Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the claims of a website."
The U.S. Government is now fully in place to test the protection of its databases.
According to a White House communiqué, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Counter-Terrorism Centre, was appointed responsible for combating refugees.
Mr. Travers is responsible for establishing "the necessary structural reforms" made necessary after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House is also willing to verify the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that it wanted to take care of the security of dissidents and militarists if they had never been threatened by Wikileaks' revelations.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," said the State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if that seems necessary."
The University of Glace
At the Gelato University of Bologna, ice caps are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day start course organized for future glaciers has been very successful and attracted to visitors from all over the world.
In fact, where's all the ice?
Of the Glacier and the ice machine.
The ice, i.e. in German the slightly demodated ice compressor, produces cream according to all the Italian ice production rules.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the cooled wine by means of a spatule, it is available in the refrigerator and then begins to sell.
To know, we don't need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice, he cannot avoid the "Gelato-University" of the Italian Carpigiani firm.
The sorbets manufacturer founded the University of Ice in 2003 so that ice creams came out of his machines in response to the high Italian ideals.
The three-day start course organized for future glaciers has been very successful and attracted to visitors from around the world.
Special courses are also offered on chocolate ice and extend over several days. Practice sessions are also organised in private glass.
In the full crisis of the quarantine, a number of people hope for a new career, others are simply risking their burning desire on the cold ice.
This time, 40 participants came from 19 countries from all continents from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of art education from California, is responsible for the slow Food movement. He wants to propose a European product of quality in the country of the industrial glass.
Ande de Berlin is advised to manage the company and she wants to take a few years later something unique from this test for nerves.
Two young Egyptians hope to open a glacier in Cairo.
One man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian household woman came because her children worshiped Italian ice cream.
The gladiator Luciano Ferrari first explained to participants the ideal characteristics of perfect ice.
It is decisive not only the good fortune, but also the quiet flexibility and good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the training period the request for the national superstructure and, in general, the south: "Italian ice is just the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romance."
The first stage in the production seems quite simple.
Luciano refers to basic ingredients such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers in a large blender that warms all at 85 degrees thanks to an electronic program, then cools immediately to four degrees.
Then he opens a robin installed on the machine: he turns out to be a white layer of pasteurized base cream, based on all kinds of ice in the milk.
The trainer is quick to ask the question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without stabiliser?
How can free course be given to the personal pleasure of the experiment?
Mr. Luciano warned against the fact that he was being misled by the spirit of time.
The one who speaks only of "made from natural ingredients" may have been used by stabilisers: most often a natural product, such as the grain of guarantor obtained from the guarantor harcot.
Of course it is possible to make ice without using a stabiliser, only it needs to be sold within a 24-hour period, but it does not sink and the customer will not cross anything but ice granules.
Some changes in the base mass are allowed.
This becomes more passionate with the aromas.
Master Luciano sets out the difference between ingredients obtained in the supermarket’s fruit or confiscate range.
In addition, there are powders and potatoes.
"the suppliers will all try to represent you with dozens of flavoured ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Both in fruit juices with sugar and fresh fruit.
In ice creams made from the white base mass, which, by adding eggs, becomes a yellow cream and is, when added to the cocoa powder, the basis for all possible chocolate deserts.
Now, all participants in the course have to go through the use of ice-cream machines.
Luciano invites them in time to make four types of ice: Vanilla, chocolate, moca and noodles with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanile aroma or other natural ingredients.
The different types of ice for fruit are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more pure fruit: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
The ice for babies does not necessarily contain the taste of the night, when it is composed in most of the boys.
The ice in kiwi, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and less stabiliser.
"Only a balanced mixture correctly detects the taste of a ice," Luciano says.
The manufacture of ice is a calculation exercise: if it is used for the pure fisheries with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar must be reduced in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is necessary for the ice in the lemon.
Luciano presents a device with which it determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (winners are used to measure the size of Oechsle in the root muscle).
Fortunately, tables facilitate calculations.
The manufacture of ice is no longer necessary, as is sometimes so much physical intervention.
This is not just the automatic manufacturing machine of the basic mass that helps.
There is also a device in which the mixture of ice is simultaneously available to make it cloudy and combined with negative temperatures.
Despite all automation, small pans are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo barbulates the fruit of his head to his feet and thus enslaves his study friends when the control of the melangular collossal leaves him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that "a similar incident is likely to occur during each course: this is just a matter of time."
The controllers in an ambiguity position
According to some sources, the industry, which experienced the culture of genetically modified plants, has led the European Food Safety Authority.
This charge is now made by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an independent institution for the evaluation of the effects of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we're well informed," said Mercredi to Munich M. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech.
Some information is that the president of the Efsa Group of Experts for genetically modified plants, Mr Harry Kuiper, and other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi Press Group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper worked closely to develop the Efsa test requirements for genetically modified plants and was therefore clearly in a conflict of interest, according to the criticisms made by Mr. Then.
The requirements drawn up in text correspond to the positions of the pressure group Ilsi and thus the brand of the industry, which is essentially controlled by the authorities located in Parme in Italy.
It's the second time Testbiotech has declared a conflict of interest.
A high-ranking officer of the Efsa recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta without conditions or transitional periods. Doing so, she changed from camp.
A short time ago, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union control authority and industrial lobby, which raised both the German Federal Agency for the Environment and European Members.
However, the Efsa does not accept the existence of any conflict of interest.
One opinion indicates that all reliable data, including those of the industry, are used as well as good professional quality.
Experts working for the Efsa account are not prohibited from contacting this activity sector.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper acknowledges that he worked for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) based on the United States.
This body is considered to be a neutral forum involving experts who, among others, belong to science, industry and policy in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being at the expense of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then fail to demonstrate that genetically modified plants are accepted without any animal feeding test and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know what, for example, the effects of genetically modified maize on the field," said Mr. Then.
The current practice consists of testing only isolated proteins and not all genetically modified plants, which does not allow reliable results.
"If we don't look for the risks, how can we find them?" asked Mr. Then about a defendant.
That's also Mrs Angelika Hilbeck's point of view.
This scientific research has been carried out since 1994 in the field of genetics and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic School.
In this region as well as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That is why there are still researchers who are not linked to companies.
In the opinion of companies, critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck says that "the industry controls security research".
The trace of stone
Uli Gsell searched for it, about 400 pounds.
Monday after noon, she was in front of the Stutgart station with her tube at two.
There was a manifest.
He was wrong.
The story is known: In September, excavators were arriving and began to demoligate a large part of the northern island.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands of people have demonstrated against the S21 project, the transformation of the center of Stuttgart into a underground train that will cost several billion.
A large part of the island was in ruins when the exhibitions started at the end of construction work.
It's 6000, 7000 machetes.
The Muschelkalk (the coquillier calcair) of Crailsheim, a tentacles and gravel - built wall between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Ostfieldern.
He searched for some fragments.
"These stones are relics."
"They don't have to disappear."
He says with enthusiasm: "a modest and good market, simple and land-based rock."
He claims that he felt the smell of smoking.
He doesn't know what he'll do about this fragment yet.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell too.
the traces of the stones of Stuttgart lead to an old warehouse of the French army ammunition in a forest located near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
This 44-year-old man is selling old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition that occurred in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were defeated or they disappeared in the crash," he said in his office located in a hut, which was sometimes a guard post.
He reported that he had been subjected to insults and threats when the newspapers reported in September that he had bought the rest of the North Island to the demolition company.
However, he negotiated with the S21 project opponents for a whole day.
And he explained that he could not do anything to resist demolition.
And if she did, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using stones.
About 200 S21 opponents then carried one of the weighted weighted stone parallelepids of 80 kilograms, the value of which is between EUR 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as to remember in all hope also can do it during a reconstruction.
Rongen bought 500 tons, 25 trucks full of a truck.
About half is still concentrated in the forest, the rest has been sold for a long time.
Owners of gardens, landscaped gardens, Particuliers.
They came everywhere and carried everything they could get into the safe and the trailers.
These stones of the Stuttgart scandal have long been transformed into "Mäerle" or limited by grass bandes.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," said Mr. Rongen.
"and this political component."
He enters his car all over the country, making the turn of his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He did legal studies that he left. Later, he started studying biology before he became interested in the information and eventually became a career.
And a stone lover.
The stock is 40,000 tons.
He loved treasure everywhere in Germany.
He claims he's the biggest trader of old stones.
He's re-examined.
Sculpted sand stones with art are placed on the snow.
"At times, they were part of the Marienbrück bridge in Dresde."
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, says it with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the road that goes up through the forest.
He shows a bag of dougts: Pierre de sable red, above, part of Karlsruhe's station.
You'll be right there.
"Joli travertine."
The parallelepipede was adjudicated part of the court of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Throughout the snow of stones and history, the Cannstatt crossing from the police prefecture, the red granite from the St. Blasien Cathedral, the tube from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what effort, what joy!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that the stones were sculpted into the hand and moved with the help of simple pallets and carts drawn by boulevards, he became quite respectable.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were put in place."
He didn't become rich, even less demanding.
But today this career employs 14 people. In addition, several stones, a sculptor, a baker, a glass fan and a garden have been installed in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's grateful," says the Waste Recycler.
Next time, he has to go back to Cologne.
Also, there are rocks to save.
Fight talents to win the highest potential
The counter knows a living afluence.
16 students struggle to buy small bread for the salmon, tomatoes juice and white mangoers.
The Braunschweig Technical University and the Volkswagen Automotive Builder invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
In the framework of a kind of competition, they must talk about the future car with VW designers, and, in the meantime, meet the Volkswagen firm.
Today, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body in competition to denounce better brains and engage, like Volkswagen, in a multi-form cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most expensive diplomats in the amphitheaters before they arrive on the labour market and are not courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements on the performance of their students, we try to detect exceptional talents in practical projects and to trust them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the Technical University of Brauschweig, the car group loves talent.
A young staff maid shares the styles, bonuses and cards that include the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the calendar of professional courses and student jobs for young talent; she shows them the ways to access the group's enthusiast.
It is Nico Selle of Braunschweig Technical University who is responsible for the project undertaken with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual advantages for both parties: "Students are in contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen group, it can get to know students, look more closely at the serious candidates and appreciate those who come online as a collaborator."
According to M. Sei, such cooperation is inadvertent.
What's new is the offensive with which we're trying to attract students.
"At times, the emphasis was rather on the professional project," said Mr. Selle.
The fight for the victory of the new graduates will become even greater.
In the interests of the sector, companies can no longer recruit their partners by making a trip on a candidate's chair.
But they must gain their confidence and, above all, cut the hand of highly qualified workers.
This is especially The diplomats on engineering fairs that are in excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German VDI engineers, more than 40,000 jobs of engineers remained unattended in October.
And according to the VDI's forecasts, the gap in engineering will still grow.
Roman Dykta goes to the talent store for the KPMG account, audit office, accounting expertise and advice.
It organises cost-effective events to recruit talent, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a sort of paper-roller where competitors need to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to the United States to do so.
Participants can visit KPMG branches and get to know the company.
The person who must participate in the selection process shall decide ahead of time after two selection procedures.
Only the cremation of many candidates will take place for the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used to seek higher potential in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to get out of the lot through the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruiser was too little"
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
"To this day, we remain in contact with all the people who took part in the last year with a similar action."
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to send their applications to our company soon," he said.
In addition to direct love in the camps, small and medium-sized enterprises are becoming more and more classically involved in professional careers where they are delivered to the brains.
"We are trying to reach the graduates by participating in professional halls."
"For example, at the solar technology salon," says Ms. Sitha Stübe, Director of Human Resources at Solarworld, making photovoltaic panels.
This company installed in Bonn employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe knew about the problem of recovery.
Currently, 35 posts are awarded on the company's website.
"At this moment, it's very difficult to provide vacations."
"It costs a lot of time," he says?
Another way to establish contact is through university teachers.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, such as the University of Fribourg.
"The teachers indicate that the student has the opportunity to perform professional courses or write his final study project with us."
Honorary advertising campaigns are announced among solar specialists.
That is why the company tries to make its advertising by applying other qualities: personalized environment, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Many times a large group can't do this," said Mrs. Stübe, head of staff.
For a long time, money has no longer played a major role in finding employment.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good opportunities for promotion are other determining factors.
According to a study conducted by the Institute of Great Place to Work, Solarworld holds the 55th place among the 100 best employees in Germany.
The institution is an annual honour table for German employees.
To that end, he asked the staff members about their level of satisfaction in relation to their work and their context, while taking into account the staff conditions.
The Chief of Staff Ms. Stübe hopes that this placement will allow the company to increase its image to job applicants.
"I believe that candidates are primarily referring to external evaluations with regard to a potential employer," she said.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Academy, DEBA) advises companies who want to build a good reputation as an employee by applying a long-term strategy.
He advised his customers to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, this means, first of all, internal action.
"The best way for an employer to become attractive is to pass by his own collaborators," he said.
This is called, according to the garage used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employee's brand image within its own effective.
"cooperatives are satisfied with the best messages."
When dealing well with its employees and they identify themselves with the company, they only make their employer's advertising with their friends and knowledge.
"It's like playing it in an orchestra," says Mr. Kriegler.
Obama sets a brake to the new oil drills
There will be no new oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico along the coast of Florida, South-East United States, over the next few years.
The Government of Washington has made a ban an equivalent ban and has finally cancelled its initial plans.
Even along the Atlantic coast, new forests remain for the moment forbidden.
The Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar, made this Wednesday announcement.
This is the explosion in April of the Deepwater Horizon forest platform, which is the origin of this strict ban. It must remain in force for at least five years.
In the face of this incident, which cost 11 employees and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under the pressure of opposition and of this sector of activity, had indicated that he was willing to allow new drills to be carried out in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The parties to this solution therefore want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries for oil supply.
The question of knowing who bears the responsibility for the destructive black marina in the golf course is not so far definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is faced with several billion claims for compensation, is at the centre of charges.
A committee of inquiry established by Obama must submit its conclusions in December.
In October, interior secretary Ken Salazar lifted the gel of the forest described after the platform explosion.
Following this decision, various oil groups had promptly submitted applications for new drying projects.
With stricter controls and stricter security signals, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent control authority, which has been disbursed after many allegations of corruption, is currently making the subject of profound reforms.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced that he would eliminate the tax deficits of the gas and oil groups.
The actors in this activity sector now publicly object to the fact that food consumption in the golf course would be significantly lower than the case so far.
"The Government's objective is to ensure rapid growth in the gas and oil sector" according to the results of a current survey carried out in the sector by the BDO Audit Office, before the ban on mercury-based drying.
Furthermore, the American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows what will change exactly with regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been reported until the new order, to the detriment of growth.
The country of Ogoni is dry.
The water that flows into the rivers is brown oil; it emits a smell similar to that found in the gas station: Because of an escape, billions of crude oil liters have destroyed the country of Ogoni in Nigeria.
Men live in volleyball, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't yell," the ecologist starts to calm the journalists, saying, "You still have enough oil in front of the water lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has tried to photograph a young man immersed in the pool water to the poitrin, as well as the fat training that surrounds him: This scene seems almost beautiful in the water stream at the color of the sky.
It can't be seen that the sub-sole is regurgitating raw oil naphtha.
On the riverside of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom relates that, in the meantime, she was collecting blankets from all over the lakes here.
But, in the meantime, calm waters are completely primordial.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil fell from an olive oil that was exposed to the immense mareage.
Fishermen living in the small town of Bodo now have to wait six hours to reach fishing waters: The country of Ogoni located in the heart of the Delta of Niger is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
All the width of the shrubs is lifted in the eyes when the mangrove walls are crossed through the watercourses.
Instead of a clear water, the motor boat sinks a crating brown water. Anyone spreads his hand to remove any oil covered.
The roots of small mangroves emerge from the sun like registrants. Insolated palm trees leave their palm trees sad to grow.
We search for birds' nests, as we usually meet in cold areas: Since the engine outboard stops, a phantom silence is on this paradise sometimes compared to a service station by the smell it defts.
"What is happening here is a war against the environment," said Mr. Celestine Akpobari of a sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger to health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni live is a battle field that has been occupied for decades: More than 60 years ago, the first European explorers were imprisoned here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by writer Ken Saro-Wawa. It was executed later. In 1993, the Shell group had to stop its production activities in this region because it had become very dangerous for its employees.
Today, the return to Ogoni is prohibited to this company: while more than 2 million gold barrels of gold are daily pumped through more than 5,000 drills and 7000 kilometres of olive oil throughout the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields of the Ogoni country are unexploited, as the situation is too unstable for this oil group.
All a few hundred meters are drawn into the water of steel trouts as strange sculptures: "Noël trees" are described very kindly in the heads of drills.
They've been up to 50 years, most of them run by corrosion until the rehearsal.
Akpobari believes that a head of drying of this nature falls from time to time in ice, because a constant flow of crude oil in the water.
According to experts estimates, more than two billion litres were broken down on the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that spent in the sea during the disaster of the super oil "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in Alaska, one of the greatest environmental disasters in human history.
Who should bear the responsibility for persistent environmental pollution? The answer to this question divides actors.
For the Shell group, the sobotage and syphoning of the oils are responsible for more than 90 per cent of pollution. Environmentalists for them consider the explosions of dry heads and perforated oils as the main causes.
In 2008, U.S. researcher Richard Steiner complained to the Shell Group to apply to Nigeria more strictly security standards than elsewhere in the world: Only the rate of misconduct of conduct is "even higher than alllers".
Some forms emerge from mangroves in a place that, from a distance, resembles a abandoned workshop, full of cages and installed in free air: They are completely naked and covered with camouflages up to the neck.
A scintile fire under one of the many tunnels that are so related to the pipes, so filled with no reason on the site should be repaired: a small clandestine refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the tunnel for several hours, explains Michael, the team leader.
In the first time, the essence is poured into a container passing through pipes, then, through the conduct of kerosene holes falling and finally obtained from diesel.
That's how Michael and his four colleagues produce four bottles of Diesel of 300 litres daily: "This tells us 34,000 Naira," about $22.
The Delta population is part of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil producer country in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a price less expensive than that slightly lower than 40 cents of Euro per litre of Diesel: because they freely buy their first material.
It is offered by "protectors" who put the oil supply network across the country of Ogoni. Experts say that the country loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a small part of the first provisionally placed matter is illegally cleaned: organized crime networks that also include high-ranking politicians and soldiers, the share of the lion in tankers and the brand on the world market.
Militant Akpobari considers that the debate on the issue of whether environmental disaster should be attributed or rather subversive activities to the population or the mode of Laxist production is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not perceived as intrusions and if the foundations of fishermen' lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be neither sabotage, nor flight and illegal refining."
But, in the meantime, the relationship between Ogoni and Shell has been so deteriorating that it was no longer the issue of withdrawal from the group. "Perhaps operators with other nationalities, such as Chinese, will be better exposed."
So Michael gets nervous.
"It's a long time you're out of your mind" announces the open oil robot.
"The soldiers may appear at any time."
If illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not do the object of an arrest, but, most importantly, they will offer them power.
Even soldiers from the northern part of the country, especially those from the north, intend to benefit as all Nigerians from the first matter.
"At any rate, this trick stick has caused our country to fall down well," Akpori laments.
Researchers discover construction defects in A380 reactors
A380 is clearly suffering from a major security problem.
In examining an emergency landing device, the investigators discovered a possible construction failure that could lead to "disaster failure of the reactor."
The Kantas Air Company now wants to file a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
In early November, the passengers of the Airbus belonging to the company Quantas were apparently more fortunate: During the investigation that it carried out, the Australian Air Safety Authority found that some A380 aircraft reactors had a serious safety problem, and it was maintaining a possible lack of construction.
This potential failure could have serious consequences: It may cause fatigue and escapes at the level of oil conduct connection, indicating in a publicised position this Thursday by the administration of ATSB.
It could have led to a catastrophic failure of reactors.
The Rolls-Royce reactors and 20 A380 aircraft are concerned.
The Airbus of the Quantas company, which was due to arrive on November 4th in Singapore, is one of them.
The Australian airline has now committed judicial proceedings against the English reactor manufacturer.
She filed a judicial complaint to an Australian federal court in Sydney, which allowed her to take other legal measures against society.
Quantas' director, Alan Joyce, said that his company would claim damages related to the incident that occurred early in November.
Parts were detached and the bearing surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it's oil inflammation that's the source of the damages.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors now have to be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators have announced that other safety tests will be carried out on superjumbos that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The security recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, which indicated the ASTB spokesman, Mr. Martin Dolan.
The security problem is considered sufficiently important to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of his plane, the Quantas airline had real estateed all its fleet of A380 for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily refurbished three of its eleven A380.
Lufthansa replaced the A380 reactor with caution.
The two-stage plane is the largest line plane in the world.
The melting of snow across the territory causes chaos in transport
Germany covered all white: In one night the snow fell on almost the whole country.
The chaos governs all roads, trains and airplanes.
At least three people are killed in traffic accidents.
The winter makes Germany gratified: Due to glazing temperatures, almost all the Republic is covered by snow in the night of Thursday, which leads to chaos in many places.
In the north and east, snow cover reaches 15 centimetres per place.
The traffic is very restricted on several roads and on many roads.
On the national A7 in Flensburg, the winter service staff worked permanently, but they could not come to the end of the snow that had not stopped to warm up.
In addition, violent raphales swept the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Bureau of Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) is waiting for these sea-sea crossings to take place at the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels that can reach 1.2 m above normal.
The winds of snow on the roads and on federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxe.
That is why the weather alert centre Meteomedia announced the level of violent alert was announced in the Saxony: in fact, it is the highest level.
In some places, there have been 30 centimetres of fresh snow that strong winds and fresh winds have scattered.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
Even in the country of Saxe-Anhalt, police authorities have announced serious disturbances on the roads.
On the A2 highway, snow and wind caused a stop in the movement and caused by the mouth.
In Thuringe, snow falls hit the A4 and A9 road.
According to Deutscher Bahn, serious traffic disturbances took place in Saxe, Saxe-Anhalt, Thuringe and north of Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on the railways, trees fallen on the railways, chains or destroyed needles.
In Saxe, interregional transport in Leipzig-Nuremberg had to be interrupted.
In Salfeld, Thuringe, an ICE train to Munich had to stop its journey.
The pumps and paramedics had to provide 165 passengers of the train in blankets, food and drink.
Winds of snow washed the roads.
The snowflakes have produced numerous flight cancellations in Germany's main airports.
According to a standard portal and flight information, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
A Fraport password indicates that 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt on Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that the passengers in the airport are no longer numerous, although 400 liters are available there.
Accidents took place after noon on many roads.
On the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a level pass.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Due to the snow layers on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was caught at a level passage because the vehicle was realigned.
The driver has lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car had a tonne on a skiing boat in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce good news: The snow will always be soft and dusty, but it will turn in case of light raphales.
But the wind is going to go down.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by violent and fast winds.
It does, however, very cold up to 15 degrees per place.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its Christmas tournaments.
The Deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to the information reported by the newspapers, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This property could account for up to EUR 500 million.
The Deutsche Bank is just about to encapsulate the group's headquarters: The Christmas Tours in the Business Quarter have been modernized; while the bankers have to return to their former place of service.
The financial group clearly seeks to recover the costs of renovations and is looking for a buyer for its two real estates, as the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland" says.
This password did not specify the reasons for the planned sale.
He stated "if it is more interesting to take care of the property or to sell it to us, and to relocate it later".
It is also the largest financial institution in Germany that has already handed down its headquarters, not long after.
It was only in the middle of 2007 that the bank had acquired the monthly flows for an amount of EUR 272 million with its own fund holders and then rehabilitated them.
The energy optimisation transformations included about EUR 200 million, according to some indications.
A sale would obviously report a lot of money to the bank.
According to the information provided by the newspaper, experts in this activity sector estimate the value of the tournaments, rebaptised between "Green Tours" and around 500 million euros.
According to the password, we do not know at present whether the properties will be resaled to a bank-owned fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the children who have died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had an idea for schoolchildren who were reported dead following several explosions in a mine.
The body was still unable to be remounted because the safety situation of the silhouettes continued to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 minors between 17 and 62 years of age had been taught under the ground.
A probe had been introduced into the sinister hole, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Due to the strong concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that have followed, no relief team has been able to fall into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and administration had considered that minors no longer had a chance to survive.
So far the bodies could not be remounted.
Today, parents and friends have arranged a memorial celebration for the dead.
Thousands of people were gathered under a sunny sun in Greymouth south of the New Zealand island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of 29 minors, 29 tables were installed on which names, boxes and lamps could be seen.
The photos and personal effects, including the clothes and surfaces, also had their place.
The shipyards were placed in a bar in front of all the country's public buildings.
The New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants at the memorial festival that New Zealand had given hope that the children would remount to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was taught in the caves, said he could not re-sign himself to accept the death of his son until he saw his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the memorial celebration.
Minors of South African and British origin also learned during the first explosion on 19 November.
The rescuers began to spread a fire inside the coal mine of the South island of New Zealand.
Police chief Gary Knowles explained to journalists that when explosive gas masses are moved, burning temperatures inside the mine begin to fall.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the Splatter movie an artificial movie?
Realiser Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the old species through his film, "Wallalla Rising", the champion of the fighter.
To which audience would Danish realiser Nicolas Winding Refn have a good idea of turning "Wallalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) who owns only an eye is made prisoner; he frees himself from his storm and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates his enemies after each other. It seems ideal for young male spectators to seek a bloodthirsty action, just because our hero uses brutal killing methods. When he is in bad mood, he draws his enemies' instincts without expecting them to die.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the borough says no words on its real name. Even the other characters leave to escape, in addition, around one or two sentences a few possible agonism crises.
Otherwise, we say nothing and we celebrate in the beautiful mountain landscape of Scotland, which is the decoration of the Viking universe about a thousand years ago.
This would be more ideal for moderate cinematists who are interested in existentialism and excellent travel.
When a film is directed to several target groups, it is harmful that they are excluded from each other.
The Winning Refn realiser has been considered, since the appearance of "Pusher", his trilogy regarding drug dealers in fashion and style, as a sort of Quentin Tarantano danois, but he refuses to bring a little more humor to the dominant current or introduce a little less brutality to the film of art and testing.
Most of the sympathetics of the art film have to test the ear to the brain that spreads around and to the intestines.
The amateurs of action movies die suddenly when the borough is aboard for reasons that it can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship to Jerusalem; they are buried for an eternity by calm and hunger before the crew arrives in America and continues to retreat.
It is not surprising, then, that "Wallalla Rising" did not find any movie distributor in Germany and that there is only one DVD format.
This is especially due to the great images of the poor who deserve some attention, but also because the image of a palpitating film, from time to time, is hidden behind a prestigious and bleeding appearance.
It is not about dialogue in this film, nor about a coherent action, it is an ambiguity, a warm dream transformed into a film.
The viewer can't escape there.
Refn gives him a moment of detention and slowly cuts his throat with glacial images and a loud sound band, but especially with an insatisfiable hate that engulfs the heart of the people.
Only one young blond boy, who is faithful to the side of the castle, maintains some innocence, all others are animated by anger.
More than that, the hero whose furniture is never known, but who comes from hell at any time to fight enemies and provisionally from allies in war, may be sent by the devil himself.
It represents corruption, but it may also be, nothing but those who are, in any way, fraud.
"Wallalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, which has the purpose of capture, enthusiasm and wonder.
A traumatic experience.
Mastering work of the terrace
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications regarding a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
However, this country refuses to take a position on this issue, even less to be subject to agency controls.
On the night of 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15-boats attacked a mysterious Cuban-shaped building on the Syrian territory.
It is located on the edge of the summit; the largest city nearby is 30 kilometres: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name is contained in IAEA documents, as it is the question of the reactor that Syria has built with the help of North Korea in stone parallelepipede, dissimulated in a valley marked by the lack of electricity current.
According to a briefing by the U.S. intelligence services, the CIA, by the end of April 2008, the current reactor, known as the nearby village, El-Kibar, would be well suited to produce plutonium, which would enable the production of nuclear weapons.
In contrast, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA has shown a video of presentation containing floating satellite images.
Through the animation assisted by a computer, it indicated the likely location of each reactor component before the destruction of the centre, which represents a minimization copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she showed pictures showing the nearby building, i.e. the inside of it.
It appears that the reactor was on duty, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, more information is available than at the time, and even, with time, the mystery is growing.
The former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to this attack, the CIA was certain that Syria had built a reactor in El Kibar, but had no clues showing that the country had developed an "active nuclear-weapon programme".
Some information agents in Europe prefer to be more cautious on this subject and only speak of a "reactive estimate", even if they consider the CIA's presentation "plassible".
They lack tangible evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Questioned about how it was ensured that it was a nuclear reactor, a high-level United Nations diplomat gave only a Laconian response in the past saying that IAEA had "sufficient documentation to ask questions".
The Syrians had certainly taken out the wastes of the "unusual military housing" and had been subjected to a methodical landing on the ground.
However, in June 2008, an AIA team of experts led by former inspector Oli Heinonen, discovered man-made uranium traces at the Al-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA has received a Member State of satellite images of commercial suppliers indicating the time when the attack was directly followed. It seems that the latter are more exciting than those presented by the CIA.
However, these pictures are not available on the market because the anonymous commander, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for IAEA to establish its authenticity objectively.
Syria has always made sure that it has never carried out a secret atomic programme and that it has not built an reactor.
Damas claims that the uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
However, the IAEA rejected this argument after the analysis of the particles by qualifying as imputable.
Since then, Damas has rejected any discussion on this, as well as on satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow inspectors to carry out a second inspection on the Al-Kibar site and refuse access to the demolitions of the building destroyed by the bomb.
Yet, even Israel kept a secret.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in exercise at the time of the attack, recently stated: "We will never comment on this."
Thus, the investigation on this matter has been ongoing since June 2008 without a result and has become "increased in a serious credit issue of the Agency", as recognized by a Western High-level diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, which is ultimately a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
The IAEA considers that in order to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of three other installations that must have "a functional report" with the alleged reactor.
To date, the inspectors have not indicated or indicated what installations are in place here, what their function is or what they are suspected to be.
According to information published in the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskanariayah as well as the name of nearby cities.
The Washington Institute of Independent Science and International Security identified these sites and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf, which would probably be one of the suspicious objects.
It is possible that it is in a military base or directly on its side; that is exactly why Syria refuses to access the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is claimed that the Syrians reduce that the inspection group is actually spies sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy out military installations.
In fact, it is information provided by U.S. secret agents that draws the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made ships between the three sites and the stone parallelepide to transport substances.
A high-ranking Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "use to produce fuel".
There would be no "indications about sensitive activities", such as the enriching and withdrawal of uranium; processes that are essential for the production of nuclear weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works through non-rich uranium.
However, there is the strength of positive assumptions regarding the following fundamental issues: where uranium should have come and where the plutonium needed for the production of the bomb would have been removed later.
It is ignored if the records, which could hide traces of great value, were stored on the three sites.
When hundreds of land-loaded trucks have disappeared, no one will have information about the storage site of the graves.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had examined Al-Tibni salt mine in 1998, located only a few kilometres from El-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, in order to see if it could agree to the storage of radioactive waste.
In a recent analysis of photos taken by satellite for the account of the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley established a link between them and the reactor in question.
Photos taken by satellite show, however, that Syria has undertaken terrace work on the three suspicious sites and has moved huge containers when IAEA began to demand access to these sites.
It is possible that this is a coincidence, but this has not contributed to removing doubts.
It is said in the diplomatic environment that the IAEA has been developing a plan on inspections to be carried out for several months. This plan should enable Syria to maintain any military secrets. Only the investment time shows the great interest of inspectors in this regard.
In the meantime, Damas also made this proposal.
One year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not done so, the emergency would not be reported for this matter, for example, saying Glyn Davies, the US Ambassador who has been referring to what has been known for a few months under the name of special inspections, one of the most powerful means the Atomic Energy Agency has to implement its controls.
The Director of the IAEA, Mr Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option I'm open to in the future", but he still hesitates.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, there is a need for a majority of the IAEA Governors Council and a large number of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation on the scale.
On the other hand, like this diplomat who thinks, "It would be useful if they found nothing at all"
Love in Wartime
It's bad since Angelina Jolie made her early childhood as a realist.
She wrote the scenario herself: it is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbian origin.
We do not know anything about this story anymore, but that is enough to cause the curse.
A persistent roommate indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian storm during the war of Yugoslavia.
Bosniak women's federations were immediately protested. In response, some of the turnout sequences planned in Sarajevo have been moved in the last minute in Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film was filmed in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war sent a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and requested that she meet the actress.
She's not a diplomat, but a few weeks ago, she offered these women a meeting with them in Hungary, but those who chose this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," said Hasecic.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario says a lot about her attitude toward the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic's organization has subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commissioner to withdraw the quality of good will from Angelina Jolie.
But, in fact, what kind of Jolie script did she write?
The Bosniak Ministry of Culture, who received copies of its scenario, gave a tour permit to Sarajevo after a few weeks, but we do not know why it did not come yet.
The young author himself ensures that she does not pursue political goals with her film, but that she is making a lot of effort to face the Yugoslavian conflict, and she supports her desire to implement the terrible consequences of the war and to give all the parties involved the opportunity to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circle on the Net. It is quite different: The lovers knew each other well before the start of the war. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
This is also a big difference with the version "a victim of violence loves his storm".
That Jolie's movie started well before the war, of course.
The pressure on it, as Jolie says, is "unjust and based on incorrect information".
Now, only Hollywood fanatics can seek peace: by illegally placing this scenario in the Net, as well as others before.
Let's go!
Tonight, everything goes back to the Irish.
no trace of disturbance.
That is why the local team dominates too much visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans shout joy at the background of a strong music, they shake their feet.

Cian Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drinking game and reserved information, these two behaviors are really not going well together.
And yet, 26-year-old man is trying to smile, to turn away from the scary question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in its projects. In January, it will run crews in New Zealand.
"I try a strange feeling," he said.
"The country is so far away and I have no job."
Finally: Her copy is waiting for her already in Auckland, "at least two, she revealed her wish to work as an event project manager, perhaps a good sign," said the young man smiling.
Because of the country's dark prospects, two of Tanner's three sisters have tried their chances abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social assistant, lives in Sydney, her Colin brother now serves as an IT consultant in London.
Young people go: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts from the Institute of Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even planned a number of 200,000 immigrants from here by 2015.
This is a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts are met, it will be a comparable migration stream to which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic booms during which the Irish enjoyed great ease, the chagrin now takes the whole place.
However, the economic crisis affects particularly young Irish, well-trained, who have known so far only moments of happiness.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's too much money.
But, in the meantime, three persons under 30 years of age are in unemployment.
The Irish Times magazine publishes extensively the letters of readers written by young immigrants, who complains: "In Ireland, everything is going to come."
"There should be a rise against politicians and bankers, but whoever has the opportunity, our country and a whole generation are going."

"But work abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new professionals to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy," the manager said.
Its website shows photos of surfing in Australia and snow surfing in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a career, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
Six months, Seán O'Donovan, knows what it means to be founded again.
As there was nothing to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector and Germany.
A modest house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannover or Berlin projects.
In the meantime, O'Donovan only rarely visits his native country, because he participates in an additional job, so that he can complete the credit awarded to build his home in the native country.
"The situation is already a bit of a finger," he claims by breaking the threshold of his home for the first time after a long time.
"I get money from Germany to build a house in Ireland where I don't actually live anymore."
He ebbs from a rinsed smile through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-cared garden, expensive large brand cars are located on the access routes.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister for an amount of €380.000, funded by the credit 100 percent.
"There were moments of fun, no doubt, the money was easy," he said.
Is he afraid to see everything go wrong because of the credit?
O'Donovan thought for a moment, became angry and said, "I don't have children to keep and I'm young; even if everything goes through, I can go to zero."
The construction engineer does not like the complaints he often hears in recent times.
"No one should suffer hunger, our situation is not even as dramatic as what we have ever experienced here on the island," he supports.
"Trade for a while abroad, this is not what can happen worse, maybe it's what makes us feel Irish first.
He laughs and then speaks of his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
"It was about to come back after seven years and, in Ireland, life was just going on."
This idea is good for Cian Tanner.
Leave the future and discover how life is going on.
In its palmares, He has already spent several years working in London. That is why life should not be so easy in New Zealand for him and his wife.
But there's another thing that worries you about these last days: the festival to be held on the occasion of its 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He's afraid she can't turn around in the afternoon.
"Only, not a lot of emotions," he said with a long beer throat.
"One day, it seems all the same concern."
"Let's call this one night to see, all arrested, meeting some friends, with some drinks and some games."
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as is the case with the private enterprise.
Crime has become more of a concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in a large part of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the last Latinobarometer survey taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
As the survey has been carried out regularly since 1995, it follows the change of attitude in the region.
Two related elements are the results of this year's survey, carried out in September and early October.
The first is the well-insolent humor of Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries throughout the South American Peace (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per cent per year since 2002, the support for democracy has gone from a minimum of 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a strong decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most popular countries in the region, are convinced democracies, which reduces the regional average (see table 2).
Some 44 per cent of the region's respondents were satisfied with the way democracy was functioning in practice; this is the same figure as last year but with a strong increase of 25 per cent in 2001 (Figure 3).
Some 34% said they had confidence in the Parliament of their country and 45% in their government, the same as in the last two cases; however, they grew significantly compared to 2003 (i.e. 17% and 24% respectively).
Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America were fueled by support for democracy.
If this has been good during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America have experienced only a brief recession and have benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has contributed to the protection of the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty has increased slightly in 2009 and has again fallen to 32 per cent this year.)
But humour varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is translated by a widely shared sense of progress
What is more rare in Mexico and Central America is where the recession has been more severe and where violent crimes have become worse.
This is only for the second time since the poll began that more than one response across Latin America in general mentioned crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see table 5).
Some 31% say that they or one of their neighbours have been victims of a criminal act during the school year; however, this figure is down to 38% in the last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in the increase in support for the private enterprise and the market economy: approximately 71% of the region's respondents say that the private enterprise is essential for development, compared to 56% in 2007 (see Figure 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their developing countries, against 47% last year.
It is interesting that 62% of Venezuela's respondents are of this opinion (80% support the private company); although their left president, Hugo Chavez, is expropriated by many private companies.
Brazil is the largest in the region, mentioned by 19 per cent of the respondents (18 per cent last year), followed by the United States (9 per cent, changed to last year) and Venezuela (9 per cent, 11 per cent since last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential country in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A raised vote
No one expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on 28 November.
But it was much worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country was shaken and frightened.
Boxes were presented and a new box was presented, ballots distributed in the gouts, polling offices and intimidations.
The voting offices opened late in the evening.
Many of the Haitians, including many who have been moved after January's seismo, would have gone to the neighborhood to find out where to vote.
Some of them ended up leaving.
A dozen candidates to the presidential board, including several of the alleged favorites, have denounced the fraud and claimed the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have been launched through the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, considers the event "a pretty good choice in matters".
Observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community have plainly stated that they did not "believe that these irregularities, as serious as they are, were necessarily invalidating the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are renegotiated to René Preval, the outgoing president, and his candidate Jude Celestin, must announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The second round is scheduled for January.
All expectations in the election are not lost.
The two candidates for the opposition, Michel Martelli, a rap musician, and Mirlanda Manigat, an old lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared null.
However, there may be problems if Mr. Celestin, who has little or no tangible support for the electors, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second tower reaching the second round.
With a cholera epidemic that is rare, and more than 1 million survivors of the seismo still living in tents, it was feared that participation would be involved.
On the occasion, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disorganization.
Nearly 250 000 identity cards, required to vote, have not been distributed a little time before the election.
The engine is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, of course, the Haitians do it themselves.
The point of feet towards the center
The following weeks after becoming so late, Cristina Fernández, President of Argentina, received a public-sympathy wave that improved his approval rate of 20 points by more than 50%; it is the highest level since its election in 2007.
However, turning this into a successful campaign for a second term of office during a election the next year could depend on the choice of Ms. Fernández, apparently in pain, according to which she would abandon the intransigence of her deceased husband, predecessor and former political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the habit of developing budgets that were underestimating tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income voluntarily.
Ms. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year on paper.
However, the opposition was divided, and the situation worsened in the development following the death of Mr. Kirchner of a heart attack on 27 October.
Some of the dissident members of the Peruvian movement have joined Ms. Fernández.
But after caatholic meetings (when a parliamentarian struck one of his peers and others accused the government of corruption), Congress did not approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
At present, the 2010 budget will be applied next year, leaving the President with even greater scope for voluntary spending.
The economy is wide-ranging: it is likely to grow by around 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation is now 11.1% but many private estimates and unions' salary claims are close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took his role in 2003 when Argentina was alarming economic collapse, made a priority for growth and poverty reduction rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, he hacked the private sector and cleaned the INDEC, the statistical office, which had been falsified by official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández modernise these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit salary increases in the next year by 18%.
The economy has been stimulated by high global export prices in Argentina.
However, inflation has led to a drop in the momentum of growth following a strong decline in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernández showed signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations to the rest of the world.
This year, the Government concluded an agreement with the officials who had refused a prior restructuring of the debt for which Argentina had not settled its deadlines in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be raising towards and agreement with creditors governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve supervision by the IMF, as usual.
But last month, Amado Boudou, Minister of the Economy, announced that the Fund would provide a "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index, which is similar to a prelude to the INDEC's consolidation.
It is not clear whether Mrs Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her mandate, now that her husband is no longer at her side.
If she does, she needs to get support from the middle class, among which Kirchnerism is very disappointed.
When Argentinans return from their summer vacations in Mars, the wave of sympathy for her will have flown.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not she will have a lot of politics of her husband.
A half-hour for China
The Taiwanese electors are heading towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother on the other side of the desert?
More than 7.5 million voters were present on 27 November, or 70 per cent of the eligible persons, to elect municipal mayors and advisers in five urban districts, as a general assessment of the President, Ma Ying-jeu.
Mr. Ma himself has become a substitute for feelings related to the continent, with new links of innovative business, including a partial free trade agreement, in the biggest reorganization of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. I did the test, but it's all right.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) has won three of the five seats, he has failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic-Progressist Party (DPP), which considered Taiwan's complete independence, won almost 50% of all votes for the 45% KMT.
If this had been a presidential poll, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's vote decreased by about 8 per cent.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with KMT in municipal councils.
The event has revealed most of the main themes of Taiwanese elections, including camping trucks and mass-assemblies with girls dancing in minimal detention.
A compulsory mysterious murder attempt has also been perfected.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, the honorary president of KMT, made an election tour for a KMT candidate in charge of the election.
A man of the crowd drew on young Mr. Lien, just through his face, hurting him and killing a passerby.
Unfortunately, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to harm Mr. Link or to settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any event, Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, said that the murder had an impact on the election by leading the DPP suspicion and turning the voters to KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the elections was China.
It was touching to see how much of the Continental Party itself was absent.
Instead, the candidates enjoyed plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its independence of fact and hates China's military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid stopping its links with the government of Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from activating the anti-Chinese feeling.
This is the answer to a new consensus that Chinese companies are essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, said that he had made a confirmation to know whether his Chinese policy was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing Government will continue to provide commercial facilities, in accordance with its strategy to return to Berlin, to Taiwan.
China has not lost any time to send a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, it would also like to see political integration; but it begins with the beginning.
This is better to wait after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has recovered in any way.
Two years ago, it was wrong: his former boss, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison after charges of corruption.
From 2000 to 2008, he was an advocate for an explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates saw the day under the direction of Ms. Tsai and the PDP put in place to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was welcomed as a DPP candidate to the presidency, such as His Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their part is doing its best to show that he can also engage with Pekin.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their stakeholders could have a position without prior conditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party presented a "dependable alternative of confidence" in relation to the alleged approach of Mr. Ma to China.
Mr. Chen seems to have been exacerbated by this change.
In a statement published from his cell, he stated that PDP candidates would have obtained better results if they had insisted that Taiwan was a separate country.
He even ordered Mr Su, a pragmatic, not to interfere with the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will have a bad choice between its potential candidates.
KMT must do an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's evaluations were weak; despite genuine economic growth, KMT's candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its incompatibility seems to be largely due to unemployment and the expansion of the gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman said his cabinet and his local antennas would be repaired.
The good results of the PDP suggested that Taiwan's support for the approach should be limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanis see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, an editorialist, "the point of not returning is already gone."
Appointments to Grammy Awards: the jazz song Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "best new artist"
To make a president's request, and people need to know.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist named by President Obama for his Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, noted one of the surprises of Grammy Awards this year with a large appointment in the category of the "best new artist".
Considering that Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since its 2008 album, "Esperanza", the appointment remains a little mysterious, but it is compatible with the rules of Grammy Awards that an artist should not produce more than three albums before the registration; which "determines the public identity of this artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", has certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaged vocal style, his popular pop and fun and his Latin influence, it is possible to draw at least a line drawn to Spalding in relation to Norah Jones's success in 2003, which is the closest equivalent for the Grammy Awards voters, taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
In addition, the Grammy Awards electors have just the honor of Vijay Iyer Trio's "History" in the " instrumental album" category, a spring spring that was one of the leading favorites last year.
Among these yesterday, the "Moody 4B" of Veteran saxophonist James Moody and the "Positoothly" of keyboardist John Beasley will be particularly competitive.
Thrombone Shorty, in favour of the new Orléans' red voice and often invited to HBO's "Treme", was honored in the contemporary jazz category; which is also strongly attached to some merger with Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The secret Society of the wild Darcy James Arge, familiar with the steampunk, won some well deserved recognition in the large group; in competition with the wealth of Billy Children's room and the eternal adventure Dave Holland whose album "Paths" of his live octopus was a good example of the democratic hand of this bassist as head of the group.
Name of Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey run in classic categories
The classic names for the 53rd Grammy Awards are a mixture of musicians and composers from around the world.
In the headings, Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machine", for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and "Dreamhouse" by Steve Mackey, an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among those appointed to be associated with South California, there is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No.4, "Los Angeles", a work directed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of the composer based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in line for a reward.
The classic names are divided into 13 categories covering orchestra records, opera, choir and solo records.
A category for the classic producer of the year features five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Malinson.
The classic album names are the Symphonies n°3 and 4 of Bruckner of the Royal Orchestra du Concertgebouw; "Deus Ex Machine" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Daugherty of Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" of Steven Mackey of Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the art of Castrati" featuring various artists; and the "Requiem" of Verdi of Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the names are "Lulu" by Berg of the Orchestra du Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse du Ars Lyrica Houston; "The Love of Loin" by Kaija Saariaho of Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted walker" by Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchestra and the Choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and "Ivanhoé" by Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for the contemporary composition count Pärt for the Symphony n°4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machine", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatimotto Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Grafiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No.4 took its first place at Disney Hall in January 2009 in an execution registered by the philharmonic Orchestra of Los Angeles, headed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil machinate Mikhail Khodorkovski, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was designated for its sole instrumental performance with a orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles said that he had just written the 15-minute work especially for the interpretation of the Avi Avi Avital manual, which played the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
"I wrote it using the sounds of the Middle East and a large number of North Africa's games and rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old Orchestra chief Pierre Boulez received a nomination in the Orchestra performance category to lead the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky works.
Among the instrumental soloists who received a nomination are the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-Andre Hamelin; the organizer Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only vocalist-soleist names; these are Anne Sofia Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the class of classical blends, Soprano Jessee Norman received a nomination for his registration "Racines: my life, my song"
The project of the Temcula mosque succeeds the approval of the planning committee.
A demonstration project in Temcula received the unanimous support of the local planning committee after more than five hours of public witnessing, often accompanied by passion.
Critics took the project by claiming that it was promoting both terrorism and trafficking embassies.
The Commissioners, however, held Wednesday evening that the new religious centre respected local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people have come to support it: Christians, Jews, Bahais, you mention it," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, taking the word Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of you as an American citizen."
"It shows that justice brings it."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting began at 18 hours and lasted until almost midnight with, for most of the time, people speaking for or against the centre, in the time of a little bit of speech, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the website of the newspaper.
"There's no more America," wrote an interviewer.
"It's another song planet with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America's fallen."
The planned Islamic centres also triggered protests in other parts of the country, including the Zero Ground, where the attacks of 11 September 2001 occurred in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoussh condemned violence in Temcula Valley.
Its congregation of 135 families co-existing without incident in the Riverside County for years, but it wanted a larger and better space than the enterprise that it sold on a shared property with a water filtering system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-footed museum in the Mediterranean style architecture would be composed of two mines and would rise to 43-foot high.
It would occupy a 4,32 hectares on Nicolas Road about two thousand east of the Chapral Street.
Opposers can still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
An arsenic tolerates the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or otherwise.
The discovery of a foreign bacteria, which can use the arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new forms of life on Earth and may be there.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say that this shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That's why she's very special, even though she's far from being a really "foreign" way of life," said Paul Davies C. W. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report in the online edition of Science magazine.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and suffering.
But researchers have found that the bacteria discovered in the Lake Mono in California are able to continue to develop after replacing the phosphoric by the arsenic.
"We are asked what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
Discovery is important in the search for life beyond Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not reveal the details of the finding, generated speculations on the Internet that the report could reveal the discovery of an alien life.
That wasn't the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms could be able to use other elements to act on biochemistry and that the entire "standard" of the elements that we think absolutely necessary for life could not be established," commented Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute of Planetary and Space Science, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a lucky discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Symon of NASA's Institute of Astrophysics, who conducted the study, chose Lake Mono because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, it specified that a microbe exposed to the two substances could be able to replace each other.
"Arsenic is mainly toxic because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of the phosphorous."
"As a result, the agencies have a tendency to distinguish these elements separately."
"But the arsenic is quite different so it doesn't work exactly like the phosphorous; it paints inside and, in some way, destroys the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar explained.
Researchers collected the known bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to growing arsenic concentrations that it could adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with the phosphorous but the fact that it can live with the arsenic at the site raises the possibility that a life form using the arsenic can naturally occur either on Earth or on another planet or on the moon where the arsenic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant microbiology professor at the University of Florida, said that the idea, according to which the arsenic could be replaced by the phosphorus, was not new; but nothing ever showed that it could go.
Arsenic was more frequent at the beginning of the existence of the Earth, she said; thus, researchers showed the hypothesis that the first forms of life could have used it.
This suggests that there may be other ways to shape life, not just how life on Earth was formed at the beginning," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Symon's research team.
Research was funded by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two flying exposure dogs were found in Compton.
The other two exhibition dogs on four flights from the outside of a motel in Bellflower were found, the officers of the Los Angeles county announced it Thursday.
The four exposed dogs - two akata and two yellow pembroke dogs - disappeared on Tuesday when someone flew the Chevrolet Express truck where they had spent the night outside a Bellflower 6 motel, the authorities announced.
Two dogs were recovered after midi and the other two were found at the end of Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, the spokesman of the department of the sheriff of the Los Angeles county.
"The good news is that dogs are going well," said Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They were restored to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where dogs had been found, in what neighborhood and what circumstances they had discovered.
"An investigation is ongoing."
"We don't want to say it," Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide a comment on Thursday.
They met Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a shelter for animals from the county located in Downey.
The sheriff's assistants found the truck and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old man, and Didi, a 10-month-old woman - were healthy and safe, announced the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the ravens Rickard and Peek had planned to show regional competitions this week, for the owners of Japanese dogs, had disappeared until their Wednesday night discovery.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend in the framework of the National "AKC/Eukanuba" champion of Long Beach, where they were to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in other trials scheduled in the days prior to the exhibition "AKC/Eukanuba", said Peek at the Wednesday Times.
South California is one of the ends of the canine exhibition tour of nearly a month of the couple.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked the motel.
They often stay in the motels and earn their truck outside, just next to the window of their room.
They raised three other dogs - a closed boxer, a terraier Parson Russell and a Spanish breton - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the cortis, in the thicker furrow, in the truck where it would be more expensive.
They've got some windows open, so dogs can have some air.
Peek and Rickard reported the truck's flight at 6:00 a.m.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could drive them to the cortisols, a micropouse installed to identify them.
It is not clear whether a reward was granted on Thursday.
The lion is ready to rediscover again, the restructuring of MGM is only waiting for the final green fire of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got green fire to begin with zero.
A federal judge of New York's failure officially praised the "pre-paid" plan by creditors, who said that about $5 billion of debt would be cleared; opening the way to the entertainment company, with 86 years of existence, to concentrate its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television.
With the decision of Thursday, according to which the plan met the requirements of the United States failure code, no further legal obstacle exists in front of the MGM in order to take place under the auspices of Entrepreneurship Spyglas, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the general directors of what will be an alleged study.
Staff will be collected to approximately 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 as long as JPMorgan Chase will not conclude a 500 million-dollar credit facility, which is intended to finance new MGM operations and production.
It is currently distributed under a licence by the Investment Bank, which itself amounts to $75 million, and should be financed until mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009 when the Moelis & Co. Investment Bank was engaged to advise the management on how to place its funds, since it had no means of paying interest to $300 million a year.
In August, Director-General Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, an old Enron's PDG and a well-known recreating expert for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and meet more than 140 students of the studio took much more time than planned.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed to sell the company at the end of 2009.
However, the sale of bribes attracted a few bidders among whom none of them were willing to pay the amount of 2 billion more than the creditors were looking for.
At the beginning of this year, there was a need to re-examine it when the MGM team had begun to work on a restructuring plan which, after months of internal disputes and discussions, was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially fails in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies receive several million dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, who collected $375 000 a month for their business management services, will receive a "cash of success" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum intend to relaunch the production of MGM, which came out only one film this year, and put in place an annual list of seven or eight films that would come out of 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "the Hobbit", with Warner Bros
The studio must conclude a separate loan between $265,000,000 and $275 million to finance its share in these two films, which must be made by Peter Jackson.
Investigator Carl Icahn, who holds around 18% of MGM's debt, tried to realize a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Tech Games to keep your budget in balance
Although the main candidate for this year's most wonderful this year is the IPAD, follow, perhaps through Microsoft's video game system, Kinect, both can make an important step in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bicycles at $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 strings to jump classic pearls, or about 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget balanced.
Recently, I visited three national game sellers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" You and the Wholesale Club of BJ - to see the electronic games I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that the Law of Moore has evolved, the technological game of this year is likely to have more strength; yet, at the same price, there is a little less, compared with the last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new games associated with Web sites, two of the most known types, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And pile games with buttons are increasing, as well as game with rechargeable piles.
Here's some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" You, unless otherwise indicated.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and more) are playful games of the size of an Indian cocoon that sings a note when you hold them on your belly.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second allows a song to be composed.
If you buy more, they'll sing in harmony.
Warning: once you start to support, you can no longer stop.
To combine the song with the dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and more) is the best choice.
Inspired by Elmo Live's technology last year, the 14-inch animated doll plays around games like Simon Says and can make the moon dance thanks to its innovative articulating feet.
Children who have attempted the game use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain of a lack of control of the volume.
If you are a child in the '80s, you will remember Alphee, one of the first computerized educational games.
It's back (hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and more), with a bag full of two questions game cards designed to transform a car ballade into a session with auto-correction and a van class.
If you are upset when your child has your smartphone, here are three independent options.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for the 3-8 years) is the least expensive and most easy to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although games are not as effective as the Leapster Explorer ($70, for the 3-12 years), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a more recent and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, for 3-7 years) uses a iTunes-type system to offer electronic games and books and has an SD card entry that allows family photos to be displayed.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a collection of five-block pens greater than a light box, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before the time comes to school, it is ideal for an improvised spelling contest.
In addition, players have a kind of online connection.
It is based only on their presence in toys stores, the two biggest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet from the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for the 6-12 years) that includes a marked part of a hidden code.
When you buy the online code, your child receives enough credit in the Club Penguin store for two items to choose.
It can be made of rolls or of a company animal playing Puffle.
slightly larger than the dust at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and more) is the last micro-robots with a button.
The fake animal quickly moves on 12 healthy silicone pads in random directions.
It's fun to make a labyrinth of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
She's strong too.
We survived a fall in the kitchen table and even a temporary passage in our dog's throat.
Bring a softer side to maintain order in China
Tang Shenbin was a city's place as a urban officer in training by seriously inspecting his nerves, by issuing low-vote orders with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of the Chengguan - responsible public officials in China, afraid and disappointed for their arbitrary repression and thought of violence - to convey some impressions to a whole audience.
"You're right!"
"Be readers!"
Show them, say, "What do the beautiful girls look like?"
Four girls who had been punished for their teenage years with white gloves, clothes and identical olive-colored pants, were at your side.
Four pairs of black-to-sharp shoes, aligned with the rule.
Four perfectly wrapped hats in the sum of hair attached by a blue and white needle.
"I personally think they have an average appearance," said Mr. Tang, with shame.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of the city inspectors of China.
A city required all new recruits to have a higher degree of study.
The province of Guangdong has changed the gray-haired uniforms against a more aggressive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced them with a strong one: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had attempted an uncontrollable snack carriot by throwing black views, firmly for half an hour, until the co-rapporteur repatriated his business and part.
Xindu, a city district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen to perform a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police in the urban environment of 13 women, especially chosen for their appearance, dress and age.
The idea is to give the police a softer side, more female.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson could have difficulties attracting attention to this underground urban brigade of China
And for that reason, critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to comply with municipal orders by imposing amendments or other administrative sanctions.
The Chinese media, however, reflect the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the province of Hubei killed an observer after using his mobile phone to film them while spreading a protest against a discharge of waste.
Last year, a training manual for Pekin inspectors, discussed and put in line, describes how the offenders effectively win without issuing blood.
This year in Shanghai, a pastor was left with a brain injury after a luggage with five officers.
A video game free of violence, available by online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained in street sales.
"Chengguan has marked the government," China Daily, a national publication last year, after a polymeric on tactics.
The newspaper called for a "full cleaning."
Sceptics say the approach is far away.
After the district passed an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, asked whether women had real jobs or whether they were just a tourist fun.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district announcement required female candidates aged 18 to 22 years old to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five faces of the face in good order."
They must have a size greater than the average, either 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement of 26 years is compulsory.
Officers reported that the work was physically too severe for women over 25 years.
"It's their image that's important," said a certain district officer at Rednet.com, a almost government website.
"First, the external qualities of candidates will determine whether they are appropriate; this is the size, weight, face-to-face treatment, etc."
Then come the "inland" and "inland" qualities.
Chengguan's women are like flower gardens, he said, "In addition to being bazaars, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not share this description.
However, he noted that the high standards were standard in many Chinese employment offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement for the order of the visas.
That this means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, persons with disabilities or disabilities should not postage.
"We can't leave someone who's tired or a boss coming to serve here," said Mr. Zheng.
"He wouldn't give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrols the Baoguang site near a monastery, is 22 years old and has played with a finally incrusted mouth.
She doesn't consider her appearance to be sexist, she says.
"Do you think I'm having sex in this uniform?" she asked for a detached air.
Xu Yang, his colleague at 21-year-old fossils, says: "Our job is to present the city's image."
They are not opposed to their mandate being limited, they say, because they feed larger career ambitions than simply throw sellers into the streets where they are willing to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a dozen ambulances moving fast to foot or bicycle, trying to sell as little bread or tofu bags before taking the flight.
"Master Wang, you must leave."
"We've already said it several times!" said Ms. Xu, while a salesman walked away, temporarily leaving his bicycle-carte to his knees.
Officials describe their functions rather as monotonous than proud.
"It's almost the same thing every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the property of sellers.
They can only threaten to signal opponents to their superior men.
This tends to protect them from Sudanese public demonstrations of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, rebelled after spreading false rumors that the agents of the Chengguan had killed a salesman.
In one night, more than a dozen Chengguan police and police officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were turned or fired.
Xindu has so far escaped from such violence.
But peace is not a guarantee.
Just two beds of houses in Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled this morning, more than 50 people gathered around the street.
The agents confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the trottoir instead of in a store, as they imposed regulation.
The owner of the motorcycle created the scandal.
A 15-minute iron arm followed before the police, in the left-hand side, broke down a narrow road towards their vehicle and were driven at any speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
The 40-year-old Joedong, a male team coordinator, stayed behind, his white luggage returned to hide his name.
Like female sex officers, 40 - year - olds or more - old coordinators play a role in supporting themselves.
Unlike them, they are not formed to keep a clear image.
"Sometimes, we fight in words."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. He said of a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it's the public that starts."
Prosecutors will not involve Senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice raised the criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, from a case related to an old campaign assistant and his efforts to obtain a job of lobbying for the husband of the woman, announced Wednesday to the senator's lawyers.
The decision put an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Republican of Nevada, who was considered to be a potential Republican candidate at the 2012 presidential office until the scandal surrounding his case did not take place in the last year and broke his career.
Mr. Ensign's office stated that he was "very happy" by the decision, resulting from an investigation of one year.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate Committee on Ethics.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said that the Ministry of Justice had "reported that Senator Ensign no longer had the subject of the investigation and that he had no intention of retaining any charges against him in this matter."
The Ministry of Justice has not commented on this.
The announcement came as a surprise for many foreign ethical lawyers in the Ministry of Justice, who would have had significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign had intended to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first reported in the New York Times in October 2009, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to obtain a job of lobbying to gain the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, regarding the senator's case with her.
Ms. Hampton once served as treasurer during an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Insign contacted a number of policy fund holders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they engaged Mr. Hampton to make a lobbying for them, in accordance with documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited for one year by the Lobbying Act with his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seems contrary to the said prohibition of the turning door of lobbying.
According to evidence that has been made public, "there seems to be a prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and substantially violate the law of the returning port," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the defence of clients of a government investigation.
Although the Department's judge refused to explain the reason for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said that the Department seemed to hate political persecution after a number of high-level reviews by its section of public integrity, including the decisions taken last year to abandon the prosecutions against former Senator Ted Stevens accused of misconduct.
The federal prosecutors were clearly afraid to take the weapons, said Melanie Sloan, the Director-General of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defence group that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government official can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief lawyer of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a phone call from a prosecutor of the Ministry of Justice on Monday and a follow-up the following day, saying that the Ministry was not looking for charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's lawyer team had cooperated with the prosecutors to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed him in a communiqué, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made in the park.
"I am not about to enter the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except to say that we think they have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to give up an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that the payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents violated the federal electoral law in Hampton.
The Electoral Commission stated that it did not have sufficient evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, an important Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign has helped Mr. Hampton find the job of lobbying.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after accepting Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's head of office, John Lopez, communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that the Ministry of the Interior was "martial" on a dispute issue.
Mr. Ensign also participated in a dinner with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and asked the transport secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he hired Mr. Hampton to do the lobbying.
When the news of the case came up last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and resigned from his position as head of the fourth republican class in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign stated two weeks ago that he intended to fulfil a third mandate in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said that the senator hoped that the ethics committee would soon follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and finalize the investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she says.
Cheshire's call to Twitter
One and a half of them were trying to get away from the audience room.
They sent every minute of the terrible witness reports via Twitter.
In the end, the defence said there were more than 140,000 messages on the crime process and children attached to their beds in a house that had been burned.
Thursday, the widely followed trial by Steven J. Hayes, who was recognized guilty of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, should be brought to an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
However, Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already deposited elements in the court that challenge the arguments of appeal, which are likely to occupy the courts for years.
What is causing this is that the intention of reporting on the process - as well as the widespread and widespread use of Twitter journalists - has created a " circumcise atmosphere " that is so wide and instantaneous with fire details that the jury has been adversely influenced by public passions.
The request could move the appellants to discuss the question of whether new technologies require new rules in the hearing rooms.
"I have experienced in this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the hearing rooms violates the rights of the person to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, a lawyer by Mr. Hayes, a lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court of State, rejected the claims in the trial last week, asserting that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the trial would have been encouraged by the trial.
But this does not seem to be the last word on the question.
The appeal courses have been recognized for decades that media coverage of known cases can raise questions about the equity of a trial.
In a 1966 judgment, the Supreme Court of the United States rejected the condemnation of a osteopathy in Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in its decision that there was a " carnival atmosphere in the process " due to the media.
Crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for television and the film "The Fleet".
Some lawyers said that the appeals courts were taken to review Mr. Hayes' conviction a half century later, as the argument that new rules might be needed to manage the means of communication of hearing rooms, i.e. during the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason to be concerned about the impact of the new media," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report according to which she was arbitraryly applied.
Professor Donohue said that some appeals judges might be interested in the idea that the limitation of instant communication from hearing rooms could allow more fair proceedings.
The case of Twitter is only one of many others described by the lawyers of Mr Hayes, who may have been discussed for years; this is what slows the execution.
Advocates of defence also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered damage when the Blue Judge refused to allow them to test the responses of potential jury members by showing them macabre photos of criminal scenes during the jury's selection.
Some jurors said they had been Horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and his daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years old.
Advocates of defence claim that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and will claim that the judge has unjustly excavated one of the jury, which had been criticised in the eyes of the prosecutors, and that he had abused the pressure for a verdict by making it an unusual decision to bring the jury to trial on a weekend.
The jury wasn't shocked.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the biggest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case was dominated by the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the electoral campaign by the candidates at the position of the governor and the Senate of the United States.
They maintained that the computer media did not cease to act on the flame of the feeling of the case.
"The daily boutique of media tweets, cameras and journalists in front of the court," wrote the lawyers, "they did not look like anything that had been seen here before in New Haven, and perhaps even at the national level."
Their emphasis on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interview, some journalists said that the claim that the new instantaneouss were more fire-fighting than the communications sent earlier was a ludicrous view that would open the Court's policy governing the media coverage of future proceedings.
However, some lawyers have stated that the appeal courses were often drawn by the arguments that social and technological changes needed to be adapted by the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insisted on this claim.
In their case, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court's decision that had reversed Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the media coverage of the trial and explained that they would need new rules for the new media.
"This case," they wrote, representing Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civilization bring the clivas closer?
After a campaign marked by investment and negation, a minimum of civility was released this week in Washington.
Is this a sign of a true bipartite cooperation to the front or an illusory moment before the rapid return to the partian struggle in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the leaders of the Congress did not raise any doubts about the major issues that must be dealt with during the session of the "Bottle Candard".
However, there was at least a Polish discussion on the differences between the two parties, as well as on the recognition of their shared responsibility to rule, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to mark points.
The Committee's public meeting on the President's deficit was also civilized, despite the remaining political differences among the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect that transcends the ideology; however, it still divides the members.
It is hard enough to declare that a new time for cooperation has arrived.
The two parties are now in a period of testing and mutual testing in order to obtain signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of the electors for a renewed partian war.
That is why the meeting on Tuesday and the subsequent comments of the participants revealed a minimum of requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
As far as taxation, expenditure, health care or rights are concerned, both sides remain thousands of miles away.
However, the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed on the tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now on the side of the Ethical and Public Policy Centre.
"It's inevitable after the elections.
Elections cause divisional passions, and then they stop.
It's okay."
On certain issues, including those on the agenda of the "bottle canard" session, the Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax reductions will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of that.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve a party or the whole, in a permanent or temporary manner.
Similarly, a compromise is visible on the extension of unemployment allocations, since the Republicans cannot give the impression that they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, while refusing unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After the Tuesday meeting at the White House, more optimistic plan on a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the "Bottle Canard", with the ratification of the "New START" agreement.
But William Galston, from the Brookings Institute, warns that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the "duck sea" session will not necessarily lead to a better agreement between the two parties when the 112th convention will meet in January.
Instead, he said, a period of disagreement is likely to be inevitable.
"Once things that have to be done will be done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared scepticism, which would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I consider most of what is happening between today and 2012 as a preview or shadow boxing relative to the major event in 2012, he said.
The reasons are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the electors present in the tea that contributed to its creation.
However, the Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, knowing that they must try to raise their promises to reduce public spending and repeal the new health care law.
These split positions are clear in the initial responses to the recommendations of the deficit committee, which include reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, relieving retirement age and reducing expenditure.
Co-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, according to themselves, have imposed the issue of deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they needed 14 votes in favour to the Commission, consisting of 18 members, to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they had no intention of reaching that number.
The biggest resistance exists among the group's choices; this suggests that there are tax issues, at least today, with little reason or willingness to compromise.
Galston has two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans of Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partnerships, given that the Republicans are opposed to Obama in terms of budgets, taxes and health care; then it will be followed by a period of greater bipartite cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
Public opinion.
It is widely demonstrated that, despite the prevailing spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see both parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to an impalement, as in 1995, the two parties will carefully observe the public's response.
The one who will be judged to be lost will have to change his mind and find compromises.
But it would still be a point of optimism.
The divisive spirit and polarization are more widespread today than they were in the mid-1990s, and it seems that there is a greater ideological difference between Obama and the Republicans of Congress than there were then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, both parties were seen in 2010 as a simple prelude to a more consistent election in 2012.
In view of this reality, this week's civilization could be appreciated by many Americans.
But there will be much more effort on the part of both sides to find an understanding field on the issues that still divide them.
U.S. published documents describe Moscow as a barrier to corruption
The control of the city is between the hands of a "Kleptocratie" and makes it possible to pass to Kremlin a part of the wine and the protection money it collects, the United States Embassy in Russia reported in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service perform huge rockets that help explain the high cost of life in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate enterprises but also organized criminal groups.
Each branch of the bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical power" - takes his part while the money goes up to the top of the scale.
The service note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted by Wikileaks on his website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been searched.
It was edited while Youri Loujkov was still the mayor of Moscow; it is largely responsible for corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitri Medvedev, but there has been little cleaning trails since.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a first-class construction company, have always raised the allegations of corruption over the years; and has obtained several disclaimers on these charges.
In September, he said what happened to a Russian television channel, when he was asked about a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's getting out, it's anything."
The Russians believe, at an alarming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to the polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in a embassy account; it is unusual to imagine that it would be for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the government of the city of Moscow and crime led some people to the term "disfunctional" and to state that the government was operating more like a kleptocracy than a government", according to the ambassador's note.
" Criminal elements enjoy a " krysha " (the term used in the criminal world/mafia which literally means " whole " or protection) through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the Office of the Prosecutor, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the government of the city of Moscow.
"The analysts identify a three-level structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and militias are at second level."
"At last, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"It is an ineffective system in which criminal groups carry a void in some areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB saves the money of the largest companies and that the police target the small ones.
One source, he said, "was explaining that Moscow's business owners understood that it was preferable to have the protection of the MVD and the FSB (more than organized crime groups) because, not only, they had more weapons, means and more power than criminal groups, but they were also protected by the law."
"That is why the request for protection by criminal gangs is not so high."
The note notes that, although the collection of money is extended, the protection itself may be in vain; even those who suffer are sometimes subjected to arrest.
Those who do not suffer quickly see their affairs closed under one or the other.
Medvedev several times mentioned the fight against corruption, but he allowed little progress.
The ambassador's note transmits accounts of people who bring bags, probably full of money, up to Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrats," said Gueorgui Satarov, director of Moscow's "think tank India".
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"He is not part of a political class because he does not exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of power, he said that corruption is inevitable.
According to India, the cost of corruption would rise to well over $300 billion a year throughout Russia.
The country was ranked 154e in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are classified at least as the most corrupt).
The disclosure of the U.S. embassy note, which had only been made yesterday, late in the evening, at hours of Moscow, will definitely eliminate the satisfaction of the Russian government; although Loujkov could be bludgeoned, to some extent, for Moscow's failures, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that he is in the process of solving the problem.
Interviewed by the CNN by Larry King, Putin expressed the hypothesis that WikiLeaks' documents could be a production and reacted angrily to the allegations that U.S. diplomats had disclosed by calling Batman and approaching Medvedev of Robin.
"The problem lies in our interaction, an important factor of internal policy in this country, he said.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would be achieved with such pride, such pressure, and, you know, contrary to ethics."
The old fighters of the Red Khmers are forced to face the past
In a poor class room with badly damaged concrete walls, the director of the secondary school of Anlong Veng mentioned the man who had built it, the last head of the Red Khmers, Ta Mok.
"All the world here loves Your Mok."
"He was a good leader; he was concerned about his people," said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
It is known as "the mouth" for its brutality, when it was at the head of the Red Khmers, that commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of red Khmerrs in the north-west of Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures; and where thousands of ancient soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers returned to the government, the long-term loyalty was finally due to Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation enabled victims to meet publicly those who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school manual that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Red Khmer children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly led with the United Nations, delivered its first sentence on an old member of the Red Khmer, condemning, at 35 years of imprisonment, the former chief of the notorious torture center of Tuol Sling, Kaing Khek Iev, better known under the name "Duch".
In the face of this developments, anxiety has increased among the former combatants of the Red Khmer in Anlong Veng; and the efforts to reconciliation and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society are complicated.
"There are feelings and fear among the old Khmerrs of red, but they are forced to do whatever that is," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent body that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Khmer was glorious, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The gender situation of divisions within families."
Under the Red Khmer regime in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died from hunger, disease or overcrowding.
When the Vietnamese invaded and reversed the Government of Paul Pot-Unis in 1979, the rest of the regime and his army fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There, they launched a surprise that lasted until the last movement took place in December 1998.
While Paul Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were leading their base guard located in the mountains of West Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a follow-up to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement by the United Nations led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of red Khmer fighters began to undermine the government, culminating in the capitalizations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and of Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Paul Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had taken his head, was captured by the government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 waiting for his trial.
Without their beneficiaries, most of the old red Khmer fighters have fallen into black poverty, common to the rural regions of Cambodia; many remain nostalgic of the movement.
Although some red-homer elite officers have kept their positions as local commander instead of placing the weapons, they are non-qualified farmers in the low grade and directory.
"These people received very little follow-up after the capitalization," Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation organized public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are imbibed by the utopian ideology of the regime."
"They have been raised in a framework where business is a foreign concept."
On Lim, aged 55, who joined the Red Khmer as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before being installed as a poor rice grower in 1998.
"Life under the Red Khmer was good," he said.
"Your Mok feeds all over the world."
But now life is difficult because we must meet our own needs."
The High Court of Red Khmer has also raised concerns here.
The court should, at the beginning of the next year, initiate the judgment of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former red Khmer minister.
The court's mandate is to judge the senior leaders and the principal perpetrators of the crimes, but it did not say if it continued beyond these four cases.
It would need more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculations turned to Im Chaem, aged 64, former district head in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the rule of the Red Khmer in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma barrier, a project where thousands of forced workers would have been killed.
Recently, on a dry night, Im Chaem returned from work in the field near his wooden house on pilots, on a road out of Anlong Veng.
While the sun was rising from long shadows on the fallen grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past in the Red Khmer.
If the court had found her, tell her, she would have refused to go.
"Cambodge is peaceful and stable," she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who had made a red Khmer mistake in 1978, also warned several times that an instability would occur if the court continued to suspect several suspects; although experts and historians would answer that.
"Cambodge has to cross a hole and bury the past, he says.
But facing the past is all that Cambodia has to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang from the Documentation Centre.
"The reconciliation in khmer terms is to re-connect the broken bones," he said.
"We have to put these pieces together so we can understand."
The centre produced the first manual approved by the Government on the Red Khmer, "A History of the Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as an addition to the history manuals of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained fewer than four pages on the Red Khmer.
As in most Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know only a few details about the red Khmers, despite the city's links to the regime.
Touch Valeak, aged 19, studying at Anlong Veng high school, said that the new manual helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with scepticism when he returned home with the book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he said.
"They are angry because they don't know exactly how many people the court will continue."
Such resistance has made the process of complex and difficult reconciliation, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
However, the Red Khmers maintain a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the mountains of Dangrek, a road covered by the bad grass and split into plastic bags leads to a black sweating rectangle, covered with a rolled towel.
Paul Pot's body was burned here on a pile of pneuses after his death in 1998.
At 31-year-old Sothea, a street phone vendor, said she didn't know much about the man who was incinerated there.
"But he has a great spirit; and many people will pray there," she said.
It was the anniversary of Nuom Sothea and, later that day, she planned to go to Paul Pot's last place of rest where she would leave a bunch of wall bananas in hopes of bringing the chance.
Belarus agrees to give up its military-quality uranium stock
The Government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it would abandon its highly enriched uranium stock, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide.
The agreement was published in a joint communiqué published after the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Sergei Martinov, in favour of a security summit.
The American government had tried to convince Belarus for years to abandon the highly enriched uranium and seemed to have broken the horizon in the past spring.
But American officials told Washington Post that some classified operations were carried out with Belarus over the last two months to eliminate 187 books from the military quality uranium from a Belarus research center.
This opened the way to a credit agreement to eliminate the rest of about 500 books, according to a staff member who mentioned the condition of anonymat due to the sensitivity of the question.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of the 47 nations Nuclear Security Summit organized at Obama's initiative, where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was beneficial to seek an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit in 2012.
"I am really impressed that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This proves to me that this process works," said Ken Lugo, president of the World Security Partnership, a nuclear security promotion group.
Clinton qualified the "very significant, important step" agreement reached by Belarus.
Obama committed to Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear material across the world in the next four years.
Since then, the American Government has helped six countries to rid themselves of all their rich uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, the Belarusian President, Alexandre Loukachenko, stated that the nation would never relaunch its uranium.
"We have kept the uranium highly enriched, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the uranium of military quality and uranium low-rich," said Mr. Loukachenko.
"It's our product ... we're not going to make salt bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We're going to use it for research, that's all."
Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, however, expressing its interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate the uranium in Belarus was particularly complicated in October because the material had been slightly irradiated, the respondents indicated.
It was loaded on a special train that carried more than 1,300 miles to an installation in Russia to be stored and removed, the officials indicated.
The second operation was completed Monday and was carried out by aircraft, according to the officials.
The U.S. government has spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace the search facilities of Belarus with the low-rich uranium; not suitable for weapons.
"A minute coordination and organization has been implemented in order to strengthen confidence"; leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, Andrew Bieniawski, a member of the Department of Energy Specialized in the Global Development Reduction.
According to the estimates of the Non-Proliferation Study Centre James Martin, Belarus had this year at least 88 books of military quality uranium, and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus seeks to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been under way for years, mainly because of the severe repression by Loukachenko des Human Rights.
But the statement of credit would suggest a potential renewal.
"While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential to improve bilateral relations; and essential to the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The Government has not issued any objections to CIA flights
The Government has not issued any objections to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners headed by Guantanamo across the Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the United States ambassador to Madrid.
This was demonstrated by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks in El País, which added that the first vice-president of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández of Vega, had requested that the Spanish Executive be informed to "may show that they exercised adequate surveillance on foreign aircraft crossing Spain".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe that accused of complex human rights practices in twelve countries, including Spain, a meeting was held between former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The vice-president acknowledged that the Council's report "was surprised by the Government of Zapatero outside the game" and stressed that Spain had nothing to hide.
"From the Vega has emphasized that Spain has no objection to flying intelligence over the Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" in order to avoid "take them to the desert," says Aguirre in a cable.
The official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the day, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the Ambassador that the Spanish Executive "would give the lowest possible profile, even if, as it was in the hands of judges, the Government had limited influence".
In January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente Gonzalez transmitted to the Embassy the fact that he did not have to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no criminal element, no sensitive information," explained the Embassy after speaking to the prosecutor.
The United States has also expressed concern about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than about the information issued by the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will be complicated by our efforts to deal with the case secretly between Governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007, on a breakfast between the United States Ambassador and the Minister of the Internet, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba commented that "even if the Spanish judges are extremely jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had instructed his colleagues "to avoid comments from a literate rétoire, trying to redefine the temperature".
The Ambassador also expresses his concern about the PP's action in this regard.
"In spite of its general American guidance, our experience suggests that PP will certainly be part of any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," she said.
The paricide that passed on to the blind complained on the "accapable" network of being a mother.
The young girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Treaty at the Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is a "Muki" in the network.
With the nickname she used since she was a child, she communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two origins of Noia, the village of Coruña.
The messages are due from 2008.
To understand them, you need to know your emotional life, which ABC builds with the help of the testimony of its parents.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had started a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, industrial.
Their relationship lasted for a year.
Not long after they separated, we learned that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was with him, but his ex never let him do the DNA test.
We found another little friend after that.
The hero was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring town.
With him, she's been with him for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the young girl went to the Balearic Islands to visit the labour market, the girl stayed with her partner, who also accompanied her for a week in Palma.
But according to the content of his communications, it is understood that their idyllicity broke, they separated.
In March 2008, she was in Minorque alone, and she writes: "Alberto is very strange and famous for the fact that I have come to work."
"When I told him, it showed him a good thing, but of course, he now takes into account what it means to be with the child all day and does not have the freedom to do what he wants."
And then she speaks of a mobile message she just received: "I want you to come in this month or give me an address to send the child to you."
She complains: "If that doesn't please him, let him go with my mother, and I'll take her when I get in," she complains.
In May, she said of her return to her village: "I'm going this week, but I'll only stay until 19, because I have to present myself to a job so that I don't lose it."
She explains that if everything went well, she would have taken her ass with her.
"He will stay with the right person, i.e. with me, and I will never leave him with another person if this person is not my mother," suspicious intention, taking into account their bad relationships.
In July, there's another place.
When she struck him, it was assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, was reportedly murdered on the 10th.
"Cessar's happy on one side, but he's not on the other."
"He's with me on one side, and this place likes him a bit, but another goes to school almost every day."
She's talking about a move to Majorque.
"There's anger (the child) in a few hours of summer, and like this, I'm saving some money from the baby-sitter."
The 17th salute and complaints.
"A very big kiss on Caesar's side, who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent you, I don't know what videos on the e-mail, you see, when he wants it, he finds me, shit."
On the 30th, another: "The child is well, he goes to summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Victor, he's a current partner, there's a "I'm ahead of the money."
On the Internet she has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had a sign in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the prison liberator."
"Treaty at the Galician (epigraph) " .
The last man who lived with her, watch out, confess his regret to feel guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Monica went into Palma's provincial prison yesterday, from the centre of juvenile justice.
The lawyer of the office, Carlos Maceda, explained that she did not remember how the facts had happened, "and she had no intention of doing harm to the minor anymore."
Before she had learned that she had kissed Caesar in the bathroom and buried her body in a suitcase.
The defence and prosecutor asked for a psychiatric test.
The members of the People's Party would receive 4 seats in Congress and the PSC at a loss of 9
With the results of 18-N, the PP could be determined in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and MEPs recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PPP has already referred to the generals because, whether there is progress or not, the prospects are more positive than the number of votes that this training is achieved in these two committees usually the one it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the Catalan people received 610,473 votes in 2008 to the General Assembly, while the 2006 autonomouss had received 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384.091 votes.
If this trend is maintained, desired by a shift in the PSC votes and the confidence of the PP electorate, the analysts of this training calculated that, if there were general elections, the PPC could have passed from 8 to 12 members in Congress, while the CIU would also receive four (he now has 10) and the PSC would have lost neither fewer nor less than 9 Members (he had 25).
These calculations would indicate that the Catalan space is fundamental to PP and PSOE.
According to the population analysis, the ERC would lose a member - he has three now - while ICV would save one member or win one.
But if the electoral agenda is maintained, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for municipal commissions, where the population can also be determined at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relations with the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations managing the highest budget - 661 million euros for 2011.
Both nationalists and the populace agree that PSC could lose the mayors of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would no longer have the opportunity to benefit their traditional partners, CRC and ICV.
In view of the Republican debachment, it would not be fantastic to lose this training in Barcelona's capital - it is necessary to get 5% of the votes.
The PP has increased its voting number in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Joseph Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes in relation to PSC, whose mayor, Angel Ross, maintains a very good relationship with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they found themselves several times.
The population also recorded progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
The PPP is now present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and is seeking to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell has made thousands of passports available in Al Qaida
In addition to the seven prisoners in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian officers of the General Information Commission of the Barcelona Police formed a Jihadist cell, which, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to various Al Qaida groups, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Land Tamil" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiiba" (Let), the last to be the author of Bombay's attacks that resulted in the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has attached great importance to these investigations, in order to ensure that "the Kampai operation" "has been weakened" by Al Qaida's falsification device at international level and "as a consequence, its operational capacity".
Researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years during which it was active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they have been counterfeited and distributed to groups that integrate the criminal galaxy Al Qaida so that its "combatants" can cross the European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The demented cell is not the only one that the Jihadist network has been operational in Europe, which is why the research involved, in addition to the Thai services, of other European police units, that is why there could be the following days of similar cuts to that recorded on Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Juneid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Aguambiade), another was held in Thailand, with Pakistani captures Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikallaya Kijbumrung.
They were the ones who had been leading the cells in Spain and other European countries since Bangkok.
The Catalan network, which was hit by a party in 2009, was mainly the passports that met the conditions identified by the World Islamic Front.
It is said that documents should be on behalf of young men between 25 and 45 years of age, with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
Researchers point out that so far there has been no detail that connects prisoners in Catalonia with Bombay's alert, even though the author of the attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the group of passport receivers flying in Spain and then counterfeited in Thailand.
However, it should be recalled that a few days before this attack was committed, Catalonia was sent to a transfer agency a few thousand dollars that had been "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used after the "command" that killed 106 people.
The police used a lot of documentation.
PP requests Mas to suspend tax complexity
The PPC leader, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to present to Artur Mass his terms of reference to support his investment as President of the Generality, identical to those presented during the campaign, and to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-South adventures such as the economic complexity that the nationalist leader wishes to address half of his mandate.
The President of the Catalan Peoples has arrived at your meeting with Artur Mas with the security that gives 18 Members to the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to please, because the CIU candidate needs at least one of the trainings that will take the opposition to vote on the investment.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists wish to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but for the moment, the conversations that Mas has with the rest of the political leaders become Catalan key.
And with regard to the President of the PP, to support an investment "all sovereign and independent talks should be eliminated", and the economic complexity - similar to that of the Basque country - that the leader should wish even to submit to the referendum.
The two leaders generally have their peers to mix the political equipment of a very exorbitant autonomous administration and the elimination of taxes applied to successions and donations.
Details of Mas investment negotiations will be taken up by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a tough opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidariat Catalana).
The hierarchy claims that the dead have not been subjected to "a lack of measures"
Owners of the Centre of Olot do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 people.
The managers of the charity La Caritat d'Olot (Gerone) offered a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least 11 people who were responsible for the period he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, was accompanied by the centre's lawyer, Joan Cañada, and declared that "the desire of La Caritat would be the ability to exercise the charge against the responsible" for the dead, but "legality and responsibility force us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And in addition to social disparity that the entity may suffer in order not to detect in time the criminal activities of the night nurse, the great threat for the Caritat is now taking the form of an important compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé noted that the first crime took place in August 2009 and that since that day he has not stopped killing.
The judge mentioned in the judgment that he ordered exhumation of eight bodies - old patients of the hierarchy - which he suspected that in many cases no doctor would personally investigate the deaths but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, formality was on the phone.
The Caritat, through its director, has categorically rejected this situation yesterday and said that "the lack of measures can never have been the cause of what happened."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in this case there is only an indication of imprudentness on the part of any other person who is not accused of it."
The person who was already baptized as "the Angel of Death" committed 11 murders yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009, and one month later killed a second mother.
In this case, he caused his death by injecting an insulin overdose, in contrast to the first crime he committed with a mixture of sedentative pills.
The director of La Caritat mentioned that it was difficult to control access to medical staff from the centre.
Injections of insulin and sedative cocktail had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her desire to alleviate internal suffering, used to kill them.
However, laboratory analyses will clarify whether Vila did not lie by saying that he had sought for his first victims a less cruel death or instead burned them inside by giving them lessives as he had already reported with the three women he killed in the interval 12-17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurses, no more the number of the victims, they do not eliminate the possibility that the number would be larger and justify their attitude by the various versions that Villa has given in her visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing the way of killing after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they declared that they would remain available for justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
The ECB is at risk.
Investors reacted violently yesterday to Trichet's yesterday threat that "markets should not underestimate our response capacity".
The differences in peripherals have closed the force and European banks' actions have increased by more than 5%.
However, we must no longer underestimate the ECB's ability to cheat and the euro has been punished with an increase, which is a sad sign.
What has happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way it collapses, it recovers, but motivated by short and highly speculative positions closures.
The institutional investor will be late to lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB called us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to look back for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan due to its inefficiency and the elimination of all outstanding liquidity measures at the end of the week, leaving only unlimited weekly access.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures will be extended "at least until March" and that the sale of quarterly access charges will be maintained at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity by at least until June.
We hope that it will continue with the obligation purchase programme and that it will even be given the signal of intensification.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent response of yesterday's markets and continue to be alert to withdrawing the liquidity measures, which God helps us!
As well as during their May meeting in which they claimed that they had not even considered the purchase of obligations and had broken the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse on the market.
Last year in Portugal, there was a lot of poverty.
The Tresor issued only 500 million to 5.28% compared to 750 million to 4.81% of the previous envelope.
Even so, the Portuguese types have dropped 30 basic points throughout the curve, reflecting clearly a change of market feeling after Trichet's words.
In Ireland the figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in short term and 15,000 potentials and have a deadline until February for private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not having identified the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumed in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, on Tuesday next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it has not yet had sufficient support, so Ireland remains in a pit of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to ease tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that shows that we are united and that we understand all the same.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures approved by the Council of Ministers.
Reform of pensions, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, reduction of deficits, liberalization, privatization, measures to re-activise employment are heard by investors such as the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Bourse rose to 4.5%, the second to the rest of the European Bours.
Unlike in February, the response of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and radical and we benefit from the surprising effect.
Today there is a key element of a three-year commitment that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope that it will be resolved with a strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for a Plan of Assistance would be self-immulation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Tresor has more than 40,000 million in liquidity available, the triple compared to March, to very expensive types and they cut access to the markets without day.
However, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "in addition to being, it seems."
Courage, we can get out of it!
The President of Eulen will answer the council of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm does not stop in the conflict open within the family of Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will answer, as he considers it "no law", the next 16 trial council of El Enebro requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to evaluate their majority and compete with the management bodies of the Bodegas Vega Sicily firm.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José provide their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for control of a part of the group.
The founder of the larger maintenance of business services for companies does not appear to be willing to surrender in his dispute to be present in El Enebro's governing bodies.
He was excluded from his board of directors by five of his seven sons who were appointed administrators in the Chamber of shareholders on 18 January this year, whose reply is recorded in the Register of Trade and Companies.
El Enebro's court council for the next 16, convened by the Commercial Magistrate No. 2 of Madrid, reopened the box of toners within the Álvarez family.
The appeal to the judge to establish the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism to ensure the Assembly's call.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Álvarez as "a desperate appeal of the applicants his five sons to try, through a procedural argument, by clearly violating the Law and by violating the law, to ratify and correct the assembly radically empty on 18 January", according to his official oral statements.
This argument will be the basis for, once in place, to be challenged as it is "no full right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a silence, have already tried without success that the Magistrate is calling an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a parent and holder company of Bodegas Vega Sicily, among others, the sons of David Álvarez control 100 per cent of the capital.
The founder of the service group nevertheless requested 51 per cent of the capital, according to the family protocols.
This is the fundamental question that the judge must decide after hearing the request for an answer for which he has not yet reported.
Red Bull triumphe in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
A software creates improvements in real-time cars.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, his history in this universal selection of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a new journey that had come to pass, despite the rising trajectory of the last season, last November, in the last phase of the campaign they all compared to the Ferrari triumph of Fernando Alonso.
Without lowering the skill as a champion pilot, the German Sebastien Vette, no longer the power of the Renault engine that propelles his car, in the world of Formula 1 we talk about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the Siemens multinational company has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
This is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with very far-reaching objectives of the high car competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to create assembly chains for factory manufacturers around the world, power stations, and high precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before it is built in a real way, thus avoiding inevitable defects and costs.
The PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's photo equipment, Sukhoi's planes or Nissan's most famous utility vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this computer tool in Formula 1's factory allowed Red Bull to create and execute "in a few hours, almost in real time", changes, changes and improvements detected during the courses and trials.
Russwurm explained that the 1992 cycles had an average of 10 technicians in their teams capable of introducing a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
In Red Bull's team, 180 high-quality young professionals are working today who, with powerful computer equipment, analyze and design all kinds of modifications to the balls.
Siemens' manager explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull's balls except the engine, which is the exclusive responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and security elements are modified.
Changes can take place from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autokeys.
As the only limitation of this technological perfection sheet there is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit for each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has installed the high-tech tool to create and produce its balls in a 50-km area of London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are limited.
All that's going on there is considered "top secret".
The staff for this duty includes 580 persons, including two pilots, Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Formula 1 of Red Bull is undoubtedly the recent Sebastian Vetell champion.
Among the enormous technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has contributed to its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is unestimable and none of which is known.
The company's technology director, Steve Nevey, said five years ago it could be said that R+D's progress in the case of race cars was 50 per cent of the winners and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology represents 85 per cent of success, while pilots bring 15 per cent of the added value.
Nevey argues that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by information, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 separate stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened his first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with his partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the 20 trade networks between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-market centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte English.
The vice-president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave an example of the repair shop located on the Grand Vía de Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she worked 30 years ago.
The North American Group has prepared a plan to implement 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes 20 Spanish institutions.
The first openings were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the third of Barcelona.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible store, even if she realized that Madrid could be the next destination.
HM's management of personal systems has ensured that the philosophy for the implementation of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with the sector's experience and knowledge.
The North American group advises and deals with the design of the exclusive furniture of stores (with products that can be affected interactively), which will have an identical image in Europe.
In addition, HP covers the training of institution staff.
Helena Herrero pointed out that it is a French system and stressed that the exclusive trading network claims to "improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in the purchase, assistance, post-sale and even packaging".
Barcelona's store includes a space with a global pioneer pilot program that solves possible problems of the computer equipment of HP in guarantee.
An online service connected with a technical centre located in Maastricht, Holland.
"Yes, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, as large companies have already engaged in technical assistance services," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell pairs on 'volar' a million customers in its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, the managing director of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, thinks that 2011 will be a hard year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the Passive War.
Nevertheless, it provides for an extension of the margin of interest, which will try to compensate in part with increases in the commissions and the price of the credit.
Sababell hopes to capture in three years a million private customers, his task to be done.
Sabadell has found a way to operate for the next three years and can thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new management plan in 2011 that will hold a three-year capacity.
The aim, in addition to surviving without the need to use FROB's public subsidies, is to win a market share by the capture of a million new private customers - 700,000 if those who can leave the bank - its major task is to be carried out, as so far this bank has had more to do with SMEs and companies than the private customer.
This year he caught 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5 per cent, while it exceeds 10 per cent for companies.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the pari on productivity, or that is the same thing, austerity, with the reduction of costs as a target, which will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks are now able to set goals and make them public, as the financial crisis has undermined all plans of the world banking sector.
Sababell will, in fact, complete this year's Optima Director's plan, which he established four years ago, even if the plan was initially for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for a further period.
Customers who leave the savings caches will be their main target.
During a small-day event organized by APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 will be a "hard and transient year".
The executive, in fact, thinks that the outbreak of the crisis in Spain will "be slow".
In addition, in two or three years this will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is essential for the survival of the banking business, he stressed.
And even if he thinks that the passive war - which criminalizes the margins - reduces the price of the risk premiums that banks and cashes pay for their emissions for liquidity are already moving to the credit price to compensate for the loss of the margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and funding is structural and will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We didn't close the robinet, but the differences are higher," acknowledged Guardiola.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of the differences - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also noted that the banking sector's trend now "is to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's management plan is based on organic growth even though, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that it ensures that in Spain "we will seek greater dimensions."
"All will move next year," he said.
He claims that capital needs "absormally increase" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And it states that FROB can replace the market in fund-raising in the case of new recapitalisations.
Having made sure that Sababell can survive in the temporary closure of the markets, he reduced the importance of the fact that some banks already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that it cannot be issued, but, contrary to what happened in June, it can be obtained from short-term funding through rest, which waits for the crisis.
ECA rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among caches
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a new batch of savings caches and insisted again on the speed with which the sector is being restructured.
When the process of concentration of Spanish savings has begun, several entities have ensured that they should not participate in this first phase and that they were reserved for the second phase.
However, José Antonio Olavarrieta, Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of Caisses d'Epargnes (CECA), rejected the possibility of producing this new wave of operations yesterday.
"I think that most of the mergers have been achieved, it can't be said that the inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, that's adjustments."
"Most have been fully implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14, all the major processes have already been carried out under the auspices of the Spanish Bank, which has worked very much in this operation as well," the manager pointed out.
In the small-day statements of the Aragón Directors and Executives Association (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process is "as soon as possible and we must be very satisfied with the way it is carried out in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain", he said.
"The passage of 45 caches with an average of 28,500 million volumes of assets to 17 with 75,500 million is an unprecedented process in history, reducing the number of entities by 62 per cent so that they are much larger in order to be consistent with Bále," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of very few happy opinions on the slowness of the process" which show "a lack of seriousness and meaning", because "the Spanish Bank is reminding us that we must respect the deadline before the end of the year".
The CEO of ECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, made sure last night that Spain had the toughest financial system of all Europe and the "probably" of the world, and he gave it to people who doubt that it is a lack of knowledge.
The manager mentioned that given the current economic context, "we can remain very calm" with the situation of financial entities and savings caches, a system that has begun a "very important" concentration process and "go as fast as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector had suffered a great deal from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin chose to remain in the euro, but it established conditions for the Union as a whole.
Market tensions have caused a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new methods of adjustment, ranging from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or removal of EUR 426 for unemployed without professional contributions to privatization of 49% of AENA, airport management of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of State lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joined with Chancellor Angela Merkel's criticism of his responsibility to address the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be noted that Merkel's position is not an error in his communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction on the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which surprises it to maintain the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to focus on the three possible outcomes of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by it, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, and the south would leave the monetary area.
Second, Mark's recovery, even if now it seems to science fiction, with a very favourable current of opinion, is almost 50% of the population.
Thirdly, a new concept of the euro is in line with the German proposals for greater macro-economic control, budgetary rigidity, amendments to the countries that are in breach of them, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has long been defined, so there is no room for excuses now.
First, in 2009, when both IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government launched a constitutional reform in order to prevent them from leaving 2016.
This was the first signal of divergence between what Germany thought should be done (the fiscal rigidity plan and the stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second time in the Central European country was when Merkel had difficulty extending the decision to save Greece.
Since then, it has been the object of a fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the publication were against Greece's withdrawal.
Finally, at the end of October, Merkel once again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union treaties to make it possible to withdraw from a country and at the same time force private buyers to support part of the cost.
This position was interpreted as an anti-European, as it predicted the Irish crisis and the rest.
However, its proposal, although somewhat uneducated, has been approved, and we should be involved in the reform process of the Union, which makes it possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that she doesn't think she's going to cross.
And she tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we can't agree, from that date the former operation of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that violate the rules will be severely punished, they may be obliged to make a declaration of termination of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also support some of the costs.
Germany points out that we must follow a strong growth path with high savings and investment rates, consumer moderation, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external sales.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with enormous losses in the balance of payments, such as the one who presided over Spanish growth in the years of the tree, will not simply be tolerated.
It's clear.
And it would be bad not to hear him.
This is not just a reduction of public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we're asking is much harder.
And what he must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that current disturbances will bring us greater peace.
And let's know that we've been given the opportunity until the spring of 2013.
President Zapatero seems to have also heard this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after the Saturday meeting with the large companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggest that despite the criticisms of Merkel, we have opened the way to the subject of ordering the house.
But the red line that Germany has followed is here, and they don't seem to move it.
And among the possibilities to be considered, it cannot be excluded from leaving a highly disadvantaged monetary area of a few countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that she had warned us.
Sports and fraud of the law
The Russians like Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show their skill but not their willingness to escape a penalty.
The expulsion by two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the 23 November match against Ajax in the League of Champions made a lot of emphasis on the anti-sportic character of such behavior and whether the two players should be punished by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before the match (their team had already been clearly won), the two players had deliberately lost their time when they made mistakes to determine whether to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and given that Real Madrid will be the leader of his group, the two players will perform the regular penalty during the next match of the game of barrage against Auxerre and will be able to pass without cartons at the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished with two matches the team coach, José Mourinho and various economic sums to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, but rather more frequent in the football world.
It is so concerned that it is part of the ethics, non-written rules, but followed, of this sport.
A part of the debate in this case must have been that this was a protagonist of a team of the entity of Real Madrid (which in its own humility shows nobility and honour and, in the past, has condemned its players to an amendment for similar acts) and to orchestrated dramatization, it seems, by Mourinho, which adds a more episode to its long history of historical and provocative technicians.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behavior is not expressly prohibited by the regulation against the principles of sport, i.e. if it is a violation of the law, because they are actually actions that are relevant to the sport regulation, but they seem to avoid its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of injury they cause in the sport spirit.
One of the assets that includes the sport spirit is the physical integrity of the opponents, a aspect that with these actions has not been put in danger, i.e. there has been no violent game.
Another of these assets to which the right game is aligned is to avoid that the criminal player team is benefiting in an unjust way from the opposite team, which is no longer the case.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the players in Real Madrid is that it does not agree that it is normally characterized as a crime or a violation of the law, because its violation of the rules has not been committed in a cache to try to avoid the punishment, but their actions have been precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty of the arbitration.
They waited and voluntarily accepted the penalty.
Another question is the type of advantage that offenders obtain from the intended errors under consideration.
There seems to be a need to note that we are not in a situation of disadvantage to the rival and that we are no longer benefiting from the same match, since of course the result of the action is the fact that they leave their own team with fewer players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next match no more, because the club could not rely on these players.
Of course, the advantage is that players will start the next phase of the League of Champions without cartons that can threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team could be removed all at once and on the other hand, with this action the players complete a penalty match and enter the second cycle of cartons, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cartons occurs with less than in the first cycle.
So it's not so clear that this is a advantage.
In the end, these actions are not contrary to the sport spirit, which makes it part of the adoption of strategic decisions that promote the maximum benefit of rules.
In our case, players have not acted to avoid the application of the penalty (that would be a clear case of the law fraud), but they have chosen rather the time at which they submitted to it.
They have taken a strategic decision without delay or leaving it.
Although the border between the genius and the fraud of the law is wide, in this case I think there was a clear case of genius.
The policing seems to me to be due to two factors: there were two self-exultations and the way in which the directive was transmitted to provoke them.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas gifts for groups in NCBs
The calendar dictatorship focuses this year on a reservation rate for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-financed celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the tower and lotteries, when December comes, the dinners of groups before Christmas continue to be the oxygen balloon for the restaurants and entertainment of Barcelona, but because of the crisis have set you up in an offensive price adjusted to be able to capture most customers: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, consistent with the business and associations of the interviewed sector.
In order to complete the accounting, this year's calendar (such as the night of St. Sylvestre tombe Friday) focused the applications on the week of December 13, which has thus far resulted in a set of day-to-day reservations (the 17th and the 17th) and almost nothing in the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, many companies have removed collective debt for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize them by paying their own taxes.
In any event, they ask for all the war prices, confirm the President of Gremi de Restoración de Barcelona, Gaietà Farrás.
The representative of the patronage is now unable to predict how the festivals will be held this month.
"People think a lot before booking."
"They want to go out, but they pay a lot of attention to the prices," he says.
The case will be well "for those who give good price and with a good service", he adds, and he recalls that customers are inclined to lower a level with the crisis, so that the gap around 25 euros has become a majority in demand.
In a survey in various institutions of the centre, the questionnaire for the night of 17.
The Soteras group indicates that there is a valid round of applications for this Friday, with a claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the context, with full forms of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Funda and others), the particularity of the calendar has been subject to more early reservations, even since the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all the costs of 19.95 to 30 euros," they explain.
AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locations, maintains optimism after detecting a range of invoices since the second month and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
The group's sources mention that 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate parties in advance.
In their six group menus they added one for the cloud, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a pre-disposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, such as the Catalan wine produced according to the champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies calling on their employees again and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased slightly.
On the part of Patriot Facasarm (including entities such as the Bars Association, Restaurants and Entertainment of Barcelona), his vice-president, Henri Gomá, is confident that he can begin to see the end of the tunnel and supports that reservations are generally "animized", even if customers "not at all".
This is true, the hope with regard to festivals has not fallen, regardless of who pays, indicates it.
Pakistan's nuclear programme generates great concern for the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country".
Wikileaks' filtrations confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US Embassy of Pakistan and the United States Department of State filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused by Pakistan's nuclear programme in Washington.
In addition to the clear and happy details of the discussions and views of North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents show that cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear safety, instead of increasing, "decroit" and that the Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear programme - the fact that weapons are not collected but are stored by components to make their destruction difficult in the event of attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
It is also the Ambassador of Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, listed in a report before the visit of the former Counsellor of National Security, James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities in the territory under the Taliban attack, the dispersion of nuclear materials, including the short noise and vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is being considered, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as prolific and a reason for maintaining the guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the drop in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programmes," said expert Yuri Korolov, Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at a meeting with its American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by Julian Assange portal is the ever-increasing cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high Pakistani level of nuclear weapons production.
A delegation from the Embassy in May, which qualifies as "frustant" communication with Pakistan, supports the following: "Transparency is often absent; aid offers remain unresponsible or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence Officer for South Asia, notes that "in spite of the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a speed faster than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to understand "very clearly" the officer that "the Pakistani Army must end with the support of the terrorist groups".
To the chassis of the chief of Wikileaks
Obama will be appointed to a high responsibility for the anti-terrorist fight to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol emits a red alert to monitor movements and locate in Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complex labyrinthe where it is difficult to have certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "black alert" to "localise and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
In addition, this is not new, but it dates from 20 November.
And this has nothing to do with the latest filtration of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian is facing in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' lawyer Mark Stephens ensures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
The 20 international police officers in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not do so until yesterday after receiving the authorization from the authorities of the country.
Thus, 188 Interpol countries have received an indication of identifying or localising Assange "to obtain its provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot order arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the Member States, according to the organization's explanations, consider the call to be a free route to arrest -- which the national police body must carry out - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case in Sweden and England, where Assange is thought to be found.
The movement inspired Assange lawyers, who published a letter yesterday that Wikileak's 39-year-old founder was willing to respond by video conference to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, as compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, chief of Stalin's security.
"It seems to be a disaster, not a legal persecution," the negative one declares.
While the world is looking for her - and in Australia her mother defends her son's innocence -- Assange continues to be found in an unknown place, but he didn't.
On Monday he gave an unexpected interview to the director of Time magazine via Skype, in which he asked for the resignation of the United States Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that it has been responsible for giving orders to American diplomats to the United Nations by violating the international treaties signed by the United States, it should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the press secretary of the House-Blanche, Robert Gibbs, who qualified as "ridiculous and absurd" the application for resignation.
"I'm not sure why the opinion of a type with a website should interest us," he said to the CNN.
Obama himself was charged with a high responsibility for the anti-terrorist struggle, Russell Travers, to prevent new issues of documents.
The trial of President Barack Obama's speech to reduce the importance of Assange is consistent with the views that politicians and conservative commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who had since January presided over the National Security Committee in the Lower Chamber, asked the Department of State to examine the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and continue to anyone who provides contributions or assistance to them".
Even more far away is Tom Flanagan, a Canadian president's adviser, Stephen Harper, who has since returned to his statements after saying that Assange should be "killed".
"Obama should transform it into a target and use a plane without crew or something similar."
A person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"The one in the Government who has filtered the information is guilty of trafficking and all that is not an execution would be a very loving punishment," he said for Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with eye clins to Carod's adapters
The President of the Republic will allow the party to vote in secret on its continuation.
Huguet proposes a more plural execution and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the receipt to resolve the first internal revolution within the ERC, without north due to the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his threat of decommissioning is not sufficient for former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira's adapter, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as intense as his liar and that this can certainly not give him any headaches as he had with other extended currents.
That is why the leader of Escerra will try to win his new criticisms with eye clinches that allow him to hide until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC consultants could make themselves known on its secret continuity.
By ballots, not in front of your hand.
If carrots want to take a certain vote to the president, they will be able to do it without fear of the hostages.
In fact, the head of rank wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews, he stated that he would not consider himself ratifying half of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a "bulgarian" result would not be good.
The people close to Carod require the president to put his position on the military, a gesture that does not matter when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ among the conventions.
However, since they do not have enough majority to force resignations, they will try to obtain an executive roadmap until May.
To that end, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that the Directorate will submit to the National Council's vote on 18.
Its intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise of programming the 2011 convention, which the leaders consider to be a safe fact.
The ERC leader has announced that "polyphony" affects stability and that its objective is to make it possible once for all the organization to wash its room in the family.
In this line, the article that current adviser Joseph Huguet signed in his blog sympathetic result.
In view of Puigcercós's ideology, the innovation holder thought that the fact that the leader would be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" was as if it had been done.
And he numbered it five, which he mentioned two.
The first, "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90 per cent of the military, that is, including new figures coming from the approved Carod sector.
The second can be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC be liquidated once for all of the Assembly as operating mechanism.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes that enables conventions to be carried out through elective delegates.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this regard in the last two conventions.
In fact, the 2008 Concrete Confluence led to the revision of the Assembly model in a specific convention for the reform of the Statutes.
This meeting remains indisputable, as the internal market has not been recommended in recent years to address this issue.
Now, without critical sectors of profit, the time could be good for the recovery and closure of it forever.
23 executions in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO of the State of Mexico, a decrease of 4 cases was recorded in 2010.
In November 23 persons were executed in the state of Mexico, less than four months ago, according to MILLION of the state of Mexico.
Among the murders are these three women and the discovery of two bodies trapped in the Gulf of Mexico.
During the last month of the year, 390 deaths were recorded in theory related to organized crime.

Very early in the morning, the fourth day, the owners of the common land found a body with signs of torture and at least three litallian fires in the thorax, on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan of the Hall, in the sector that crosses the village of Villa Guerrero.
Near the body we found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day after Nezahualcoyotl a 50-year-old monsieur was killed with eight shots of fire when he left his house to start his collection work.
The seventh November, two subjects of 30 years, were killed by a blow of fire on each head in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, town of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the cut of fire in the front, a man's body was found on a lonely road in Colonia El Naranjo and under the body was found a wounded ball of 25 caliber fire.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
The emergency bodies have carried out a thorough search of the rest of the members of the body, but they have not been found.
The residents of Tepotzotlán warned about the discovery of a corpse found in Peña Colorado, the hands attached behind and the eyes bent.
Man had a wound caused by a cut of fire in his neck.
In the half of the month, two men who had been buried in shelters and abandoned in a vehicle in the streets of Villas de la Hacienda department in the town of Atizapán in Zaragoza, were reported to be executed at the same time with the victims with two death warning messages.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony it was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by The Incorrigible.
On the 17th covered, two women were found in the village of Zoquiapan in Ixtapaluca, and the following morning a man's body was located in Huixquilucan, who had been immersed in a yellow and blue cover, in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, according to a message that his executioners had left behind.
In Ixtapaluca, with gun cuts in the neck, it was found the body of a woman without life in the hammock of San Francisco Aquautla.
On the woman's skin, she was detected from Santa deathts and colliers with her image.
At the end of the month, a man's body was found on the side of a car in the town of Zinacantepec with at least three ball impact and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with the head and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed by a criminal organization, who said, "That's what happens to those who don't agree."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and feet attached, two bodies were found inside a taxi left behind the Center of Justice of the San Agustín colony.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first one had disappeared from the Cuchilla Ancón colony and had been immersed in black plastic bags, attached to a canal tube and a message on the side; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Next to him, the agents found a brochure with a message.
China maintains the objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions
The representative of the country in COP16 ensured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce carbon trace and has detailed that it maintains its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020.
China maintains its bid to reduce between 40 and 45 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, Su Wei, representing that country at COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), His Wei ensured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon trace and convert its industry.
In fact, in the past four years, his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work with the international community in this area.
He noted that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity-building; institution-building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including the approval, last year, of a new Energy Act, which recognises the objectives of greenhouse gas reduction.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have worked in a coordinated way with governments and local authorities to achieve energy savings goals, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, he stated that there are various multi-year plans in progress or completion, both funded by the Chinese Government and by the Governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented for the past five years and has been invested by the United Nations (UN), the Government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial project for climate change, another for the change of induction lamps by economic lamps, and another for the acceleration and adaptation, he explained.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific adviser to the Government of this country on climate change, made sure that China's efforts were greater than we thought.
For example, he said that the greenhouse gas emission in China is three tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9 per cent of the historical contribution to pollution.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and to make another similar by 2020, he said.
Legal Explosion of Espino: César Nava
The National Director of PAN has explained that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
PAN National Director César Nava Vázquez ensured that Manuel Espino Barrientes' expulsion was legal and that the former Panist leader had the right to appeal to the National Order Commission.
In the previous interview at the protest by Gabino Cué Monteagido as governor of the state, he said that the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"It is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address, where appropriate, by making a complaint to the Commission of the National Council, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body," he said.
On the other hand, he made it clear that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there was never an alliance for the presidential candidate on the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that the National Action would be stronger after the next 4 and 5 December internal elections where a successor should be elected.
"This (a 2012 alliance) is a aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the moment, was a approach for the local elections that had succeeded and achieved its goal," he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "inland competition does not frighten us; rather, "we are stronger and stronger," he said.
He said that the Council would certainly choose the best leader/and which Action National needs for the next three years, so it would refer to the person determined by the Council.
"I am completely quiet and open, I would be proud to leave the office of the President of the Party to any of the five."
He provided that the re-entry recorded by the party to the previous elections of 4 July would be reflected in the next discussion, even though "it is not yet time to think about 2012."
"For the moment it is about joining Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three Governments that make alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the trap and will be a cause of observation throughout the country, so that it is "a lot of hope for them, and I am sure that Gabino will be at the top of expectations".
When he was asked about the criticisms of PRI against President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked the priests to reflect on the six years of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks the governments of Zedillo and Salinas have been better than those of Fox and Calderón; that they start defending them; that they come out of love," he said.
He said that the holder of the Federal Executive could make statements like he did in his speech in the National Auditorium, because in the country there are no balloons, and even less censorship.
Obama promises on Twitter the law for students without papers
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call on your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," said the American President in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama met today at national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legitimize students without paper, with a message in his personal account of the social network Twitter.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Obama said.
Its short message continues to open a cybernet link with a wider document that requires the public to contact the senators immediately, as the vote in the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote we expect soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he said.
The message was made public after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation if the extension of the tax reductions in Bush-time and the financing of the government continued.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as ratification of the new START Treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs said he was confident that once the tax problem was resolved, a agenda could be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we must solve this tax problem before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at a given time and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the democratic majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced Tuesday that he would request a "vote of debate" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legislate the undocumented students could be voted from the next Thursday in the Senate, even though it was likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Council Act would be legalized by 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, they remained in that country for the past five years and were accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
However, the participants need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they need to compete with a large number of Republicans, at times when the participating organizations of the protagonist project are intensive lobbying to ensure the approval of the Act.
Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 places.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska said he would vote against and only a Republican voiced his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why the participants in the Dream Act need the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the shortest Republicans there are Senators Maine, Olympic Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator George Lemieux, from Florida, who completed his mandate as Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act were Orrin Hatch, Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, Texas, but they said they did not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his position so far.
Although the Chamber of Representatives has a different version, the analysts agree that the greatest obstacles of the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literature we put the dougt on the beach
The second stage of the language's Players was a walk in which participants held the narration.
"The sex in the language, I understand, but... the right on the beach? what is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela, invited to open the second stage of the language's pleasures, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish, and this time used the subtitles of her question (for another time the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language, she explained).
The duet on the beach "...we put in the embarras", launched the Argentine writer to the public, most young people, who met at the International Forum of the Book of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this moderate table by Marisol Shultz and who participated in Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela has read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz has defined after a great story, with Luisa in the first person as a protagonist who seeks to know what the "play" is, she goes from a doctor to another, without getting an answer, only tracks in the same narrative.
From the infectiologist she's quite confident: "It's not my strength, it's probably my grief."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath in the middle of the cold, but who explains to him that crying is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the beach is actually what is open, the symbol is the scar."
The protagonist sighs and concludes: "On the beach I only know that it is open in reality and that it does not exist," but is convinced that the pleasures and pieces of the language must be closely linked to them.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a fascinating narrative that he called Eloge in the invention, where he did not count on the beach, but at a given time he was discovered.
With the touch of magical reality, he speaks of a famous cloud- touching cloud, bringing back people who had gone away or repaired verts that a lady had lost, a narrative that goes on to talk about America, the great news that had from the beginning her own chroniclers and quoted in Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticises the stories of the conquerors.
"Cervants who invented all of us (the writers) have been misled by false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise we would never have told the story of America with an imagination that was missing even from the power."
However, he stressed that "the fools and liars have the best imagination" and here the reality is converging with the lie, we no longer know what part of the narrative belongs to a band or another, where the fiction literature reaches its advocate.
It's actually called the 'Cervantes tradition'.
"It's thanks to its heritage that we're counting on."
In his tour, writer Mayra Montyero announced and praised the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with its round table The right to the beach.
Cuba-Portoricaine has focused on the great scourge of social violence that its country is experiencing - and Latin America is sharing - resulting in trade disputes and drug sales.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs give a silent commitment that is not necessarily premeditated," she said, after citing that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the engagement that exists between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening ends with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, who also stressed "this must be on the shoulders of the engaged writer".
He considered that in a world that is very fast also in terms of intellectual habits and the control of consciences that turn to the advantage of dogmas, "there is a small non-, and behind every denial there is a small yes."
"To be the masters of our own feelings and the masters of reality, we need to wake up: and to wake up means many times to put the right on the beach and weaken the people who feel very comfortable thinking about caricature, white and black, in established and unsatisfied ideas and also to undermine the powers that prefer a world in white and black," he said, inviting us to regain the sense of writing.
Romano in his first title box
Rubén Omar Romano had three shortcomings in the finals he had heights and lows in his career, but he had reached the decisive series three times.
With the pain of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the end, there are also two different styles that are faced, marked by their technicians, which find a contrast marked by results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three shortcomings in the finals, he had heights and lows in his career, but he has reached the decisive series three times, even though he has not so far placed in the mill and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
Argentin ended up consoled with the champion's medal, remained a step behind the winners and carefully with the same team he played consecutive ends.
The Santist strategy came to its first end as a coach in the Tournoi d'Operture 2002, when he held the Morelia rows with which he lost a total score of 4-2 against Toluca; later, he also reached the decision-making threshold and lost again with the overall score of 3-1 and was specifically against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the Bicentennial Tournoi 2010, Rubén has again suffered a reversion, since his team has had a 2-2 match against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of the game, but in the series of trials he has gained a benefit for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players have been running 11 meters and he has suffered a stroke as a result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Rojos Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, so he does not want to have the same luck, he tries to detach himself from the maléfice so that he can celebrate for the first time a title, even if he claims that the institution is more important for him.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, not for a passion I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned earlier is more important," commented the teacher when he was asked what would be his weak points in the end.
He remembers a lot of the final, which he has learned many, "the only lesson we can hold is that until the arbitration won't end, we can't celebrate, we're ready on the line, players too, because last time, with two penalties to get us already ready to run, and I think that this is a lesson, before the end of the game we can't celebrate".
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not bother him, because he trusts his players: "We never try to reach the series of penalties, we try to end in the regular period, but sometimes we are not prepared, the previous tournament has been prepared, unfortunately the fate has made us a bad turn, sometimes these are the emotions or the desire to have the title between our hands, but he has removed us, this has served as a lesson for this final situation and we hope that we will no longer get there."
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a champion technician and to taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining visas
People have to go to the service centres for Visa applicants before their interview in the Advisory Section; the waiting period will be shorter.
Since 10 January 2011, the procedure for the treatment of visas in the Embassy and consulate of the United States will be changed.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to be present at the Visa Claimers Service Centres (ASC, according to their English signals) before their interview in the Advisory Section.
ASC staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Advisory Section before the interview.
The new procedure will provide some advantages for the applicants, including the following:
The total cost of handling the visa will be lower, and it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to obtain a return, another payment for the visa processing and another for the e-mail service to deliver the document.
Aspirant will make a single payment that will cover the three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visas for traders and investors.
Those who wish to renew their visas should not present themselves to an interview with the Advisory Representative, only to the ASC, where they will present the documents and take their interpreters.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken into the ASC, applicants who want a second meeting to be interviewed in the Advisory Section will stay there less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants for the Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo Consulates will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.
For further information on the new procedure to request the visa, please visit the following page: http://Mexico.usembassy.gov/boletins/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The United States Space Agency has cited the press to present a discovery tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living in space.
The National Administration of the Aeronautics and Space (NASA) of the United States will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow morning at 13:00 at NASA headquarters in Washington for experts in astronomy, science studying the origin, evolution, distribution and the future of life in the universe.
In citing the press, NASA ensured that it would have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which resulted in speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are similar creatures to us and in hostile environments that we thought we were unsatisfied and would make it possible to become intelligent as humans if their living conditions were improved.
It seems that we speak of a microbe discovered at the bottom of the Mono Lake in the National Yosemite Park, California, which lives in an environment that was thought too late for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any way, creation uses the arsenic as a way of life and this capacity makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our goodwill.
Astrobiologists say, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, this proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from what we know."
The Space Agency will communicate the true range of findings at the tomorrow press conference.
The conference will be attended by the geobiology Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (the largest satellite in Saturn), with the view that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
PRD, PT, Convergence and Pattern opposite 'block'
With reforms to the Congress's Organic Law, the arrival of 'bipartism' is made possible.
The 60th was to be installed when an opposition block led by MPs of PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent and the four asked one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before the 60th installment session of the Constitution, Felipe Manzanez Rodríguez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patron Montalvo, 'tonna' against the reform of the Organic Law, because he excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, the 'bipartism' was started because there are now two people, of the same number of parties, who control Congress.
These four MPs, alongside Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only votes against the PANiste Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these institutional reforms constitute the political marginality of the PRI and PAN parties.
He said that the following days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to modify the scheme through political will and if they did not, they would be again served by the two parties and thus the opposition coalition would end.
"To date (the opposition coalition) has arrived, that is what I see, because we are excluded from any decision, they have not even the political difference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanez Rodríguez, de Convergencia, mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patron there are similarities and that is why they form a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued that Congress, after being monopolistic, is now "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of reform of the law that has an eternal bipartism in Congress."
To begin with, this group begins with 5 legislators and now talking to other colleagues to make them more numerous, the Convergent has expanded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT, explained that the Congress has now become a 'butin' between two, giving an allusion to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between them."
Mr. Montalvo asked to respect the membership's personality, to give him his place in the negotiating tables.
"If they do not leave out for collective agreements outside 5 which will probably be 9 Members, now that we see, separated from five different groups, we have decided to join us to find a place in the negotiating table, that is the problem, but in the reform they have made, that they have decided, we are outside and we are not in agreement with this reform there."
$200 million more for "the supplier"
The Mairie de Mazatlán pays another check on the owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another 200-mile weight check for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by Marie.
With that, the amount paid this second month to the owner of the electrical equipment company is 1 million million million miles of weight.
According to the municipality's Transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 weights, in terms of "supplier account liquidation".
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno said that the Community would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State Supreme Audit to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, as a result, lots of checks will still be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"We bought nothing, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last Czechs have "reapparu" the last quarter of the year: September 24, two October 15, October 19, October 29, and November 16th.
Although the supplier has not yet published in the Official Journal of the State, according to the provisions of the Law, when an undertaking is asked by ASE to avoid other Governments using its services, the Treasury has ensured that they have not used its services again.
All of this, after 25 July, Noroeste had published a review of the Czechs that Maria issued to her suppliers, showing that in the March 2008 interval, 2010 in the 30th anniversary of the Marie Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality of Camacho Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos, has been through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, covering more than 3 million weights.
Tourist sites should be cared for
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the bad conditions of the Sanchez Taboada round point in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a corner of the Sánchez Taboada point, the tourist sector in Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that were in bad condition and to design a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of Zone Dorada, recalled that several times they requested that the destination image be taken care of and that new activities should replace others that the tourists find bad.
He said that the bad state of the streets and trottoirs affected them because the tourists came to walk there and saw the degradation and avoided close trade.
"Politics don't know what it means to close a business one day and they don't know how lucky we're losing it, nor did they do the work for so long and without proper planning."
Hotel José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the loss of the tourist has exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of Marie.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and avoid that this is happening again, how to do so, so through preventive maintenance and not only to correct it," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as residents who deserve a clean place to live there and Mary must change her strategy for the well-being of the city."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it does not depend only on promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has the property in its beaches, bulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"We have not given them the attention they need, and this kind of fact highlights something that is unknown to all, care is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Under-Secretary for Tourism Promotion, stated that the recovery of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent because they are not used properly and are planning a bad picture.
He spoke of a number of places that should be put in line with the municipality and be a priority to have the city updated, clean, ordered and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Happyly Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and sites that should be ordered first, cleaned and made available to make them attractive so that they can be added to the inventory that we have to promote this destination."
IP requests for results at Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that MEPs assume the responsibility of being an example of a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations they face.
The Mazatlán business sector requires a decent and free labour legislation between the parties and the Government Executive, as Sinaloa is confused and faces major problems.
The 60th legislation was put in place by seven political forces, 19 MPs of PRI, 13 PAN, three of the Party's New Alliance, two PRDs, one PT, one Convergence and one PVEM, total of 40 people.
The list of expectations that the new members of the Government Congress are a clean and committed management with society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of party spirit or parentalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that MEPs assume the responsibility of being an example of a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations they face.
"We hope that Members will actually exercise their right, free agreement between the parties, because the practice is that they make agreements to protect their own interests and become a mask of carnival of the rulers and leaders of parliamentary groups."
That is why I ask them to confirm their commitment to establish the necessary points for progress by the current Governor.
"We will ensure that they do a decent job, especially with society and sectors, because Sinaloa's people have made their voice of confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tris Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to move and add forces to the state's economic growth, as the economic situation is now very complex.
"The most important thing is that they contribute to economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will in a way stimulate the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourism, he asked that the new legislators would give him the importance it had in the government budget to consolidate the Secretariat of Government Tourism.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat of the State with a smaller budget and that it is not as an important economic activity and as a generator of loans and investment, which is directly compatible with the agro-industrial."
In addition, it is necessary to classify resources for detonating tourism projects that help ensure the State and update the Alcohol Act that the previous legislation has not been able to resolve.
Looking for king magic
People, cars and bicycles, among other games, are the children's wish from the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Kings Mages will be difficult to carry out their illusions, as their nest is formed by or less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, Joseph Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will bring them the games and clothes they wish so much.
The family lives in a humble home of Colonia Salvador Allende and lives daily because their father has no stable employment.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we're selling mandarines and potatoes... and the afternoon I come out with the 'plebes' to sell in the street," said Cayetsana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of children.
Adelaide, aged 4, wants a doll or bike, and her 3-year-old sister Isabel would like a doll in Barbie.
In his tour, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long had a 'trick monster' and for his little brother Jesus, of 8 months, Cayetsana suggests size clothes for a year.
"He said to me (José Alfredo), 'I'd like to have this monster', but I told him 'we', my son, 'because he was very cute'," recalls Cayetana sad.
For the older children, who were at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11 years old, had the size of 12, Isaiah, 10 years old, had the size of 10, while Miguel, eight years old, had the size of eight.
José Juan, aged 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of five-and-a-half or six would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dream of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true, you can participate in the campaign On Search King Mage by giving a game or money to the Noroeste reception.
14 Drug traffickers arrested
Ten studies have been carried out in Austria, Wednesday, as part of the maintenance of a network of production and sales of cannabis.
Four people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The search took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used for drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilograms of haschich, the money and equipment used for production have been seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec Security.
In all, 11 men and three women were arrested, including the two head of the network, two men of Sherbrooke.
Persons arrested should be compared to Sherbrooke's courthouse in the hours following their arrest.
They could face allegations of Cannabis production, possession in order to carry out traffic, contract and flight of services, among others.
These investigations were carried out following a long-term investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"This is the information received from the public that allowed us to proceed to these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 police officers from the Regional Investigation module of the Estrice Security of Quebec, Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagog Police Region participated in this police operation.
Clandestine migration will continue without problems
The draft law of conservatives, which, according to the Government, should address the problem of ships loaded with clandestine migrants, is clearly being fought when the three opposition parties have informed merced that they could not support it.
"I strongly support the Charter."
"I have a debate with a party who has created the granite under your feet," said liberarian chief Michael Ignatieff, while he was surrounded by Members after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would allow for up to one year all persons from a ship identified as transporting foreigners, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Quebec bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because he took it to the wrong target.
"We are against, and it seems that all sides of the opposition are against, then we will see what the government will do," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD’s criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, rejected the criticisms from the hands of the critics that his party was not strong enough about the clandestine immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agree to take action against the clandestine passengers and that is what we do through another bill, C-35," said Ms. Chow.
"We do not support the bill of conservators because it takes refugees and prison children for at least one year," said Ms. Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of the Canadians.
"Canadians say to Members that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations aimed at Canada and treat the country as a palillasson."
"They expect Canada to take firm measures," said Minister Kenny.
The Government has not announced a vote of confidence on its draft law, which would have led the country to elections coming to its refusal.
However, a conservative told the QMI Agency that the Government would ask for a vote so that each opposition member would then appear before his voters.
The new unit doesn't make unity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and corruption by Jean Charest, many observers continue to request the establishment of a public investigation committee on the subject.
Minister of Public Security Robert Dutil argues that this idea does not occur yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation of New York on this issue since January.
The metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
Yet, Tuesday's announcement surprised more than one.
It should be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec police services on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
There was no need for the pequistic public security criticism, Stéphane Bergeron, to qualify this announcement of "lapin coming out of a hat" and "brickled solution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil responded to those who feared that political power had too much influence on the possible future united.
"You'll see the result when we're going to announce it, if you're happy to confirm it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the President of the CSQ, Rejean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public investigation.
"More Mr. Charest refrains from creating this investigation committee, more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry, Jean Charest's resignation," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
In order to get out of this gap, he therefore suggested that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor-General to investigate corruption and corruption.
"It must be possible to extend the mandate of the Auditor General," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the verifier the same powers as a Commissioner, thus allowing him to be obliged to testify.
The creation of a permanent castle is not the only project in the Charters of the Charest Government.
Quebec would also request Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request would be made by the Prosecutor of the Marteau Operation, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Supplier that the case was not explained in this kind of investigation.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed to him that his colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering certain amendments related to this matter.
During the Primtemps 2001 operation, which hit the Motards groups, although the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 persons were arrested.
Ottawa has subsequently adopted the Gastrics Act.
High-supervised rivers
A number of water courses remain under high surveillance due to strong assumptions that have been submerged in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
An earthquake struck Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening another blast would occur in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road has gone down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, strong assumptions have been overcome in several regions, from 40 to 70 millimetres of rain.
A further 20 to 40 millimetres of rain were expected this afternoon, according to the regions.
The sectors in the north of the river and in the valley of Outaouai were most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimetres of rain in total.
As these precipitations must be added to the source of the already accumulated snow in some sectors, several watercourses are feared.
Warnings of flood alerts were issued last night by Quebec's Civil Security for the Oueaau and the Achigan River in Lanauière.
The waters of the North, Saint-Jerôme, in the Laurentides and the Cheneum, in Lotbinière, were the object of inundation and continued under surveillance.
In the region of Lanaudière, strong precipitations led to the depletion of certain lakes in Sainte-Juliane, Sainte-Marceline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was carried because of heavy rain.
Ten residences had to be evacuated in a preventive manner.
In Otaouais, the depletion of certain lakes led to the closure of several roads, including in the municipality of Mansfield-and-Pontefract.
Civil Security remains on a alert foot and monitors the situation close to it, said Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Québec Cross Prediction Centre, for its part, has issued strong cross-border warnings for several rivers, including Maskinongé, Assumption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and the Loup.
Dupont partly cursed
Québec Stéphane Dupont's radio animator came up with a partial review before the Canadian Council of Radiotelevision Standards (CCNR) for controversial issues on social assistance and Haitians as well as on its major language in waves.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but that some of them contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, inadvertent negative representations of Haitians and gross language that were not suitable for broadcasts during the day".
The Council also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two people who had been murdered, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
CNR had received several complaints regarding comments made during the 2008-2010 broadcasts.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Common Front of the Social Assistants of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were inaccurate.
Animators must provide solid information rather than fraud.
As to suicide, animator Stéphane Dupont had considered suicide to be a long-acting gesture.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the vehicle message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes due to "Dubont the Midi" have dealt with a delicate subject in a fair and appropriate manner."
So no flower was kept in its place.
The last dispute was on statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort were then delivered to a media face that had caused many reactions.
The CHOI animator stated that he had not done anything to help the Haitians because it was not possible to know with certainty that the people in need would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect is an unfavourable negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already cleaned up my suspension three days ago."
"My file is empty for a year and a half," said the animator.
In all decisions, the Committee condemns the proliferation of major languages.
In each case, radio broadcaster CHOI-FM collaborated "outside his obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station which, among other things, will have to announce these decisions once during the hours of large hearing within a period of three days.
A king of Kung-fu in Montreal
The Montreal of Algerian origin Nacerddine Zemmal has an extremely special course.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing on the Tatamis and the world's rings in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts such as kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemmal, installed in the Metropolis since 2008 to develop among professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere, because for those who don't like the game on the ground in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, he who works as a security agent and as a commission for the UPS company has just delivered bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championship from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the kickboxing categories full of contact and Thai box, he explained."
"Now, I'm ready to go to China for the San Shou World Cup."
"The fighters who ended among the first four in the last world champion in each category were invited."
"I won the bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished the eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I completed the tournament in fifth grade, while I arrived third in Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What's interesting is that I've made progress in each competition."
"At this rate, I'll be the first one this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is an original Chinese discipline where ping and foot cuts, as well as soil projections, are permitted.
The holes are originally on a platform and rarely in a ring.
The most famous Puggyist is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well-known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has to keep only one event in his career, he will certainly respond to his presence at the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the most famous and prestigious in China, explained the sympathic gaillard."
"It's a little equivalent to the Lumpine Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first battle, in half-end of its category (80 kg), before losing it.
"The one who beat me was a real pro, he analyzed."
"There are four combatants per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winner of the semi-finals will finally face their category."
"Then the winners of each category are made to celebrate one champion, the king of kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Quebec has provided $450 million in loans to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
In the heart of this 100 contract, it is a consortium of BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor companies that has obtained the most important, the project management, for a total of $295 million without tenders.
In 2004, the group called Energy Management was jointly established in Hydro-Québec to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this major hydroelectric project of $5 billion.
In early 2005, the Energy Management Consortium dissolved the contract with no public tenders.
For the Québecian Party, the use of business associations poses a serious ethical problem that is likely to eliminate competition and cause price increases.
"It's the new way to do the collusion and take off competition."
"In other words, people, instead of doing so secretly, are now the source of openness," said Pequiste Sylvain Simard at a press conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the question to the National Assembly because he said it was difficult to see how public interest could be used in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalia Normandeau, responded after noon, noting that there had been a collapse in this contract.
"I'm starting to have my trip," she said, arguing that the PQ had been "inhumanity" and had "no strength."
She said, "That would be the least of the things" that the PQ apologizes.
Consortium formula is a current practice throughout the world.
This is usually a limited alliance in time that allows two or more companies to group their respective expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity taking into account the scope of the work.
The building is running and has to be scaled up to 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the game of competition; there was negotiation.
Also, the form of concerts is no longer an exception to Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As was revealed last week in Debor, the formula for the Consortiums in the Council's engineering sector is the subject of an investigation to the government.
A quick overview of the Quebec business register allows more than 200 consortiums, some of which seem permanent.
Thus, the Dessau firm works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Genival, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, bound to one and even moral person, either Dessau.
As for the Energy Management Consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Baye James responds to special labour dynamics and that Hydro-Quebec has been particularly responsible for this since the 1970s".
The great boss of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Baie James Energy Society (SEBJ), gave an explanation that the project management contract had been awarded for a graffiti.
"If you call for tenders and there are few bidders, your price will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take the people in this market and you say, we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that it's not the price that matters, it's people's competence," said Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Energy Management Consortium is part of a long list of contracts of over $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Quebec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Debor entered into 109 engineering contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to signatures or branches, including land laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin confirmed 22 contracts, Genival received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting its participation in Energy Management.
All contracts were negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the Energy Management contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard made it clear that the four signatures consisting of the Consortium (BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor) are "well-known in the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau left that the PQ is also linked to these firms that "finance it" before specifying that it was more than its leaders.
Responsible Consumer Barometer - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More green, more sceptical.
The Quebec consumer is very lacking in confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in equitable brands and eco-certifications to guide their choices.
Pis, even if he descends into a media universe where messages in favour of a more responsible pollutant consumption, he misses a lack of credible information, because he even qualifys as a brake to his commitment, indicates the Barometer of responsible consumption, which the first reading was delivered yesterday.
Even though they increased the consumption of products that were socially responsible in 2010, Quebec seems to provide very little credit to those who were trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say that they do not believe in the company's environmental commitment as well as the company's green advertising, and they reveal the measuring tool developed by the observatory of the responsible consumption of Sherbrooke University.
Other findings: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications on the products listed below, but also the credibility of products and brands that appear to be irresponsible, indicate the Barometer.
In the same vein, politicians' speech on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6 per cent of Quebecese.
However, the information on responsible consumption appears to be prima facie to stimulate this food of the currently animated consumption by close to three thirds of the Quebec consumers.
In fact, the empty and questionable nature of the information calmed down 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecs also say that they are also vulnerable to the alleged performance of green products or services that they are sought to be put between their hands.
On another note, consumers were close to half in 2010 to have changed their habits and, above all, changed their brand of one or more products to respond to their conviction.
At 61 per cent, they also promoted purchases with traders from their district and privileged the purchase of food grown in their region, according to the Barometer.
More green and responsible - the index of responsible consumption reached 64 on a maximum of 100 for this year - the Human consumption of Quebec likes to be presented as the king of recycling who seeks to reduce its environmental strain by worrying about the protection of animals.
However, her social and ecological conscience seems to remain outside her car, says the Barometer: in 2010, 28 per cent of Quebecians indicated that they had used transport in common or had preconceived codification to defend their green interests.
The course and the bike were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavioural survey, which has just taken its first click.
A State loan for the eXcentris strike
The Government of Quebec, to whom it was requested to engage financially in the capture of the eXcentris film complex by Angus and the parallel Society, agreed to cooperate, but only in competition with a loan.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallelle, which expected a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy to Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinematographic complex on the St. Laurent Boulevard by re-enacting his full cinephilic vocation, did not receive what they claimed.
The Government agrees to intervene in the case, but under its own circumstances.
Instead of the expected grant, the Government of Quebec offers a loan which would be lower than initial expectations, which could be a viable solution to favourable conditions, at least from the opinion of the sources of State offices.
A first plan of action and a request of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec on the last spring, but requests have been revised since then.
A proposal and action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, which pilots the eXcentris file.
He made a final report 10 days ago.
But the counter-proposal of the cabinet arrived at SODEC Tuesday.
The Parallelle and Angus have until 31 December to answer.
It seems, however, that the hypothesis of the State's gift must be really different.
We recall that the Québec Film and Film Owners Association opposed direct State investment in support of the eXcentris strike, arguing that the Ministry of Culture did not have to finance real estate projects, which it did not do for other cinema rooms.
However, several environmental actors called for substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the director of the century, had spent ten years wearing the author's film in his complex premises after he had funded his own construction, which could justify a derogation from the treasurer's Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is growing in Montreal, and eXcentris had its customer loyalty.
The Angus and the Parallel Society, with their head Christian Yaccarini, pilots, on their side, a private funding campaign, hoping to collect $700,000 to push the acquisition route.
Since the spring of 2009, one of the three screens, Le Parallèle, has continued to broadcast films in eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to unlock the three rooms on February 27th by projecting the very beautiful film Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not remember the duty and we ignore what he and his group think of the low proposals made to them.
The road up to a complex Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks shed light on what the United States considered to be the Canadian minority complex against the Americans, but they also betrayed the feeling of superiority of the latter towards Canada.
American diplomats thus marvel that every Canadian elector had no Canadian-American relations in mind by voting and believed that President Obama's visit helped the conservative government adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, located on the public place yesterday, offer more croustling details than substantial content to be put under the teeth.
A cable dated 22 September 2008, either in the full federal electoral campaign, related to the fact that the United States is not a party to the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the great surprise of the American ambassador in position in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanation of the situation.
"A Canadian minority complex almost inherently conditional may be Canadian political leaders to talk about internal issues of the day rather than to make this election on the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign)," he wrote.
The United States therefore concludes that "the verbal elegance of this election: everyone, but potentially too threatening to talk about it".
The ambassador understands less this "assurance of silence" than the two countries have a strong political and economic relationship.
"In a reasonable sense, it considers the ability of a candidate, a party and more than a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind by voting."
The other expression of this importance is in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, a business manager in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's survival when the federal budget vote began in February, by which Canada will show its first deficit in over a decade due to a $30 to $40 billion discount plan," wrote Mr. Breese.
There was no mention that the Government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being confused by the coalition and that opposition parties had to make their lives conditional on the quality of the proposed reconciliation plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington from the increasingly negative picture that the dramatic series distributed to CBC are sending to the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the emissions of Border, Little Moscow on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there are little subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even the removals for the CIA's muscle questionnaires.
Another cable relates that, at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some of Guantánamo's prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of "cases per case".
At the end of the meeting, he wrote, "he sent a paper to the State Secretary about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Canadian-origin Muslim."
"The Secretary agreed to review the case."
Let's say that the ghosts are wrong about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flaangan, a very close adviser to Stephen Harper, said on the CBC waves that the leader of this massive storm should be "killed".
This was done by Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A Global Plan for the Renewal of Enlightenment
The United Nations proposed to Cancún yesterday a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries in order to achieve a greenhouse gas reduction (GES) corresponding to almost three thirds of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the planetary climate of 2020.
This ambitious plan is set out in the series of major projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancún in order to compensate for the absence of binding commitments by industrialized countries.
According to the plan, if the inductive ampoules that monopolize more than 50 to 70 per cent of the market were replaced by fluocompact ampoules or, better, by electromagnetic diode ampoules (DEL or "LED"), the total of 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GES emitted on the planet for human enlightenment would be avoided.
Clearing is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the planetary car park.
In Copenhagen last year, large issuing countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, engaged in voluntary reduction plans that would allow GES global emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will need to remove another 5-Gt balance to stabilize the climate from 2020 to 2 centigrade degrees in order to avoid it becoming out of control.
In the incandescent ampoules, 95% of energy disappears in the form of heat and the rest, 5%, produced from light.
With fluocompact ampoules, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with new DEL ampoules, this energy requirement is reduced twice again.
The fluocompetant ampoules last between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new DEL ampoules, such as those launched by Philips this week - this company has also participated in the United Nations study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consumes 80% less energy than an undisputed ampoule, giving an idea of the economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
All these new ampoules can also work with rheostats in addition to producing very little heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown reservations in place of fluocompetant ampoules because they contain mercury and that they need to be removed as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the manufacturers place signs.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluocompetant ampoule, but rather the coal thermal centres, which emit a lot of mercury to produce gas-filled electricity in incandescent ampoules.
In the United States alone, these centres emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would thus save a billion dollars per year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 heat stations to which it would cost 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire expects the announcement of electoral results in the nervous state
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, called for the publication of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire after the expiry of the deadlines.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and to announce the provisional results without delay, has underlined a speech by the Head of the United Nations."
"He calls upon all the parties and institutions to demonstrate their responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the announcement of provisional results."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral committee has allowed the Wednesday morning to pass without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's break.
About forty minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the Chairman of the CEI had stated on television that the Commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
Appeals have multiplied in the world to finally announce the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opposition Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp is about the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "fraud" votes in the north, held by the ex-rebellion of the new Forces (FN) since the collapse of the state in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, president's campaign director of the Ivorian campaign, said that UN electoral intimidation maneuvers in the north of the country had discouraged the president's party from voting.
All elections could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo were retained by the Constitutional Council.
But the opponents of Gbagbo believe that the highest court in the country is not neutral because it is directed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political alliance of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the North who leaves all ties with the former rebels, has considered the delay in the announcement of the results and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone until the victory has been won.
His allies said that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results because he knew that he had lost and that to complain before the Constitutional Council after the electoral commission had prevented the dissemination of the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidency, Sunday, was intended to pursue the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that remained divided into two years.
The United Nations strongly warned the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had completed the first round, on October 31, with 38 per cent of the votes against 32 per cent in Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bedié (25 per cent in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France at 3th quarter
The unemployment rate in France for the International Labour Office (ILO) remained 9.3% in the metropolis (9.7% taking into account overseas departments), showing the adjusted seasonal variation data (CVS) published on Thursday by the Insee.
The number of cameras is 2,631 million in metropolis.
The data of the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the population active in the metropolis and 9.7% with the DOM.
In one year, the unemployment rate is increased by 0.1 points.
More widely, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether they were or not available in the two weeks to work and whether they were looking for a job or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has still deteriorated, with a new rise in unemployment rate, to 24.2% in metropolis (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25%, including DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637,000 15-24-year-olds were in unemployment as a result of GDP.
The seniors knew for their part a slight increase in unemployment, at 6.4 per cent in metropolis (+0.2 points in three months and one year), 482,000 persons aged 50 or over, and 6.6 per cent with DOM.
Only 25-49 years have benefited from stability in the third quarter, 8.3% in metropolis (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in France.
The Insee has not published more monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a polymetic on its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union statistical agency, continues to do so and announced a 9.8% rate for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini under review and place in detention
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, head of waste treatment and brother-in-law of the PS President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhone, was examined and visited at Lyons' arrest house near Aix-en-Provence in the context of an investigation into alleged fraud-related public markets.
Alexandre Guérini was examined for the abuse of social goods, funds and public property, theft, active corruption, traffic of influence and detention of ammunition, stating his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and tends to explain all the questions that the master will ask him, not fantasies."
"It's easy to keep it for a worthy crowd of heads, it's another thing to prove it," said AFP his lawyer, Florence Raul, before hearing his client.
Mr. Guérini, Brother of the strong man of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, had, through his lawyers, brought before his hearing a memo to explain.
One of his neighbours, Philippe Rapezzi, was also examined in the night and buried Wednesday.
According to his lawyer, Me Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but work out the downloads he had to manage.
As regards the allocation of markets or the allocation of funds related to their operation, he has never known them, said Mr Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Auglomation Services, was examined on Wednesday for public funds abuse and complexity, and was released free of charge with a ban on meeting the prosecutors of the case.
"My client has provided explanations of the facts that have been rejected."
"The instructor's teacher took into account the private lack of freedom," said his lawyer, Me Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been examined and released on Tuesday night at Wednesday, with a seat under judicial control for two of them, indicated the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic of Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director-General of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), continues for "passive influence traffic and corruption".
Two staff members of the agglomeration of Aubagrene, Michele Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were considered one for "sustainment and diversion of public goods by a person charged with a public service mission", the other for "public funds distortion complexity".
Finally, the company of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was examined for "the abuse of social goods".
Among the people who were confronted with Mr. Guérini's figure was Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently created in a parallel case of fraudulent public markets involving the Corse.
Investigators suspect that their companies are using the money of the great banditism.
The investigation was conducted in the framework of several open judicial information against X in April 2009 following anonymous mails, for fraud alleged in the passage of public markets, in particular in the waste chain.
From a close source of the investigation, the research focuses on the conditions of the assignment and operation of a discharge of La Ciotat, which collects the wastes of Aubagne and some towns of the city community of Marseille (MPM).
Case Clotilde Reiss: Elysée exercissed Syria's media
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher who was arrested in Iran for "exposure", held the opinion in Haleine in France, warned against diplomacy, and intensified the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
The United States diplomats are under careful consideration.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some of this crisis.
They describe how Elysée explained her strategy to the Americans, providing them with advice to deal with their own "attacks" crises in Iran (a small group of miners).
They show how French officials have sought to convince Washington that the release of the French youth had not been to counter the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by the American justice for trafficking in material for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they are pleased with a crucial light of how the French Presidency sought to manipulate the media to believe the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram published on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage cases of arrests".
Elysée Advisor for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, co-chaired by the Director of Orsay Quai for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, serves with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise the Americans to do so in order to repatriate their own strong-armed nationals in Iran.
"Making noise," they say, "murtle forever" in the media the words "rights of fundamental man", "in ignorance", "immediate liberation".
It is necessary to capture the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do so much more than the Iranians ask you not to do."
Because, despite attempts by discreet channels, "silence won't rule anything," Iranians are "masters in dilatory maneuvers".
Mr. Richier added that the arrest of foreigners is "an Iranian family tactic: taking hostages for political singing".
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day when she fled to the Embassy of France) "will require a large amount of money for Iranians" (230,000 euros for defence).
And he knows that the Elisée is anticipating other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will get worse".
The Iranians could "in the near future stop another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison for twelve days, but remains locked in Iran.
One information is published: Iran Majid Kakavand, whose US claims to be extradition for an unlawful traffic of sensitive electronic material to Iran, is released free to Paris on a decision of a judge.
The US Embassy, like many observers, is asking about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which tracks Iranian clandestine material acquisition networks for the nuclear programme, Majid Khakavand's expansion is a bad news.
Did France accept a marketing?
The release of Iran from France against that?
During a new interview with Kathleen Allegron on September 4, François Richier ensures that this is not the case.
Elysée, he said, not only "it was completely taken by the judge's decision", but sought to oppose it.
"There have been lively exchanges between the French Presidency and the shadow guard" (at the time, Michele Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot return to the decision" the court observed.
Mr. Richier also wanted to show that Majid Kakavand remains under the "secret" surveillance of French information services.
Elysée's adviser consists of a telephone number, accommodating, and then informs the American diplomat that Iran "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian Embassy".
During Clotilde Reiss detention in Iran, Elysée does not host her efforts, through communications and "smooths" organized in the media, to believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influent" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and they note that manipulation brings its fruit because several press articles affect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 refers to "the "mediate" of French officials".
On what basis is so much "gratitude" expressed against Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris is requested.
"Despite their full statements of praise, French officials acknowledge in private that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then focuses on the reasons why Elysée was forced to throw it into this fiction.
The intensive communication effort "to validate Sarkozy's opening policy in Syria," he analyzes.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was then perceived by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premeditated and unmerited".
By "extremeizing the role of Syria", Paris seeks to "show Syria how much praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "seeds of dispute between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. Embassy knows him well.
On August 11, François Richier told him, "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians did anything about it."
"But we thanked them at the same time."
"This should at least seem to be confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss entered France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it to Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our competitor".
No online games for young Koreans last night
The South Korean Government will adopt a law called "Cendrillon" that will prevent adolescents from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, indicated by government officials.
A draft law will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gambling companies to block access to these games after midnight, to young people under 16 years of age, indicated representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the Family.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the Ministerial Officer under the draft law.
Online games will be re-available at 6 a.m. in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare themselves for the application of the law, he said.
The Government also intends to ask companies to limit the time of daily access to these games for young people whose parents are applying for it, added the responsibility.
It will also make available to people who claim free software to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and the newspapers regularly report on various facts related to the intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the inconsistencies of the world online games competitions.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals in World Cyber Games, facing 58 other nations.
World 2018-2022: Fifa designates the host countries
In full confusion about corruption, the Executive Committee of the Fifa designates the countries organizing the World Cups 2018 and 2022, a particularly political choice where the fight against influence and lobbying are at risk of taking action on technical criteria.
One thing is sure, the 2018 edition of the Fifa's Royal Competition will take place in Europe, the traditional bastion of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its implementation in the United States or in the Middle East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Qatar's emperor, Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) addresses the economic and political issues of a World.
The treatment in coulses is therefore likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, it's difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the Fifa evaluation report, English, Spanish-Portuguese, and US (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be very serious for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, at the beginning of the revelations that resulted in the suspension of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the chances of his country, a football bat who had just accepted the World once in 1966.
The BBC sent a box, Monday, broadcasting a documentary featuring three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to please Fifa and put the English officials in the ambarras, who started in an intense lobbying these last few weeks with David Cameron in the first line.
The Head of Government hopes to re-edit the success of its predecessor, Tony Blair, who was awarded in 2005 for the organisation of the JO-2012 in London.
Will this intensive activity be sufficient to round up the collapse of England to the EC?
There is no doubt that the Spanish-Portugual duo does not miss everything with its already ready stages, its expertise (Mondial 82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its feeding culture.
However, the economic and financial prospects of the two countries could serve their ambitions.
The possible objections to the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase Russia's share, becoming an out oflerant despite the shortcomings of its file (states, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and declared a "deloyal competition in the preparation of the vote" in an allusion to the charges of the English press against EC members.
"We're trying to compromise them," said Mr. Putin.
For 2022, the United States, strong in 1994 experience, appeared as the logical favors.
The first world economic power, the headquarters of the main sponsors of the Fifa, seems to have a long lead on Japan and South Korea, which have built a very beautiful project separately.
However, these new candidates appeared early for two countries that had co-organised the trial in 2002.
Another threat: the award of World-2026 to China, strongly desired by the Fifa, which would in fact result in Asian opportunities for 2022.
With Qatar, which has played a major role in proposing future stages, and Australia, Fifa will continue its expansion towards new countermeasures, but these two countries pose more risks than certainty.
Australia, such as Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of TV rights acquired (because of the time delay) by European countries, the nerve of the war for Fifa.
Second mandate: evidence
De Gaulle was really tense.
Mitterrand had thought he was pregnant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac didn't have the least excitement.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than them.
A mandate to Elysée calls it another.
So the current Head of State will be applied in 2012.
However, the evidence does not make a good home with the part of the mystery attached to the presidential function.
So it must be done as if there was always a doubt.
In a sense like in another.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third mandate was not excluded.
On 15 November, with a severe wind, Nicolas Sarkozy made sure that he would take his decision "some part in the fall of 2011".
As he pointed out in front of the UMP parliamentarians on Tuesday evening in Elysée, the prospect of "two mandates" has therefore been a bit of febrile.
Was it the official announcement of his application?
We were far away.
The President recalled that the constitutional revision of 2008 was limited to two-fifths.
He made a statement, not an ad.
This is not the first time he mentions the presidential, on the tone of humor, at such meetings.
"The worst, or the best, you've had it for seven and a half years with me," he started them in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: "Don't think I don't think at the next stage."
Its matter before-day doesn't make her more a candidate than she does; they don't make her less.
If they hear comments, that's for a second reason.
The acceleration of the course to apply for the PS, on the one hand.
But it's not the Royal Ségolène's front entrance that makes Nicolas Sarkozy go away.
On the contrary, its 2012 candidate is clear that many in the PS claim to have an early battle order.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters preferred François Fillon's application to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion with the UMP above," the Prime Minister responded immediately and tactfully.
"If he believes the possible failure, he won't be asked," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"I will always believe that I can win," Alain Juppé corrects, quoted in the evidence.
Euro: The ECB is forced to maintain its State securities purchases
The last meeting of the Council of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be the opportunity to clarify the modalities for the issue of the crisis or at least to announce the end of a number of non-conventional monetary policy operations to be completed at the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis will no doubt make it impossible for the Frankfurt Emission Institute to be as peremptive as it is in order to worsen a situation more than it is today on the European compulsory markets.
The political cost would be much higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, the French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde, welcomed the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis in Europe.
She did not want to say if she felt that the central bank had to do more, e.g. increasing its sovereign debt purchase programme.
"I reserve my thinking to my European partners (...)".
In Brussels, when the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs heard the European Parliament's Committee on Economic Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was no longer aware of his intentions, pleased to indicate that the purchase of State title on the secondary market was "continued" and that "we will see what we will decide" at the meeting on this Thursday.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main manager rate unchanged by 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchases of Treasury bonds by the ECB have doubled last week to nearly EUR 1.35 billion.
And, according to market operators' indiscriminates, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese titles yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have purchased EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, the precipitation of a continuation of purchases is no doubt (see page 29).
The economists no longer expect no significant change.
If loan operations have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal for more than three months, the latter is still subject to limited liquidity allocations under generic conditions and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
The economists today expect this device to be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine how important it is to change its program."
"Without that, it would be risking new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, economist of the Commercialbank.
"A progressive release announced during the first quarter of 2011 appears more likely," previewed by Norbert Brams, economist at Sal.
Openhouse.
On the basis of its public debt market interventions, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of these obligations in order to stimulate an anonymous market," adds Norbert Brams.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It needs to be replaced at all costs by a lack of investors on the market and to act in such a way as to prevent a balance of performance paid by the most fragile States," said an important mandatory manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates are concerned, the States will be more generous in order to reduce them, or to stabilize them.
The saving of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government makes the two round
After a week of concern for Italy, the situation was somewhat delayed, yesterday, with the reflux of mandatory rates at 10 years.
A return to the early silence.
At a meeting with the Minister of the Economy, the regional presidents said that Giulia Tremonti had heard that the situation was "undefraudable" and expected a week-end "unpredictable", which the interested party then declined.
On Tuesday, the difference with the long German rates had reached the 210 basis points record and the cover price (CDS) contract price was around 263 points, resulting in some collapse in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the difference with the German rates was more than 400 base points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was declared "very concerned" by "market turbulence" and possible contamination from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the anonymity of tax revenues that go with it, putting the State at risk of no longer being able to cover its funding needs.
The latest forecasts in Brussels have been a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under review at the Senate table above 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates that the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (against 3.9% of government budget) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Where the room of a new budget collector who could be put in place after the parties, for an amount of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will have to be taken," says Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy receives support from international institutions.
"The foundations of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we repeat them for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy to IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate and short term, because despite its important debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested in Italy are less than those applied to other countries," observes Pier Carlo Paduan, CEO of OECD.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censorship in the House of Members, following which early elections could be held at the end of March.
There would then be a period which would not be conducive to the decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis devices
Christine Lagarde was still martyred yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I believe that we have shown it again Sunday and night, are obviously solid, determined, committed to defending their currency and monetary area."
Although in any case, the detention recorded yesterday on the rates of State obligations of the European State has brought water to the government's and ECB's mill.
But we can't talk about a normalization start yet.
The standard & Poor's notation agency announced that it could undermine Portugal's debt note, the most targeted target today by speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and visibility, particularly on banking systems," the economists of Exane BNP Paribas said.
More than "political time is much shorter than market time".
Aware of this urgency and the dangers it poses, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis devices.
The informal consultations between the most directly concerned finance ministers and, more widely, with their G20 peers will be well conducted.
This also applies to meetings of the Group and the Ecofin from the beginning of next week.
The ECB will meet today.
In the menu, the result of non-conventional measures to support the euro area countries in the markets collimator (see above).
With regard to the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, launched an Asian tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform the EU's leading investors of the crisis' developments.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the area.
The first EFSI securities issue is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an American official representative told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct pledge of IMF.
First-line countries, Portugal and Spain, as far as they are concerned, are seeking to adopt structural reforms, including on the organization of the labour market.
Reforms that add to closer austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to borrow a different route from Greece and Ireland.
One and the other have every price to avoid seeking international assistance before setting up their own budgetary corrections and deciding structural reforms that are necessary to restore permanent confidence.
At the end of the year, the euro banknotes focus on the options available to speed up the process of normalization of sovereign debt markets.
On 24 November, Axel Weber had first developed the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to hand over to the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, an actor of the first European sovereign debt market, argues that a round of about 100 billion euros would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
The vehicle exists: the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism, which currently has EUR 60 billion.
A Council that has all the opportunities to be carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if the conditions of the market were met.
Negies and verglasses: 24 orange surveillance departments
The negative episodes still create traffic difficulties, especially on the secondary network in Britain, and may interfere with certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange care due to the risk of snow and snow.
The Eure, the Eure-and-Loir, the Two-Sèvres and Vienna, has been added to 20 departments already in orange care, 18 since Wednesday after noon and two, the Dordogne and Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, maintained snowflakes affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it slowly snows on the French Isle.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, to 5 cm for the Parisian region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Netherlands Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
The severe episodes are known enough to trigger traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, states Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departments were prohibited from weighing more than 7.5 tons, including the Gingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Ludéac.
The movement on the secondary network in Britain is very difficult according to gendarmes who recommend not to take his vehicle but, if necessary, and the movement of some TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transport was banned for Thursday in Picardie.
No specific measure was considered Wednesday evening to restrict the circulation of heavy weights.
Prefecture " invites all motorists to the greatest caution on the roads and to adapt their behavior accordingly".
The Civil Aviation Directorate (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel their flights to the Paris airport of Roissy and 10 per cent to Orly due to future snowfalls.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their company.
In Great Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial equities
Since the debate on the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France has taken place, billions of people are crying.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, 23 billion are earmarked for the Great Paris Metro which must be built by the Great Paris Society.
In order to launch this GSP, the State has announced a $4 billion capital grant.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that will then enable the GSP to borrow on the markets a part of the funding of its double bottle.
Today, we end up with the first additions.
The Correctional Finance Act 2010, examined in the National Assembly's Finance Commission this morning, contains the arrangements for the start of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, in the text of the draft law, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution of the Great Paris Society".
It is listed as "the product of this tax is €117 million per year".
The second is a reimbursement of a tax on offices already existing "in order to modernise it, increase the product and affect this increase to the Great Paris Society".
How much would that be?
Master.
This is not listed in the text.
We're out of 4 billion.
"It is stated that these fiscal resources are added to the 4 billion euros of capital allocation that will be mobilized by the State and brought to the Great Paris Society in the form and measure of the project," we can read in the statement of reasons.
In the GSP, we don't find this shocking system.
"From the time we created recipes (the two taxes, dllr), we can cover the studies in three years and dig in the 4 billion after, it is explained."
"It will be included in the budget and drawn to the theft and measure."
The GDP estimates that 4 billion will start to be registered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This provision, in which the 4 billion promised remaining subscribers are still at risk of causing a little parliamentary debate.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Hackers and spies in love
WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals a clear scandal, a scandal that appears as scandal rather than a scandal in the face of hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level and predicts a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed by order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file is made up of a secret service (from any nation or nation) consisting exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary" U.S. appearances on Berlusconi's sexual habits can only be reported in any newspaper (except those of Berlusconi's owner), and Khadafi's self-categorized profile has been for many years for the artists of cable to sketch.
The rule that secret files should be made up only of new ones already known is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that every work is repeated (on the Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Temples or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in the previous works.
And this is not just because the author of hidden texts doesn't like to do indirect research (he doesn't know where to look for news on the missing person), but because those who turn to occultism believe only what they already know, and who confirm what they have already learned.
It's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
I'm going for the secret files.
The informer is parscal, and parscal (or spirit-limited) the head of secret services (but it could be, I know, a liberator), who does not hold as true what he recognizes.
Top secret information on Berlusconi that the US Embassy of Rome sent to the State Department was the same as Newsweek published last week.
Why, then, did the revelations on these files sound so loud?
On the one hand, they say that every person cultivated already knows that embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the heads of State can call or take a plane to meet dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for a few small representations, have been transformed into testing centres.
No movie viewer knows that very well, and that's not just by hypocrisy that it seems to be ignored.
However, the fact that it is publicly violated is the duty of hypocrisy, and it serves to put American diplomacy under bad light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is an impenetrable blow to the prestige of the State Department.
The scandal also does not put both victims and victims in crisis.
But let's go to the deep nature of what happened.
So, in Orwell's time, all power could be conceived as a Big Brother who controlled every management of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy was fully realized since, able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction carried out, the hotel visited, the bus hired and then the citizen became the full victim of power.
But when it is shown, as it is now, that even the secrets of power can't escape a hacker's control, the control report ceases to be undirectional and circulatory.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - choose as the citizen's winner - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel has already told him that a true secret is an empty secret (and empty secret can never be revealed); it is true, too, that knowing about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, because it is relevant to the public domain; but revealing, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets meant to remove all power.
WikiLeaks didn't hurt Sarkozy or Merkel, but it made it too big in Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury to a very powerful power?
It is clear that in the future, the States will no longer be able to place any information on the reservation - that would bring it back to the public on a display gathered along the street.
But it is also obvious that with the current technologies, it must be expected to be able to maintain confidential reports by telephone.
Nothing easier than discovering if and when a Head of State moved into a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved reports be maintained in the future?
I know that, for the moment, my vision is derived from science fiction and is therefore romantic, but I am obliged to imagine government officials who are discrepancyly moving into uncontrollable journeys, not carrying messages from the heart or, above all, hiding the rare information written in the earpiece.
The information will be kept in a single copy in locked shots: in the background, the Watergate spy attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I've had the opportunity to write that technology is now advanced in crabe, i.e. in the spinal cord.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a telegraph on children (telephones).
Videocassettes (analogues) had enabled film researchers to explore a step-by-step film, going ahead and back and discovering all the mounting secrets, while now the CD (numerical) allows only to jump off the chapter, i.e. by macroporations.
With high speed trains, we leave Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the plane, and the moves it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not surprising that politicians and communications techniques return to horse cars.
A final observation.
At other times, the press was trying to understand what was going on in the embassy's secret.
This is now the Ambassadors who request confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France doubles its financing promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine the compliance of rapidly-deployed financing promises (such as fixed start or advance funding) carried out by developed countries.
And the great French bidouts are revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries committed themselves to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (or €420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU has played a major role in ensuring its partners' commitment to fixed-start funding: a report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, large side event, distribution of brochures...
Transparency operation is valuable and appreciated at its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announced that in 2010 €2.2 billion was lost, which put it on the right path for its commitment to 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when we look at it in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be, under the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional" to ensure that an additional effort is made without prejudice to public development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States in which France had blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the best reference.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained and it added 150 million over three years to fixed-term funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or in terms of level of public development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers the funding of "all new projects" in 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to previous years' expenditure or the overall level of public development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of France's support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), claiming to respect its commitment to "new and additional funding" ...
Another crucial element, sharing between gifts and loans.
Still, there are no rules and each chooses its calculation mode.
Some, like France, considered that 1€ loan was equal to 1 € given.
Of course, this is difficult to justify: effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the reduction of emissions based on more efficient technologies), it is not possible to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro given... Moreover, it should not be taken into account for its commitments but for the cost of loans for the loan to the beneficiary country (or the equivalent of an interest rate).
However, France does not have to make such a statement: it 'respects' its commitment of 420 million euros by 91.5% of loans (389.8 million) and 8.5% of donations (33.1 million euros) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so extensively.
Germany requires 46 per cent, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in other cases) comply with their commitments with 100 per cent of the grants.
In other words, when the very large majority of the European Union set €1 to meet its commitment, France only places 10 cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
Nice pass tour!
In summary, in its fast-start funding France has a double-scrokering approach: on the one hand, on the evolution of the action in time and on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only EUR 36.1 million, it is possible to believe that it spends 420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (which seems to have achieved arbitration) could have a double negative impact both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give up if it is sufficient to do so) and in negotiations as developing countries are not fully duped...
The chapter of early financing is only a small issue, relatively short term, in relation to the whole of climate discussions.
But it could be more sand grain in the size of the machine than the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that's not the case.
Whatever the case, it is necessary to draw lessons from this first year of early funding.
Firstly, France could announce a change in its accounting mode for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and equity with other countries of the European Union.
In particular, France could advance discussions on long-term financing issues (another crucial chapter currently under discussion): the question of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans will not be excluded.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister for the Environment, Ms Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement on France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would naturally increase the level of international confidence needed to advance in discussions.
Warning of pesticides introduced by children
A 10-year-old child engages in a day 81 different chemicals, according to a study published by the Association of Future Generations (ex-Movation for the Rights and Respect of Future Generations).
The association, which foresees that its results "have no significant statistical value in view of the low number of samples analysed but are examples of the problem being dealt with", bought in July and September the food normally consumed in four meals and one meal a day by a child for a decade, in the supermarkets of the Oise and Paris.
These types of meals, including official recommendations - five fruits and vegetables, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as friands, were examined by laboratories in the search for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The assessment is based on 81 chemicals of which 42 are classified as possible or likely cancers and five certain cancer-classed substances as well as 37 substances capable of acting as endocrine disruptors (PE), according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, it is well seen in our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic consumers and/or PE is worrying," notes the Association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible and three possible cancers such as certain cancers, as well as nearly one-half of the residues that can disrupt the hormonal system.
The cheese, imported from Brazil, which is intended as an encas by the study, presents six traces of chemical substances, including a fongicide, which is currently banned in France.
The same thing for Kenya's green raccoons, including in the afternoon, about which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the steak, the tin in the box, and even the bread bag and the rubber Chewing were contaminated with pesticides and other chemicals.
In robin water, the analysis revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroforms.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of plastic acid used to dry the meal in the micro-onde was not exempt.
The final risk for the consumer of this "continent cocktails" is "probably underestimated", according to the study.
The European Ecology-Les Verts Alliance (EE-LV), on the other hand, has proposed "beyond the emergency situation" to launch a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop "increasing civilisation diseases".
In July a study of the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) showed the presence of 365 different pesticide residues identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
