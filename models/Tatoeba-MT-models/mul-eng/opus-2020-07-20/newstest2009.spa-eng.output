Prague's Ball ended with less points at the end of the day
After the early fall in the morning, Prague's Bolsa corrected its losses.
The transactions of the ČEZ actions achieved approximately half the value they had on a normal day.
At the beginning of March, Prague's Bolsa responded immediately to the fall of the moon when it fell to around 6%.
The drop of this time is due to the drop of actions in Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote of the American Assembly of Representatives, which was refused to support the stabilization plan of the Secretary of the financial sector, is also expressed here.
Action drop in Asia
Asian Bols' actions were a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although during the day, the index finally reduced part of the losses.
Hong Kong's Hong Kong Hong Kong's Hang Seng Ball index during its financial day marked almost four percent, although later it slowed its losses by reducing the drop in virtually 2.5 percent.
Hong Kong's Hong Seng China Enterprises' index following Chinese operations in Hong Kong was 3.8% down, the markets in Shanghai were closed.
The actions of the Sidney Ball were more than five percent lost, but in the end the losses fell to a 4.3 percent.
Taiwan's Bolsa, according to the Secretary of the Index, fell to 3.6 per cent.
"The rescue actions planned in the United States are unsafe and this affects the financial market all over the world," said the Chief of the Hong Kong Monetary Office, Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it only determines its monetary policy, that is, independent of the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong interest rates are at the same level as those in the United States.
American legislators should meet again as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and adopt a proposal to support the financial system.
On the other hand, it threatens that disasters will be felt in other countries.
Bloody bath of American actions
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the financial system aid plan, which should be devoted to $700 billion (about $12 billion).
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and help to stabilize the whole economy.
On Monday, American actions lived a bloody bath and mainly the index of actions collected the largest drop in over 20 years.
Dow Jones' index dropped almost seven percent. A similar volume drop was last registered in 1987.
The index was down before it was announced but soon it was shown that the proposal for the assembly was not going forward, the index began to fall free.
Congress withdraws: U.S. government can inject $700 billion in the bank
The highest representatives of Congress and Government, President George W. Bush, agreed in a broad agreement to provide financial assistance to the American financial system.
Its vote will take place at the beginning of the next week.
U.S. legislators raised a gap in the negotiations on the adoption of the ransom plan in its form to assist the US financial system with the amount of $700 billion (about $12 billion).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must finalize some details of the contract before they can make the final form of the law and be voted.
The financial system assistance plan will be discussed Monday in the Assembly of Representatives.
He said on Sunday to Reuters, Barney Frank, Chairman of the Committee on Financial Services and the Bank of the Assembly.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate not before Wednesdays.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, it will come to "satisfaction" thanks to the complex mechanisms that will also help the market.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We've made great progress.
We resolve our discrepancy opinions on how to have the package of measures for market stabilization" commented Democrat Nancy Pelosia to Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met on Sunday night with Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give him a final way to the Government's Fund.
This should buy from financial companies non-sale mortgage assets that lead to long-term losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and must also be effective in the market.
It is necessary to continue with the healing plan, but I think we are already in it," Paulson said.
A sign for Asian businesses
The global financial crisis has an express impact on the fast-paced action market.
According to Senator Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators are doing their best to finally approve an agreement this Sunday.
They therefore want to calm the business of investors in the Asian finance market because they are the ones found in the first time house and where Congress could influence Monday's trade.
However, there is no clear certainty at this time about when the two cameras of the American Congress will vote and even if they will not be in the last minute with any problem.
The legislators believe it will be adopted in the next days.
The law, however, will suffer a series of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
However, Congress could block the release of the remaining amount if it had the impression that the programme did not fulfil its function, which would have been $100 billion and later $350 billion.
Bush appreciated the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the President may vote in favour of this decision, but Congress can overcome its veto by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the programme was retained that was to earn financial resources for the recovery of mortgage securities whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to end up paying their mortgages.
"We've done everything.
The Assembly of Representatives should be prepared to vote on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
American President Bush is also satisfied with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with the progress of the Saturday and that it is worth "the effort of both parties to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy".
Restriction of closed contract
The Chairman of the Banking Committee of the Senate, Christopher Dodd, head of the negotiators, said that the legislators had decided on the responsibility of the programme for the protection of the taxpayers' taxes, a relief clause of the programmed financing plan.
The new law must also limit the so-called closed contracts for directors of the participating companies of the programme and establish a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This would have to be directed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it, and we have made great progress towards the convention that will work and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also provides assistance to house owners who have problems with their payments.
The Government would have to agree with the new mortgage payments that it purchases with a view to lowering the monthly charges of payments to the creditors and allowing them to stay with their homes.
Marek: psychological assistance
The proposed plan is, according to Patria Finance's economist, David Marek, a good idea that will be carried out but quite difficult.
"And that's why you don't know what mechanism and what price the problem assets will buy.
This will be decisive for the distribution of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
That the plan is now adopted or at the beginning of the next week is not so relevant, according to Marek.
" Much more important is that, this week the conventioners agree on their support and you in your good sight before you can do anything.
This important and psychological agreement that comes to that approval is, at these times, the most important thing," Marek insisted.
Handgun fight: MP3 player against mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile player plays MP3 files, no MP3 player is able to make calls.
What seems to be obvious is that it's better to buy only the phone.
There are still enough reasons for a man to get only the player.
The choice depends practically on the way it is used and the requirement of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult to acquire the latest tocadisks to listen to it last album by Maxim Turbulenc.
On the other hand, this type of music products such as LP discs are no longer coming out, and as regards their quality, there is no only objective reason to continue to buy them.
If you hang on your vinyl discs with art rock, jazz or blue music, you are probably dreaming at least with this type of toca discs.
This is the same with the music that is on the way, that is, compressed, simplified music - the music in MP3.
And here there are categories of price and quality.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, the same as for a Pink Floyd lover who will find it difficult to test the market caches of twenty crowns.
Two extremes, including enough space for each one.
The selection is wide.
Also determines the duration of the battery
Some of the best players get much more than just playing music and even the one that doesn't even most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as your phone.
Face to the most important functions such as telephoneing, sending messages, can play music and video, record both, has a better or worse camera, and until you can navigate.
And when we take into account the Smartphone and the PDA are going to have a small computer in their pocket.
This is a little miracle because no one ever knows how to make a parrilla and no TV can photograph.
The universality of mobiles also brings us dissuasives.
How many more functions are used on the mobile phone before the screen indicator will be illuminated and requested to be recharged.
And music playing is one of the biggest energy tracks.
Few are mobiles who can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, most of them much less.
In this regard, music players (especially the simplest) have a clearly greater performance.
Therefore, be aware that cheap mobiles will not play more than two hours.
In addition, above all, they constantly call themselves to be given, for more safety, a loader for work - this is also valid for the most expensive devices.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have it, as even the poor will take at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load.
Another problem happens when you write music on the phone.
Unfortunately only part of the devices have a universal USB connection and, in addition, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without a special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly on the memory card, but only in some non-reduction reader units can connect the small memory cards that are used in mobile phones.
In the players, with some exception (iPod), no special software is required.
Enough to fill the device with music via USB on your computer.
Most mobiles and players create only their order in the musical library according to the name of the interpreter, title of the album, gender or even user rating.
Some devices show only a tree structure directory similar to a Windows Searcher and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Player tries to use, mobile knows more
For the selection of a specific team interested in the resistance of the accumulator, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and of course the comfort of its management.
If you listen, above all, to music as a background and you will listen to it every day for just a few minutes, as in the transmitter, then you'll get enough of any cell phone you play.
What actually gets any mobile.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the cell phone or player plays music.
MP3 plays it all and, in practice, almost all the music it comes to will be in this format.
Among the most extensive and except for him, the absolute majority of the devices play music in WMA format.
At least they include the AAC format (format used by Apple and its iPod).
Best mobiles also enable, for example, online music purchases.
It's just via the mobile Internet to visit the operator's competent pages (or any other service provider) and buy a song or album.
This service could only be a weight argument to acquire a mobile for music.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable and the majority are limited to the themes of successful radio escape.
Prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that this kind of music sales (whether via GSM, internet or wireless) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always take up a cell phone.
If you like to listen to something, you'll find the cell phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether I always get earphones or, at least, handsfree.
If this is not so, you can use an integrated player that has practically every mobile, even if it is at least a MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many of the mobiles with music will be their price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns can already buy a good walkman.
Most of you will limit the absence of an entry for classical hearing aids.
The best, even with regard to the technical part, such as the telephones equipped with a 3.5 mm input for classic hearing aids, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of players is nothing but their easy service.
The simplest players - in no way necessarily the cheapest ones (see our selection) - really manages them all.
The minimum functions, their management, similar to the previous current cases or also tocadisks are evident.
It does not represent a threat in that we are mistakenly connected to the Internet with the mobile and, consequently, giant account for low data.
What device to choose
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g., Vadaphone 527) usually have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even the purchase of a suitable card will reach the 2,000 crowns.
However, be careful.
Basic models, usually equipped only with a 2 GB maximum capacity card.
Only the most expensive have an 8-GB memory.
If you already have a mobile and you want to buy a cheap MP3 player, you can buy an egg in Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
According to capacity (up to a maximum of 2 GB) no more than 1,100 crowns need to be spent.
If it is considered among the most demanding lovers of music the hand of the most specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles on the walkman line have almost the same use as that of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category of price, over four thousand crowns, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance up to 35 hours), would bring MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will be arriving this year in the Czech Republic.
Probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, here we still need something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
He probably won't be late for it.
That Czech operators are part of Europe's most expensive, we have already written it on mobile.cz.
The rest also confirmed that the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÜ) warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is the most expensive of the whole Union.
Following the last steps of the European Commission in the field of roaming rates regulation, there is likely to be a paradoxical situation - for some of the Czech mobile operators sending SMSs from abroad will be cheaper than sending them from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, lacking competence that really wants to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical, because we have three mobile networks and its high coverage is over 100%.
In contrast, mobile operators like to complain that there is an extreme competition in the Czech market.
The President of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÜ), Pavel Dvorák, also said that there is no place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It may be true that for a classic operator with his own network he no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Exactly the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market led to a high price decline, which also required classical operators to react.
At the same time, even before the entrance of piburons such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile to the market in Great Britain, similar voices were heard there as well as here.
There has been evidence that there is room for this type of operator and that they can be successful.
On the other hand, there is no need to look for examples too far.
In February of this year, we inform you about the star of the virtual Mobilking operator in Poland.
Only after a year or so, this operator was able to obtain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighbouring country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking there is the Penta group that, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is to concentrate on many more specific target groups.
In addition, to enable them to function effectively, they are enough with many less customers than a classic operator.
They do not bear relatively high costs in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world, this type of virtual operators are usually profiled with low cost - they offer cheap calls and messages that, however, are often contrary to the most adjusted service offer.
Thus, for example, mobile Tesco in Great Britain offers SMS at least half the price for competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a good hit for a trivial group target.
This operator is specifically addressed to the man.
"The right man chooses Mobileking - is the operator that likes and trusts," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works this virtual operator.
It's hard to say if a concept like that of Poland might fail in our country.
There is no doubt that Vodafone's spokesman, Miroslav Čepický: "The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments where most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of the offer of services is relatively satisfactorily satisfied"
In the Czech Republic there are no possibilities, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be any virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic it does not seem too hopeful.
Rather, it is the launch of Mobilking in other countries of our region," said in a telephone conversation for mobile.cz, Jana Studničkova, a spokesman for the Penta financial group.
He indirectly ensured that the current mobile phone operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to this idea.
Instead, they try to do everything possible to prevent any potential competition.
Interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator already shows the new GTS group that wants to take a step forward to become a real O2 telephone competition in the field of business clients.
"We have a great interest in it, so that we can offer our customers not only fixed phone services but also mobile phone services.
And as long as before, better.
With this possibility we have found us again with all Czech mobile phone operators.
With some of them we have made progress at the meetings," said the group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
Well, maybe they're spending better time.
It seems that, in non-official information, the first official operator would have to arrive at the end of the year.
But for now his appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable silence wall.
"At these moments we believe that the situation is suitable for the appearance of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
So far no one has been directed to us with some complex and serious project in this field," said for mobile.cz, Vlastimil Sršön, Telefónica O2.
Other operators refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
The spokesman for T-mobile, Martina Kemrová, in exceptional terms with O2's opinion, adds: "To date we have not registered any viable commercial project which, bilaterally profitable, can continue to develop."
And he adds: "In the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find any virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this moment we should already have on the table some concrete contract that could be studied in as short as possible."
Vodafone focuses on compliance with the own requirements of a 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this is about spending and infrastructure.
We view it precisely as the greatest contribution from the customer perspective.
Vodafone's main strategy in this field is in the company with which to set up a shared network for a quick internet on the mobile."
Offices responsible - with Ugna and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increased competition, which would lead to a lower price and thus a decrease in profits.
Then why facilitate access to competition?
When operators want to get something, they're able to pull from the same rope, proof of that is the arrival of U:phone.
Maybe the biggest pressure on the ČTU was at the time of U:phone by T-Mobile society.
It certifys the public information available on the ČTú website.
But precisely now U:fon serves as an argument why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds: "In addition, not long ago the competitive environment in the mobile phone market was opened to a fourth operator.
With regard to the nature of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would be subject to him and, above all, to his large services."
That is why this access to mobile operators is extremely disappointing due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
It is not just the position of the ČTU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries.
This is purely the Office for the Protection of Commercial Offers (UOHS).
However, it expressed its typical position before this problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile phone market would be possible after a contract on the purchase of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile phone operator and a virtual operator is concluded.
So far no convention has been closed since the offer of the most well-interested potentials was not sufficiently interesting for classical operators," Kristian Chalupa, of the UOHS External Relations Department, added our question.
These statements do not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For offices that should represent the interests of consumers, it is more than a consideration, but it must be noted that no one takes advantage of their position on the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In the foreign place where virtual operators operate normally we can note that their market entry has contributed to lower prices of mobile phone services"
Clearly, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the low prices do not enter the interest of the UOHS.
Indeed, the dramatic shock in all of this is reflected in the dissonant reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is a coincidence is offered by itself.
It is the same with the price of gasoline in the gasolines because it is clear that it is a work of chance and a hard fight for competition.
"The Office in this regard has not found signs of unfair competition and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators therefore have a dominant position that does not have a corresponding rise of responsibility in their actions on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile phone market to virtual operators, instead, are missing, as well as telecommunications regulators," Chalupa added.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many conflicting points.
There is obviously an analysis of relevant markets developed by the ČTU that telecommunications is from the point of view of a single market.
In this type of market, of course none of the Czech operators have a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer another vision - in order for a virtual operator to emerge, it is always necessary to agree with the network administrator.
And the mobile phone operator - with all his logic - has the monopoly on his network.
Therefore, in a concrete segment, it must be necessarily dominant.
And if this argument was not accepted, at least for UOHS should be a warning that three mobile operators appear in a similar way.
The current complaints of stakeholders (including the so-called GTS Novara company) show that in all negotiations with operators, there are many similar obstacles.
The burden of responsibility in ČTú is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications where the UOHS washes hands in all this matter.
We've already met with him in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the telecommunications law was introduced shortly ago to expand the ČTU's competition in the field of non-implemented commercial tenders, even when a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
This must be well known by the representatives of UOHS, but it is clear that their interests are on the other side.
It's all right, when no one sees.
At the same time, it is incredibly still working something as well as a pseudovirtual operator that already exists in Czech mobile phone networks.
They are companies that place their own prices on mobile phone services, but only one party is public.
This is usually the case with companies that are dedicated to multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Usually only a few selected ones get a list of prices from these companies.
The magic is in which the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business client of the same company carrying a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that commercial conditions in all Czech mobile phone operators prohibit that type of return.
"If cases such as those mentioned could be identified as a violation of the terms of the contract which could be translated into the end of cooperation with the society, "the question of this problem was answered by Martina Kemrová.
But it is quite unlikely that this type of activity carried out by mobile phone operators will not reach responsible people.
In the case of the three mentioned companies, thousands of customers can be treated.
None of the operators are opposed to this procedure.
With the activities of these companies, they gain nothing and, at the same time, unlike the authentic virtual operators - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns us of the possible problems: "the law allows a speculation of this type, however, the services of this company are used only by one hundred customers.
These should also accept that the SIM card of your phone is not your name, so they can't be absolutely available from it as a normal client of the operators."
This is precisely what it should look like to the Czech Republic at least foreign.
There is also a new question for the UOHS.
If mobile phone operators are surrounded by eyes in this type of procedure, why are they blocking the entry of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that the UOHS has sufficient competence to discover this type of activity and if it is not to be desired, it must not be satisfied with the explanations of operators that they have no idea of this story and that their commercial conditions do not permit it.
When are we gonna stop being the most expensive?
As already made clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market led to a significant decline in service prices.
At the same time, practically in all countries where the virtual operator emerged, classical operators tried to protect themselves from this interruption.
The arguments used by these were practically all identical - too small, a market, possibly too satisfactorily, problems with service quality, etc.
In the most developed countries, however, regulatory bodies have intervened at these times and in none of the cases have defended operators but their customers.
They already had formal measures or informal pressure to produce the first virtual operator and with it they began to produce more.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory body all of this happens as if it were a burning key.
In our experience, we cannot let ourselves be impressed that the confusion of the attributes in these cases is consistent with them.
But we don't despair.
If this information between carriers is correct and the virtual operator really comes to these lands, then the Czech mobile phone market is probably beginning to move again.
If any of the operators stop accessing any virtual mobile phone operator, it will be difficult for the UOHS to remain indifferent to the refusal (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling dearer than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hammock has four new versions.
Best Ellipse
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the Czech official poem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek, on the day of the Czech official celebrations, presented the new official recording of the Donde temple, my home.
The new humno recorded him under the direction of Jiří Bélohlávek.
There are four versions - two versions that are solos, one male voice and the other female voice, another with Coro and another instrument.
Part of the canton encargan Caterina of the King of the Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the heavenly arrangements are Otakar Jeremiaháš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to the four versions.
Bélohlávek considers this national Czech song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
The Czech Radio has already said before he deliberately elected the only singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried with the two and then, also with the Coro to rely on the speech so that the text would be well understood, so that it would be consensual," he said.
The official Czech hammock celebrates the next year of the 175 anniversary.
The song Donde, my Home was first sung in 1834 at the tables of the State Theatre in the original Czech work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetan Tyl and arranged with the music of Frantisek Škroup.
He won popularity and people made it his.
The first set of the song after the birth of Czechoslovakia in 1918 was naturally converted into a part of the official stage.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the birth of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" hemno sounds
Prague's MHD takes us Wednesdays for the first time with the chip
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, is written in the history of Prague Transport Company on the date when the first passengers enter the subway, tram and bus with an electronic bonus in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
This can be purchased at these times by nearly a thousand people who have the Opencard chip card.
The passengers can buy the 30-day bonus, 90-day bonus and the year (will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously load it on their chip card in the info centres and transport business posts at the Metro stations, Museum, Móstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Andël, Roztyly, Latvia, Kobylisy, Rajská Zahrada, Kacherov and Luka.
The bonds can be purchased from the Internet since yesterday on the transport company's pages, www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than four hundred people until evening.
Those who start using the Internet as a form of trade can definitely begin to forget about ticket sales at the metro stations, where they have to do so regularly to get a normal ticket.
The bonus is bought online, and the opencard card is recharged in one of the three branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is a valve for passengers with staff ready to help interested people with online purchase and also with the recharge of the bonus bought on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrní.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to reload the electronic bonus on the Opencard in the automatic machines that are located in some metrics.
How are these expanding machines?
They're red, they remind us of a ticket picker machine and the passengers are probably already located at Roztyly, Budéjoviká metro stations, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are now in the city five but at the end of the year there would have to be eight," Opatrní completed.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Just to enter in it the chip card Opencard and the previously paid bonus will be charged only to her.
Electronic bonds have been valid since morning not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the traffic and bus lines between 300 and 499 which are mainly used by the inhabitants of central Bohemia.
"In the trains assigned to the integrated transport of Prague there are auditors equipped with a reading card that will help confirm the validity of the time and zone of the bonus," he explained the control of tickets, Filip Drapal of the Ropid organization, which sets out the hours of collective transport in Prague.
Circulation buses have their reading cards mounted in the driver's pocket.
When entering, it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also to accompany it with the Opencard in the place to which it is intended on the side of the Box.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the bonus.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonds there is nothing easier than to request the driver this information," Drapal concluded.
Passengers who do not travel on the circulatory buses and do not remember when completing the validity of the bonus can be directed to the sending machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be presented with information about the validity of your document.
The South wanted to be part of the United States in a referendum.
In 1945 the Germans asked that fumaba be a part of the United States.
This is what is drawn from the letter that is stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the pattern of the United States of America.
With this desire, some groups of Germans from the Southern Hemisphere were apparently directed to the President of the United States in 1945.
The result of the cards that are stored in a particular archive and that today are stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in a letter to the American President that does not allow the return of the "Shuumava Land" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - again in Czechoslovakia.
"We have correctly understood the situation and we want your word that the American units are coming to German lands, not as oppressors or enemies, but as liberators," says the letter, signed with "the people who take the destiny of Shumava in their hearts."
Given that the union of Czechoslovakia with the southern Germans is supposed to be - according to these Czech national nature - a hope only in brutality, disconsideration, misunderstanding, pressure and slavery, the authors cry out in the letter to the American President who is taking over for today and for all time in Shumava under a protection.
"We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million people, we are delivered to a foreign state that oppresss and rejects minorities and that it is actually working with the victory of the allies," says the letter.
The reason why the authors can't sign is that the fear of repressives of the Czech "pressors".
If the president of the United States was too suspicious about this idea of the Germans, it would be sufficient to organize a referendum on whether their citizens want to be part of the U.S. or live under their patronage.
Although the text of the letter, with the current knowledge of the postwar history, can sound a little childish, according to some experts, accurately paints the expectations of the Germans of the south-west of the time.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least assume that they were going to deal with their expulsion from the Republic only a few admitted this possibility.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to negotiate for the Sudan in a clear form of autonomy.
Others thought they'd stay in Czechoslovakia.
He even confirmed it by Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budéjovice.
This was in the war, as German of Budéjovice, wrapped in the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war the British captured him and placed him in the camp of ten German Holstein prisoners were sent to him to teach them Czech.
"They thought when they got home, the check would come well," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, he said, would have been excluded from the Republic on the basis of the Benes Decrees.
Don't you think - pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most direct action in Czech history directed to safety on the streets.
In this way, it could be characterized by the emotional campaign that decided to launch Wednesdays the Ministry of Transport in the media.
The Minister's office, Aleš Rébíček, promises to disarm drivers of dangerous driving.
The 150 million campaign will be heard on television, radio, cinema, internet and booklets.
It should discourage the driver of high speed and alcohol on the wheel.
And also to remind them that before they get started, the belts are fixed.
He wants to reach consciousness primarily of young drivers, motorists, petons and, ultimately, professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Basically human stories that empathize with emotions.
And for that we testify to the ads "sanguinarians" throughout the campaign:
Don't you think - pay!
The word "not thinking" is written with great letters in the matrix.
And in a blood vessel is the word "pagas".
This should symbolize that a man at a time of dissipation can come to pay with his own life.
The ads are going to be "fearful" to the viewers by 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out in Anglo-Saxian lands where strong images of victims of accidents can be observed.
You promise that this will reduce accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The announcements have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and lubricants for drivers
"For drivers, the sugar and melgo system is worth it.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a red semaphorus occurs and thus saves time.
The wolf is a threat to much or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risks," says hospital psychologist Na Homolce, Martin Korıán.
And that's why an information campaign is needed in the press and especially a negative publicity, specifically the psychologist.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the risk driver.
"If there is a panel installed warning of any danger, it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention to it," Korán warned.
Olmert would return almost all the areas occupied in exchange for peace
The President of the Interim Government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, spoke on the return of virtually all the lands occupied in 1967, namely, Cisjordan, Jerusalem this and the Golan Highs, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
I proposed in the interview that the moon appeared in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we must reimburse almost all the lands (employed) if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"I'm sure we'll stay with a hundred of these lands, but we have to give the Palestinians a hundred like (from the lands of Israel) because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that in the event of a return, this would also include Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want the tractors or excavators to pass over his feet as he passed through one of my best friends, then he will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem," Olmert pointed out about the two July attacks in the city where several dead and dozens of people were wounded.
According to the President, it will be necessary to find "a special solution to the Temple hill, a sacred and historical place" located inside the ancient city.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 220,000 Arabs.
This won't work," he insisted further.
Retirement of the Highs of the Golan
Olmert also spoke of Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Highlands, which from his point of view is an inherent condition to conclude a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also entail concrete efforts by Damascus.
"I do not propose to close peace with Syria only on the basis of the withdrawal of the Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to learn to win the Golan.
They will have to abandon their current relations with Iran, they will have to abandon their relations with the Hizbul (chita movement), they will have to learn from the permanent support of Hamas (chita movement), Al Qaeda (the network of terrorists) and Yihad (Holy War) in Iraq," the first Minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are bus accidents illegal?
The law is unknown, cannot walk on a long-distance bus
In relation to the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency near the Italian city of Padova, the question arises whether the bus can be moved by the bus during the trip.
"If we wish to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activities of the Azafta are contrary to the traffic law," says the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanselka.
The accident in which he died last week at the age of twenty years was clearly caused by the driver of the truck only when the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the less secure location of the vehicle despite having reservations from two other sites.
However, the bus may have an accident or a sudden brake, and at the exact moment when the elevator distributes coffee or newspapers.
Here's what's playing the paper is if the bus is equipped, according to the technical permit, with foot-and-mouth spaces.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
The long-distance buses of Student Agency do not have places to walk, as confirmed by the company's director, Radim Jançura, at Aktualné.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally, this was withdrawn and we agreed that passengers could go to the bathroom while the bus was running if they had seating", he commented.
The elevator doesn't know the law
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the Asaphath - no legal provision makes this function clear.
Not even any legal provision prohibits transport agents from carrying out any service.
The road transport law only knows the term of the vehicle auditor, whose rights and obligations are not defined", adds less specifically, the spokesman Hanzelka.
The Director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorní, is of the opinion that the law adequately addresses this problem.
"It depends on whether the bus has the approval to have foot-and-mouth sites.
That's all," he says.
The buses are divided between the towns, where there are places to be foot and maximum speed, interurban with foot stations with a higher speed permit and long distances without footing, with the highest speed permit and with seating equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, the expert says
The BESSIP security expert, Jaroslav Horín, sees no important problems with the movement of the bus bus.
"In the course of the development of the journey there is not much danger, the situation can be compared to the service in the aircraft.
Even here there is the security that turbulence comes and that the asphalt can be hit in the head."
"However, if the bus suddenly freezes clearly the physical laws are valid.
The same as on a urban bus or on the tram.
The safety of the lift must be resolved by the carrier's internal regulation," he also says, and believes that from the point of view of the law this problem is not solved.
Jančira is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier that offers the elevator service.
He employs hundreds of them.
The Director, not after the accident, considers this work risky.
"However, at the moment you have the impression that the position of the elevator is risky, then I will remove it.
Coffee and newspapers can be received by passengers when they come in.
I'd save even expenses," he says.
In the interest of security, it is the reason that Asians lack azafts in their vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, which runs a small line compared to SA.
"We don't have Asaphs, we've been against them since the beginning.
Before or after this will end in a fatal accident," he said less than a year ago for Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy occurred
In the incident of the line that led to Naples, a young woman from Pilsen who had worked for the company for two years died.
A Slovenian truck that probably drove from the station road blocking the bus. without using the intermittents.
His driver tried in a quick manner to avoid him, however, he shocked with the right side ahead.
Jančira nega that were sold to the two sites that are reserved for the relief of the azafata.
"These sites can't be booked for long-range connections, they're blocked."
The company intends to request the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the verdict on the compensation of the girl's family but also for the financial expenses of the offender.
Law reform?
No, for now
The reform of the law could lead to a greater accuracy on the movement of the azafta in the bus in which 30 experts from a group of the Ministry of Transport have been working for a year.
"However, no concrete conclusion has been reached.
They don't spend too much on buses, but rather on the point system, maximum speed in the bus and use of the mobile during the trip," says expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the Asaphs to be an important threat to passengers' safety," concluded the spokesman Hanzelka, that the control of safety in buses is the competence of the police and the Office of the Safety at Work.
Dusseldorf's hope is supported in Frankfurt
In the letter of the West LB Bank's Board of Directors, there are no great words for its colleagues.
The merger of the Dusseldorf bank units with the DEKA bank can form a central capital market of the financial group of Sparkassen', as the letter says, published on Monday.
The West LB bank, breaking the 'competence block' with sustainable profits capacity would enter such a business.
In addition, such a merger can be a beginning for subsequent mergers in the area of regional banks.
That is how the text is understood when a joint directive wants to show the ability to act in difficult times.
Because just like the West LB was under a huge pressure before.
Not only on the part of the European Union, but also on the Federal Institute for the Monitoring of Financial Services that recently made it clear to the Government of Northern Rhineland that there is little time to find a solution.
It has been a long time since, also from the part of Frankfurt, much has been said about such a union between the DEKA bank, which the customers of Sparkasse know about their investment funds, and the West LB.
In fact, Franz Waas, head of the DEKA bank, presenting the data after a year and a half at the end of August let him know that he sees no sense in the bank's merger, located on Mainzer Street street, with a regional bank such as Helaba or West LB.
But the DEKA Management Board, which is now composed of the regional banks and the Sparkassen associations, has been tasked together with the directive to start negotiations with the West LB on common commercial activities.
This could be a business in the capital market or some parts of it.
Of course, negotiations have just begun, as is stated on the financial site.
It is not the first time that the consolidation in the area of Sparkassen appears the name of the DEKA bank that with its 3,000 partners is among the most important companies on the Francfort financial site.
In 2003 the situation seemed to be so that the DEKA bank could merge with the regional bank of Renania-Palatinate and Helaba.
This initiative to create a union of three parties was without results.
As soon as plans were made public, the Government of Hesse expressed opposition to Helaba's participation in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the regional bank of the Renania-Palatinate initiated dialogue with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank.
But it was always played again with the idea of the merger of DEKA bank with other regional banks.
But finally Günther Merl, president of the Helaba's directive meeting, said he was against the plans of co-existence with his bank.
It seems more clear, however, that the Union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
Thus, when the elections of the Bavarian Parliament are going to take place, the BayernLB union with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank could make progress.
For Helaba this is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure continues to increase, Helaba will need the partners to do so.
In the south the bank could only be a young partner, although so far has been much better than the financial crisis that the real estates of Stuttgart and Munich have done.
On the other hand, the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which holds 85 per cent of Helaba, at the beginning of the year, avoided co-existence plans with the West LB.
In any case, only the North LB remains.
But such geostrategic reflections are just one part.
On the other hand, it is the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a commercial model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, so that Deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband has not yet given any answers.
In the end you can decompose the West LB, but that, of course, is not the bank's own desire.
Thus, also in the letter of the Bank's directive, it is said that an attempt would be made to find a complete solution for the whole bank.
As co-existence between individual parts of the bank with the DEKA can be accompanied, that will show time.
The second weekend of Octoberfest is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
For Elena is the first time, for Luca's third or fourth.
But this time, he sees Elena as his bride, and therefore everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, on the side of a 5-litre barrier of Kaiser brand beer is built a huge tiger showing almost 200 participants in Oktoberfest who sound low can produce in his garage.
First Elena gives Luca a mistake, then a kiss.
They came from Bolonia to Verona.
From there, from the parking on the side of the Porta Nova train station, this evening at 23:45 three buses, `Munich direction, the beer party', expected to arrive at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are intended primarily for Italians, a bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the parking corners on the side of its flag are singing the Americans, they have already begun to celebrate the night.
With a lot of noise, Marco Guarda says, which is nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial skin hole and gloves with silver-colored panties, belongs to these buses.
For five years they have come to Oktoberfest, bearing in mind that there are only three excursions this year.
From night on the way there, during the day at noon, at 22.30 a.m.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the reception of welcome with a Kaiser beer that was made under the law of the purity of Bavaria, disease insurance and guide in Germany- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
By night the buses are already on their way to the bus station with the "Brenner" address.
There's no brain, not yet.
Soon the queen's quiet on the bus, the passengers are sleeping.
All right, they'll still need the strength.
It takes Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with the Italian matrice take another break in the 8th car just before Munich.
Finally, when Marco's group has the planned arrival at 6.30 p.m. in the parking area on the side of the Prado de Teresa, there are about 50 other buses all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his last talk on how to proceed.
First: Put on a yellow dress.
There, from the left is written "Oktoberfest", on the left hand side is the page of Marco's travel office on the Internet: "conoscersivajdo.it".
Second: "When the doors of the campaign shop are opened, that means march!" cried Marco in the morning.
"Mark!" mark and take the back places in the campaign shop.
"Don't take the front seats, because we're going to block, and don't all of you sit in the same bathroom, distributed throughout the space!"
A beer litre, red Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the property
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
Just get out of his place, he'll be busy!"
Third: "This afternoon exactly the 10th and the average you have to come here!" Have you understood?
And now they're all going to October.
One, to mark the way, to the yellow mountains in the trees, traffic signals and even in a cartel of the elections of a large People's Party of Bavaria.
You want to be able to recognize the path behind you.
It is the second weekend of Octoberfest known as "the weekend of the Italians"
There are no accurate data on the number of people; it is estimated that 50,000 people travel on the Alps and are in the process of torture, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend in Italy.
Munich police receive assistance from seven police officers from the autonomous province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers assist the Red Cross in making a statistics for the present nations, where Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, are in front of the English (about 60 assistance) and Austrians are taking the lead.
The Italian campaign's favorite store is so called Hofbräzelt.
Nights without sleep for believers in the Real Estate Hypo
Germany's banking system is relatively stable, emphasised only last week by federal finance minister Peter Steinbrück.
Well, that policy would use the word "relatively" and added that the German banking area would also be affected by critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), Munich's real estate fund, which is co-financed in the DAX index, receives from a group of German banks a billion credit to be able to withstand turbulence on the market.
Monday a person who knows the situation very well said to Reuters: credit aid amounted to EUR 35 billion.
The part of the capital that the Real State Hypo is going to use has to throw interest.
Money comes from private banks as well as from public law.
The cause is the losses of the Defa branch.
According to one report, state funding for long-term projects has been financed only for a short period of time - which is now due to market mistrust.
In the first half of the year, the bank's capital reserve actually fell by a 95 per cent, EUR 2.37 million, and the share of the capital itself decreased slightly from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
In comparison with the same period last year, the continued income of financial investments and net profits of financial operations fell to zero, the income of taxpayers and some securities also decreased from the resolution of the provision of credit businesses by more than 70 per cent, in EUR 5 million.
Only in the light of the high and high revenues from the reimbursement of the costs of restructuring of the former Defa group as well as the reimbursement of interest under the federal tax code and the business organised for the companies of the corporation, the negative balance could lead to a deficit of approximately 16 per cent more.
After its privatization in 1990 the former state finance at the beginning was lost in speculations with industrial credits for the real estate, which served as a reason for the establishment of the Aerial Bank.
As much money could not be gained with the financing of state projects, the Defa began to devote itself intensively to projects in the area of infrastructure and the financing of Community projects by private investors as well as state (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and was diversified.
Now, the Real Estate Hypo has to make amortizations about the value of the branch that will have a "significant material effect" on the consolidated account of the group's losses and gains, it is said very precisely.
It's a fact that dividends have canceled.
By 2007 they had been cancelled to two thirds.
Following the acquisition of the Defa, the Real State Hypo became an important state and financial financial asset in the area of infrastructure.
As the bank does not have customer deposits, it, compared to other banks, becomes more dependent on the refinancing in the interbank market.
With the collapse of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, what happened two weeks ago, the grant of interbank loans was essentially low because banks were saving their liquidity.
Each year, the Real Estate Hypo needs nearly 50 billion euros to finance a portion of the Defa credit cards of its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the report of Hypo Real Estate, the bank covers with a credit the need to finance the group for a short time and the company is assured that "the influence of international monetary markets which are now largely inadequate to operate"
Other sources say that, thanks to this money, refinancing is guaranteed by the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, president of the Hypo Real Estate Directive, explained that the Real Estate Group would not need the monetary markets for the foreseeable time.
The German Central Bank and the Federal Financial Services Monitoring Institute (BaFin) are based on the fact that the competitiveness of the Real Estate Group has since been ensured.
That must be expected by shareholders and bank creditors.
But because of the dynamics and the impotence of the crisis, there is no consistency.
It is even imagined that no funding should be required in its full volume.
But the opposite case cannot be excluded.
I would vote that the bank was still almost insolvent in the last hour of the Sunday, so temporary salvation can also not be comforted by the least concerned people.
The share price fell to 75 per cent, EUR 3.30.
In contrast, loan courses are really good.
While the priority debt is almost unchanged, the rates of loans according to the position in the property register are clearly below.
The loans of the former Württemberg Hypo branch are particularly affected and for the sake of their 2009 profits.
Following the remarkable growth in the banking crisis and the acquisition of the Defa that affected the Real State Hypo State, the current value of its loans that were previously an investment for speculation must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While embassies, governments and small-scale banks are still ready to support the system, they can therefore come from the amortisation of pensions within a period of time.
Or it's going to happen, something that doesn't make sense to anyone -- the financial crisis will be over in the next 15 months.
But when we saw the cross-reported news on partial status, the security that is already at its limit became a justified hope.
That will be a reason, because believers will spend the night without sleep, breaking their heads on the decision on their isolation of enthusiasm.
In the short term investors can still put the end point and use the transport to re-account for losses for future taxable benefits on change in the future.
Sylvana and Bent's secrets?-Box
When the first day of Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to appear at the Tachibana High School, the girls began to cry: "The German is completely "kawaii!"
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on the exchanges she has in Japan.
"The first day at a college in Japan.
I felt nervous.
I was afraid before I went to college.
I live on the Tokyo border in Kawasaki direction and train 40 minutes to Tachibana High School.
I just had to find the way, I'm lucky I didn't lose.
It seems that the beginning of the classes has not been set as strictly as in my home in Baja Sajonia.
From eight in the morning the students came, at least nine began a small meeting with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before I started the class, I was moved to introduce myself.
Besides, I'm not a person who speaks very well in public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform, they put me a poor old lady of my family host and also a blouse, blue calcettes and black leather shoes.
So, this dress put me in the pocket and tried to pronounce everything in the right way: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - I'm called Sylvana, I'm from Germany, and in a week I'll be my maids.
At this point he was very happy because he had started to study this language for two years.
All 31 girls in the class have slipped, refused and made signs and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew my Mangas.
That belongs to the Japanese girl survival vocabulary and means "Mona, beautiful"
Then I quickly disappeared from my place.
The girl on the side had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was quite quiet, but when I heard the gong, I really felt so excited.
Everyone spoke at the same time and asked many questions - at the same time it was very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then in the rehearsal, everyone took out his Bentos.
The mother of my host family also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something else that fat German bread pieces.
It had rice with herbs, small sauces, pepper salad and algae, fruit and something like meat in Tofu mass.
In most cases, I have no idea what it is like here in Japan.
Things are rare and have a new taste.
What's sure is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of marinated surgeons in the salt, buff!
In Japanese schools the windows are not just a lunch.
Sometimes a girl prepares a Bent made very artisticly for a boy and is given in hopes of getting to know him better during a recreation.
About that law in my Manga-Comics.
I'm very curious to see if I can see it here too.
"Why exactly Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
Then he always answered:
"Well, because I'm fascinating."
Finally, years ago I prefer to read Mangas.
To understand the comics and culture better, one day I began to study some Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I'm going to travel there.
Also because I have a bottle of tradition and customs.
Here they have a great value.
On the other hand, Japan is a country of latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is a strong, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I still haven't felt lost here even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen in my life."
The rats also have feelings.
It's said that a rat or a cucara feels the danger of flying, why has he also been afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology, is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can they be controlled if they behave in a similar way to us, feel the same way?
In an Internet magazine called "Edge" has been published for many years by famous scientists.
SPIELL ONLINE presents in a series the selected answers to the question What do you think is truth without being able to prove it?
I believe that animals have feelings and other consciousness states without me or anyone else being able to prove it until now, although we can not even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can wait for it because all human brains present the same basic configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include questions about sensation and general awareness, we enter the unknown area because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same as the other animals: he dies, steals or attacks.
People behave similarly, as some scientists draw conclusions on comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to contact our subjective experience with animals.
First, almost always include circuits associated with the human consciousness of the pre-frontal lobula lateral cortex brain (because of their participation in the short memory and the executive functions leading to conduct).
This broad part is much more developed in the case of people than those of other primates and it seems absolutely lacking in other creatures.
Taking into account at least the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the pre-frontal lobula of brain cortex, including the knowledge about whom we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man is different from other primates.
Another particularity is found in man's linguistic nature: As most of his experience is combined with language, this often means that conscience depends on him.
In this case animals may be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created anyway, would differ in many cases from most of our consciousness states.
So it's hard to explain how the conscience of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is not to be measured because it has special hardware, nor is it to be analysed through our experiences, so your research presents great problems to us.
Most of my interventions refer to the content of conscious experience, but at the same time there is another aspect of consciousness that would have to be easier for scientific research.
Animal awareness processes could be investigated without taking into account their contents, and that is what happens during short-term memory studies, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, it is more important to the neutral correlations of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both can be similar or not.
Curiously, this approach highlights the importance of the pre-frontal lobula of brain cortex for the formation of visualization.
And what's the result of that for the sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain is responsible for that, the same thing that happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a mental state in which we are when the activity of the brain occupys an area of the defense system (or its consequences, for example, the reactions of the body).
In view of this point of view, the sensations are very fixed by brain courting what distinguishes from primates and, above all, man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature, we continue to classify the final feelings because we can distinguish and classify states with the help of words and grammar so that we can describe the states of others as well as ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damasco, on the other hand, believes that the sensations come from the simple activities of the parts of the brain cortex responsible for the body's feelings and the spinal cord, the same is thought to be Jaak Pankseep, but focuses more on the brain.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can be absolutely referring to different types and feelings.
For theoretical reasons I can't go against that, but I don't think so.
Pakzeep argues that what rats and men feel like fear, perhaps it feels in two cases as well: But how can you control if rats and men behave similarly feel the same?
When you see the danger of a bird bird, why are you afraid?
I am of the opinion that the pattern of behavior still does not prove the pattern of experience.
That's true that neuronal comparison helps: rats and men have similar convulsions, the opposite shells do not have at least one brain.
Is it the trunk of the head what is responsible for sensations?
Even when it is possible to test it for men: How can it be tested in the case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also cocachas (who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't know how to try it.
I would like to investigate the emotional behavior of rats and emotional sensations because their feelings are supposedly different from ours (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected as much as it is measured by rats and men.
As I do not invest in the language and consciousness of rats, as well as feelings, I don't know if they exist.
You can say I don't see any more out of my noses, but I prefer to keep working without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA Platini President: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Ivan Wasjunik, the Deputy Prime Minister, said that preparations would soon take place under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as evidence of Ukraine's confidence in the ability to organize the European Championship together with Poland," said Wasjunik.
"But that is not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and there is much to do in both countries."
The time for the construction and reconstruction of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is at hand.
The number of stations is likely to be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We now have to work very fast," said the president of an association Ukraine Grigorij Surkis.
"The UEFA will not remove our eyes."
A more radical step was taken in Poland.
Following numerous scandals, the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish PZPN association and replaced it by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that PZPN is unable to follow the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA Platini's president that preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer."
Only in the last period were many clubs of the first division convicted for manipulating the lower category, and the division council had to be postponed.
Inflamed Dennis Quaid's contraction
She wanted to promote a new film, talked in an interview about private life - and had problems with her ex-wife: Hollywood Meg Ryan's star designed her ex-wife as an adult.
If you're jealous and you're attacked.
The recent war of the two roses in the former pair of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: eight years after their divorce, the two actors in Hollywood publicly show an unpleasant struggle between them.
Last week in an interview with the U.S. magazine InStyle Meg Ryan was the first time he said about the reasons for the marriage failure: "Dennis was very unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She claims the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for revealing private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story of the failure of a marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his appointment as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is "I hear that Meg has stories of our relationship in another version," said 54-year-old man to "New York Daily News".
Among other things, it's very "relative" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, again "will recall in public the pain and changes, all that means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan lives alone after divorce, Quaid is newly married and recently is a father of twins.
And so it ended with its statements saying: "No matter how my life continues.
I'm happy because I have a wonderful family that's good."
Air tickets and hotels are low
In the first half of 2008 aviation tickets and overnight nights in Europe were cheaper compared to last year.
According to a current study, airplane tickets in Germany were made cheap even up to 50 percent.
The air tickets and hotel pernoctations were re-valued - this is the result of a study by the travel service provider and the American Express financial services.
The company has analysed its reservation data for the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter has been significantly changed in the second half.
After many years in the hotel market prices continued to rise, overnight nights in many places became cheap.
In comparison with last year, between January and March prices in 41 of the 48 different cities of Europe increased by an average of 6.9 per cent.
From April to June prices were down to 3.6 percent compared to last year.
The trends were more noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to the American Express, the reason for this was the course of a weak dollar, which was the reason that "the interest of American tourists on their journey has decreased."
The decrease in hotel prices is also noted much more in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hannóver, Colonia or Stavanger.
In the city of Norway, hotel prices increased by 26.3 percent and thus hit a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, air ticket prices also showed high trends:
Due to an increase in the prices of kerosene, the passengers of the Economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-range flights even made up to 29.2 per cent more expensive.
From April to June, the prices of the tickets in the Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, were medium to 12.5 percent, but the price changes for the Business and First Class were small.
In Germany the price change was more significant than in other European countries:
From January to February prices increased to 11.9, and the second half dropped to 23.6 percent.
According to one study, prices for national flights in Germany even reduced to half.
The cause of price change is partly the increase in the flow economy, explains the company.
In many parts of the airline travel market, demand is under way.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies Treaty which liberalises the traffic between the United States and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profit flights in airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared in summer - only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV won against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburg SV becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borusia is still not going to make the decommissioning gol.
Christopher Klein well presented the forced landing of the national election player Marko Martin.
Gladbach's player started playing late and failed to make a hole.
All I wanted to say is by reacting exactly to what happened, if I could clearly read it from his lips.
I just knew I was right.
"We need a second gol," said Hermann Rieger at the entrance of the hall of Hamburg.
I don't miss anything special in the catacombs, the rest time is over and most of those present were back in their places.
Rieger was almost three decades of HSV's physiotherapy, enjoying a great reputation as one of those who formed a part of the group.
That is why his request was noted by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol, the assistant coach, sat down with his head and raised his fingers in a seat belt.
Cornelius is Martin Jol's brother, the main trainer in Hamburg.
His order was the same: Come on, the second gol!
But that wasn't done.
"Today it wasn't all nice to see," added Marcell Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhard also wanted to have him "more relaxed."
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) with its head impact; and also the situation that Gladbach's team was very weak could not show all its strength to the weak team of Hamburg.
"That was a sushi victory," said Martin Jol summarily.
This month the Hamburg SV will meet its 121 years.
The Sabbath will be the spectators had already celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the stadium and the change of the table on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to interpret it," said Marcell Jansen.
It is intended that the partial classifications of the table correspond more to the validity of the link than to the domination of its HSV.
The chip with its mandatory players late, such as the Neves and Silva Brazilians, the Petric Goller as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to join, but the chip can still not shine with its success.
"We need more of the feeling and of the dribling," demanded Jol.
After the vote
Fear spreads on Wall Street.
The first news about the failure of the bank rescue package left down some time the Down Jones to 700 points.
That was the loss of the biggest points for one day in his history.
After the Dow Jones recovered a little.
Over 20:30, one of the world's most important pool barometers cost a deficit of 5 percent in 10,579 units.
Nasdaq, the electronic share market, lost more than seven percent and remained at 1548 points.
At this point the biggest loss in the Dow Jones was American Express that lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of nearly 12 percent.
No title could be won.
The Goldmann Sachs bank's shares were almost 10 percent lost.
Just a few days ago a large investor Warren Buffet had participated financially in the company.
The rescue plan provides for the provision of resources to purchase so-called “podrids” mortgage actions.
But the sum will be paid by strike but step by step.
As a compensation for this, the State has to receive an option of action for financial associations that can be taken during the course of development to reduce the financial burden of the state's box.
Action courses in Europe and in the United States continue to decline
The aid of billions for banks in Europe and the United States does not silence investors.
The course of the actions of the German Grand Bank Hypo Real Estate is low and has negative influence on the Dax.
Despite the saving of the state-wide financial market, the US Dow Jones index continues to fall.
The losses of the speculative actions of the Real Estate and Commercial Bank caused the fall of the German index (Dax) in a large deficit.
Despite the rescue actions of the federal government and private banks, Munich's real estate fund has lost two-thirds of its value for a period of time, the Comerzbank has lost more than 20 per cent.
The Dax clearly fell below the psychological limit of 6,000 points and suffered a 3.7 percent deficit in 5.839 units.
Financial markets all over the world suffered a fall.
The opening of Wall Street's day in New York began with significant losses.
Investors fear that the savings package of $700 billion from the US government will not be sufficient to boost financial markets.
In the first hour after the opening the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to remain at 10.809.25 points.
The United States Chamber of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue project, the vote in session could be the first of October.
The other European balls also knew only one trend: at the beginning of the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 per cent, CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, the main Japanese index of Nikkei after benefits fell by 1.26 percent to 11.743,61 units.

After announcement of capital expansion, Arkandor's actions were lost in the MDax.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim signed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the commercial and tourist association announced that the participations in Thoms Cook would not be sold.
Dark matter affects the trajectory of space probes
For many years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion among researchers: the Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to manoeuvre.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity cannot be so correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" went on for almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel tubes are now heating up a death threat in the cold.
Over the years a mysterious phenomenon, anomaly during gravitational assistance to manoeuvre, causes confusion among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a manoeuvre of the trajectory of space probes while they get acceleration using the energy of the gravity field of a planet, for example Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as well as the Sun Ulysses probe did.
But what surprises researchers for many years: Missiles do not behave 100 percent as expected under the gravitational law.
Rather, they are often irregular at speeds.
The probes are improvised at higher or lower speeds.
The physicists could not explain this effect until now.
He was called anomaly during gravitational assistance to manoeuvre.
Some experts fear that possibly even the general theory of Albert Einstein's Relativity that describes the attraction force of the matter by the curvature of space cannot be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the U.S. Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton's Institute of Physical Science, believes strongly now as before Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during the gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Astronomers in the universe.
"The reason for the anomaly can be the Dark Matter that can also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
Researchers in the universe know the existence of the Dark Matter for only ten years.
It supposedly has the attraction force and its influence can be observed on other planets.
The Dark Matter, on the other hand, is completely invisible which means that it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientific calculations, the Dark Matter makes at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy confirmed, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, the stolen tourists in Egypt must be released.
Sudan's kidnappers had demanded millions of ransoms.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during the release.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the ransom have already begun.
The Germans always fall again at the point of attention of the kidnappers.
Wellt Online reported on the most important cases.
In view of the fact that European tourists kidnapped in Sahara are free.
The same information is available on State Egypt television, Arab television station Al-Arabia and Italian media.
After news of liberation at the Italian station Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, confirmed the liberation: "Our citizens and other Queens are free.
"Now we control your health," Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian followers are well and are in security, informing Egypt State television.
The 19 participants in the expedition in the desert are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the release of the hostages: According to Egyptian security guard's descriptions, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudan army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with the ransom," said the guard.
It was just "receiving the reindeer" when suddenly it came to "this surprise."
On Sunday the Sudanese soldiers have killed six kidnappers and two of them have been detained in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have asked Germany for a ransom in the amount of EUR six million; the money had to be given to the German wife of one of the Queens.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that liberation was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of its security.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release women's pensions after they have received the ransom.
The men had to remain in custody until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take the position on this report.
Father's abuse led to suicide.
According to the court, years of abuse by his father led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, from Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after he admitted eight innocent assault charges.
The Royal Court of Truro, through an inaugural study, knew that he had regularly attacked his daughter Stephanie Randle when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession paper: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court knew that Ms. Randle had been murdered in her home of Mutley in Plymouth on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
At the time that the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to catch her and sell her eyes before carrying out her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to Cornwall.
His daughter was transferred to Plymouth.
However, the court knew that Mrs. Randle, who had spent much of her time working as a volunteer for the National Trust, was shocked by the abuse she had suffered twice a week.
In 2006, the tax collector Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some friends of Mrs. Rande had said about her, who, after being a big surfer and cyclist, now seemed "emotionally dead", as if she had "refused to life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terraza Randle, found the dead woman in his apartment in Plymouth.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced his daughter's father, who wrote a confession letter that concluded: "I often drew her and beat her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetisher, and for his victim it must have been a terrible experience, especially when I was only seven years old.
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim leaving his own life.
Even more obvious, if she had not done so, the question probably wouldn't have ended in the courts."
And he added: "I have noted the effect that according to the description made by Stephanie's father and mother the abuse was on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a future promising, successful and happy."
An official loaded for data loss
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet officer who forgot some secret documents on the train in June would be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on his way to work by the Ministry of Defence, left two highly classified documents on the train for Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being sent to the police.
It is certainly the least serious charge under the law and does not provide any indication of the intention to commit a crime.
The BBC correspondent for Defence Frank Gardner said that the trial had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is loaded under section 8.1 of the Act, the information protection clause.
The Royal Legal Service noted that the staff member should be charged by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of its work in the Secret Service Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information on Al-Qaeda and the capacity of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and then transferred from his home to a secret place.
Construction companies face the price of B&B
In Britain, construction companies could face a price of more than 80,000 pounds after the rescue / rescue of Bradford and Bingley banks.
In fact, the Government provided 14 billion pounds to protect the deposits of 2.6 million bank robbers.
Interest in the loan will be paid by all companies using the savings money, including 59 construction companies.
The Director-General of the Association of Construction Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers that companies and their members must pay
The 14 billion loan should be reimbursed as soon as Bradford and Bingley's mortgages are reimbursed.
However, the interests of the whole are charged annually to the 700 financial companies that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that 59 construction companies were included in that number.
It is humiliating for institutions that have acted wisely ... to be called to pay today the price of institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is said that each company had to pay in proportion to bank deposits, and that mediation companies had to pay about 18 per cent of the cost.
The treasure estimates that the interest on the loan will rise to 450 billion pounds in 2009.
This means that companies will have to recover 81 billion pounds to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Trade Association of Construction Companies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
"It is humiliating for institutions that have acted wisely in the growth of the real estate market to be called upon to pay the price produced by those who were far less prudent."
According to BSA, there are no data indicating the failure of some company since 1945.
"We will need to examine all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction companies and their members against what might be a relevant price," said Mr. Cole.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year until March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of demanding interests, which can be almost twice as many.
As mutual organizations and without shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through greater rates or lower interests in their savings.
The price of milk up to five pounds per litre
The inhabitants of Jersey Street will have to pay more for their milk.
Journal Jersey Dairy has announced that the highest price of milk products will increase by an extra five thought the litre since next month.
It is the second increase in this year's price, after an increase of two thought in February and after the investigations carried out by a consulting company.
Traders can decide for themselves whether they want to apply price increases for their customers.
The last time the maximum milk price had been increased before February, it was in 2002.
Negated freedom under the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladeshi court has rejected the request for freedom under bail for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she can be taken to prison when she returns to her country.
His advocates said that the court did not grant him freedom under bail accusing him of exorcising 50 million taka ($729,700) to a businessman when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of the various allegations of corruption on your part.
His long-term political rival, Khaleda Zia, was set free at the beginning of this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but her party, the League of Awami, has demanded that the country's government, supported by military support, grant her first full freedom.
Correspondents say that while he was granted conditional freedom to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is not clear now what the terms of his release are or whether he will be able to remain free when he returns to Bangladesh.
Their lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the request for freedom under jail for Sheikh Hasina claiming that he could not obtain freedom under trial because he was already being treated abroad under conditional freedom," his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We are going to make an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court."
Her defenders argued that she needed freedom under bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to her homeland after 17 October, according to a leader of the Awami League last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the interim government, supported by the army, took power, but she was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all the charges they are charged with.
Fears for the campaign against polymyelitis in Afghanistan
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan - says the United Nations - have not been able to benefit from a recent anti-poliomyelitis vaccination campaign because of the violence of the Taliban.
Last week the United Nations launched a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach children in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
One United Nations spokesman said that it happened despite the promises made by the Taliban that would not have attacked or hampered thousands of staff while performing vaccinations.
BSkyB lost legal challenge in ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competence Commission after the decision to force the company to reduce its participation in the radio broadcast ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Competition Appeals Tribunal that it will have to reduce its participation by 17.9 per cent in ICT below 7.5 per cent.
Previously, the Commission said that BSkyB's interests hampered competition and allowed its negative influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock package in 2006 in an agreement that actually blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, by buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti Monopolio Office reported that the acquisition of ICT participation by BSkyB had raised doubts about the independence of ITV, and urged the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All, including Virginia's chief, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Offcom regulator were opposed to the purchase.
BSkyB commented that the obligation to reduce its ITV package was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly because BSkyB said, it would have delivered its voting rights.
New investigation into the commission of U.S. lawyers
The U.S. Attorney-General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the disappearance of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Director-General of the Department of Justice criticized the conduct of administrative staff.
The report criticised the staff of the White House, the legislators and former Producator General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether the investigators questioned during the investigation have lied to researchers in an attempt to impede justice.
"Greece complaints of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," said Prosecutor General Glenn Bellas in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. lawyers were removed from their duties by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the Department had made the decision suggesting that lawyers had been fired by low performance.
But later it was assumed that lawyers had not been evaluated worse than others, and many observers concluded that the expulsions would be motivated for political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked in the persecution of some Republicans, members of a high profile of the Congress, while others had refused to investigate the allegations of electoral fraud against Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute judicial cases for the government
and may be dismissed at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The Deputy Chief of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure by the delegates, gave up his position.
A certain number of other officials of the Department of Justice did the same.
The report of the Attorney-General is very critical of the role played by Mr. Gonzales in the matter, and underlines how he had a "primary responsibility" for the dissidents, who "abdicated" his leadership position and was "notably uncooperative" in the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, former Bush collaborator, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf with great honor
The rock Meat Loaf star will be honored in the Q Awards for its epic charm Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will collect the special prize next week at the ceremony that will take place in London, said that gaining this recognition would be "an honor".
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album with which Meat Loaf graduated in 1977.
The Coldplay group is taking applications for this year's awards and making the classification of the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that convey time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires excellent vocal ability like that used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the nest.
The song was first known as a single in the United Kingdom in 1979 and became number 15.
However, Bat Out Of Hell of Meat Loaf stayed for some nine years in the classifications and came to sell over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including surgery for her cardiac arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
Later, it appeared that I had a taste in his vocal cord.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
New York City has thousands of adventures, blubbers, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply service.
However, many people, including Veteran taxis and local residents, find it difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends to the North of the First Calle – before I found the Second Calle – between the Bowery and the Second Avenue.
This chalketite, more than 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, is similar to a powdery challeon more than an active route.
There's no signs.
It's practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings in the First Calle
who wants to repatriate Extra Place and create a clean walk to shops and shops that are expected to be opened in the new buildings.
Other admirers include the neighbors of the old date who commented on being in love with the stolen car just because it is one of the last remains of the block's past before the fitting of the buildings.
However, the Department of Housing, Conservation and Development of the City, which has control of the road, has no interest in owning it.
At the meeting of the Committee on the Environment for the Use of the Land that took place this month, representatives of the Avalon Agency outlined a proposal to buy the road.
However, the Committee, having preferred that the road remain in the city, requested a new plan to be presented next month, as Susan Stetzer, the district manager of the Community, said n.3.
"The city is owned today by very few spaces and we would like to continue to own Extra Place," said Mrs.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage space, but we also want to ensure public access to the road."
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that he wanted to repair the small street and install seats, including some to be used as coffee, in the hope of renting the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street came up for the first time during this month's meeting
But Michele de Milly, a lawyer from Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, she didn't necessarily want to own it.
"Avalon Bay's primary concern is the renewal of this abandoned village and the possibility of turning it into a public area," he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation Committee, confirmed that it was a city's desire to sell the street and noted that the agency's mission was the development of the property rather than its management.
Compared to its more colorful surroundings, those of the Bowery, Extra Place, have left a hole in history.
Some believe that he got his name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's great estate plot was divided among his children, and this tight-franch of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the Punk Rock monument that was closed in 2006, opened in Extra Place, but the street is probably best known for the photograph of the establishment going out on the cover of the Ramones "Rocket in Russia".
"The environment was wonderful," commented Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothing and pieces of barrels, boxes, sheets, boxes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about East Village's detention, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, even modest ones, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, virtually unchanged, a kingdom of the city that should be protected.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Biterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a story of the city's history on Extra Place, published by The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a little tight and without exit, also dark for the day and marked by hot iron storage doors and anti-windows, with old magazines of weeks covered along the canals."
With few exceptions, the road seemed more or less the same in a recent afternoon.
A rat was fed through the back of the street and stopped at the door that was used to enter the CBGB and that is now hosting a luxury dress shop.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty 22-oz beer bottle were close to a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some passengers said that they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but they suggested that a cleanup could be given to him.
Mr. Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the road in their current state.
"I've spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, wet and dry places."
The debate on bilingualism: interference in English
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old associate in studies on California and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Calling Spanish voters effectively is a difficult business.
The educational proposals made by Barack Obama are an example of that.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that "Americans and Latin students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," and this is a very clear consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama's education plan specifically advocates, among other things, "the bilingual education of transition" for English students.
However, the open question for Mr Obama is whether the commitment to bilingual education, which prefers instruction in different languages in English, is effective in eliminating distance in final results.
Take, for example, Six Street Prep, a primary school officially recognized in the eastern region of the Los Angeles county.
In this school the vast majority of students are Spanish and family with low income:
more than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are learning English.
However, an amazing 100 per cent of students in the fourth year have been positively evaluated in the 2008 math review.
and almost an equally amazing 93 percent has dominated the English and arts language test.
This amazing success has been achieved using a different ingredient that Mr. Obama preferred.
The Six Street School stresses the review and practice, the constant assessment of competences and does not tolerate any attitude of apology.
In addition, and here is where Mr Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the head of the Sixth Calle, the focus of the school for instruction in English to students is on "total immersion".
Entering into English means the almost exclusive use of language in the treatment of the content of instruction.
Ms. Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, said to me, "We've had extraordinary success with students like this last one that has arrived from Mexico and that, if you entered the school 12 months later, you wouldn't be able to collect what it was."
"It works," he said, "we believe it works."
Will Mr Obama take a school as Sixth Street Prep as a model for replaying other schools with large Spanish-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of the politicians of their party on the subject of education (the Associations for National Education have been long-term advocates of bilingual education) and their own constant support for bilingual education conceals the forecast of Mr. Obama's response.
While immigrants should learn English recently, Mr Obama has been triviating the issue by allowing people to stop worrying about the legislation that is only written in English.
and instead, he said, "You must make sure that your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close the gap, he should consider carefully the models of education that work well, rather than despise them or triviate them.
The price of oil falls sharply after renewed economic fears
Petroleum prices are drastically reduced this month due to the concern that the US recovery plan for financial markets may not be able to re-activise the economy.
Heavy oil operations decreased by 7 per cent, reaching $99.80 in the morning negotiations in New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has been down by more than $20 per barrel since last month.
In the last two weeks, the basic product markets have been overcome by the financial crisis in Wall Street and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had fallen to almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before retracing again, because of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
The anxiety came from investors, once again, Monday, despite the leaders of Congress who said they had reached an agreement during the weekend on the rescue plan, the biggest in history.
The news was shaken by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The developments that took place in the last episode of the merger process confirm that Citigroup will buy the bank operations of the Wachovia Corporation, as the government said this Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the Fortis European financial conglomerate.
Analysts in Barclays Capital said that, at the end of the week, negotiations led to the rescue agreement "they seemed unable to re-activise market sense."
As the economic situation deteriorates, the demand for basic products, including oil, is expected to decline.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rate and change will be increasingly focused," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that basic products cannot escape this contamination.
From the product perspective, our most pressing concern is the assessment whether the American virus will spread worldwide and specifically to China. "
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for the next year, such as oil consumption due to the crisis in economic growth and the forecast of a reduction in oil and gas prices is 20 per cent for 2009.
Second living room: equipment sets record
After having spent, during the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in the Jets uniform, playing defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he saw how things developed in the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets transformed a game without annotation into a game of self-defence.
"I've never seen anything like that," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Cardinals Arizona had played with pears under the clouds' shadows.
At this point it happened that the quarterback Brett Favre met Laveranues Cole with a target of 12 yards and suggested the perfect preposition for one evening, in which the development of relationship between players had a great leap forward.
Favre found Cole for two more targets in the room, one of these when a cornerback fell and the other arrived 10 seconds in the middle.
"I won't get out of my way," said Favre of all the steps that go to Cole.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people can think of."
While Favre and Coles were engaged in the arrest, the Cardinals' defense was ill-treated by the Quarterback Kurt Warner.
The Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a shooting and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith pointed to another move and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was obliged to miss Warner.
In the last turn, the shortcomings required by Bowens could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken the possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the balloon, Jay Feely gave him a 20-yard path to win a final 34-0.
It's the biggest points the Jets never did in a room.
To the team trainer, Eric Mangini, ask you to describe the speech of this moment, he said, "The second room or the third room?"
When he answered both of them - the Jets allowed 21 points without response in the third room - Mangini said: "I can say I liked the second room much more than the terror.
They won a lot of points in a very short period of time."
Gebrssellasie relaxes its world record
Once again, Haile Gebrsselassie of Ethiopia has demonstrated that many consider him the greatest runner of history, exceeding his own world record in Berlin's marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person to run the 26.2 miles race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After the victory in the long-distance career at 2:03:59, Gebrsselassie destroyed for 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has established world record number 26 in a career of an impressive length so that he has established a global champion or world record for any distance, from the opposite course to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie has not taken part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarming, retrospective - that air pollution will aggravate its problems with asthma.
Instead, he was about to run to Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - sunny and with 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrsellassie won this Sunday, using in the medium term some shorts 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Targat from Kenya have become long distances, the marathon record has been reduced in more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa de Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the victory last Sunday, Gebrselassie told journalists that she had suffered in the pantoroll two weeks ago and that she had lost a week of training.
Clearly, the suspension left him fresh, not oxidated.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselasie told the journalists.
"It was all perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I have some doubts, but at last everything was fine."
The athlete has been subjected to some criticisms - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's afro-oriental rival - for the style of orchestrating too much of its careers, in general, avoiding encountering many stars of the world marathon, based on the marks as if it were a career track, and putting them in front of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not reduce the size of Gebrsselassie's skills as a runner.
This Sunday, at the start of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached the middle of the race at 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, started challenging Gebrsellassie after their brands fell.
But shortly before three miles of the target, Gebrselassie took a last push to separate from Kwambai, who ended up at 2:05:36, improving his best personal record for almost five minutes.
Kamati arrived at the third place at 2:07:48.
In the women's career, Irina Mikitenko, native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh time in history.
Paula Radcliffe from Great Britain has the world record at 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36 years old, was a surprise and won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She also did not participate in the Beijing Games as described as an injury in the back, but she recovered to win Berlin and set up her best personal record in almost five minutes on the third marathon she ran.
He made an intelligent calculation career, leaving a quarter of Kenyan runners and Ethiopians to make heads and then recovering them after 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won the second place at 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third at 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and proof of the life of color
Hidden by the expansion of the park on the theme of the great Orlando, just a few kilometres from the bright, noisey and colosal city, there is a quiet village, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are very evident.
Eatonville, the first city completely inhabited by blacks incorporated into the country and place of Zora Neale Hurston's childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three fields of croquet, 300 colored men, 300 good navigators, many Guayabas, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fairy in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Rebirth.
And in many ways, however, the city she described – making it also a tourist phase by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Federal Writers Project of the period of depression – continues to be a separate place.
The city remains independent, honorable and private as it was in the '30s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often refused to share their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us and doesn't know what's going on."
Even now, in the year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called for attention to start a dialogue on the subject of race, many continue to be cautious in front of the desert.
"We are very careful about how our history is counted," said Jones Hortense, 59 years old, a resident of all life and member of the oldest church in the city.
"You must be right."
Eatonville has always been defined as a triumphal parade and struggle.
At the same time, it is a historical model of the assertion of blacks and a community of nearly 2,400 people living under a double level of poverty in the national media.
It is a literary center, but it is also a well-repared example of the rural culture of the South black - sometimes disappointed, others praised - that was a nation of slavery in America.
It's not strange if those who live here are always proud and reserved.
And the concern about Eatonville's image really began by Zora, as no one here calls it Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her birth city to the world through her deep books in dialect such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes We Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in Florida's guide turned the city, just outside of Route 17, a road that runs through the center of Florida often forgotten to the history of the blacks and the human drama.
Having both the face of cement in life and in literature, Mrs. Hurston led his readers to the property store of the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Out of the road to the left hand," he wrote, "there's the modern public school marón with its white ends, its well maintained gardens and playgrounds, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can only read and write."
She also mentions the new husband of the Dash widow and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and everything goes with transitional rooms."
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Mrs. Hurston is referring to Eatonville with the autonomous government, but also with analphabetism, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor didn't.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the picture.
"Now he described it as it was," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the daughters of Johnson that Mrs. Hurston immortalized by quoting men singing colourless songs about her beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like that."
Ms. Hurston is still remembered here as a living eccentric who returned frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77 years old, recalls that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did it without warning in a big Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is still proud of being clothed with dignity.
Most of the residents were fascinated, said Mr. Franklin, while many reign in sarcastically.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But, add, balanceing in his chair in a backyard with a view to Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her too.
Although it was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only color woman in the Barnard College in the 20s, it was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce - Florida, where he had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no big memorial ceremonies, no big public readings.
"I don't think your contribution to the world or your heritage was understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography by Mrs. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-way road through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two main roads of the working community.
The expansion of the area of Orlando had already forced Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period of his history.
Strong integration, among other things, had put him in relatively identical isolation from the community.
In the '50s, the struggle for racial mix brought hatred against the community.
"During that period, a group of white boys, went to the city, shooting naranjas and everything against the people who were sitting next," said Mr. Franklin.
"They also killed a girl once.
They fired him against a car's sand."
In a letter from 1955 to Mrs. Hurston wrote to the newspaper The Orlando Sentinel, critical of the strong integration of the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education, "insults instead of honoring my race."
R Residents today say that the disaggregation of schools, positive in some respects, has weakened Eatonville's cohesion and undermined the confidence of their young people.
"The black children were used to being dressed - I agree with this – they used to greet the teacher in the morning and in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit organization.
This lasted, it added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
"I wasn't going to hug your teacher because she was white - there's a cultural break there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who passed over the prejudices, just as she did, with beatings, trust and lines such as: "How can anyone deny myself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, author Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston's anonymous tomb and began to fight to raise her reputation.
Five years later, a so-called biography by Mrs. Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in the libraries, re-introducing it into the American cannons.
The road project came right at the time the most famous daughter of Eatonville was again under the reflectors.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of admirers arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return to the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
"The resurrected idea of the road to five roads, would have been to put in what you would call the curvature speed, a real civil pride," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd just said, "Now he saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped change the image of the city itself.
People out of town like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to the church from here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new library (with the name of Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006, on a repatriated and clothed Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still an anomaly in Florida: at only six miles from the center of Orlando, you may sometimes feel like in a street of the past under a spring rain in a small city that was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(The 90 percent of people are black today.)
Forasters who come looking for the history of Eatonville, of its meaning, are often treated with caution.
An early permission is needed to do most of the interviews, and some things - such as the walls in the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs Jones, a brave and convinced professor who has a weakness for the bright red, still fear that his island community can be misunderstood.
And, however, as the Hurston festival has expanded, there has also been a higher level of natal pride.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville in the same way that Mrs. Hurston saw all her race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and also the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, workers, to name and mix.
It is a sincere civil sense that can be heard in the voice of 18-year-old Franklin, Edwin Harvey, who planned to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or by the Department of Police, who said he might need some help.
And even the younger ones, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old Winter Park twins, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, if they are supposed to go up here, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to anyone else'," says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at your story, it's a very nice city."
Here, in New York, everyone's talking about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan remained far from the kitchens and giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not be considered to be in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass façade of the offices at the bottom of the beehouse that are located above their heads, the bankers and speculative fund managers that are monopolize New York are faced daily with the worst "beautiful day of the office" since the autumn of 1929.
Littles for home delivery continue to resonate their metal carts for tea through steels and bring muffin bands for breakfast meetings.
Latin men continue to drag between buildings of busy apartments, like human walls, with 50 excensorship shirts strewn to a yogo through their homs. Office workers still wait in the corner for their breakfast, and it is still impossible to take a taxi between 4 and 7 in the afternoon on working days.
The employees are still waiting to take their luggage to the salesmen's cars, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon on the days of the week.
It seemed to me that there was no crisis at all, until this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimist forecasts there, I decided to open a new account of savings.
Although I had calculated the time needed for the operation to coincide with the rest of the afternoon at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, a handful of about 20 people were already waiting.
And not in front of the employee's window, to withdraw his effective or to make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where customers throughout the life order their check-ins, tourists seek instructions to go to Macy's large stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people were ahead of me, I was informed later by Starr, my personal trust banker, and they were in charge for the same reason that I did.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from the smallest banks in places since they had moved them, places such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the Staten Island.
They had taken their money from so-called savings associations (a little like a construction company), credit unions and savings boxes of their native city whose branches only operate within the state of ownership, and who say to treat customers as their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have failed quietly.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion assets, entered into the well, and as the New Yorkers headed home on Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachavia, with savings of $440 billion, was looking for a ransom buyer.
The offices and shops that were standing before me, fearing another collapse, were transferring their money to a bank to what is considered a safe shelter, which is doing most of the rescues in Wall Street.
Normal people in New York have become financial experts in the past few weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and her executive director of the affected aspect, Dick Full, commented on the matter with familiarity as if they were complaining about the inactivity of a colleague.
And Lynn, fifty-five, and something he'd come up with in the form of my block of apartments, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my purchases at the tendon.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, "I now have all my savings in the cash market.
The exchange is done, I'm not taking any risks."
Muslim drums profanated at the time Austria approaches the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left hand side of the right-wing party for the freedom of Austria and Filip Dewinter Belgium, associated with the right-hand party Vladimir Belang, took part in a demonstration to present to the organization "Citizens against Islam" in Ammers on Thursday, 17 January 2008.
They take traffic signals that represent the blends with a red line that passes.
The police are accused of extreme right extremists for profaning a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that political parties on the right made huge profits in the country's general elections.
More than 90 drums were severely damaged in Traun's cemetery, near Linz, at some point between Friday night and this morning, where the police thought it was an organized action.
Criminals have broken Jewish symbols, such as the David Star on some of the drums, but researchers believe this may have happened by attempting to hide the real motives of extremists motivated by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident was in some way related to the elections.
A spokesman from the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the profanation, which reached Muslims when the month of Ramadan was ending.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for a round of introspection after the round to the right in the parliamentary elections yesterday.
The two parties on the right that were held almost 30 per cent of the votes, the Party of Liberty and the Alliance for the Future of Austria had conducted a campaign focused on anti-immigrant violence and some of its slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, leader of the Freedom Party who won over 18 percent of the vote, gave his campaign against headaches and burkas, and also expressed his opposition to the food considered related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the emergence of Islam.
Both parties are trying to ban the construction of blends and mines, arguing that they were symbols of the current Islamic policy in Austria and Europe.
Investigations and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the extreme right as the stronger political block of the country, indicate that the change is mainly caused by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel ban abroad for Gary Glitter
The courts have prohibited Gary Glitter, the fascinating child sexual abuse rock star, from traveling to France and Spain.
The judges imposed a ban on Gliter six months after he informed the supervisory authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent's police made the ban on travelling abroad last Thursday after the judges had produced evidence of Glitter's previous sentences for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Judges' Court in Kent, but he was represented by Corker Binging attorney.
A spokesman from the Justice Service said: "On Thursday 25 September at the Ashford Judges' Court in Kent, the police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's travel abroad as in France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd didn't attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad to find himself under the register of sexual offenders.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
and it is also necessary to communicate to the police the scheduled date with seven days before their departure.
Kent's police said he wouldn't discuss the individual case or possible Glitter's stand-by place in the county.
A Kent Police spokesman said: "Kent's police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent Police spokesman said: "Kent's police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to watch someone stay in the United Kingdom because here we have systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
"Protection to Kent's residents is the main concern of Kent's police and we work closely to monitor the conduct of the sex offenders registered in the county and to minimize any risk to the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11.
When Glitter was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and finally fled to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied his entry and he wanted to return to Bangkok, where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22, and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Court of Justice in West London after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to be registered as a sexual offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months in 1999 for having images of child abuse.
A source of the Ministry of Interior reported that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was calmed and delighted to know that Glitter had been forbidden to travel to France and Spain.

No tacos, no flying, no external wear.
The essence of the great masters of the flamenco, who were disappointed by the concentration in interpretation to gain the relaxing aspect of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in the privacy of the public, at those moments when you find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of some hands, disappointed because they are not going out on stage.
German Günther Bauer alternative in "Flamenco-people" is the theatre of some stage posts with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less known side of these teachers.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of the flamenco from different areas.
Included in the programming of the Month of Flamenca Photography, the exhibition "reviews the international importance of flamenco, more every day", explains the creator, who explains that "Flamenco-people" "may be people of any kind but, when looking at the photos, the observer is aware that they are not the typical images of artists in the scene.
These people portrayed as "in the street" are artists capable of passing on stage passion, sadness, joy... holding the public down.
To capture the personality of these artists, there is no need to take pictures from the scene.
They take his personality and character inside.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to grasp with the camera the personality of the huge flamenco."
With the taste of the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer started a long trip in 1,997 to entertain singers, guitarists or dancers with a silver camera.
These are photos that, due to the choice of camera and material, remember classical photography.
The application of different estylistic media breaks with the classical basis of the image, confiscating modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, that evolves and surprises every day."
It is not the action of the dance, song or touch in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, which serves with his art to the public.
The search for a meeting with the essential, with the demand that is made visible in a way of feeling, being and being sound and has been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Fotomata.
Known figures of flamenco like Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, configure this selection of almost seventy photographed artists.
The project has become an anthology of the flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the photos presented in the sample.
The passion for Bauer's photos led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "SportARTproject".
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I like to take people out, know them and be able to enter a moment into their life, whether a long or short moment.
I think within the photograph the picture is the most difficult gender.
You meet or face people, characters, sometimes you don't know, or they just leave you a few minutes to take the picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of photos of the current flamenco, which is entitled "Flamenco-people" is shown in the Gallery El Fotomata, located in number 20 of the street of the Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, where it can be visited until the next 16 October.
Vargas Llosa believes that the novel he writes is "a fear"
He is surrounded by places he does not yet know and writes about unknown issues, but yet, Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to leading up to the new project in which he works, a novel he has as a protagonist to Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for twenty years and passed through Amazon.
The always favorite of the Nobel Prize for Literature yesterday confessed by the Hay Festival Segovia that the project today "is a fear" and that "all indicates that you shouldn't write" the novel.
"If it was sensible, I wouldn't, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it sometime," he concluded in his intervention at the conference of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that have been seen through the city of the Acuducto for four days to a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the highlights of the third edition of the word festival and fulfilled the prognostics.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer in the audience - an ancient edition of "Our mutual friend", by Dickens-, filled the joy of the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Felix Romeo, he found before him a public delivered to him at a very short time when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, reviewed how he was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "reading place" and "live more than what he lived"; how he wrote of "disciplined manner" to supplement his "inspiration failure" with an intense work of documentation, correcting and rehearsing much; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what "images of memory" are the basis on which their stories are supported.
The Spanish novelist recognized that "there is no way" to measure and know if the books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an effimeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes the most inconsistencies", so he asked the writers "don't give up" and "take responsibility" his vocation.
The climate goes beyond the Pozoblanco fair, which also remains without areas
The festival of districts that closed the pool of Pozoblanco fair was suspended in the morning, after checking the announced districters that the floor was not in the best conditions.
Thus, the company, according to Fermín Bohorrquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the course.
Meteorological pressures have been overcome by this party, since at last two of its three parties have not been able to celebrate.
The Sabbath was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second round of intended bulls.
The cartel consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a Castilblanco funeral.
So, only Friday was a party.
In him, the triumphal procession was Daniel Luce who cut three ears and went out to hombres, after leaving them pleasantly and aesthetically.
That same evening Alejandro Talalante saved his two hats with greetings and an ear, which gave the tendons more than his tore.
That's right, worse still was El Juli, who passed through the body of Los Llanos without any punishment or glory.
In his second bull, after a relief party, he won the crown of a large part of the audience.
A check in Álva on a two thousand kilograms of ham
Five less than ten of the bridesmaids.
Traffic control of Ertzaintza in the municipal term of Arminón (Alava).
The agents give the high to the two employees of a car and they take the Jews.
His load, more than two tons of sharks, wasn't like stopping.
The agents pursued and detained one of the two employees, a 28-year-old, identified as A. A. J., reported in a communication to the Department of Internal Affairs of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual has been accused of drug trafficking and falsification of a public document.
The incident was recorded when several officers of the Álava Traffic Unit carried out a transport control on N-1, their way through the municipal term of Arminion.
A vehicle was available to be stopped for inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, crashed violently and the control was broken.
The agents began their persecution until the vehicle was stopped a few miles later in the arc, when two of their crews opened to flee to the railway for a forest area.
The Ertzians finally reached one of them and were encumbered by the 2,178 kilograms of sharks they transported and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with luggage loads, so it was transferred to police units for extensive and heavy drug inspection.
In addition, the officials verified that the matrix had been "doubled" since it did not match the collection in the vehicle documentation, so a crime of falsification of the public document had also been imposed on the arrest.
Ertzaintza continues to investigate the detention of the other suspect, who was able to flee the race as mentioned, and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The arrester, A. A. J. of 28 years, was transferred to police units to perform the relevant duties and will be brought before court in the coming hours.
Hold the actress Heather Lockclear for driving under the effects of any medicine
The actress Heather Locklaar, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effects of some medicine.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers when she tried to get out of her apartment in Montecito, according to the newspaper People revealed a voice from the California road patrol.
The witness has explained that at 16.30 o'clock, Locklear "was laying down the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to pull the car out of the parking car forward and back, and on going back he passed several times over his sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who seemed to have not recognised the actress at first, saw Locklear standing in a nearby highway and coming out of the vehicle.
This person was the one who warned emergency services because "he was worried about Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived, he found the actress sitting inside his vehicle, who was partially blocking the road.
"It seemed disorientated," so the agents took her to the specialized drug and alcohol centre to carry out a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress showed cooperativeness and the excess of alcohol has been eliminated since the first time, although "though the officers had first observed, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medicine".
Locklear was arrested as suspected of driving under the effects of a substance that has not been specified and entered the local prison at 1900 hours, although he was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left a Arizona treatment clinic where he recovered from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Callers urge the long-term IU federation to assume their competence in the Silva case
The General Coordinator of the IU and Member of the United Left, Gaspar Callazares, has today ensured that it will be the regional training federation which will have to take a decision on the case of the former Youth and Sports Council Council of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who left the week after being accused of conducting family-friendly treaties.
"I am very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its competences," he said Callazars about the action that the party should adopt with what has so far been concealed in the municipal constitution.
However, the IPU leader defended the need for "transparency" to be present in the possible investigations into the irregularities that Silva could have done: "IU has always defended that type of matter has the highest degree of transparency".
In the same line, he stressed that training has "strict ethical codes for all public tasks".
'Mayo Blood, Garci's Episcopal Affiliation
Inspired by the national episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci celebrates the famous rise of Spanish against French in Sangra de May, which is the most ambitious film in his film with about 15 million euros in the budget.
In this way, the cinema has tried "to illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" which has always been admired in the work of the novelist knowledge, has explained today during the presentation of the tape, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría in front of a wide list of interpreters.
Blood from May, with a meter higher than two and a half hours, is spent this Friday in cinematographic rooms, to become a future minister for Telemedrid for more than four hours.
Great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci has made sure that he has fulfilled this round "a dream of childhood", which should thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Madrid Community has been assigned to round a memorial tape for the second century of May 2, which he has always accepted and when the report was based on the National Episcopals.
The 15 million budgets that the Community of Madrid has contributed in its entirety constitute a "one chance" for Garci to have an appropriate environment with the decorations and clothing of "a NATO-led Spain that was mistaken for fighting, because the struggle for independence has led the people to enormous delay with the reign of Fernando VII", he said.
But the movie laments that it has not been counted with funding such as the Alatriste or the Los Fantastics of Goya - more than the double of the Blood of May-so it has not been able to round some plasma scenes in a script signed with Horacio Valcárcel, who has collaborated in almost all of his career.
Therefore, the Director of Return has been affected by what is his usual form of work, the stage with the actors, with which he often tries before starting the race and with those who do not make castsing, because he seems to be "submissive" and to consider that "part of the director's office is based on the theatre and cinema to know what is happening in the industry in which he works".
Many of the interpreters who meet in Sangle de May refer to their camera, as is the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga, or Fernando Gillén Cuervo.
Candidateed to Oscar on four occasions - of which he won one -, Garci believes that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the May's own Blood, Seven French billboards and the finally selected, The blind giraffes, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which must be known", has assured.
With this film Garci doesn't expect prizes.
"In the beginning you think you work for the future, then you realize that you only work for the prosperity, and now you agree to make a more film," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional trajectory.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the savralina Tortola Valencia
A seville dancer is going to honor a ballerina, too.
Carmen Törtola Valencia, a Catalan father (Florenç Törtola Ferrer) and a Andalusa mother (Georrina Valencia Valencia Valencia), was born in the village of Triana and when she was three years old she moved to London with her family.
It was a ballerina of free and professional dance in Eastern dances.
He had a fascinating life, a pioneer of women's liberation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was Buddhist and vegetarian and was a lawyer for the abolition of the course that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman, who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe from between wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character and it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell your life but to collect your spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested me pals of flamenco.
So, "the dance of the maripos" suggested a gajira, or "the dance of the serpent" some tangos.
His dance was sensual and they told me that my dance is also within this aesthetic," he says.
The assembly has two exceptional collaborations: Miguel Poveda's who will sing Isabel again in one of his shows, as he did in the "Open Door"; and with Matilde Coral teacher, who has especially wanted to collaborate with who was his student.
"Matilde makes Tötola the parent, the character of maturity.
I'm happy because I've agreed to act in my work and I feel very honored about it."
The assembly also includes the musical and guitar composition of Jesus Torres and Pac Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pajaro, as well as the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "which makes the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were divine in all its extension, and who are always loved by them."
The work also has in some way the life of this woman who has developed in places as far away as possible, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, in addition to all of Europe, since she normally lived in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think it's from these women who have a huge influence at a certain time and now no one knows and much less appreciates her work," said Bayón.
The show will begin today at 20.30 p.m. on the Lope de Vega theater.
The publication of "Diary of a recently married poet" also closes the Trinity
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of a Recycling Poet" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez opposed marriage to Zenobia in March 1916, is marked within the activities planned by the Council of Culture of the Council of Andalusia to celebrate the "Treaty Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the publication of both.
In this way, the "Treenio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to its end with the restoration of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum, and with the traveling exhibition "Joan Ramón Jiménez: This lamp of light", which was opened last May and, after travelling through the various Andalusian provinces, will be scheduled to travel to New York during the crossing of the International Congress.
The Council of Culture of the Council of Andalucia has also acquired a total of eight copies of the "Day of a Reconnaissanced Poet", edited by Pedro Tabererero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the diffusion of the figure and work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Auscia de Malaria", and gives the idea of the American movie's disappearance, and of all America, before the impressive idea that Newman has gone.
Look how much they needed to give him an Oscar.
And that has been withdrawn since 2007.
And I knew I was very sick.
That's how it's been a joke for everyone.
"Sometimes what a feeling is beyond all expression, and now I have lost a big friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to your existence."
No one was afraid of making the joke or exaggerating.
He had lost a father of the film and heritage at a particularly dark moment, with fear of terrorists and markets, with the American self-esteem by the soils, looking desperately for reasons for dignity.
When it's so hard time and no virtue for men and few beings to admire you stay, it doesn't need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
I was incarnating for all an ideal almost platinum of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and advocate of lost and winning causes, from the foundation to fight drugs created in honour of his premature death by overdoses to his domestic and organic food brand.
All a gift to a country that has cost him much to surrender to a kill food culture.
The vast wave of admiration would be Hollywood's neighborhood without caring for nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that a man didn't die but once.
Another English, former director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was even less than the top of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, was supposed to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He has left us the list very high to all," observed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to try to live as Paul Newman lived: maintaining high the need for probation and having a serious and distant private life from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's medical jungle.
But someone's trying, and Paul Newman is his example.
He divorced once, but then I was married to Joanne Woodward for five years, who was faithful when he was sure he had the opportunity to not be.
"But why am I going to eat hamburgers out of the house, if I have feet inside?" he used to smile himself.
In heaven, he is seen as proud that his daughters in the earth match their fans, something not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles that he interpreted, no one was as proud as the devoted husband, loving father, sociable grandmother and devoted philanthropo. "
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is to celebrate some Olympics in Madrid and, after the fall of 2012, may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I say no!
The perfect race was called her, and in my judgment it was the worst race I've ever been in.
A set of assumptions which would have been very clear if they had taken into account it as an assessment and I would have examined it.
But let's go for parts and from the beginning.
Depreciation starts with the dorsal collection, which makes you have to go ahead.
Which doesn't look bad to me, but if they're already making you go all the way (including the chip to avoid the wheels in the race).
So don't.
Here you were just going to pick up the dorsal (first off, only for that) and (through the relevant cola), surprise!, there was only 'S' cut for the shirt (second off, because I need an XL cut)
What world do we live in?
Or has the crisis decided to buy only small shirts with less fabric and cheaper?
Well, things like these are a nice thing compared to those of the day of the race.
Apart from having to go very soon to collect the chip, the coke on arrival is 15 minutes and also has to leave the mochila.
More than 35 minutes waited, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as I expected, started the race, and we had not yet left the mochila, although once achieved, the collection was worse.
In addition, the rain disturbed the waiting for more than 40 minutes, which was joined by popular rebellion and loudspeakers at the castle.
I think some 500 people will certainly have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, they will not even appear with the right time in the classification, because of the chip they gave me that, I imagine, did not mark my exit correctly.
Since then, if I had been asked about the perfect career, this wouldn't have come into my mind.
So I think we'll keep dreaming of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft Recipe search engine (virtual)
At the MIT Emerging Technologies conference Microsoft has shown progress in a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without much intelligence but is able to perform some basic tasks, such as asking for a taxi (or in Microsoft case, a launcher to move through the company's field) by listening to what you hear in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a face recognition system, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who are - even remember what they are doing - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
Also group the present according to the negotiating groups.
In the sample video, the receptionist detects a third person but he realizes that he is not a member of the group he is talking to and that he is not a employee of the company.
Ask him if he's there to visit someone and tell him he'll be there soon.
Everything with no blue screen.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example in the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week has been much above a change in Microsoft strategy.
Windows 7 will be easier and it won't have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has found that if the computers came with the essential instead of commercial bassilla loads, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it will be less.
All a match bearing in mind that Microsoft, version after version, has added functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change in course is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system will lose its importance, as well as the software.
When Google Chrome came out of the network, I was one of those who came up with the theory that Google was the first step to compete with Windows.
Many have pointed out with certainty that a browser is not a operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for hardware and software to be understood.
Complete the same function as your wife or husband when you have to tell your wife something.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but there is a need to think about the "death" of the operating system, not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People always pay less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer starts only to execute Firefox or Chrome - or Explorer - and each day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What are half the applications that come into the system for?
It's less.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than View.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and finally being an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I'll give you a little example.
The photo of this post took her in one of the rest rooms for Microsoft employees, in Redmond, at the beginning of the month.
In the refresher machine a cartel asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the network.
Last week, of course, a delay was also confirmed in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not reach the beginning of 2009 but at the end, rather drawing to 2010.
In Microsoft they will certainly seek the joint launch of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is more computers every day.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone on the way, is going to be billing.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso took her to the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio lighted one in Edward Zwick's 'blood diamond', the same as Al Pacino in 'El Padrino' by Francis Ford Coppola and form part of the uniform of the gay muscle parology.
And if we're quantifying star appearances, we can re-mount the image of that punctuated bigote force that raised weights in an ambulatory circle.
In essence, it is no longer the typical male shirt of inside in cotton, cooked and without mangoes.
The 'tank', which calls the speakers, but the Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles is against all others.
First, because of his revolving name - although familiarly known as 'Marcel' - he has to see the sport because he gets his name, according to legend, by poet Marcel Cerdan, a lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' highlights the others for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive shade and for the small Belgian flag (recognisable only) that the most emblematic shirt models carry as detail in the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian firm is not only focused on its tank tops.
It also includes college suites, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, marine shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Take thought for comfort underwear.
Even though it's a shame to leave them like inside clothes.
They're too much in love.
"I want to be a young mother; the candidate doesn't care."
His enormous size like his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is often but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters take their new activity seriously in fashion.
For Monica, they're much more than nice and famous girls who give their name.
It has been in Paris on the promotion of Mango's firm in its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important prizes in a way that the Spanish house sponsors.
Calm down and fear, win the short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I've come to introduce the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have come to Mango in this new summer summer season, in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Let's go, a very intense day but, at the same time, exciting.
What is your new collection for Mango in this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the 50s and 60s movie; we get a lot of references from there.
Then, I like to miss out on a city and watch women wear, mix and mix their clothes, I do a lot.
Baillarina, actress and designer, you're a very polyfacetic woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, it's all one and there's a lot of ties in common.
I liked the clothes from my childhood; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to rush into my aunt's arms and see her dress.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the attraction park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of my clothes.
You know that the dancers like us very much to make us our stylists for the classes and tests, to look at us at the mirror and feel us well.
And in the role of actress when they give you the dress is when you really find the character.
Then everything goes together, yes, with great respect for designers and professionals.
You've met 30 years ago, have you been in a crisis?
What's going on?
I feel better than ever, I like 30.
When the woman is done, she has experience and enjoys life with less mistakes.
To me, the biological watch doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since childhood and this has given me much inner happiness.
So, do you think you're a mother or not?
From then on, I know I'm going to be a mother because I'm asking for my body and, moreover, I want to be a young mother; this I don't want to lose.
As for the candidate, I don't care.
What I will do is give my child much happiness and education with great love.
As for the movie, you're standing by a number of stars you've been around last year.
That's how and I'd like to see the light.
I, who's a woman who comes from the theater, I'm very impatient and worried, everything I want to be, of course, can't be.
I want 'The Last Time' and 'Search for the tomb of Christ'.
Seeing them look like...
A few days ago you started on a ride with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not that I'm going to get to a passport to model it.
Simply, she called me Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a beneficial feature for her organization 'Women for a better world' and the dress we showed - I took two pieces of our collection for Mango - it was up to raise money for this Naomi's NGO.
People don't know that Naomi's third heart.
They say so many things about her that, I know her, I would tell you that many are not sure.
Besides, I'm staying with that very good part where she's involved.
He asked me to stand up for such a noble cause, but if he came to ask me to make the pin, so would he.
To benefit the women of the third world, what's missing.
Alcoholic drivers must install 'alcoholock'
Inside he wants the driver with three administrative penalties for alcoholism, to install in his vehicle a system that prevents him from driving the Hebrew vehicle, or if he does not sleep.
The initiative was already announced last June and is now included in the annual memory of the State General Tax Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
Its purpose is to re-enter the driver, so this will also receive a virtual re-education course.
In the experience, in addition to the General Insurance Taxation, they will participate in the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Institute of Technology for Automobile Safety (FITSA).
According to statistics, between 30 per cent and 75 per cent of the car drivers reported more than once for driving Hebiros are back to pick up the car.
Alkolock would avoid it because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in the air and prevents the car from running if the driver does not soak; or when a concentration of alcohol is detected is higher than allowed.
Its cost is above EUR 1,000 and would run for the penalty.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce to 65% during the first year of implementation.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save 115 people every year.
The measure is closed to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And facilitating its implementation, as legal reform can be done on a regular basis, and, however, the necessary reform on a criminal basis requires reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available in the Spanish market in any commercial mode, although it has already been experimentally implemented in some industrial and public service vehicles.
In the morning, the Congress of Members will vote tomorrow for an initiative of the PSOE in which this system is proposed to be installed on school buses, as has been carried out in France.
In Mexico the word 'peep-toes'
With British accent, at 17.40 a.m. in the programme, Benito Juárez, Mexico DF, was landing the plane of the Spanish Air Force on which the Asturias Princes traveled.
The sun was still withdrawing, but its rays were still forced to use their hand as a visual way to see the real couple descend from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier he had asked the taxi driver if he knew that the Spanish Princes had visited the city to formalize an official trip.
- Oh, very good, then you won't be able to go to the airport at that time... she's from here or...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexican press knows very well who are the Princes of Asturias and the importance of travel.
Many are waiting in the airport hangar attached to the red carpet and a military valley formed by 27 marine soldiers who interpret the salvation of honor.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the Princess, a melancholy, very sober, doesn't use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps they had informed her that in the DF she was threatening to burn.
They give a smile and a pause to the photographers before going to the room in which the official committee awaits.
At the hotel door where they are located, one of the four great cities of the city is waiting for them a detailed report on Mexican television.
The best gift of fashion
There may not be a place in the world most suitable for presenting a fashion award, which Paris and possibly no live designer is more expensive and good than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of new fashion talents.
It is equipped with a 300,000 euro prize.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his designs on Mango's escape at the number 54 of the Haussmann Boulevard of Paris and almost starved of the emotion.
Of course, this is the second largest firm in Europe and it is just opening up with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first is in London.
So many events, combined with the desire to thank the designer Valentino, who would preside over the jury of the ceremony, made us finish in a lucid dinner at the opera Garnier de Paris.
With the closest Chagals, the presidential table prepared by Mango was even more spectacular.
Nati, with the heart set on punishment and making triangular hearts, because of his brother's recent failure, took a ride from the house and some ELAH addresses, which cut the breath, and from the arm of his son Luis - a rabbit nearly two meters long - accompanied Valentino in the chairmanship of his guest dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honours and he's so brave that he ended up with the baron of Rotchil, without a jacket, because both of them had been given to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who attended the store with pants and shirts - of her own design - and for the dinner she was transformed with a long black dress, was excited when during the night break by the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were taught the ballet test room and she, remembering other times, got to one of the bars and made a big cry.
Inès Sastre did not stay in the walk by the palaces, but he taught us on his son's mobile phone.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the view with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another truck moving on the motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with its savannas, its toilets and having asked for it before, that there were no holes in his room.
Stars under the stared sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, anti-sterres
There is no 1000 but one way to forget the caotic and frenetic daily life.
And if it's not, everyone is gathered in a book that will bring relief to the libraries on September 30th.
The alarmer almost punishs when he wakes up every morning at 7:00 a.m., but it is even worse to imagine being surrounded by the angry pace that imposes the present life.
The office is called tension and the support computer.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is not one or two ways to combat daily abuse and the problems of disconnection with the working world.
No, the number goes up to, nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Apart from yoga positions, the classic massage or 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers in the pages of a book all a 'menu' of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each.
The anti-sterres work is called '1001 ways to relax' and its peace will reach the libraries of the editorial Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone considers it impossible to achieve peace in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' will undermine such belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as contacting nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If the adrenaline is no longer running for your veins to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit in the sofa, disconnect the mind and concentrate on reading.
Chats
Some kids talk about the night.
I'm not referring to those who get very tired telling us something that happened the other day, but to children who talk about being asleep.
The first time you get the best, you're wearing a suit, but it doesn't really matter.
It's a benign change of dream called dreams.
It's quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one of them has told you what he talked about last night.
This phenomenon may appear very sporadic (once in life for example associated with a high fever episode), or more periodicly (every day, once a week, once a month...), the next day the child remembers nothing.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often related to other changes in sleep such as pesadils, night terrors, nightish enuresis (to get sleepy) or sleepbulism, but it has no reason to be so.
As we mentioned earlier, they can also be associated with very high fever tables, stress or overextreme.
Anyway, it's a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
It can be spoken in a tone of calm voice, quiet words, a smile or everything else (Laughter, tears, long speeches...).
In cases where the event is very intense, it would be appropriate to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check whether there is a problem that is causing much anxiety and giving him a way out of this.
We said it's a benign change, so it's not treatment, unless it's associated with another change in sleep that can be treated (for example, if it's associated with a sleep apnea or a stress picture).
What can be done is take into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to encourage the child too much before going to bed.
So find quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are scared or a little violent.
With very nervous children and who are very expensive to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire some inner peace.
This will help the child to have a calmer dream.
Once dreams come out, try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless for the child and that the next day you will remember nothing of what has happened.

Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's not conscious, and you'll break his dream.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if you are shown very anxious during several episodes you should consult or find out what is causing so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common), do not hesitate to try to make an inquiry to make him sound information.
You won't get anything, because being asleep doesn't know how to organize your thoughts.
You will also hear what he says, but you don't know what he's dreaming to say that, how much attention you take in how you interpret the information and the conclusions you get.
You never tell the child you could ask him at night to know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That generates anxiety.
In summary, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts just a few minutes.
They'll be gone!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the path of victory in its field after a long period of drought.
Without having done a good game, the team created many times of gol and was able to make a gol to win the game.
The rhythm was not very constant during this encounter in which the rebels had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann who shot the army with a far shot, Illhaeusern kasi was going to take the "power" and turn the Fenderflick away, then with Hirn up, Romain with the footpoint or also Diebold came to block Dannemarie's defense.
In front of us, we didn't let the Central Campsite pass and left only Rihai in a position of attack.
The beginning of the second time was crucial, first with two occasions of Rihai and Temporal gol for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the marker for the Illhousians with the gol of Marais, well placed to collect the balloon rejected in a first attempt by Diebold (53 ').
But the Illhousiens goller will not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and will be forced to return to the warehouses a dozen minutes later and leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the occasion and it will not be a problem for the eleven Illhousians who have retreated a little to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of the game during which, after an important dance, the balloon passed very close to the transversal field.
Sarkozy finds angry fishermen
Before moving to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will give a ride to Britain.
Faced with the demonstration of resistance by fishermen who strongly disturbed the entrys of several Breton ports last month and normative, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère to meet his representatives there on Tuesday morning.
They promised to welcome him " with a constructive spirit " and expect him to " come with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the " crisis committee " created by the Breton fishermen to achieve measures to deal with the increase in fuel prices, which marks a record reaching EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to Elizabeth's spokesman David Martinin, the president " will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help his companies re-competitive and to save the employment and remuneration of mariners " .
The fishermen wait for Nicolas Sarkozy on foot.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to minimize the movement in Morbihan and Calvados, which have been able to reach almost 10 km.
The port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-yile have not been stopped.
" A filtering barrier " has been placed on the peninsula of Quiberon.
The sailors had already shown their determination to burn the moon, when the white, neumatic, and wooden pallets were burning in front of the fuel deposits in the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while the demonstrations were in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement was spread to other ports along the Atlantic coast and the Mancha, such as Les Sables d'Olonne, Vandea, where the cattle remained at the port, or Le Havre, where some twenty ships blocked the movements of the merchant ships.
The fishermen from La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loira-Atlantic region, stopped the blockade of the important total refinance of Donges in the afternoon.
The fishermen from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until the meeting of this Wednesday, which will take place in the ministry to think about any action.
In Guilvinec, the " crisis committee " will have to consider tomorrow in the development of the movement and in its participation in the meeting planned in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by national fishing committee officials, who did not support their movement.
" The strike will continue " because " fishermen have not left " and " do not want to move to Paris " , for example, Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay gas rates, are currently paying about 50 cents per litre but consider that the financial balance point of a ship can only be reached with a fuel at a price of less than €0.30 per litre.

AIG would want to sell more than 15 % of its assets
Assurer American International Group, who has been removed from debt thanks to the American monetary authorities, plans to sell more than 15 per cent of its assets with a view to reimbursing its loan of $85 billion, according to the issue of the Financial Times Sunday.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and pension insurance in the United States, this magazine needs.
The AIG Management Board met last Sunday to consider possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of which AIG intends to separate include its Air Lasing Branch, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% share in the Transatlantic Holdings insurance and its real estate card and its investments in private equity, adds the Financial Times.
No definitive decision has been taken on these sales, pursues the Financial Times.
AIG must quickly make liquidity in order to repay its loan of 85 billion that the Federal Reserve has granted it to the U.S. authorities to take 80% of its capital, disbursing it with due proportion among current shareholders.
Analysis of the historical session of the Bolza de Paris
New York's Ballsa accused a historic fall last month after the Representatives' Chamber rejected Paulson's plan to save banks: Dow Jones lost 6,98%, or it was a loss that was never seen in Bolsa of almost 800 points, and Nasdaq was 9.14%.
The industrial index Dow Jones fell from 777.68 to 10.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most important fall in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on 17 September 2001, or the day on which the exchanges resumed after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, a technological dominant, retroduced 199.61 points to 1.983.73 units and the standard & Poor's 500 was 8.81 % (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 units, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street collapsed after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the Plan to save banks that would have been able to recover some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 abstentions, the representatives denied the US Secretary of the Treasurer Henry Paulson the funds he requested.
About two Republicans of each three rejected their plan.
"That is not a good sign sent to the market, seeing Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of the Financial FTN.
"This shows how far the market was counted with this plan," Lindsey Piegza added, fearing that a project adopted within several days would come "too late".
" If the project is really killing (...) the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over (the US Central Bank, the N. of the Network) to manage the crisis, which would add to the credit conditions ", Brian Bethune, Head of Economy and Finance of the Global Insight.
And stressing further the sense of urgency, " Every day the fall of a financial institution is announced in the United States, Ms. Piegza underlined.
After Washington Mutual's fall last Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachavia's banking activities by their Citigroup rival.
In Europe, the crisis has dramatically accelerated, which has led to emergency interventions for banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets are facing "not only a crisis in the United States but a global crisis", the FTN analyst added.
The compulsory market rose dramatically.
The income of the 10-year-old treasure bonus was 3,632 %, compared to 3,827 % Friday afternoon, and the 30-year-old bonus was 4,161 %, compared to 4,357 % of the summer.
Obama, winner during the first TV show
At the first Friday debate between the two candidates in the White House, another one happened to know who had trounfed between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
No wonder, the general quarters of the Republican and Democrat campaign declared their own victory on this TV show that has been followed by a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honorable, was not "very brilliant" to allow him to cut his down in the polls for five weeks of presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, whose survey of public opinion published last Saturday, grants five points of advantage to Obama (49% against 44% for McCain), argues that it is the democracy that was successful.
Among the indiscriminate electors, who are the ones who count, Obama went out victorious with 39% of the respondents, while 25% of them grant the victory to McCain, according to a CBS survey.
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the expected good performance of his own candidate, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
It has good instincts," however Bill Clinton predicts this weekend.
Septuagint McCain highlighted his indisputable experience in foreign policy, emphasizing the "insensibility" of his opponent on these issues that were in the heart of this first career.
"Senior Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." accused several times.
" I do not believe that Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be president, " he also ensured.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican television advertising.
Obama stressed that he was the future.
Unconstitutionally, he showed himself conciliatory and precise.
It has raised its ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
" McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done so," he replied, at the end of the week, a democratic television advertising that condemned the Republican because he had not considered the impact of the US crisis " .
" During the nine minutes of the debate, John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing about you, he complained Obama yesterday, before 20,000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina under a rain.
He did not utter the words "mediate class" or "employers". "The financial defeat clearly favors Obama, which is considered by the Americans as the most capable person to save the economy that is at the edge of the precipice.
" Next week could be a decisive episode," he estimated yesterday, the influential and democratic senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, an old member of Clinton administration, compared Obama's " good economic instincts " with Bill Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the democratic candidate, the current financial disaster " is the final outcome of eight years of a poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain " .
Reiterating that despite all efforts to reduce the taxes of 95 per cent of the United States despite Wall Street's peaks, the Senator of Illinois also noted that the country's possible energy independence thanks to the promotion of renewable energy was its first priority, with the creation of a security and health system.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear centers from here by 2030.
Both candidates, however, failed the issues related to the financial savings plan of $700 billion (470 billion) adopted yesterday by the Congress and extremely unpopular.
"In Minsk, have you noticed the elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents showed the Sunday afternoon at the main stage of the Belarusian capital in order to prevent the results of the legislation.
Hundreds of Belarus met on Sunday afternoon from the closure of the electoral centres in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no results have yet been announced, many young people have come to protest against President Alexandre Loukachenko's power: " the dictator, he has to leave."
Some recognize that they have not voted: "Why, because they will do what they want with my vote," one youth says.
They do not believe that the regime that has been good to foreign observers in order to renew contact with the European Union is willing to make a democratic change.
The sanctions, including the prohibition of visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are considered clean for observers.
It wasn't according to opposition.
" We have been on the side of the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the polling, " Iouri Potemkine, the Union's spokesman for the Democratic Forces, was complaining about a heterogeneous regroup of twelve parties.
" It is a cosmetic change, underlined by Alexandre Milinkievitch, former candidate for opposition to the 2006 presidential election and leader of the European movement, because the important thing is who the votes are, and in our home, is the executive power.
If some Members of the opposition enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed but not elected.
" But your entry to Parliament may mean television appearances, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. "
The opposition must therefore enter into the political game because " the dialogue with the European Union needs to be started.
Because if our economy, which has a lot of debt against Russia, is in crisis, and if we are not reformed, we are at risk of becoming a protector of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process does not recognize the validity of the vote.
He stressed that the participation figures seemed too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26 per cent of the voters in Minsk) favored manipulation.
"Have you noticed the elections? Ask social democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the electoral centers.
And there will be as much as five Members of the opposition to Parliament, who are better suited to power. "
The night's silence returns again in October's place.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the electoral central commission are happy for their success.
The interview - Blood again to be safe
Hema-Québec celebrated his 10th anniversary of his foundation yesterday, and his President, Francine Décary, had reason to be happy because Hema-Québec has returned to be one of the safest and effective providers of blood in the world.
And above all, it reaffirmed the public's confidence that it had been seriously vaccinated by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Faced with this drama and the disfavor of the public, in February 1994, the Government of Canada conducted a public investigation, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, which sought to clarify the circumstances that had led to such tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would no longer occur.
While Judge Krever was late to present his relationship, certain provinces then set up a committee to plan for a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this mission.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to provide all other provinces and both territories.
" In 1998, when Hema-Québec began his activities, nearly 38 per cent of the people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, recalls Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
After much effort has been made to improve the safety of blood products and much work over the years that followed, we have recovered the public confidence " , he said in his pride that at the beginning of 2008, about 94 per cent of the Quebecese population had confidence in Héma-Quebec.
Dr. Décary recalls that " confidence is extremely fragile " .
Since its creation, on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we attended in Europe the birth of many cases of the human variant of the disease of the cow, a new variant of the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, the Décary account.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
Then we support one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which, when we do not know and when a serious illness may arise, in this case the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob characterised by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we establish exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we rejected the blood of people who had remained in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been shown beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us so that the precautionary principle applied had meaning."
In 1999 a much more sensitive HIV detection technique appeared on the market: the nuclear acid tests that enable donors to detect directly the presence of the virus and not the presence of antibodies against the virus, in which evidence has been used so far.
Nuclear testing allowed the period between the time when the person was infected and the time when the first viruses could be detected in blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We can reduce this period in a period of less than one week.
We therefore substantially reduce the risk that certain donors are infected without knowledge and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements allowed a significant reduction in the risk of contracting AIDS for a blood transfusion.
Today, every 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV - contaminated blood.
"That means that you will have to distribute 12 million blood products before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products annually, it will take more than 24 years to overcome a case of HIV transmission by a blood product.
I believe that today you can receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health without concern," says Héma-Quebec's head.
" Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen could arise in the system.
Last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of the Reunion that, for example, the West Nile virus was transmitted by an insect in the blood.
Hema-Québec must be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Décary before stressing that in addition to safe supplies, hema-Québec must also provide adequate supplies.
" The needs are increasing because the elderly population is growing.
As the most aggressive anticancer treatment is usually required by patients injecting red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for the network of blood donors that regroups only 3 per cent of Quebecs eligible for blood donation. "
All healthy persons aged 18 and meeting the eligibility criteria may, however, give blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
In the medium term, 14% of those who propose their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they travel in a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3%, we can maintain an inventory covering hospital needs.
The pennies are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this donor network as they grow older and can no longer give their blood.
But it's hard to convince people to give their blood, but especially to keep them and encourage them to be regular donors.
Since current life is very fragile, we rarely find time to spend an hour giving your blood," she hurts Francine Décary.
With a budget of $297 million per year, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products but also human tissues, including bone inerts, heart valves, eyeglasses and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, transformed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public blood bank of the umbilical cord in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was previously considered biomedical waste is filled with a rich blood of mother cells that can be used for the treatment of serious diseases such as leukemia.
" We have celebrated a few weeks ago, the position at the bank of our most beautiful sample of blood from the umbilical cord is expected to take more than a thousand of these each year.
We should start proposing it for inerts at the beginning of the next year ", Dr. Décary needs to describe this program of cordial blood taking as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they can't enjoy this, " because Hema-Québec has no resources to propose this complex and expensive programme in all Quebec hospitals.
Softbol - The Impact on Semifinals
The Impact of Montreal was qualified for the semi-finals of the first USL elimination series, thanks to a victory by 3-1 (4-3 in final summary) on the coast of Seattle's Sounderers, yesterday, during the second and decisive part of the series of final rooms, in the Saputo Stadium.
The central champion Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After the first time without any gorilla, central champion David Testo and Rocco Plantentino created many gorillas.
Roger Levesque was the only one who disappointed Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
We recall that during the first part of the series of the parties going back and forth, Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat in Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in Seattle.
The Impact will be measured at Vancouver Whitecaps semi-final.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, Thunder lost 3-1 in the return party to bring it back by 4-3, but the Whitecaps joined the semifinals by 5-4.
The Impact should be faced with the Whitecaps Friday and Sunday next, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short – Kovalev’s victory goal
The third number one of Canadians is willing to start the season.
The composite unit of Alex Kovalev, Thomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the attack on a Canadian 3-2 win for the free shoots in front of the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, marked a gol, Plekanec accumulated two aids, and Kovalev took a step in this gain, the quarter of the Tricolor in six preparatory parties.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet, before the Russians.
"I need another party to feel comfortable."
He tried to play at the maximum in the first time, annotated Guido Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
There was a great ovulation."
Charest takes care of the North
First Minister does not exclude holding elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party concluded, Jean Charest was yesterday in Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) tried to be elected during today's partial election.
Rescinding the limits of our last great northern border ": this is the long-term ambition Jean Charest presented with visual force staying on the big lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
After him, during his speech, images were designed.
On three large screens, they showed spectacular images of hydroelectric packaging, mineral exploitation, from Quebec seen by Google Maps, maps, etc.
Large means such as during the electoral period.
The first minister thinks that the elections will take place this autumn, although he saw that his time was very full.
The " North Plan " is the fourth side of a " vision" that the prime minister intends to have for Quebec, the " new economic space " , which includes an agreement on working hand with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmony with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the first Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the Northern Territory at 49th parallel - had never been subject to a presentation.
The first Minister was limited, however, to explain why Norte was " a joy to the immense potential " but did not give a term, investment contributions, or a precise priority in future projects.
What could be most developed is, in particular, hydroelectricity, forest, but especially the mine sector, driven by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains " Nickel, five, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and diamond " , according to Mr. Charest ' s enumeration.
This "tier territory twice as large as France," is our home, is in Quebec.
Not only is it our home, but it is in us," he insisted, as to show that he asked for a national founder myth.
Quebec was built much thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the laugh towards gold in Abitibi, the Quebecian engineering, the Bahía James.
"We belong, it is our future," he added, after having taken a theatre break to observe the immense map behind it.
The North, 70 per cent of the Quebec territory, includes a portion of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, specified the first minister during the press conference.
" It is a traditional position that all governments have repeated.
There is a border line where they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion is presented, repeat that position on the part of the government, " he said.
In addition, " with climate change, we need to reflect on our view of the North," he said about the passage of the northwest, which will open every year due to the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister considers that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the people of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuits?
The first Minister said that the Quebec Government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (formerly former member of the Quebeques Party of Ungava), have already begun consultations around one-third of the communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, where Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role to play.
The first Minister does not exclude an important meeting, " not necessarily a summit " , but a meeting in which " a common vision will be given " .
The development of the North would be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan " will be concerted, organized and respected by the environment " , promised.
Jean Charest described this vision as one that is consistent with the first liberal ministers who preceded him.
" As the liberals before us, we have considered another way of transforming the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development. "
This was one of the recurring topics at the end of the week, which began Friday with a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the party's power.
One of the resolutions adopted proposed the rebaptation of the Beauharnois Centre at the Adelard-Godbout Embassy.
" Of Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage that made the peaceful revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bouurssa that made the Bahía James our party intended for the future," said Juan Charest.
At the press conference, another reference was introduced, the conservative, John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, the first minister from 1957 to 1963.
On the theme of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric packaging project, Mr. Charest stressed that his position in service is scheduled for 2012.
"This remains between us, but I expect to be there," he confided to his soldiers, raising applause.
Indeed, the first minister, who said in April that no elections would take place in 2008 and no doubt not in 2009, did not take away the possibility of making a vote on this autumn, which the law allows.
He stressed that his time was not complete, especially because of a mission from the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council on weekends provided the Liberal Chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, in particular " constitutional aspirations " which had no problems to be accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec in particular called for the recognition of Quebec ' s " specificity " in the Constitution.
I also wish Quebec to appoint members of the Council of Radio and Canadian Telecommunications and to have a veto right on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcomed the great lines of the North Plan with scepticism.
The head of the Quebec party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the development policy of North Quebec that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If I had done so, "we would have made progress today" commented Mrs. Marois on the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote made today), Françoise Mercure.
The Democratic Action of Quebec seemed to support the adoption of a North Plan by the Government.
"But what you want is that this isn't just a show," commented leader Sebastian Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is returning from vacation today.
Letters - A Distorted Country
He is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (oh irony!) at Harper's office, which was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "greed" for Canada.
That is how this woman who has brought an inconsistencies in the struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration what she says all about the relations of the prime minister and Stephen Harper.
We are facing a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not returned to its country which is closed in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not take into account in any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the crimes that have been committed against him occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, renews its promise and lets a child soldier live under inhuman conditions.
The only one who counts with a false justice to evaluate the guilt of the accused.
We recall that UNICEF, the International Amnesty and the Canadian Law Association, in particular, support Omar Khadr's repatriation in order to benefit from a fair process in Canada.
It is this government that closes the eyes on torture: it does not matter to a young adult to be psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of acts.
We are still not aware of that, but we are present at this moment with an insiduous erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", that is the word that Harper continues to repeat and that does not make sense.
The time has already come in which no morality exists: we can treat, torture, arbitraryly imprisonment a Canadian citizen as the head of government so far as a minority (what will happen after October 14 ?).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that commends the Truth, the Law and the Order: I do not see that this government has abandoned what it has done to our country's reputation and dignity.
Mr. Toews' shame is caused by this denial and by nothing more.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold Orwellian speech
In his September 17th edition, Le Devor published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President and Director of the Canadian miner Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the largest gold company in the world has attempted a process of disfamination of six million euros against three authors and a small editorial house in order to generate a " transparent public debate " .
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of persecution by discrimination, but the law.
Not surprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to harm anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
The outcome of the dispute is of little importance, the authors and editor of the book Noir Canada should spend considerable sums to prepare their defence and to fight, with very different weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by nearly unfunded bullets.
The tactics, in these unequal struggles, are often aimed at destroying the applicants with a view to imposing a friendly arrangement that will upset the opposition in addition to arresting anyone who might dare to reconsider the matter again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in front of the public opinion that he would have had to present his vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions in Canada are usually done by changing ideas and not by beatings.
It was enough for miner to open his books, his envoys and establish a true debate through newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent search teams that could have clarified the matter.
But Barrick Gold seems not to rely on public opinion and rejects requests and letters of support for the authors of Northern Canada.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he could ask for a "public" debate by ignoring the views of this one?
According to the vice-president, this word appears to refer only to highly paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; this represents a very limited view of the concept.
Democrats also have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or what you don't want to understand - is that the public who supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada does so primarily because it rejects the brutal way of mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but having as a basis civilized change of arguments, and not in the context of what many people see as a persecution-murder (the " public debate " continues, Barrick Gold has just filed a request for the authors of Northern Canada, threatening them not to use this word anymore).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal speech, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on the freedom of university search and truth, essential to all democratic societies.
It denied the right to mention credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that discourage rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under many persecutions, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
He's got a right to answer.
The university world, to which we belong, has long known to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's uncontrolled persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he intends, he does not want to engage in a transparent debate.
It is a loss to the university world, but also to the public debate in Canada, and it is now time for governments to put devices that limit this kind of abuse.
Wall Street rescue operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and the leaders of the Congress, together with the Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic saving plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US$700 billion plan that seeks to stem the financial crisis that took place in Wall Street for months must still be confirmed by both Congress Chambers.
In particular, it provides for better control by the elected members of its implementation, new mechanisms that seek to ensure the reimbursement of the public money invested, new provisions to contain the number of households in charge of the lack of payment, as well as a right of taxation on wages paid to the managers of the companies concerned.
The American Secretary of the Treasurer, Henry Paulson, the President of the Chamber of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day round of negotiations.
" We are making great progress with a view to an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said the representative of the Bush Administration, Henry Paulson.
" Everything has been done to cover the economy and the ordinary United States before the current Wall Street crisis," the Democrat explained.
" This is the main point: if we don't do this, traumatism, chaos and disturbances over the daily life of the United States will be enormous," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had ended very quickly in recent hours because they were afraid of the effect that would cause a new failure in investors' humor.
The last time they had set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates at the American presidential elections, which had joined the negotiations late, proved to be more favourable to the agreement, without forgetting to express their satisfaction that they were obliged to reach this end.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama was entrusted with certain provisions to reach the agreement, in particular the one that would allow owners to retain their home and the salary of the leaders of the State-sustaining companies.
" When the contributors are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the inresponsibility of some, there is no need to be happy.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, asked in another chain whether he would vote for the proposed plan, answered: "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it."
The important points I read [show] that it is something that we will have to say and with which we can slow down.
He said that the option of not doing anything is unacceptable."
The plan of 700 billion is intended to purchase with the money of taxpayers the debt of doubt, assets at risk and inexplicable from the financial institutions of the United States.
It is after 14 months of a crisis caused by the establishment of a real estate bourgeois which first led to the decline of mortgage credit before extending to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAA) and to cause a freezing of liquidity and a disband of banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of Republican voters who had changed the first draft agreement last week.
We believe that we have come out of disappointment since the Democrats have accepted that certain "toxicants" assets of the companies in difficulty are guaranteed only by the government, rather than by purchase.
With the aim of clearing the aspirations for the world at the Congress, we also added a provision that if the government had to assume losses for five years with this programme, it could impose new rates that would help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion, which may be added to 100 other billion if the president seems to need it.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote of the Congress.
Instead of its aid, Washington will obtain shares in the companies that will lead to dividends in the event of profits and that will be able to resell when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the embargo procedures relating to housing acquired with real estate loans under this plan, as well as to set limits on remuneration and metallic compensation paid to business leaders affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see him voting on the House of Representatives since today and on the next Wednesday.
Despite all your efforts, you are still not sure that your plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest against this project yesterday, both by the Republicans and by the Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the camera finance committee, said to his voters that " Washington clearly does not want to understand " .
We have a very serious financial problem.
There are solutions.
But not what is involved in profiting from contributors " .
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, who is an encouragement to a small group at Congress, presents the problems differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
" Four hundred economic teachers, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote to us to say: we ask Congress not to rush and carefully examine the way to take it," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we once again had evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
Following an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group by EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French BNP Paribas bank had announced that it had declined to buy its competitor in cash since it had lost EUR 2 billion (2.9 billion) during the crisis of the real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and forms part of the 20 largest European banks and of the 10 largest insurance companies.
" This is not money lost, the Dutch Minister of Finance, Wooter Bos said yesterday.
Instead, we will recover a right of vote in the bank and influence.
It is just something that rescuers and families now appreciate that time is short."
During this time, on the other hand, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would be responsible for all outstanding loans in the Bradford and Bringley bank and more than EUR 41 billion (75.5 billion) for real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it was the one that would buy the subsidiaries and bank accounts of the British bank.
The Bradford and Bringley Bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
His blue eyes represented his triumph for so long.
The American actor with a lovely smile had been released from his Narcissist side?
Yes and no.
His powder, his sensitivity and an obvious talent would also have removed him from the register of power that has the true sacred monsters.
But what a great depth corridor!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday, at the age of 83, due to lung cancer in his joint of Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American film of the fast years.
It is less phenomenal than Brando, who seemed much and who was long considered a rival in the movie, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of freedom and stability of dramatic conventions.
The mixed blood often makes great children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots will be one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without self-assessed, last brand of quality.
Because in it was designed all the beloved country of its own made hand, of the fighter of the war of the Pacific, wounded in battle, who at the beginning of the 50s studied the dramatic art in Yale, then attended the actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in the theater, television and soon in the cinema.
This man who fought for civil rights was also the car pilot who was ranked second in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled by six symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star also disappear with him, allergic to the scandals of the world of the show that we do not know very well.
He's an honest man, in the most noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death caused the vertigo to the cinematographics this weekend, while his great roles were intertwined in the black screen of the memories.
More than half a century of the seventh American art in permanent change goes through it.
Many memories come back to memory like the Cowboy with the love of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in La Gata on the adapted Zinc tea of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we appeal to his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that does not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone through the history of the movie.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, terrorized, violent, invincible in Somebody Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, repeated after his death, who actually launched Newman in 1956.
This nice manganese in The Sting (El Golpe), Oscar in the best movie in 1973.
Player of bitter billing and winner in the magnificent film The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961), will repeat the character in The Color of Money of Martin Scorsese, who valued his only Oscar among nine nominations in 1987.
This face that changes with years, it was him.
He's still alive.
The times change during his career.
Young people know it especially thanks to George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, trainer of a little orthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With the latest role of the Irish mafia in Road to Loss of Sam Mendes in 2003, the rice was rice.
Contrary to several Chinese legends who left the race quite soon, Newman stayed much in the cinema world, accusing Hollywood of his gold, his fasts and his concessions.
The French cinematographer Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, " as a challenge that lives in " the underplaying " and that judges its benefits too supportive.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman when the papers arrived for a long time without doing anything.
However, less often was the role of young gallant than marginally: neurotic, alcoholic, cabrons or desperate, whose roots reflected rebellions.
As a performer, Newman revealed on the other hand his true public sensitivity not very well known.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with his wife, Joanne Woodward, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott because of overdoses dedicated his film Harry and Son to 1984, a work of shame and sorrow.
" Among the many men who were born yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former arms colleague Robert Redford (who had worked together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very anxious: " My life and my country were better thanks to his existence "
Generosity, love of existence are important features of the deceased actor.
On the other hand, on the other hand, there is also a large civil rights activist, ecology, independent cinema, a questionnaire against Hollywood's excesses.
We will have seen a lot of your face ruling over the bottles of grape juice, salads, cakes and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, though it started as a gag.
The advantages of these sales were given to their Children's Fund in difficulty.
Newman, instead of enjoying his myth, will be committed to the end.
He gave his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And it's a privilege for us to have followed the career of an American artist so luxurious and so generous.
In summary a citizen model.
What did they produce in the Zuschlag & amp; Co. factory?
Very soon, on 8 October, the criminal proceedings will be launched against Janos Zuschlag and his colleagues.
It is accused of politics and its complicity of committing significant damage fraud, in a business way, continuously and in an organized manner in addition to other crimes, including the falsification of documents.
According to the Office, the funds obtained in public competition were used for their own purposes by justifying, on many occasions, the performance of works with false invoices.
Public funds and housing - in total about 65 million HUF - were put in part in the treasure industry of the Fiatal Balldal organization and in part in the pocket of individuals.
The method, which was also known by the researchers, was to justify the coverage of the funds obtained in public competitions with false invoices beyond which there was no real execution, and the different associations had never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the charge, most of the invoices were false.
To that end, the talent was obtained on the market of the Józsefváros District and the circular seals were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that, on behalf of which company, the counterfeit invoice was to be carried out was decided among others in that race by the upper region of the Balatón, where János Zuschlag sent to István Lados.
This last confessed that for this purpose guests and restaurants should be chosen.
He requested invoices for his consumption and they served as a model for the invoices presented among others in the contests of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social and Labor Affairs, and the Capital Assembly.
These invoices were signed in most of them by István Lados and his complicity András øri, who, according to our best information, wrote the reports needed to obtain public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" Lados chose a beer.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and its colleagues, this gastronomic centre provided food for a group of nine people from the Bistos Pont Egyesület Association.
However - according to the central manager - so many people don't fit in that place at all.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Foundation Jövezért - later called Együtt to Harmadik Éveveredtrett - was full of formal and contextual errors.
Because a hostel in the village of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there one night, but the invoice consisted of hundreds and thirty people.
But great fantasy invoice manufacturers were also exaggerating when they pointed to the Pigal Kft gastronomic center. Because in the bookstore itself - according to the information given to the Fiscalía - there were no documents on Jobb Jövőret and Hoppa.
Győző Farkas, the manager of the company, informed hvg.hu that when he was quoted by the tax office and showed him the invoices, he knew it was false documents.
"In the seal the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: In addition to formal problems, he also did not agree that according to the invoice, hundreds of people were accommodated, since they had only eleven rooms where they did not have so many people.
In addition, the invoice also included food, while the restaurant has been out of operation for some time.
The invoice-makers were also not informed that the agency of travel selected in Budapest only organises trips abroad, so that in the actual payment invoice they indicated in full as a service a journey within Hungary, which did not coincide with the agency's invoice delivery practice.
In addition, as stated during the investigation, VAT was also included in the document, although travel outside the territory of the European Union were tax exemptions.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents sent by the Hotel Revfülöp Kft. for the foundation Jobb Jövőret, since the services of that company are not loaded with a 25 but only 15 percent VAT, and the staff of the hotel only extended invoices made to a machine but the invoice was manual.
In addition, the "suppliers" also made other errors, as in the case of a company in which they placed on the invoice as a road transport activity to which - it was assumed during the tax investigations - did not perform the company based as an investment consultant.
Similarly by formal differences - inadequate format of the bill, false seal is assumed to be false invoices sent to Egyyütt to Harmadik Éveveredtre Alaitvány, for XXI. Zazadi Culturalis Egyesulet and for Biztos Pont.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehertó Sports Camp, their representatives refused to issue those invoices.
The falsifiers also did not pay attention to the fact that when the Fiatal group Városét Egyesület was eating there (2001), the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyhhaza was in the liquidation process, so the liquidation process - according to our information - had failed to send such a document.
The invoices were deliberately issued
Another group of manufacturers of false invoices are those who were aware that they were supposed to send fictitious invoices.
The Fundación Esély Budapest , at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjj Socialist, issued a bill worth about four million HUF in the name of the Fundación Együtt to Harmadik Éveveredt.
Collab Kft. - According to the charge, one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, agreed to send fictional invoices.
Similarly, he collaborated with Zuschlag and his colleagues the Biogate Kft., currently under the liquidation process, which in 2003 provided invoices for an estimated five million HUF to the Jobb Jövőret Alaitvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület and the Vörösfenyő Egyesüet Association, without real economic activity behind.
There was no capital movement either, since the invoices were subsequently cancelled but they forgot to make their documents available to this entity.
The next group of false invoice manufacturers includes those who have any connection with the accused.
Thus, for example, Ivan Kubatov was the Ukrainian administrator of the Delta Trio SL with fictional headquarters in Budapest, which dealt with fuel and vehicle trade.
This company issued numerous invoices for an estimated 18 million HUF in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to the investigation data, these invoices were purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a brother to who Ivan Kubatov should have also removed documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov recognized during the investigation that issued invoices for the company atlasz, for the Hoppa and for Együtt in Harmadik éveredtre Alapitvány covering the import itself.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Ltd and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian Albanians at the request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually worked because, according to the accused, they did not receive work.
But he benefited from these companies, because, at the request of his complicity, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company's registration documents, sent invoices on behalf of the companies for the organizations connected with Zuschlag: for Atlasz and for the Y-Generation.
Kubatov, on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, gave total 15 invoices to different entities with a value of 14.2 million HUF.
The Tax Office considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10 per cent of the invoices.
This man even used the Szi-Beri Commanded Society to deliver fictional invoices used in Biztos Pont's competition.
The Y-Generation and Society presented a competition for Modern Hungary in January 2006 to the dances Miāly Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
The tender received 500 thousand HUF respectively, but did not use the money for the purpose of the tender.
To prevent this from being discovered, they presented to the TMA five fictional invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These were the invoices found during the depositary that Árpád Kemexei had in the office of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the accused will probably report in court - as they did in the Fiscalía - the course of falsification of invoices.
The most interesting can be the confession of the main accused, János Zuschlag, if he decides to dismiss everything.
Because their confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not done so far.
The question is: What interest do you have to do?, because perhaps, in exchange for the return of most of the money - 50 million HUF - socialists reached an agreement with him to assume all responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days until he was able to commit himself, because to ease his prison conditions, he asked for house arrest, but he was repeatedly denied it.
While many of the authors of highly valuable economic crimes, who have never returned the money, are free or at least able to wait in their own home for judgment, he does not have the possibility to do so.
Psychology of the Posts: Why do we spend more money?
The participants in the subcontractors are willing to spend more money and overestimate the product.
The neurologists and economists of New York University discovered the neurological bases - economics of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to the study in Science magazine, people don't want to lose skills such as the eBay substations, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" through experimental substances.
One of the volunteer groups played lottery, the other participated in a summit and while both were examined through the functional magnetic resonance system (fMRI) the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games the participants could earn money, but during the substances, where it is essential to put more than the other, when losing the game was intensified the operation of the complex called strata located below the brain cortex.
This brain area, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the "car award" mechanism of the nervous system.
Thus, according to scientists, the increase in seizures is explained as a prevention to prevent an intense reaction to the strata.
In order to base their theory, the economists of the scientific group also conducted a study of financial monitoring.
In this experiment, three groups stood against a person under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the real value of the product in question, and its members were warned.
In addition, he was promised that if they won, they would receive $15 more.
On the contrary, the third group received $15 just before the summit, but in case the group members lost the summit, even the money was lost.
So the only difference between the two groups was that for one, the triumph was highlighted and for the other failure.
However, testing the hypotheses of neurologists, members of the group who played "against failure" were willing to place more than members of the control group and the "winner" group.
"These results cannot be deduced from any previous economic theory.
So far, they have explained the phenomena of the substations only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped to resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so that we now come to a third explanation" - Andrew Schotter, professor of the University of New York economy.
Hepatitis: When should you go to the doctor?
In the world about 50 million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and chronic liver disease in Hungary is considered one of the main causes of death.
The number of infected people in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand receive treatment because many of the patients do not know that they are infected.
The name of hepatitis is the common name of different liver diseases caused by viruses.
The symptoms are very similar; they are characteristic of the infection of the liver and the ecteric, but their pathogens and occasional diseases are very different.
Hepatitis virus depending on the pathogen agent is spread through two main forms: hepatitis A and E via food (e.g. with water or contaminated food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body humor (esperma, vaginal humor, saliva).
Travellers are recommended to be protected by vaccine against virus A and B, against C no vaccines.
The symptoms of hepatitis A occur two or three weeks after consumption of the infected food, manifested by a poor general state, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After this appears in the skin and in the white of the eyes icterity, the excretion becomes clear, the dark color origin and the healing can last even two to three weeks.
Each year, one million people die in cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to calculations, only 1 in 10 infected people receive pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: hepatic cirrhosis and even cancer may occur without treatment.
Most of the infected people do not know that they are sick because this pathological agent in the form of paulatin destroys the liver cells and often the first symptoms appear only 20-30 years later.
It is therefore very important for early recognition, systematic medical control.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently there are about 200 million people in the world who suffer from chronic hepatitis C.
Since this disease can also be discovered with routine laboratory control, it is worth consulting the family doctor when experiencing some unknown symptoms.
The disease has treatment if it is discovered in time, it is possible to eliminate the organism's virus, thereby eliminating the infection and preventing cancer.
30 September is the World Hepatitis Day, which was organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its aim is to address the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of their early recognition.
Do you not feel sorry for those who believe in God?
According to a recent study, religious faith has a calming effect that also eased the death of Catholic martyrs.
The scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed how religious belief influences human suffering - reported the British Telegraph.
Within the framework of this unique experiment, they applied electric shock to 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists, while they were all looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
As a result, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the human brain scan technique, it was possible to verify that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first of the research series in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the various departments of the University also participate.
The analysis took place in the following way; they set up an instrument pointing to the left hand of the patient, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look at two paintings; the Virgin María, the work of the 17th century Sassoférat and the Dama de armament de Leonardo da Vinci of the 15th century.
The researchers hoped that the show of the Virgin Mary would cause a certain religious spirit among the faithful, as long as they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and thought it had a comforting effect.
Patients spent half an hour on an MRI scanner, receiving electrical shocks in four successive parts during that period while observing religious or other themes.
Catholics said that looking at the Virgin Mary felt "security" as "protected", "they were comforted and in their hearts there was peace."
On observing the religious theme, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, believes that with any such impressive image, a similar effect can be achieved with the atoms too, only the proper image must be found.
"We should find the portrait of a person who feels very positive, like a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
English bishop Tom Wright observed the results of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases truly change our personality," Wright added.
After these awesome results, there is only one question: What effect would it have on the regulation of pain if the Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of his style were shown to his loyal ones?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary still bring even better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
In its 10th birthday Google can say: you can be found both in the pocket of people and in the sky above your head; you know where your holidays took place, what doctors visit and what they care about.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's executives, this is not enough.
On the other hand, the sceptics that make a comparison with the Orwellian vision do not see the essence of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently announced in the Financial Times newspaper that Google's main goal is to collect as many personal data as possible on its users, and this is necessary to meet the original goals of Google Founders: "We gather all the information in a system!".
According to Google's leader, the company even after ten years of work that has been in the world is still at the initial stage of the effort to process all information.
To the question what's going to happen within five years Schmidt answered as follows: whether Google could answer questions like "What to do tomorrow?" or "What would be the job that would best convince me?" - however, the software will not be able to answer questions as simple as there are not enough information for users.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their browsing on the Network, the keywords sought, IP addresses and pages around have been stored precisely when the search ended.
Thanks, for example to Personalized Search that started two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can re-examine what they were looking for, what they opened up and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized search - in this same logic the Recommendations will be based on, in which the system will offer us products and services based on the previously defined and stored preferences.
What will happen if my data is used against me, if they collect information about my activities? - those who are concerned about Google's information monopolies.
In most cases the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not punishment, fear of punishment, jealousy for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is already confirmed that not only do they preserve, but in case of justification, they also give to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing to protect the personal rights of Internet users.
The most debated example of recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google gave the Brazilian government information on its website, Orkut, to identify pedophiles.
On the other hand, Internet users concerned about human rights were relieved in May when the company together with the EFF, an organization for the protection of electronic rights, demonstrated successfully to the court that was justified in its dispute with the FBI: According to the judgment, Google will not be obliged by any of the constitutional points of the constitution to provide any type of information requested in secret by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government was able to achieve its goal of strengthening the Child Protection Act adopted years ago, about fifty thousand Web addresses and some thousands of searches, but not to obtain individual user search lists, nor to complete lists of Web pages and keywords in the last two months.)
That is how much contradiction is the opinion about Google: those who fear to provide their personal data are critical because they think that their privacy, their private life is damaged when they start using Google's services, and they rebel against it as against the multinational companies of conservative image.
Meanwhile, the North American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, netizens and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "branguarding" not their rival, Microsoft, which is categorized by their Windows as the winner of the World, because they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for its applications, the code is open and the free program package, constantly updated and seems younger, more cooperative than the official software giant's practice.
But it can also be because the geek see precisely the very problematic relationship between people's rights and the Internet that has just been produced by one of the key words mentioned in recent years: the Web 2.0.
The web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intended needles behind us and using available communication channels, and while these measures vary individually, the essence remains the same: show us ourselves.
A normal youth can have a profile on many collective pages, from Facebook to Yanga, and can even combine them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm that offers a list of their music habits, then they can include them in a follow-up system such as FriendsFeed or Blip.fm, and they can also have a blog, where they automatically show the latest photo gallerys stored in Flickr or Picasa.
We can know a number of cases of what happens to the bride, for example, when she sees the stream of photographs of the next morning of the common friends, she meets who spent the night her false boyfriend or they can send her employee to a company because she writes her honest opinion on the company's direction: one thing is sure, the definition of private life was completely revaluated.
A person's "on line" life is what she shows herself - this is the definition that is hidden behind the behavior of our youth today.
And whoever wants to hide something, or at least wants to hide Google's monopoly, can do it (starting for example with the Scroogle that uses Google's search system, but don't leave holes).
There are many people who do not want to register on the collective pages to avoid finding them, but they can replace Google's "on-line" applications, from text editing software to image and reading news applications with alternative versions that do not connect with giant servers or prepare the most perfect profile on us.
The public opinion awaits almost the day when Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), the advertising areas of AdWords/AdWithout jeopardising the revenue of advertising agencies, while services that are increasingly introduced cause serious head pain not only for Microsoft but also for many other software developers.
Critic observers, however, will also find alarming contradictions: for example, the senior director rejected the protest of employees after doubleing the price of the company's child custody, considered too far from the limited number of employees' food, but all of this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google submitted to the pressure of the Chinese government and the company, according to the agreement, filtered all information that violates the good moral and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal regulations says that they will not announce any new service with advance, but only when you are ready to work, what if you are sure is that the expected problems of the next months and years can turn to the World: while some believe that the project of scan and archive of books and magazines of Google will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be mentioned by the U.S. Supreme Court, other issues of its health system, because in it we can create our own comprehensive health profile, with previous analyses, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, it can provide a good raw material for fictional science writers, the Scroogled, a novelist of the people of Cory Doctorow, describes this future in Orwellian form, in which a man only of Google's data can be described alarmably well.
Two minors helped remove the needles to the author of the second murder in the city of Ozd.
The police asked two minors about the double murder of Ózd who, according to the underlying suspect, helped to remove the crime's waves - said the Commissioner-General for Public Order of the province of Borsod on Tuesday.
Young people recognized the crime that had been imposed on them, and are now accused of crime offenders.
The two minors - according to information from the Hungarian News Agency - are two girls - can be defended free.
They can receive up to 5 years of prison.
The charge of the double murder of Ózd - a 23-year-old man - has been in pretrial detention since Sunday.
He is accused of murdering several people with premeditation and by code.
Research revealed that 23-year-olds had a large sum of 53-year-olds.
The accused did not want to pay his debt, so the Wednesday last week quoted his creditor at the headquarters of a company in Ózd, where he killed him and then killed the 9-year-old daughter of the victim.
According to information from the ILO, the young man was prepared long ago to commit the crime, as he committed murder with a previously hidden weapon in the scene of the crime.
The police analyze with a gun expert and the circumstances of their use.
The Bolsa de Warsaw presented an offer to buy the Bolsa de Prague
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - by hundreds of percent of the actions of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish people, although the Czechs previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Volsa de Warsaw is in the hands of the state.
99 per cent of the actions are in the hands of the Polish State which, within a few months, wants to sell 60 per cent of the shares.
The Czech economic newspaper E15 reported that the Polish offer had been the highest among those offered by interested parties by the Bolza de Prague.
According to the Czech press, they have so far offered the Bolsa de Vienna, the Transatlantic Bols Nasdaq, the Stock Exchange of New York, the Bols of London and the Deutsche Börse.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Valores Bolsa, declared last week that among the most interested, the new owner would be the Valores Bolsa de Warsaw and did not take away the possibility that, in the future, the Prague Valores Bolsa would disappear.
Experts estimate the value of Prague's Bolsa in some 5 to 10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders agreement, approximately 90 per cent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Investment Bank Patria Finance with a participation of approximately 25 percent, followed by the Bank Ceská Sporitelna with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of European press
The main European journals in their March comments dedicated to the increasingly deep international financial crisis speak of a "second 11 September".
The global financial disaster is due to the US President - the Republic of Rome - the President has not been able to even get the support of his own party for the bill that has been made too much, whose aim is to solve this desperate situation...
Instead of a new Pearl Habor, of which the multimillionaire investor Warren Buffett spoke, it is more appropriate to speak of a "second of September 11th".
According to a part of the Madrid press, Washington is the spy.
In the view of the World, the failure of the United States political leadership was what led to the world economy on the edge of abesmism.
The risk of the demorrhage of the North American monetary system is growing increasingly, and this will affect the whole world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the Congress vote the danger arises that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air - just when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is carried out.
This threat cannot be ignored - point out the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still draw salvation belts to the tambaling financial institutions, thus saving them from debt with the money of contributors.
But if the domains are still more banking, then they will no longer be sufficient neither the new funds nor the new improvisations.
It is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to abandon their nationalist selfishness and concentrate control over fragmented financial markets.
The financial institutions in the crisis received only more than €100 billion Monday - recalls the Der Standard veins, adding that there is more and more real concerns that, as the Americans did, European taxpayers should also pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU has not so far been seriously affected by the crisis that takes place as a precedent for the Continental Age .
"savers" will not have to immediately present hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use the funds of contributors to prevent a bad increase?
The smart car imitates the flight of the best
What would be the best way to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not imitating the sensors of natural obstacles?
For example, it's the favorites.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the beneficiaries gave the start point for the Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
The Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the robotic driving system of type BR23C model of nature, which gave him the characteristics of the favorites, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can blind all colleges.
During the flight each improver created its own ovarian special space that actually looks very much like our security security caps – explained at the Kazuhhiro Doi exhibition, RP Technology Director and Development and Research.
They play an important role in the eyes of the wellmen who are able to see in all directions in an angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the composite eyes, engineers used the laser beam measurement system.
This identifies the obstacles ahead of the BR23C within a distance of 2 metres, in an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the vehicle's microprocessor that immediately turns into a manual to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds, the obstacle is identified, and then the vehicle's robot imitates the movements of the goods, changing the direction by turning to the extent necessary the wheels.
Unlike any existing system, this manoeuvre is entirely instinctive.
"If not, the vehicle's robot could not respond to enough speed to overcome the obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the safety capsule, in a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what an improvement is in order to blind others.
This process must be performed in an open and close eyes.
However, unlike the beneficiaries, movement cannot be directed up, down or diagonally, but can only be bidimensional and only in the direction of the wheel rotation.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities available for the well-being to hide other well-beings, they used here only as a possibility for the car robot the rotary movement and acceleration in addition to the brake.
The BR23C uses litio polymer batteries that are lighter and their energy density is higher, which means they have a longer life span than the lithium ion.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the ability to process data, nor much less the storage capacity.
This device in every second only has to process some input signals and react as appropriate.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on data from previous manoeuvres, thus using only a few decades of kilobytes of memory.
No memory of gigabytes or megabytes is required.
This is the first step towards developing technology to immediately remove obstacles, which, according to Nissan's calculations, can be incorporated into models made in series within ten years.
Another possibility for your application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to lead the driver to its destination, hiding existing obstacles in your path.
You've got a name for this dear child.
The written version of the financial savings package of $700 billion has been prepared, which will be implemented in several phases with a view to purchasing bank credit.
In the first phase, half of the money will be spent.
According to the time of the east coast during the new consultations that took place until after midnight, the convention leaders reached an agreement on the financial savings package of $700 billion in total, after several days of discussion - Reuters reported.
We have made significant progress - said Nancy Pelosi, a democratic president of the North American Congress, saying that the agreement is only to be formalised in a document.
The compromise on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, Minister of Finance, speaking about the outcome of the commitment, said that this programme will work and be effective but more action is needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street but about giving it back to the economy car.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, i.e. Sunday before the 8th of the night, according to Washington time (or before the two Monday mornings, according to Central Europe time), without causing a spectacular jump in the bags.
On the draft law called emergency law for the financial stabilization of 2008, Monday will vote for the North American Congress and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush consulted with Pelosi on Saturday night, and then the White House also heard news about the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made during the night and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy - Tony Fratto, the spokesman for the White House.
The programme is different from the original Bush administration's proposal to spend all $700 billion on purchasing securities of poor quality credit.
Only half of $700 billion can now be spent, using $250 billion immediately after the Congress vote, probably Monday, of which the Ministry of Finance will buy securities of credit, ill-qualification and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the decision of the President.
This programme will be controlled by a special agency, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of $700 billion may be spent after a new decision of the Congress.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance may apply a combined tactic: it may simultaneously buy bad credit, mortgages and securities of credit fund values, as well as other "venous" type of credit.
The purchase can be done either directly or indirectly - they informed the competent authorities of the ministry.
The law enables affected companies to participate in a security programme where the fund card guarantees the concerns, for which companies will pay the amount for the expected damages.
Henry Paulson stated: the law thus guarantees the necessary financial resources, which can reach up to $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the North American financial system, the treatment of the purchase of bad financial resources, its insurance or the prevention of risks that could lead to the depletion of some large financial institutions.
We do all we can to be ready to introduce the law as it has been added.
On the contrary, the heads of banks who are in trouble and expect State assistance may be able to account for the official limitation of their compensation, which the American argot simply calls gold parachutes.
Payments will only be limited in certain cases, as well as limitations will depend on the form of aid from the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys in the framework of a substation, an extra tax will be imposed on gold parascads, unless the failed chief of the bank is released.
When buying bad credit directly, the Government will act aggressively to ensure that the remuneration of the chiefs is not excessive.
In addition to the above, there will be no change in existing gold parachute contracts, the limitations refer only to new contracts to stimulate participation in the programme as well.
This is the first case in North America's history that will be a legal limitation on the revenue of the Directors-General - said Democrat Barney Frank, president of the Congress Committee, responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares of participating banks in the programme, thus reducing the risk of contributors, as they can ultimately gain gains from the transaction in recovery of the economy and with it the bank.
Under the draft law in the next five years, the President shall submit to the Congress a proposal on how to bring back to contributors the losses of the financial sector.
Of course on both sides there were those who expressed their reservations with regard to the project.
This is not what North American citizens have told us, that is, the contributors' dollars are not being protected - said the Republican congressman of California, Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague of Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said: the measures urged the same ones responsible for the demolition of Wall Street.

The highest price of plastic and chemical base materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical production branch (1.6 per cent).
A decrease in price in the petrochemical sector (1.4 per cent), in the production of electrical machinery and instruments (0.9 per cent), as well as - at least - in the wood processing sectors (0.1 per cent).
They did not change the prices of paper production, editors and printers.
In the rest of the processing industry, price increases were recorded between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the supply of electricity, gas, heat and water that represent an important weight within internal trade, an increase of 0.3 per cent was recorded in August, primarily as a result of the increase in official prices from the first July.
In comparison with a 12-month period - in domestic sales of the processing industry sectors - the largest price increase was recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4 per cent).
In the metal manufacturing sector, an increase of 13.2 per cent was observed, while in the food, drink and tobacco industry there was an increase of 11 per cent.
Price reductions were recorded in the textile industry (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machinery and instruments (0.3 per cent).
In the rest of the processors, the rate of price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.

Will the next year no longer be required to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes there are many possibilities for the North American-Hungary visa exemption agreement to enter into force on 12 January – the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spoke about it in Chicago, in front of Hungarian residents there.
In its opinion, "in practice everything depends on the time being built on the other side of the Atlantic the electronic system of access and control".
At the same time, he warned that in the new system the entry premium would disappear, but tourists should be registered before their departure from the country of origin.
From now on, the head of Hungarian diplomacy keeps conversations in Washington.
He will interview with the State Secretary of Condoleezza Rice by handing over the Mediterranean Cross with the Star of the Republic of Hungary's Merit Order and supporting negotiations with the international policy advisers of candidates to the presidency, the Barack Obama Democrat and the Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favour of the bank's financial savings package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates to the presidency of the two great North American parties, gave their support on Sunday to the $700 million bank assistance programme, but there are politicians that require the Minister of Finance's exemption.
The representatives of the Congress and the administration, after negotiations of several days of marathon type, announced on Sunday morning: a principle agreement was reached on the bank's financial savings package.
The financial package aimed at solving the Wall Street crisis and decolonizing the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Obama and McCain want to prove that they are more capable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, by putting the economic issues first, Obama again gained a certain advantage and lost McCain's advantage after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin's candidate to the vice-presidentship.
In a myth of Detroit campaign, held last Sunday, Obama expressed its hope that Congress would soon adopt the law on the $700 billion package.
He stressed that the proposal included those consumer protection points, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and with responsibility (...) is in danger of employment, the saving of you. In addition to entire industries and the stability of the whole economy," he said to a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not take advantage of the opportunity to qualify as an obsolet for McCain's economic concepts.
In an interview given to ABC McCain, he explained that "all of us will bring this to severe punishment (...) but doing nothing is simply not a viable path."
The Republican Senator said that the proposal included the establishment of a control committee to the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the remuneration of executives, which he stressed.
Obama told the CBS that McCain did not play any important role in the consultations, but he consulted the minister daily.
Congress President Nancy Pelosi stated on Sunday that Congressmen would probably vote on the bill on Monday.
German-speaking printing journal
The right group is intact, only within the group were the most conscious electors - Der Spiegel says about the weak electoral outcome of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a rojinic coalition.
Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the German left-hand magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Baviera Revolution Destroys Its Parents" analyzes the reasons for the CSU's broken drama.
According to the well-known politician, CSU erosion had begun long before the sad two Beckstein-Huber had assumed its role.
Social Christians have been developing in Bavaria for several decades - and just now these modern citizens are the ones who support it.
The change of one era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but the Sunday ended a process that had been planned for nearly ten years: the indisputable hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU received 47.7 per cent, for the first time in less than 50 per cent since the fifty years .
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. during the so-called Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the subsequent modernization of the CSU in the depletion province of its progenitors .
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but in the pace they have made a lot of mistakes. However, the secularization, the results of the education and settlement of the Germans of the North in the Baviera developed regions have had a negative impact on the integrity of the CSU voters.
Modernization also increases the possibilities and it also has political consequences.
The right group is intact, only within its own group have become the most conscious, more critical, and more tested voters.
It is surprising that in the last few weeks, just the conventional groups of citizens were those who left more than the CSU; the autonomouss, the small industrial ones, the ones who had bachillerate and the diplomats.
This resulted in a reduction of less than 40 per cent of CSU support.

Vienna's Conservative Journal: "Who with whom? In its article entitled "The presidents of the parties are very reserved for coalition issues" - it is concerned about the confusion of internal policy after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the OVP.
The OVP prohibits SSPÖ in its internal affairs.
BZÖ shows openness in all directions to negotiate, greens in exchange still do not wish to consult on coalition.
The elections were already held, now all around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the leaders of the parties just left a look at their flags.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to negotiate with the ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible - that is already in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left the question that if you could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, in the vice-canceller post.
He claimed that in any case they did not approve Schüssel-Molter's era.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Mulder reacted cautiously to red bids.
He said that the cooperation would certainly not be successful if Faymann tried to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
It is still open in the party if they choose the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must be discussed no doubt within the ÖVP itself.
The President of BZÖ, Jörg Haider, showed openness in all directions.
"To prevent red-black coalition, we are willing to assume the responsibility of the government," said Haider.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has been launched in Paris, its host is France, which is also the President of the European Union this year.
Lívia Járóka, a member of the European People's Party by the Fidesz, in his message addressed to the whole, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, called attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that afflict the Roma children, and it is also the biggest obstacle to the prevalence of their interests.
This high-level conference was launched - on behalf of the French Presidency - by the French Minister of Employment and Social Affairs Xavier Bertrand and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European social rights protection organizations.
Járóka - according to the press office of the Group of Members of the Fidesz in the European Parliament - warned that, in addition to discrimination in employment, the Gitans remain out of the labour market first by their low level of education.
"Most young Gitans have not finished secondary education and because of the poor quality of basic education, only a significant part can get university diplomas."
Járóka further stressed that education, as fundamental human rights, has a decisive role to play in the premise of other human rights as well.
Investing in the education of Gytan children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to make these issues fully understood between both the Gitan and the non-Gitan.
As soon as the school starts a guitar student, he will have more opportunities to become an active member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"The Gitans, as citizens of the European Union, must ensure the right to quality education and ensure the abolition of segregated and low-level education," said Lívia Járóka.
According to the MEP, the European Union's objective and active unit is needed to accelerate the process of school disintegration immediately, so it is essential that the proper implementation of existing and planned anti-discrimination directives be carried out.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, and we must offer the children of the Gitan to guarantee the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens of full rights," Járóka demanded.
The aim of the European Summit on Equal Opportunities organized annually since the Berlin meeting last year, which was held in the sign of the European Year of Equal Opportunities, is to ensure a single forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equality of opportunities at European and national level by Member States.
CSU: thanks for a transitional period
At the end of October a decision will be taken on the success of the failed Duo Huber-Beckstein
Despite the serious electoral defeat, heads have not yet been cut on the heads of the poor CSU, the debate on personal issues has been postponed.
Erwin Huber, president of the party and Günther Beckstein, the first provincial minister is still in his positions, but he does not know how long the grace will last.
The success of the two, which suffered an electoral defeat of 17 per cent, will be determined at the special convention of the party to be held at the end of October.
Integraters of the so-called two were left to intervene: they won't get so attached to their positions.
They thus sought to calm the angry members of their parliamentary group and their basic organization, who one day after the "baby tsunami" claimed personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under the direction of Edmund Stoiber who was at the top of his career - the social union reached 60.7 percent, in turn now, a year after the attacks against Stoiber, only 43.4%.
CSU for 46 years had "monopolio" in Bavaria, which gives 18 percent of German GDP.
Although in the province of the South, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to dominate, in the future they must be co-alienated with someone.
As the first sign of the restructuring of the party, Vice-President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister of Agriculture, one of Huber's potential successors, also has a position in the reduced intelligence group that begins negotiations with the Liberal FDP and the Free Right-Electors on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The stranger to the destination is that on the list of the Free Elections, Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was used for the attack by the Duo Huber-Beckstein, and then seriously deleted from the scene to the ambitious local policy.
The CSU's top leaders are now investing all their energy to stabilize Beckstein.
The transition will also have an active role to play by Stoiber that has so far been moving in the background, the former provincial government chief and former president of the CSU qualified on 28 September as the worst day of his political career.
Monday Huber made some critical comments to the CDU, in his view it would have deserved much more support from the brother-in-law party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and to Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the elections in September 2009 of the Bundestag, Merkel cannot be cancelled if they are not able to highlight with the CSU that played a transcendental role in the success of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, in the long term, he could hide his disappointment because of his failure, the loss of the CSU would not have a negative impact on the great Berlin coalition.
What is, of course, relative: it will not be easier to deal with the injured CSU and the crisis of social democracies continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
The opposition of Lukashenko: 110-0
After Sunday's elections, there will be no opposition in the Belarusian Parliament.
According to the Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability guaranteed in the country by Alexandr Lukashenko, in exchange for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which is better explained by the violations of the law committed during the time of the vote.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the electoral outcome.
Although the legislation of the country of 10 million people, integrated by hundreds and ten Members, has not been opposed for more than a decade, prior to the elections of the United Nations Democratic Forces (ODSZ) yesterday, it was hoped that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the 2006 elections of questionable legitimacy, as a result of the amendment to the Constitution, would "allow" the entry of some Members of the opposition to Parliament.
So ODSZ removed the boyot that he originally wanted to do.
At the bottom of the expectations of the opposition was what Belarus, which is increasingly dependent on Russia - which has taken a credit to moderate imports of natural gas increasingly in Russia and which has contributed to the sale of the Beltransgaz, the gas pipeline that goes through the country - wanted to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not allow it to enter Lukashenko and other high-level policies by having a policy regime considered anti-democratic.
It was a sign of isolation when the OSCE, when assessing the electoral campaign, placed a better focus on positive phenomena and not on errors - such as the prohibition of participation in a third of the candidates for the opposition.
However, the OSCE's initial Monday report criticized even the campaign itself - in which the candidates for the opposition could not appear in the press - and in particular that opposition could not be present in the contents of the votes.
With this in view of the opposition, there is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus is theoretically a federal state - a month ago considered both regions as independent.
- We have taken two steps forward and one backward, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has been started - said our newspaper Alexandr Millinkevich.
According to the candidate for the 2006 presidential election opposition, it is desirable to maintain this situation, although "the regime is afraid to allow such an opposition to enter that Parliament without weight".
The opposition did not intend to organize protests to see the results, but rather to try to bring to the voters their message about the need for economic reforms.
- This clearly causes many problems because we must print the pressure of opposition in Russia, the local authorities make it difficult for them to distribute, but I also see that they are increasingly those who support the change among older people also - Milinkevich said, suggesting that the Lukashenko regime, which believes that its main result is the creation of social security, does not consider it appropriate even for young people, who are officially the most subsidized by the regime.
Due to the country's debt and the increase in trade deficit, it is only a matter of time for the decomposition of social security that "it seems to be the silence of cemeteries" - Milinkevich said.
Russian observers, in contrast to the opposition's policy, qualified as democratics to the elections.
Sergei Lebedev, Head of the Mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People don't believe in words but in facts", so the lack of opposition is nothing but testimony to the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on it's difficult before you start working"
It has never happened in the History of Chigi Palace that will set automatic doors to control the entry and exit of staff.
But from today it starts with this measure against who cut and then goes to the bar to take a coffee in working hours.
This novel has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The automatic doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services," the minister needs.
"Now a new period of responsibility and transparency is opened.
This is Reformism," he once said again, Brunetta.
With Palacio Chigi, the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from the symbolic point of view".
No resistance has been found by employees, the Secretary-General ensures: "There has been a change shared by workers and there has been collaboration among them".
Finally, no more breakfast in working hours; no more coffee and mediocre.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a good capuchin at 7:00 a.m. is a holy hand."
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
of Rome, the minister stated that "in three months the absence of public employees from diseases has been reduced by 50%, i.e. 60 000 more people per year".
And he adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more effective
Italian, "which wage dynamics – explains the Minister – in the last 8-10 years have been double with regard to the private sector and well above the inflation rate."
For now, millions of public employees have joined in opposing the rules of the Brunetta decree, in response to the request supported by the Codakons.
"As the Minister of the Public Service shows the numbers, the less austism of work due to disease – writes the association of consumers – the people of the 'vago workers' are increasing continually.
In fact, in Italy, there are millions of employees of the right and productive public administration who have been united to declare war against the illegal norms of the decree."
In particular, the Tar is opposed to the exclusion of economic treatment aggregated by illness due to service; the extension of the time limits in which medical visits to the sick person are made, and other aspects contained in the new provisions required by the Minister.
Labour accidents, Napolitan: "Crucial Prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail's data effectively confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and cause almost twice the deaths in respect of homicides.
To call attention to the institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic issue, Anmil now celebrates the 58th national anniversary of the victims of labour accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October in all the provinces of Italy.
"The worrying data spread by Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm how crucial it is to prevent work," said the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitan, in the message sent to the President of Anmil, National Association, Amiled and Incapacitated by Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expressed his appreciation for the ongoing partnership effort in favour of prevention at the workplace, protection of injured workers, assistance to victims' families and awareness-raising of public opinion.
"It has been shown, a 'a lot', which is truly shared, in the face of tragedies that, in its size, cause the media to complain and participate in public opinion, but the daily reality proposes dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics."
Napolitan does not hide that "there is no doubt a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
In part, they take the many initiatives promoted in the school field for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is a duty to keep the attention of the phenomenon alive, not to suppress the alarm about social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
For its part, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber has stressed " how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which undermines the consciousness of each of us and imposes a decisive effort on all institutions to put an immediate end to it."
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a mild positive walk, but this does not leave the number of white deaths equally impressive," noted the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want, in fact, that this "deduction tendency" is translated into less attention, because it is just when attention decreases that triggers tragedy.
"We believe that at the general level it is still too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be carried out through multiple actions.
It is necessary, in our view, to highlight Mercandelli – more controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this is from the school world " .
"It serves a further effort - it has added - as it involves communication and public opinion awareness.
But, above all, it serves a greater sense of responsibility for employers in relation to a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidial protection envisaged for the victims of work" and "the desensitization of assistance towards which the system is heading in recent years".
"The aim is to repay the worker the insurance guarantee - it has been added – because the happiness of the person who happens does not have to depend on the timely provision made by the legislator every time."
Mp3 readers under charges, risk hearing
Listening to high volume music for a long time using portable music devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent injury to the audience.
This is the case with the European Commission, which, in a communication published in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Commission on the emerging and recently identified health risks (Csseri) of the Ue, published today.
"From this scientific opinion – read in the note – it comes from 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than one hour a day having the high volume device, risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am concerned that such a high number of young people who often use portable music devices and high-level audio-telephones can unwittingly ruin their hearings in an irremediable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"Of the scientific evidence – follow Ue's responsibility – is a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What is important is raising awareness of consumers and making this information public.
In addition to the existing systems of control in the light of this scientific opinion, we must examine them in order to be widely effective and to take the step with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to consider the problem, seeing the great use of portable musical instruments and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise that was caused by this.
"Scientists - end up with the Ue Executive – confirm that it is a cause of concern and the European Commission will now consider with the Member States and interested parties the measures that may be taken to better protect children and adolescents from the noise from portable musical devices and related devices."
At present, there is already a standard of European safety that limits 100 dB to the noise level of portable musical devices, but concerns increase as the hearing damage that may result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit many of these damages by resorting to solutions such as lowering levels and time of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee notes that when users of portable musical instruments listen to high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours per week, they exceed the current current limit on the maximum noise allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such longer periods are at risk of permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
It means that 5-10% of the users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Ue.
Rome, Germany leads the Commission to the future of capital
Today begins, in March, the accounts will be taken into account in June.
This is the calendar set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Committee for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which has been established this morning at their new headquarters behind the Caracalla Terms.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other members of the Commission will discuss the main points for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the meeting and the community council will evaluate analyses and projects, so as to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official well" of the municipality and its intention Gianni Germano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – in order to underline Germany – It will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the meeting and the municipal council can then be evaluated.
There is no more role position, only the desire to have a place where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March the work will disappear, because this experience must have a precise time-limit.
In June – the intention is announced – we will present the strategic plan using the Commission's work for the future of Rome's capital."
To whom the Commission claims to be useless, since its opinions are not binding, Germany answers: "All depends on the work that the Commission will be able to carry out and the quality of its proposals.
If quality is present, as well as in France with the Italian Commission and as I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be essential.
The policy is almost always spread in ordinary management and in emergencies which are re-examination.
We, on the contrary, want to look further beyond and for a long time, in a deeper perspective, working with seriousness in the development of Rome and its future."
The intention of Rome is also to point out that "this Commission is not a useless entity or a ban: it is absolutely free, it does not cost a euro to Roman citizens and will serve to participate and reason on the best ways to express capital".
For Germany, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immoble, in order to allow our city to make a genuine level leap, of which we have absolute need, thinking with a single spirit to its future."
A future that, needs the intention of Rome" would not only be limited to the current municipal boundaries but would look further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of capital but "also considering the role that Rome can and must develop as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first American president.
He wrote an American political note that interests him as independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the US economy and tube relations (as it does today with private citizens) with the enemy Islam".
The attacks against Obama increased as the election date approached.
Miami's wife wrote on a Web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big stone face: he thinks he will win the highest rank of the nation that has had two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, they are attacks that do not say much; they are clearly racist attacks and do not answer the electoral question: Will they be a good president? And they are also the probes; they all say that Obama wins and with a good advantage.
There are also those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the interiors of the southern United States, wrote an editorial: once in the cabin to vote we will know who will vote for the American patriot.
Get out one side of the American mentality covered up to the last one.
"Do what they want, we'll think about where to put the cross, whether about Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if he comes to win Obama, we're going to America.
things you've never said before, which seems almost certain of the success of the black candidate.
Despite all these reasons, however, the winning weapon for democratics is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his mandate? 89 percent replied: Iraq.
America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and sent her home to the rear.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and Americans have not been forced to make the elections.
Similarly, Iraq for the majority has been the weak point of Bush.
Whoever assumes George W's position will have a huge duty to develop.
Use, the economic collapse is also felt for journalists: in newspapers it's time to cut. Many blame the Internet, "sex" of the printed paper.
Fifteen American journalists have been interviewed by PEW Research Center on the state of their profession and mental control for the future.
However, today journalists are almost all pessimists about their future.
However, journalists have not openly declared less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem for U.S. journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a devastating economic model crisis.
In addition, the cuts made in the room where the editors work to carry out the newspaper are a major problem.
It is a problem to be resolved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as it is understood by the majority of the public is substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today about the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is following a wrong path.
In the local field, the executive group is 65 per cent.
Printing against issue.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the website goes.
The biggest editorial houses open a break on the Internet, for many view as the "assino" of the business letter.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn has increased to 79 per cent.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are exploiting technology in the hope of "doing something good" by journalism.
The biggest rotor in American journalism today is among those who run newspapers – whether the directors – and journalists who work for them.
56 per cent of national executives are sure that their journalists share the same values, while at local level the percentage falls to 23 per cent.
For some, this has to be done with "work safety".
Executives who consider losing their job in 3 years are 47 per cent at national level.
For the periodic staff is 30%.
The "secure work" at staff level (our editors, etc.) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13 per cent of journalists work with a contract.
In a large nation like the United States, with 300 million people and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and so become a question of "tomorrow or leave it".
Directors receive almost always good wages, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, but social retirement and insurance.
For holidays, reasoning is complicated: a total of days the first year, another after the third to complete 15 days after a certain number of years.
But U.S. journalists, by their admission, are "infirmed" followed during the year.
It's all a climate issue.
UNIPOL: ROMEO TRIBUNAL, DANILO COUPOL IN GROTTAFERRATE
The President of the second criminal section of the Roman court, Carmelo Rinaudi, has decided to reject the instance of the real estate officer Danilo Coppola who had asked for permission to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Copple this bank-rolled survey in the field of anti-contract research on the Unipol-Bnl scale.
In the course of the arrest process , last week , he was released from home, transforming it into a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate owner to travel the city of the province to a capital room.
According to the court, these trips (for which pm has voted against) would allow you to influence your society and access the evidence they accuse you of.
The elites at risk
The phenomenon had already appeared a few days ago with the vote of the representatives' room against the $700 million rescue plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
It gives us a confirmation of the New York Times yesterday informing us that the current crisis is in the hands of the Republican party, which is increasingly divided between its old soul in the East, moderate, favourable to federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, in exchange, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and the world of finance, especially in the states of the Central and South.
The soul, in fact, has become prepotential with the vote of who spoke at the beginning.
This is just an example of the mutations, of the major mutations, which the current economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the West but not only here.
Whether in the United States or in Europe, the crisis has long seemed to work as an acceleration of inflation phenomena that with the new climate are solidified and brought to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-update, the extraordinary re-activation, of the dual state-Sovereignity category in relation to a re-nationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis is a crisis of banking institutions which have strong financial relations with the outside, but above all, the balance of families living in a single country and in a single state are much more committed.
What creates an immediate political problem for those who rule it: how to respond to the difficulty and protests of those people and of those families who, on the other hand, are electors.
The crisis appears economically global but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism appears to be essentially out of play or has little to say: the crucial proof is that the European Union is always divided between the different interests and the different state strategies cannot decide any policy in common.
It is from the Government of each state that all are expected to intervene, rescue and re-activation plans, new rules and, above all, fund-subsidisation: from the time it comes to the court, it is only the state that has economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy matters.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimation to use them: two quantifiable value resources, values in certain circumstances in which no market is likely to exist and no organization can ever be available in the same measure.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the state of the nation is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance whenever the new economic development tends to assign it to a factor that is very linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradisely, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of technology ever more sophisticated, of inmaterials, while we were convinced that global finance was already intended to dominate the world, we realized that our future will have a change in how much more we have to do with little material things like water, crops and oil.
All things that can certainly be transported from one place to the other of the earth but are also absolutely united in a circuit, a territory.
So whoever is found to be sovereign, he certainly has many more letters with regard to him who is not, and to whom he has the disgrace of living in a place without cultivation, without oil and without water.
I'm coming to the second novelty, but I'm having a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics and Leaderage.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective consciousness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who is unable to take into account the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of mistrust for existing leaders, of a perceived economic nature which is inadequate with many dark areas.
And together with something deeper and in some disturbing sense: a mistrust, intolerance, an inappropriate image, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire class of Western countries in a growing number.
It seems to advance increasingly, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elite so far, the same way of feeling and being, in their culture with the comprehensive exception of the term, to have done their own time and to be more foreign to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in a few words, is subterraneanly fed by a ramaced but powerful movement of delegitimization of the leading classes and traditional political structures, which are demonstrated in a electoral "resurrection" or the sudden changes of collective humor in recent times, from the conservative exit in Austria to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the men of the American Congress against Bush (and also with the victory of the right in Italy which has something to see).
It has the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, their periodicals, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say something, make it increasingly difficult to understand and then represent, what has been taking shape since today is the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis is renewed, increasing and potentially rising.
In the face of all of this speaking of a "mass rebellion" today is fairly exaggerated.
But having your eyes open certainly is not.
The super footing to walk over the walls
Breaking the laws of gravity thanks to a great footing and in the future walking on the walls like the naked man.
It is the goal of several American research centres and a team of four institutions has now come quite close.
With an attachment of just 2.5 square inches [2.5 sq cm], scientists have been able to hold a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
EL STUDIO – The American magazine Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is an evolution of the existing ones using a particular carbon structure called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of pinging can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a spaghetti pile," explains zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of the geek, recovered by microscopic devices that can ensure perfect adhesion for the animal.
The tests on different materials, such as glass, teflon and line paper, have shown that the new attachment is ten times more powerful than the shoes of this reptil and at the same time "is easily dissipated from the walls" explains Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton Engineering University.
CHANGE FOR PAREDES? - "This material could be useful as a transitional attachment" adds Liming Dai.
Caps to walk through the walls just like the orange man? Caps. Yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use than the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are heat and electric current drivers.
Other applications might have to deal with air space engineering.
For the moment, none of the superheroes.
OTHER INVESTIGATION - The University of Berkeley, California, is also dedicated to the search for a new arrival.
In an article in the magazine American Chemical Society, Californian scholars have presented an adhesion made of microfibre like hair that cleanses dust during movement on a surface to maintain a perfect adhesion.
Pharmaceuticals: Never with fruit game
Attention to the game of pommel, naranja and manganese.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if they are taken concomitantly with some drugs, their absorption is altered by amplifiers or, as the case may be, the effectiveness with severe health consequences.
Repeating the risk of fruit games, freshly associated with the occupation of some medical professionals, David Bailey, professor of Western Ontario University in London, who has been sending a new alarm to Philadelphia since the 236th American Chemical Society's national meeting: a few pieces of pommel, orange and manganese games to reduce the absorption of some drugs, canceling the beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
The pomela game was already under charges because it was held responsible for increasing levels of toxicity some anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anesthetic, antihistamine and neurological medicinal products.
Pharmacos A RISGOS – The same Italian drug agency had reported in a package of information two years ago, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the risk of this mixture and to pay attention to what is being done if a drug is being taken, such as Diasepam or Metadone.
NOT only THE POMELO – Experts also believe that naranja and manganese play contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active principles inhibited by pommel and other games.
From here comes the call by Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the State University of Milan: "These findings are generally indicated to the various international and national drug agencies that are likely to change their information notes.
That is why we must always read the illustrated leaflets of the medicines that are being taken and if there is something that is not clear to us, don’t let us impress, ask the doctor or the pharmacist” said the expert of the Ansa Agency.
The New Economy in Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for Economics has been awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies, business models and for the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a Kenyan neo who teaches Princeton University and is an editorialist note from the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most critical decisions of Bush administration regarding the economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the attack on 11 September 2001, in those days that broke Enron, Krugman had planned in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the United States.
It is a forecast that many Polishs are emerging and that for several years wine has been reproducated to the economy, but that it has now been revealed.
"I am surprised and a little upset about how the memory of the Enron and Worldcom collapse scandal has quickly disappeared from public attention," Krugman had said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "great-value economist", but also a disclaimer with a very aggressive, particularly critical style against the excessive liberalism of Bush administration.
Open Office, here's the third edition of the "anti-Micro" package
It is the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the suite open source of personal productivity that aims to attract more and more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year's work on volunteer developers, whose support is being monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with a number of news: on the reception screen and on the smaller magazine interface, other consistent ones are added, such as the compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and the support for the new ODF(Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
Attention is also given to many functions with the Office 2007 support, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as those that allow you to reduce the size of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via e-mail, or the possibility to import the PDF file into the graphics module, preserving the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front you can create 'PDF hybrids' documents that accumulate the typical Adobe format graph with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text developer.
Cooperation is an element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the calculation sheet, several users can intervene, avoiding conflict of changes, in the drafting of texts, to each participant a color is given in the comment for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to perform some of the functions of OpenOffice to the Web (on the cloud, on the clouds), and in the coming weeks they should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/Download/0.0/Download300.html and added to the English found in the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
The request may also be sent to the installation cd at home or at work.
And if the free theme can be a trap for the distribution of houses, it is in business that Open Office is testing the follow-up, trying the great deal, and can already count on several projects undertaken in public administration and schools.
And they do not miss even the realities that offer an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, in which business prospects could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the text video the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the presentation of PowerPoint; Dbase, as in the case of known Access is the program that is capable of working on the base date; and finally Draw the graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that until today we have reached nearly 3 million 600 thousand, with the output of the new version it is likely that the expected figure can be exceeded.
Kohl also positive result is the fourth case of doping
A new positive case in the French tour: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third-classed and the winner of the highest ladder.
The news is the site of the newspaper The Team.
Kohl, 26 years old, is the fourth positive corridor to the third generation Epo, after the Italians Ricardo Rico and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also from the Gerolsteiner.
The analysis of Kohl's blood samples includes those carried out in the last few weeks in the laboratory of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the tests confirm that it is positive, Austria will lose the third position in the Tour and be angry with the two years of canonic disqualification.
To confirm Kohl's positive doping news to the third generation Epo is the head of the French antidoping agency Pierre Bordry, who has declared the Associated Press to have notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has been positioned in the podium on the shoulders of the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, helping to climb the top ladder.
Immigrants: NEW YORK TIMES IS PREGENT, ITALIA IS RACIST?
It has only recently been transformed into a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with hostility.
This is transforming the beautiful country into a nation of racists? Is that what New York Times is asking in a long article that has dedicated to the debate on racism in Italy starting with the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso who was murdered last month in Milan for stealing a gallery box.
This is evident from what New York Times defines as the "north paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where they are registered as "more integration and more work" but also the highest anti-immigrants feeling of the country and the highest support of the North League".
As evidence of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited the intolerance episodes in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
The new legislation of the Law also opened the bridge on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of clandestine prisoners is referred to as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
The trend is marked by the Pope, who by the President of the Republic: "George Napolitan, meeting Benedetto XVI at Congress, has asked the State and the church to work together to combat racism."
Students who are victims of expensive rentals, up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the last survey of the Sudanese union, renting an individual room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"the phenomenon has already taken very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study for a large part of young people at the highest cost that the family would have to support – explains the responsibility of the study office of Sonia, Laura Mariani – in these cities the demand has completely distorted the market to such an extent to trigger a process of generalised growth to residents."
On the other hand, in most cases rental offers contain a series of violations: free type contracts, unregistered, unlimited cannon, under linked rentals.
There is a need for exceptional intervention in order to regulate prices through the revision of tax tax.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, about 450 euros are served; for an individual room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Black zone) to a mean value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zone) to a maximum of 900 (Victoria zone).
In Florence a bed is costing an average of 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bolivia, where students focus on areas near the University, they serve €250/280 per bed in a double room and 370 to 500 per individual.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bolonia) they ask you about 600 euros for an individual room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros per individual room) in areas near other universities (Ostiense and Cinecity).
The economy is made only if the peripheral area is changed: 300 euros per bed and 450 per individual room in Prenestina, Centocelle and around.
In Naples for a bed you serve 300/450 euros, a room spends from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlínico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for one bed they serve you 250/350 euros, at least 350 per individual.
in cities but girls prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a higher weight in the city's economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of renting to students and extra-Community students is more frequent, further anomaly is recorded: an increase of 25/30 per cent of the cannon to foreign students in respect of Italians.
Bye to old cinema Paradise, cities cancel historical rooms
Historical cinematographic rooms are closed by favouring the Multiplex.
"A city without cinematographic rooms in a blind city is like a face without eyes."
The image offered by Director Giuseppe Tornatore takes a picture of what is happening in the great Italian urban centres and also in the cities of the province.
The marginalization process of cinemas, which with the birth of big methics in the periphery and the resulting disappearance of mono rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the features of a true cultural crime.
To disappear almost always are historical places, full of memory,"is like if a friend died, a friend who shared a piece of space and so much emotion," observes the director of the new Paradise movie, the film that twenty years ago won Oscar's first and the great prize of the jury to Cannes, who counted the possession of a provincial cinema room and the nostalgia for the way to live the movie I lost perhaps forever.
The figures given by Anec, the main trader association, are clear: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have been closed, and most of the rooms in the main cities are mostly in Florence, 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bolivia and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 less in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions by the castles are the first, Emilia-Romaña with 82 less cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardia (41).
It is a demonstration that the person responsible for his disappearance is the adventure of the multiplex, these three Italian regions themselves that have recorded the largest number of new methic movies: 195 screens but in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romaña.
"Italian exercise has developed irrationally," observes Paolo Protti, President of the Anec, "it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall is closed, not all its users are willing to move to the meths.
Not to mention the lack of funds for traders: the former debt of the state is about EUR 10 million.
It is shameful from the ethical and moral point of view, that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To support the sector would serve between EUR 16 and EUR 18 million a year".
In the interest of the case of Bolonia, the first Italian city concerned by the castles, decided to repair with the signature of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of which was in Italy to promote and protect the single room in the historical centre and in the perimeter.
Among the prescribed standards are average tax relief for managers and public benefits in terms of mobility: viewers can enter the restricted traffic area and have special rates for the station.
"It's an initiative I like," observed Giuseppe Tornatore, and I hope that other cities follow the example of Bolivia by taking other measures.
True, in contrast to the extra power of methics, traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because public is more demanding today.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that was always important to me: the closure of the film in Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the chip that convinced me to perform the "New Paradise movie", which I had been thinking for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I move forward to the Rialto or the Quirinale of the National Way already closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, so as not to see the booklets locked by the dust, I turn to the other side."
Lazo between politics and the dangheta, has been arrested by the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to unify the municipal elections for those interested in the Piromelli Castle."
The charges are heavy against the authorities of the Anti-Calabria Directorate to the intentional and intentional vice-director of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the intention of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by a mafia association.
He was also arrested by Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew, the unity of the boss, already condemned by massive criminal association and to pay 10 million euros.
"In disregarding any legal and moral standards, and in good faith," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay consultations with the lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been allowed the mafia family – the judges – to officially enter the municipality by facilitating the great possibility of control and command of public administration."
The president of the regional meeting, Agazioni Loiero, does not hide that "agreements between organized bad lives have a monsoon" in his region: "There are areas where massive intensity is stronger than others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of dragongheta, heroes who keep themselves clean."
The arrests this morning are added to those of the past July after the police had announced the court of the mafia family Piromelli.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, already in 1991, and always because of alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been subjected to the administration of the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torreone, intent upon, from Udc at the time of the resolution, after the vote in May 2006, had been elected head of a right centre coalition.
I blow a scandal when the Prefecture orders the municipal council's resolution.
I call on the Deputy Minister of the Interior who was Marco Minniti at the time, accusing him of organizing everything on a political issue, but the judges in the arrest order signed this morning explain that Piromalli had arrived to ask for a change in the A3 road project.
Of the environmental interventions made in Dal Torreone, the judges write, "the availability of a business operator, a representative of a group very close to the Piromelli clan, uniforming the elections of the public administration on the interests of the mafia families".
When energy is born of the waves, the big ones descend to the stage
It's an extreme drought that covers more than 70 per cent of the planet's surface and is now being discovered, the world's major energy companies.
Olas, currents, seas are the new renewable sources on which the great ones like Chevron look.
The possibility of renewable energy from sea movements has been studied for a hundred years and in the 70s together with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the low oil price, in 1980, the idea of using marine energy was split, but now the environmental cases and the new increase in oil prompted the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London has estimated for 2007 that 15 percent of global electricity needs could be covered by plants that exploit the movement of marine oils.
This would be the double of the currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And they would also be the currents and the seas.
Gigantes at the attack.
The first firm to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has signed an agreement to build an implant in northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced, a revolutionary step appeared.
Two years of distance on marine energy are always more and between these companies that have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology – he has declared the portfolio of a company associated with the U.S. oil collosso at the Wall Street Journal – and is assessing the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question is about obtaining permission from the US Energy Commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a very important sign, if it is considered that the US continued to extract oil in Alaska and President Bush has recently launched a plan to carry out new perforations.
In addition to Chevron is New York’s Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey’s Ocean Power to follow the way of the energy coming from the sea, the total investment so far, although not detailed, indicates an increased interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts are still talking about a technology at the beginning, because marine energy has no doubt had a great environmental impact.
For now the impacts such as those Portuguese or Scottish are small and do not seem to create great problems in the ecosystem.
In order to produce long-scale energy, a technology with a greater environmental impact should be used.
And the options are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of good unity between them.
The force of the waves, which moves the good up and down, turns into hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure causes a turbine to turn into a generator instead of a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast through submarine cables.
There are now four implants of this type in development ways, pending only federal approval, apart from energy, which could serve as a military facility.
Verdant Power, in turn, produces energy for a commercial center and for a station, using submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of water when there is seams, it rotates the turbines, creating a jittery movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said that he has a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorisations to use energy.
After the waves, the sea.
A particular interest, they say in the Institute for the Development of Electricity, is now worth the potential of the seas.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the seas are more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is particularly on the energy of the seas that you are like New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others near the coast, have invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and is expected to invest 35 million for 2009.
