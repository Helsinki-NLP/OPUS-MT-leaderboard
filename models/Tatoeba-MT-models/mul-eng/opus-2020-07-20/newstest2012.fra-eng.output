Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the liberation of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian Parliament rejected, in the context of an amendment to criminal law, the draft annulment of the paragraph on the prosecution of Julia Tymosenko, the head of the opposition.
Members rejected in the second reading the draft amendment to reduce penalties for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the currently imprisoned former Prime Minister.
Tymosenko was sentenced to 7 years in prison in October to conclude a disadvantageary priori agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the court must act on the appeal of the defendant in December.
Tymosenko qualified for the ruling of political revenge of the regime and caused a trial of the Court's parties in the West as well.
The draft annulment of paragraph 365 of the criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 Members.
There would have been 226 votes in favour.
Libinian Victoire
The liberarian liberation or rebellion has already won.
Muammar Kadafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to determine the winners.
As it is customary in the region, the winners of the elections are Islamists, but they are modest or radical.
The National Provisional Council has described the usual right of Charia and we already know what it is.
Libya becomes a country without crime because for a flight it is cut off.
Women can forget the emancipation, the non-compliance with her faith is liable to capital punishment...
This is the Qur'an that will unite the society of opposition tribes in place of the dictator's personality.
In Libya it will set up such an order that we cannot represent it and that we certainly do not like it.
But our way of life is not unique, it is not objectively the best and would probably not be beneficial for the Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that Islamic warriors have accepted help with the recognition of unbelieving dogs.
The only excuse is that this is not an American general who was leading NATO's strikes but rather God whom they celebrated the greatness of each attack.
So when it comes to finding the winners in Libya, the accident doesn't make them part of it.
We took part in shootings, serving Islam and our politicians turned from the dictator as a political alliance without any benefit.
After recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not deal militaryly with Libya.
So there's no problem for the locals to get rid of "crossed".
It is that without land occupation, oil companies will easily access the Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much that the accident may ultimately result in a disinterested protection of human rights.
Not that we're preventing these adjustments from driving.
A new age of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the investor's view.
A return to statistics was made on Tuesday in Europe.
Each of the states has published information on GDP for 3A.
The Czech economy has grown in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The compulsory market takes away all the records.
Investors not only look at Italy but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
Statistics offices in the euro area, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries have published their visions of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is projected to grow by 0.5%, which of France by 0.4%.
The two countries changed the data for the second quarter during which Germany was better placed than planned (increased by 0.3% instead of 0.1%), but France was less than 0.1% (the question of the origin of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% during the third quarter.
However, GDP has slowed down and according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics it is confirmed that it is leading towards a progressive reduction in economic growth.
The results are worse than the estimates of analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy has grown by 1.5% over the third quarter but has grown over the last quarter.
The German economy had increased by 0.5% in the third quarter according to the planned and periodically re-calculated data.
The euro area economy and the European Union had increased by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, corresponding to what the analysts had planned.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
The 10-year-old performance is 28.45 per cent
The performance of the obligations of Spain and Italy is in the process of grimmering to critical limits.
The problems begin to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc.
The performance of the Czech obligations remains below 4 per cent while the situation in the region persists.
Votes are heard in Germany to say that the ECB should be the guarantee of the last instance .
The Czechs are qualified for the EURO.
They got to Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The football representation has achieved its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to the Super Cech and the Guardian Petr Jiracek 1:0.
The Czech football has also highly defended a good part of the chance in the second part of its qualification and will not miss the European champion.
IHNED.cz has followed the qualification match with a detailed report.
No special excitement during the first part and a large part of the chance for the second.
The Czech representation has also been awarded thanks to the Super Cech and the Peter Jiracek hero with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification in the European Championship.
Montenegrins were found under pressure until the second part due to a specific Czech defence.
The victims of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic who took two chances to mark a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Chech, the Czech representation will not be absent in the European champion next year, and in addition, 200 million crowns will be awarded in the Czech football box.
From the first minutes we played a football warrior.
The two teams found it difficult to mount combinations and the game concentrated mainly around the central line.
The pressure of national footballers did not reach the Czech defence, which responded precisely to long shots even during the first half of the time.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They created a human butcher
A few hundred students from higher schools have created a human bubble around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support the nuclear programme of their country in the face of a possible Israeli invasion.
The students started praying on Wednesday to the website and then wished for the death of the EU and Israel.
A few hundred students from Spanish universities have created a madi human bubble around the Spanish nuclear technology centre where uranium is transformed.
They thus expressed openly that they would defend their country's nuclear programme at the expense of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found in its latest information that Iran has not stopped strengthening its nuclear weapon.
There was a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities in Israel.
The students started praying on Wednesday to the website and then wished for the death of the EU and Israel.
In the case of an attack, whose aim would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear programme, the targets would not only be Ispahan, but also the site of Natanz where uranium is enriched.
The feeding of an obese child: don't take little breakfast and take the care of dinner
More than one third of children aged 9 to 13 have obesity problems, 9% of those who will take up weight above average and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families who have a poor lifestyle.
This shows again how important the environment is in which human beings and the models that surround it.
In obese children's tables, for example, 50 per cent is more common than in families with normal weight.
19% of obeses had lunch fries, according to the survey carried out with an awareness-raising action "Obesity is not a hazard"
In large families sport is also not a habit, which is now the case for most schools today - only 15% responded that at least once a week parents found time for the active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year, and 900 students from Chechnya primary schools participated.
It was the second edition of "Obesity is not a Hasard", an action supported by the General Health Insurance and Unilever Society.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students from the sixth to the third were enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors that causes a dramatic increase in the number of children in overweight, obese, is lack of proper nutrition and insufficient physical exercise.
"Only half of the children asked, for example, to eat 5 times a day, breakfast - breakfast - dinner, which is a basic principle of good nutrition," says one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and dinner charge
Specialists draw attention to the fact that healthy development requires some basic details such as a small breakfast in the family at the same time.
In Czech, only 23% of the students' families eat at my own hour.
In most families each has its own breakfast.
And the worst thing that has been detected is that one tenth of the population doesn't take any breakfast.
The breakfast, however, is the basis of good daily food.
The questionnaire showed that obese children’s families are more often consumed with malicious fries.
Almost every student - without talking about weight - drinks every day of sugary beverages (70%).
More than 40 per cent of children asked for sport regularly, but for parents, it is only 15 per cent.
Prepare your food
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own food based on the opportunities offered by their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of 12-15-year-old Czech children are far from healthy, ideal food."
Among their favorite dishes there are many cakes, meats and sugars.
"The most alarming is, in particular, a great preference for sugard lemonades," is indicated in the results of the survey.
To eat this is the pasta that took the first place right in front of the white meat.
Children do not have any wish for professionals and preference for fish and legumes were very weak.
No on Health
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the time they receive ad hoc information.
"In the course of a monitoring of a group of participants in the survey that had filled the questionnaire after the awareness-raising session, "Obesity is not a hazard", a very determined willingness to lead to healthy food was supported," states the results of the survey.
The most outstanding was, for example, for sugard lemonades because children began to give priority to water consumption.
Children are most often caught on the questionnaire with white meat and fish as a main dish and would reduce sugary dishes and knedliky (Czech specialty of bread flour or potatoes).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, the professionals say.
In a presentation article on how to learn for the stylists, I was a little upset at the fact that it had been a lot since the beginning.
I didn't think about what would happen next.
The exhibitions of three specialty professionals, staffing and a seminar on what is going on.
And that'll be worse.
The more we approach final exams, the more we wait for practical exercises and information.
And even when there are Saturdays and Sundays, it's really "beautiful".
This time we have with the Director of Alenka (at the time when there is no boy) a treaty on how to get the woman who has no standard measurements.
And women like this are the majority.
One has a small knife, the other one is a boy's body, without a special curve, another of the superpowers.
The stylist must know how to optically measure large arms, extend a rope or pull necessary curves.
We have thus come to stress the personality and also not to speak too much of the types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong poitrine and pronounced hands and a fine size.
If, for example, there is a difference between size and lengths such as the pockets or pants do not go through all, it is worth measuring it.
And you won't regret it because the pain that falls suddenly is priceless.
In a jupe on a scale you will feel a lot better than in the one who disappears permanently and does not care about the painting and so on.
For those who have a male appearance, they can afford a Tucker-style dress, with leather shirts, or even brothers.
There are, of course, many examples of different approaches, and I am happy that I have every week to choose all the information I have received.
But I'm also afraid of what I have to do at home there was too much.
Each graduate receives a celebration to celebrate for the day and the evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the type of personality fashion and its appearance.
I'm supposed to "habiler" Miranda Kerr, that maybe you know about Victoria's secret campaign.
In my mind, this makes me happy, because it's better to have Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has taken nearly a hundred pounds of this last time (do not take my statement, svp, completely seriously) or well young Selena Gomez.
We must cut and cut from magazines or search online, print and work graphics.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Reflecting on the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The stylist does not only possess the physical but also creates, for example, the productive pages in the magazines (on products given the trends for hand bags, containers, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphist, we enjoyed all of this.
But that, until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general vision
Three specialty guests gave a diverse aspect at the Saturday meeting full of information on the different types of personnel.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanda fashion graphicist and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know to use it.
And a talent stylist can work with a single skill in a different way.
Variability is the primary example.
Like this trench-coat that has to be carried in a classic way with a jean and a t-shirt as a light coat but it can also wear the body no, with scarpins and take it in photo as a dress.
Or it's enough to re-mount the muscles or the neck and immediately have a new look.
"Play with that" he stressed.
But I particularly appreciated the advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly for work".
"You can then begin to oppose it," said Jacob.
Finally, I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with, why, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion defaults.
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have much more options than those that are photographed.
It is to say that for fashion story that will have a dozen pages (so a dozen models) I have to be prepared to "retail" at least a fifteen.
Also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We must count on this in the creation of a model.
The fact that the image and style sometimes make half of the success has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
It's enough to look at Madonna, which is not a super singer, but her image and marketing made it a global star.
In Czechia, the approach to the use of stylist services remains fragile.
And the familiar faces sometimes consider them useless (it's enough that I know something but what I'm going to do in the second grade).
And if someone makes a styling on our part, then we have to rely on the fact that he probably tells us a completely different size (smaller) than he actually has.
It remains for us to sail on google and make sure that the boulevard info becomes celebrity in question, if it has magri or grossi, etc.
Honza and Mario put us on the heart that it is not enough for the stylist to guide themselves in the fashion and to know how to assemble models.
He has to communicate with the people he speaks and it is so important to be a good psychologist.
Knowing to become people, not to flirt, to preserve their opinion.
"When a manager asks you to choose his armor and fill it with new elements you can't throw everything and tell him, "My God, what a horror."
"You'll find some things that you'll like and you'll advise him what to wear," said Mario.
This shows us exactly what everything should contain what is called the "placovka" or the stylist bag.
That's what you're approaching around the size and that you're on your own for whatever you need.
In addition to the clearly defined things such as cysicles, spindles, or even food spindles, there is also the nylon thread (which the stylist uses for photographing products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which a garment is closed in the dose, if it is too large (the epile or other type of graph is not useful because they may cover the clothing) or well a cut.
So that we are not only people who listen but who have tried something practical they have taught us how to properly remember shoes.
And during the photo sitting in the workshop where the surface is equal, the image could appear, fortuorily on the left.
And that's how we gathered and gathered.
We did not have the right to touch the jaws so as not to harm themselves by inadvertentness.
There is a real need for competences.
Mario made me happy when he made me happy for my creation.
The account I'm making isn't for my wife.
This is just a little summary of what we learned during the second week of the course.
I'm beginning to understand more and more that making the styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, but everyone says what he wants.
The need for speed The Run is disputed throughout America.
Revision
In the beginning, a course without problem is transformed because of a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do in a routine shift at work.
This fulfills to a certain extent the ambition of each, but it does not serve anything if no one wants to do anything more.
The new sub-titled part The Run produced great expectations before its departure.
He promised to take a new direction with the series of courses Need for Speed already aged and to get out of a kind of game from players who would not only deal with points.
So we were curious how the passengers will be going to be the main hero in the course of his car and do what he wanted.
As is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games, but the whole draws to the bottom because of some useless errors that have existed for many years.
This is not really a mistake, but rather the expression of an incomprehensible criminality by the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You've taken advantage of the adventure that the major hero Jack has had natural problems and to address them to participate in illegal courses through America.
You sit behind the flight on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The interior is divided into ten steps and then more than 50 courses.
As a result, each course is on another route and the steps envisaged in different environments that are quite different from each other and are interesting.
The player doesn't feel like a single moment the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are quite beautiful even if the technical level is the same as the previous series.
After all, it's not the end of the world.
But walking through the desert, in autonomous lands or well in high-density mountains is very pleasant visually.
The tests are more timed in time with an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you are found in a sandstorm that significantly reduces visibility.
Then in the mountains you must be careful that an eagle does not fall above you.
On the other hand, the different courses are well organized behind each other.
There's only a small number, but that's enough.
There are moments when you try to overcome the number of enemies (as in a classic course) and then run against the display (classic dose with the chronometer) and then wait for another pain with an enemy.
From time to time, you also have the police who are in the game and who tries to make you a difficult situation.
The news is the rides out of the vehicle.
It's rather an interactive animation when most of Jack's time is burning in front of someone and you have to help him by hitting the good button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What's amazing is that there are less moments of this type than you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
The result is good because this element is not at risk of gender and is placed, in the context described above, in the elements that favor the game.
The behavior model is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that there is nothing extraordinary at the moment, but we can't say it's negative.
For realistic simulation, you should go see more.
However, although it can be found better in competition, the driving model will be very well with the type of design of the courses.
So everything's okay.
Problems begin to appear after some time.
In contrast to the behavior model, that of collisions is not yet on the point.
We do not expect this game to be a complex deformation and collisions, but when you do not have, when you do not have any object, the least idea of how your car behaves, so this is not completely good.
During closed crossings you sometimes touch slightly slightly but otherwise your car part in crazy volts.
Or it's found in lies.
Thanks to the restart system, this is not really a problem, but it really bothers you.
The restart is done in such a way that when you hit the figure or you get out in the shortness of the game at the time of the last point on the stage.
But you only have 5 retreads.
When you use the 5 restarts you must restart the game from the beginning.
So it's another tool, in case something doesn't happen as necessary, something you can really count on.
Sometimes the reindeer doesn't help and the solution needs to be found by recalling the internship in question.
The main feature of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
There are, for example, certain veins that have to be passed in some way, but that doesn't happen.
Otherwise you will meet on a given location of "civil" vehicles all day in the same configuration as you arrive first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a minute later.
What angers these are situations when you can easily pass the opponent between two cars coming in reverse direction and when you arrive, you need to either side and turn them around or turn them away well.
It's the same if you go before him because it's "calculated" so that for the given situation it always comes close to your nose.
Opposers still have other advantages.
Throughout the time of the game, you arrive in some places, again without worrying about the time, and you always have the same opponent that preceded you at the same place.
This gets the most excited at the end of the game when you roll on a long line in reverse.
The opponent has to pass at any price before you.
When it passes in front of you, he hides your eyes from other vehicles in reverse and you enter into collision a lot of times.
We can understand that the purpose of this game is to do something of captivating and full of adrédaline, but it is clear that you are fast asleep.
And it's bad because through a simple behavior model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that's going on.
And it's the same if it's due to the concept of 50 unique journeys, that the order of the courses is that there's no chance of getting bored or anything else.
The original idea is the change in the vehicle during the course.
You need to pay attention to the essential pumps on the passengers because you can change from car to car, but most of the time you have enough.
The vehicles are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large American cylindrical cars for the right road and super sports cars for exotic tours on very technical routes, for example on skiing roads in the mountains.
And the way of challenges, which are courses in particular places you know about the adventure, is going very well with the main system of history.
You receive not only medals but also points of experience that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects start to decelerate:
It connects online with Autolog function that, among other things, compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult times to understand is the situation of the last stage of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the Metro tunnel (the same) where you roll in the dark on the roads (the same).
Your speed indicator indicates you between 150 and 200 km/h (at the top) and behind you comes a metro frame that sends the car directly to the rail.
In the edition we had a discussion for a few days to know whether someone really thought about the creation of this game or whether the authors really took us for impasses.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great.
What is important is that in more extreme situations, imagination does not have the level and in some tragic cases.
This is especially true of accidents with a large number of participants when a flude image is no longer yours.
The sound part is good and the track is in the choice.
In order to please the greatest number and especially the young public, a new sound track was created in the style "I mix everything", but we can expect that no one will buy the game for music.
General impression of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore really confused.
If the game did not have these stupid mistakes, we could say without fear that it is the best production of NFS in recent years.
But this game gives the impression not to be finished.
The taste is really good, but prepare yourself to see your mistakes with the strength of an aircraft reflector.

Vicenova, Embassy near the European Union:
The Czechs behave like negatives and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has radically eliminated the balance between institutions"
"I didn't expect a war so hard."
"It will take 5,6 years before the situation calms and all players are accustomed to their new role," and Miléna Vicenova began her presentation to the University of Law to the Czech Embassy near the European Union.
When she was able to describe the various EU bodies and their relations in such a way as to be understandable and visible, in that a large number of conferences at the University of Charles University's College of Law could send her to it, she showed how she took her "consensible and open-minded view of Europe" seriously.
Madam Vicenova commended Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning, the criticisms that it is, that it's a safe circle, that it can't fulfill any mission, and I have to say that it's broken the breath to the whole world because it's its role in perfection."
"It is a man who can listen to 27 member states, well communicate with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe."
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy in response to the question: "Who is in the European Union?" "What phone number should I call?", therefore, as an important step towards the unity and greater flexibility of the Union's policy towards states, such as China or India.
No one wants to stop us from syrecky.
Madam Vicenova has also made a living, living and living on the agenda of the European Council.
She qualified for the Czech presidency two years ago.
The Czechs have resolved the financial crisis, the gas crisis, or well organized a Summit for a Eastern Partnership.
It qualified for the fall of the Government very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation to the EU is currently very busy.
According to the words of Madame the Embassy, "activities have beaten its whole" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to be resolved now.
It is also necessary to approve the new Union's seventh budget, which becomes very complicated due to the current economic situation.
As it seemed that the budget would be small and in terms of economies, which branch would have priority, which countries would be most assisted, at least, all in the framework of future negotiations.
Ms. Embassy recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For a understandable Europe".
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that no one understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels no person makes rounds or tortods, bananas of very large size or even though no one has forbidden us to make syrickys."
It wants to make better use of the EU's environment and to see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A Europe at multiple speeds awaits us
According to the Embassy, the Czechs have the reputation of being Eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative aspect more than positively.
It is also disappointed to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The failure, she said, results in several factors, such as the fear of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and low support from the Czech side.
Another successful Czech Presidency then highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Polish, the Magyar, the Slovak, comes to me, this Frenchman says to me, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is still doing this group of Visegrad?' and it is not of all joy."
According to Madame Vicenova, in the near future, there are new rules on budgetary policy that await member countries.
This is the concept of a Europe at two paces, if not at several paces, which is intended to be more than a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the euro area and others outside the area."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the enhanced cooperation institution."
First of all, he said that the countries who wanted him and those who did not want him would not remain in their territory."
"There will be many institutions like this and there will be a real Europe at two paces," Mrs Vicenova expects.
It also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to identify the foundations on which all EU-wide topics should be discussed between all EU members and not only Eurozone members.
Mark History:
The IBM innovation begins in the second century of its existence
If someone had to look for the vocabulary that is the closest to the IBM strategy, the closest would be "the long term".
For a large public IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, it is a firm feeling as very current and, however, since its creation, it has been educated for hundreds of years.
The basis of this long-term strategy was rejected by the first head of the firm, visionsist Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved so that people would be willing to reflect.
His slogan "PENSE'!" became the impression around which will develop the life of a future genius (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM started to edit in 1935).
It was the basis of the culture of the company carefully developed by Watson.
For us IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements towards the future.
IBM has lived for hundreds of years because it has remained faithful to its basic values and yet has not been afraid to change everyone else around it.
This allowed us during our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century, we will reach even more "has made the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmsano for the anniversary.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, took care of his employees as Bata in the Czech Republic - the people of IBM were the only ones among the first American employees to have paid vacations, an insurance paid by the employer to a more elegant employee and a well-designed system of rewards for investors and businesses.
In the same way IBM has a well-designed customer relationship system.
The company was at the beginning of a genius in the discovery of talents - as one of the first firms to have abolished any form of discrimination and thus had the choice.
The current plan is entirely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy because it will be a woman - Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmsano to the head of IBM.
It has been working at IBM for 30 years and currently takes over the position of Chief of Sales, Marketing and the Strategy.
In recent years IBM has done what is called jany, online brainstorming, from which many future strategies and innovations have emerged.
It's not surprising that there's a lot of ideas - in the firm there's about 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that ensures its safe position in the business areas.
"From the beginning IBM had a concept rather than a technological firm," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economy at Harvard School of Economy and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technology firm but a firm that helps solve business world problems using its technology," said Geogre Colony of the Consulting Forrester Research firm.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or "Great Blue", as it is familyally called to the United States was concerned with its slogan - for one hundred years she grew up to become one of the world's largest firms.
Of course, it is the most popular technological firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, accommodation, services of the Council at the server level until nanotechnology.
It owns many patents from all American technology firms and five of its employees have received a Nobel Prize.
Among its findings are, for example, the ticket distributor, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the diskette.
IBM found this year with $220 billion the second largest technology firm according to market capitalisation (the first is Apple), when it first exceeded Microsoft in 1996.
Preview in progress
This is not all innovations and manufacturings that were preferred by the client and the time - IBM, for example, did not make the comparison on an operating system own OS/2, the Prodige online service or the PCJr IBM computer:
"From the moment your business is built on the forward movement you cannot emotionally remain attached to the past," said Samuel J. Palmsano.
For this reason IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms and when they don't work it goes.
The difference, for example, between the Microsoft competitor that is based on and remains under the Windows operating system.
A prospective technology
In IBM incomes, services, which are designed for a fifth by software and hardware, have a pre-responsible place.
However, in 1990 it was with more than the most powerful hardware representative.
Since the year 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets for $15 billion, and over this period it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies.
It continues to invest and even since 2008, when for the first time it has exceeded the new financial crisis .
IBM negotiates on the basis of its first leader, Thomas J. Watson, who has also increased its investment volume during the major economic crisis.
Did IBM now seem to be facing the current crisis without any concern?
Since 2008, the price of the IBM action has increased by 120 per cent, the net profit of the firm continues to increase.
The logo of the IBM firm is to change everything but not its values.
We can expect this flexible giant to master other crises.
IBM History: From brake brakes to flights in the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York 100 years ago; it initially had the complex name of Computing Tabulation Recording Corporation.
She named IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a subsidiary of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis for the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the 1980s of the ninth century.
They owned technologies such as old "points", pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint who, until 1930, presided over the Society's Supervisory Board.
Flint hired the head of a competition firm Thomas J. Watson to help him lead the company.
The leader then made the dream to the founder of the firm - it's about Watson's ideas that remain until now the identity and culture of society.
Watson runs the firm until 1952.
IBM, as his name has been said, starts with the production of all possible machinery for business and trade - brakes of cheeses and meat until registered caches.
During the first four years of Watson's leadership, the number of businesses increased to $9 million and began expansion of the firm in all parts of the world.
Watson was for the firm so unreplaceable that after 40 years of leadership, he was his son who was responsible for the director's failure, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its direction IBM started the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, the people and computers of IBM helped NASA fly in the cosmos - on Mercure, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the moon.
In the meantime in 1964 IBM develops the first family of computers - IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determines the computer standard of the time with the name of IBM 5150 comes on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sells its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but buys the consulting company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and starts to deal with advice and services with a high added value.
The strategy that succeeds in IBM in the last three years - the concept Smarter Planet is "a smarter planet".
Its objective is to ensure the intelligent use of technology in unexploded areas such as urban transport and management.
For the IBM trade area, there was little time left to develop a "Smart Trade" platform that helps traders manage the entire business cycle.
IBM also has a strong history on our territory.
It created its subsidiary in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the Brno Ausourcing Strategic Centre.
The Central and Eastern European Centre is located in Prague, and there is also the global research and development team that is responsible for the recognition of the word.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
If you can keep this year, I don't want it anymore!
Darina rychtarova (53 years) said, it's over!
After her husband Joseph rychtar (53 years old) became a guardian of the body and loving Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his red dream and return home.
Only she could not wait and set clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner" explained Rychtarova.
When Darina Rychtarova was an asylum woman in Bartosova in her home, she had no doubt that her husband wouldn't take care of her.
When Iveta insists on moving from Ricky after 30 days, Pepa doesn't rest the song.
And he publicly found out that he loved her.
With Darina's time reappointed, she accepted her husband's connection and ended up saying goodbye forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova are separated, there will be no marriage to welcome her on the way to the door of the house.
"It's the biological father of my son and if he wants to end his life in our common home, no one will put him out."
"He will no longer be my old dear and lost, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," he left to filter Rychtarova showing that she was divorced from her husband but that they only remain in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed his door is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll stay with Iveta and I won't change."
"My wife made a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"The company continues, I care for repairs, the garden, the real estate, I buy."
"We discuss with Darina in a completely normal way, but we don't dress together," rychtar told Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love, he won't stop it.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where she's going, who she's with and if she has a connection.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with "Iveta and I take all responsibility," Joseph concluded.
The worst vices of women: Does this apply to you too?
If you ask men to determine the typical vices of women, all of them, as well as others, are able to get them out of their weakness.
Dear ladies, you will find out in the following lines of women's vices that come to pump the blood of men's veins.
Purchases
Your half makes you notice that you are dependent on purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one suit per week?
Are you happy to buy and buy packages at the time of payments?
In your case, you can talk about purchases like a vice.
Some women think they should restrict their passion for buying.
But do you say, who would stay in the wine-tree of the clothing stores, find for themselves beautiful clothes and then try them all in the cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although most women buy a hobby, it can become a real hell for man.
Remember how many times you told your spouse that he was waiting for the entrance...
Constant Satisfaction
"I'm not too big"?
"I would need to grow at least five kilos - should I start doing sports?"
"Please?"
Don't these words remind you of something?
Yeah?
So you're part of these women who are obsessed with their appearance.
This is not the question that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a large number of people are allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about his appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the frequency of these complaints increases and that more women become overwhelming.
Pride and property in the first place
It's like an endless mess.
Wash the windows, pass thespirator, clean the soil, wash the dust, dissipate the bathroom - and this twice a week.
Do you make comments to your partner that he walks with salty feet on his own ground, to the children who have removed the labo, broken the glass of the living room, and what does that give you much work?
In the case where you are suffering from this disorder, try to have in mind that there is nothing to exaggerate and that order and property should not be the first place in the family.
However, this inflexible desire of property can damage your relationships and even family peace.
The work of sand
"But this survey used in the powder."
"Do you care to put these old shoes back tomorrow?"
"A hired servant has nothing to do with the land."
If you do this kind of work on your partner several times a day, you're really going to make it worse.
Of course, you don't think bad you want everything to be impregnable.
Maybe if the men knew it, the women wouldn't have done so much work...
The diffusion, the persiflation
Disfamation, persiglation, but also insults against someone are also the very ones of some women.
Women are particularly involved in relationships and are therefore happy to deal with such issues as, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us lets get rid of a harmless little perspiration here and here.
The hand on the heart is, however, a particularity of women.
But the worst are those who advise, perspire, even hate others, and are for their being around - especially at work in a group of women - especially dangerous.
Jorg and Voracek helped by their participation in the victory of Philadelphia
The hockeyist Jhar twice participated in the victory of Philadelphia during the NHL match on Caroline's ice and is again in the head of the Czech players productive for the competition.
From the point of view of 39-year-old Claude Giraux, who also took a further step and was appointed the best player of the match, he noted in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jjar also recorded two goals during the match.
Jjr after the match told Italian journalists that he had warned Giraux that this would be a big evening.
"I told him before the match he would give his hat-trick."
"I heard him."
"Sometimes this feeling falls upon you," explained Jer after his action Giroux marks a goal of the first shooting of the Flyers.
A moment later, there was a second assault on the Czech team.
Voracek fights behind the Huricans' goals for the palace and presents it to the Butter Maxime Talbot.
One second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer was down, but the beginning of the second part belongs to the Flyers.
Especially in Giroux.
In cooperation with Járr he marks three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transforms a fourth goal.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't mean he's the best player in the league, but he's really part of the three best," said Jerr about his center.
"I never thought I'd end up playing with a hockeyjist like him."
"I'm really happy about that."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years at NHL, the other team players tried to play on me, now it's my turn," added Jerr.
Caroline made a game of this game because with a purpose of Tuom Rutu and again of Dwyer on a stretch of criminality she ends with a difference of purpose.
Matt Read did not differ from other complications that end up two against one.
"Proger has carried out excellent attacks in our area."
"He hit the ball, I took the speed and (Read) ran to the farthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit it and I got there," describes the last goal of the game from his point of view Voracek.
Philadelphia has arrived with this victory in the head of the East Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo in the second quarter due to injury in the upper part of the body.
The Canadians did not face a champion who experienced their two goals after a two-way shooting.
Thomas Plekanec has not turned any of their attacks.
It is the fact that the back line was a disease that was mostly embezzled by the local coach rather than lost points because they only played the match with 5 defenseers.
"It's empty."
"We only played the game with an experienced player, the rest were young."
"But there's nothing to do, it's like this," said Jacques Martin.
"Replaceping on replacement is not enough and we have not been able to resist."
"Our planes just simplify the game, push the ball out of our area."
For this we were limited, "he added one of the defenders, P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, a Czech defense took part in Winnipeg's 30th attack and the victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated in Jets' goals, which stopped a series of 5 lost matches.
How Travel Prices have evolved since 1989
By 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at this time offered trips mainly in the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for holidays in East Germany, the Soviet Union (Sotchi, Crime and the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia and then the regime began to have a link to the west and travel to Yugoslavia was very limited to Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist block (also for the Czechoslovakian people) to travel individually even within the socialist countries.
In the case where the citizens of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually, for example in Poland or in the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, but the individual trip was not allowed.
Travel agencies at this time also offered trips to the West, but it was necessary to cook all night with a shower or to have a "good knowledge" inside the travel agency.
And even after that it was not yet won.
The agreement for loans that were the condition for travel to the west was rejected by the "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
However, the Czechoslovakian currency was not interchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the agreement of dividends ( western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs spent most of their vacations in the country where there were many homes and chalets that the Czechs had been able to afford and this habit is still difficult.
The journeys of the Czechs have been known since 1989 as a major revolution.
Although the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were the highest in 1989, the Czechs spent the last year abroad 4 million days of vacations in countries around the world.
The great paradox we do not have today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 as part of Yugoslavia of the time.
The removal of visas in the 1990s in the neighbouring countries of the West caused a huge wave of short-term visits, especially in Austria, Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovakians were unable to travel by plane to the west for at least one moment.
In Paris, for example, travel organizations slept in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical contract of a Czech travel was at this time to import its own preserved food, sauce, etc... to save.
Another important moment has also been the interoperability of the Czech crown that has allowed our tourists to buy free of the Western currency after decades.
Our standard of living and the average wage have increased what has caused another important moment around 1997.
With a growing demand for travel travel, travel agencies have started to prepare tours with air charter connections since 1997 which have formally reduced costs compared to what they had previously done.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs had visa-free links with practically most developed countries around the world with the EU, which later made our journeys easier.
Another moment of interest in the history of post-conflict tourism, when the first air charter was prepared for an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year as each year, direct air maps have led Czech tourists to distant hot countries; this winter will have 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that represents our post-conflict development took place in 2008.
on 17 November 2008, the EU removed visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to participate fully in the group of developed countries.
In 2008 also the Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their foreign holidays (50.3%) and for the first time in the history they spent more than 15,000 people per person on foreign holidays, including the attached charges.
The General Assembly must find its President, but this risk of ending up in a situation without a solution "a pat"
Almost 5 months ago, the Czech football is no President, and Ivan Hasek's successor at the head of the Association of Football in the Czech Republic is not yet known after a General Assembly to be held Thursday in Nymburg.
However, there is still no agreement on which voting regulation must be carried out.
Without this agreement, it is not possible to vote for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Thomas Pacli are interested in the direction of the Czech football.
Hasek gave his resignation in June, and during his departure he called his colleagues to join and find a strong personality that will lead the football in the future.
Only during the evening after Hasek the football went back to differences between the Association's rooms that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on 16 September when a new president was to be elected.
Delegations of the General Assembly met in Prague's National House in vain because the negotiations remained closed and there was not even a question of how to deal with it.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - whether it was the representatives of the Statutory or the officials who had been invested in full power.
There has been a partial agreement at this time with the assistance of the Office for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
The differences remain with regard to the regulation for the election.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has nothing to do with the situation.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the neural point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the bed.
"The dispute is based on the following fact: whether to proceed according to the statutes or to find another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of the Association of Football in the Czech Republic, Dusan Svoboda, who represents the professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the proposed model, the third round of candidates who will have received the highest percentage vote within the room for which they are invited.
Moravia is ready according to what it is said to withdraw to receive the candidate who will have received the largest percentage of the vote in the two rooms.
And the Czech party studies the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the vote.
"This would only lead to a loss of the idea of two previous rounds and would completely reject the bicameral concept," Svoboda admits, which includes the objections of the left party and that it would be best not to change the regulation and vote in accordance with the statutes in force.
It is surprising that Thomas Paclik agrees even if he considers that the electoral rule established by the most favourable status of all candidates is Pelta.
"I want you to vote at the maximum according to the statutes of the association."
"In order that there are no more secure ideas imagined by a representative as during the previous General Assembly," said Victoria Plzen's owner, who was the first candidate and who in his exhibitions was especially identified against Pelta.
The rest of us are optimistic.
He said there would be a new President in Nymburg and he believed that the candidates would cooperate in the future in a constructive and constructive manner.
"The possible qualification today at the European Championship should calm the whole world."
"The football will be again on a wave of happiness and there will be more training for cooperation" adds Jablonec's officer who among the three has the greatest experience in driving the football both professional and regionally.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moraves, but there are trends in changing the rules to design."
"This may again lead to a blockage in the General Assembly."
"I hope all the same good reason will win," said Rajchl.
There is not much time left for a common agreement to all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but which can say if the entire football tour is complete for the match.
The flight to Podgorice, among others Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, was not delayed for technical reasons and a variant was sought to form part of the Executive Committee on the Field of Deputies.
Finally, it is the ministerial meeting, which could be held in Wednesday, which should be decisive.
The Minister for Youth and Sports Education, Joseph Dobes, would be very happy to receive the missing parties within the country's strongest sports association and to bring them to an agreement.
In the game there are many: a state grant, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Union of Sports, which must determine the direction of the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik is going to fight for the position of President because he sees no proper candidate.
If the head of Plzen Tomas Pacli had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he requested for a new President of the Association of Football in the Czech Republic (AFRT) he would not be campaigned for this high position.
"If such a candidate exists I support him, I fight for him and I do not present myself to the election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," said Pacli to the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
The motivation of Paclik is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to just try to prevent Pelta from accessing the head of the AFRT that would be given priority to this election.
Pacli also stresses that in the event of the election, he would only take this position as President until 2013 for a General Assembly.
It would be good to see an experienced and high-level manager in the function but who is not connected to the football world.
"I talked to people who would have the profile," he said.
"It was terrible for me when some told me they didn't want to be identified with the Czech football right now."
"I'd like to change this image," he added.
What is said, especially Paclik, is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the regional Union of the Plzen Roman Berbr football, a man of the opposite reputation known in colleges as a lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of delegates to the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable for Pelta to take this position as President.
"If he wins, the current state would last and there would be nothing more in the football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-fly merchant, it would be even less favourable to football," Paclik declared.
What is still shocking is the fact that the name of Pelta was pronounced a few years ago during hearings in the context of an investigation into a matter of corruption, for which Pelta came out without any punishment.
"I don't know which Pelta prize would bring to football."
"And how do we look at the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the Plzen Club."
In the case where Paclik would triumph in the Jewish vote, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Pacli before the General Assembly in September that had ended with a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"Pelta would be the first one I'd ever be with."
"He has great abilities."
"It would be possible, for example, to present itself as head of the representation."
"But as the management of the Association, he wouldn't be able."
"I don't put the nose in what I don't know," says Paclik, who drew great attention in September when he spoke for the resignation of the Committee of Arbitraries with Ludek Macella, who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik said he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He took, for example, his capacity to lead private firms and has also been leading the Plzen club since last year, which has held its first-class triumph in May with his support.
"I have the power to change something in the sports world and bring about a certain culture."
"I would deny the influence of some interested groups, for example, who tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal Commission, which is leading to bad tastes," Paclik added, who did not strike his antipathy for Sparta Daniel Kretinsky's boss.
It would also consider harmonising relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose power to lobby high-level policies would make it possible to obtain more money for sport tax on games.
"It's one of the key points where the new President should deal with."
"If it's about tax on gambling like political parties say it, I understand their arguments, but they should also say where the money is going," he said.
Paclik does not take his current link with the Plzen Club as something negative even if he himself claims that the AFRT President should be "top the parties".
Pelta is again connected to Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla de Prague.
"That's not the ideal."
I don't see any reason to transfer my actions from the Plzen club to someone if I have to come back one and a half years later," Paclik said.
Pelta promised new statutes for the AFRT that should end the state of the past.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates to President Miroslav Pelta promised that if he was elected, the AFRT would have new statutes that would put an end to the electoral rules in the future.
Jablonec's official is before the Thursday meeting in Nymburg very optimistic and thinks today's success of football should calm this war before the vote.
Pelta had just promised to devote herself to national representation and financial means if he was elected before the September election.
He decided to be a candidate at the latest just before the General Assembly, and this two-month delay could well enable him to defend his vision of the football leadership and present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and are waiting for a President to be there on Thursday."
"They feel it's the best time for someone to take the lead in the Association," he added, but he's primarily connected to the Jablonec club, has worked for a number of years in Sparta and the Union Executive Committee.
it is also because it has enough experience to lead the Czech football.
It is believed that behind the current problems with the election there is a euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Happyly to the General Assembly of June of the Statutes has been approved which were not as perfect as everyone has seen."
"If it had not all these different interpretations, we would already have been a President since September," said Pelta.
It is just the revision of the most important document of the civil association that has taken all the attention of delegates.
"If I become President, I take it as my personal mission and I am ready to take all the responsibilities in the event that this does not go."
"It's a principle without which we can't exist," added Pelta.
Then he strives not to face his enemies.
He stated earlier that he could cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognized his training in law and that he knew appropriately that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
He has not been attacked for a long time by Tonas Pacli who, on the other hand, does not stop criticising Pelta.
"He's been in the football for a year and I've had some success."
"These attacks, however, were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"It's also because some now have doubts about its character," Pelta said to his opponent, but remains, he says, faithful to the declarations he made in September.
His most powerful weapon is his knowledge of football from low-level competitions to national representation.
This should be a football quick.
"And I would also try to finish all the cases that start with the Bohemians or the consequences of the scandal of corruption."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all football," told the Czech Press Agency CTK the 46th candidate two months ago.
He also added that his appointment to the football head would not make any changes to people.
"I should get to know all the employees," he said to Strahov, where he has a understandable nervousness since he has no leadership.
Although there have been catastrophic scenarios with the General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not be in Nymburg for anything.
"If there is only one point of dispute about how to vote in the third round, we will be able to overcome it."
"The football needs credibility, and he will only get it when he has a new leader," as Pelta's optimistic statement two days before the most likely day of his career.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership the AFRT would start working hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is the new President of the Association of Football in the Czech Republic at the General Assembly on Thursday this would not please a large number of people, it would seem.
Rajchl, however, promises that in the event of his election, we will begin to work hard.
He wants systematic changes and the members of the Executive Committee are responsible for the various areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work initiated by President Ivan Hasek.
"As President, I want to take care of football in all of it."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and a career football for youth."
"But I don't say I'll do it all alone," said Rajchl in an interview for CTK.
"I am a team player and I would like to distribute competences within the Executive Committee so that each member is concerned with a particular area."
"And I'll distribute hard missions to make football a big step forward."
"Many people will not be happy because they will start working hard rather than criticize others," he added.
He said he would not represent himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"As for me, we know I work 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know if that's worth the cut and if I have people behind me who will keep my shoes in the wheels and cast doubts on each of my actions," he said, explaining why he was upset.
"Many people have the same thing to say that I don't have to give up because they would also give up."
"It's a trust I can't betray," he said.
What motivates you to continue the work started with Hasek, we say.
"Since the last two years, there has been a great deal of work and I don't want to let it fall."
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences for a few years and I would not like to stop them." he said with fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union does not return as it had been before Hasek.
"I believe in a systematic work and it's something Mirek Pelta can't do."
"He's the only one to find people who would do football in such a way that it would be only for those who have been chosen."
"We can challenge a number of things but certainly not support something."
"I'm trying to be a target."
"I want to make football for everyone because everyone in the world will be happy not only those who have been chosen
And he reaffirms once again that he would be only a President for the Czech Republic.
"And if there's anyone who says otherwise, I'm ready to do the maximum for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts by one Czech and the other morah where the winners would be found in the first division."
"There would be no situation like today with only three mobile teams in the division because the problem is currently to find young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Plzen Club, has entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I always feel the support of the Czech Chamber that has elected me Vice-President and knows that there will be success with me," said Rajchl, who looks forward to saving tens of millions of crowns on disadvantaged contracts, contracts negotiations with television and the game law.
On the contrary, he said that the fact that the Association was not united is a common fault for all.
As he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech football will lose his credibility", he thinks that the second opponent of Paclik is a strong candidate who has what to offer to football.
"No one can doubt Plzen has done a great job this year."
"If he had been elected he would certainly continue in what had been started by Hasek and would not make significant changes among the people in the Commissions."
"He wouldn't want to win his success," said Rajchl who evaluated his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
A salt in the blue
De Julia Stanek
Owni optical bakers, magnificent swimming pools in Budapest: He who travels through Europe can live his blue miracle - and after turning around the city or making a long walk - he can leave his legs weakened in gas water baths.
A book shows in which birth pool you can experience most well-being.
When Iris Meder went on his search trip for the last 18 months, there is an object that should not be missing in his bags: his bathroom.
On her two in the water, she observed the artificially arranged couples, and she was looking forward to meeting the Putten marbles that awaited her on the other side of the pool and did not miss to admire the Art New Metologically Restored by these converted pools.
If a covered swimming pool pleased him, she would soon note in her cart all the worthy details of interest on the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been sent in this way by the history of Meder architecture and they have been presented in its already published book "Badefreden (Joies du Bain". The town-wide swimming pools of Münich, historical swimming pools in the black forest, "Bedton Hardcore" in Taunus.
She traveled her "traveling to the most exclusive baths of Central Europe" in 13 countries. Along the coast of Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited locations in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old Germany is a true perfumer of bathing culture.
Meder, explain that she has little interest in sports, but he feels attracted to water in a completely different way.
It is alarming that the birth promoters should be happy to see blue carts and rest from the spring of the Javel water while the players breathe perfumes from the rainforests or can listen to the ghastling of happy birds in the park.
"I've been asked one day why the swimming pools must always be if you're mad," said the vinnoise.
"So I started a collection of beautiful bathrooms."
Water surface twice strengthens architecture
A shower in a swimming pool and volcanic sauna oil - well-being factor in the Christmas rooms are enormous because all senses are alert, according to Meder.
And if the builders were given a little more pain, the Nager rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor there is a surface of water in the birth rooms."
"It is on one side transparent, but reflects on the other side of the whole building's beauty."
All surfaces are optionally presented in a double way: high voltages, multicolored carts, tremplins.
The small image volume "Badefreiden" makes a report of 190 pages of interest on the history of architecture and culture on the axis of historical wellness - it certainly wants to make a cure in the blue.
The collection of Meder discovered remarkable specimens during his research in Hungary.
On the side of beautiful well-being baths such as the 100-year-old Szecheny bath in Budapest, she found water containing nitrate in a natural cave in the Karst (Cavern pool in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath filled with water containing alcali and (Városio Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and located in a bottle-form building.
On the other hand, Swiss and Austrian air-conditioned swimming pools offer spectacular views. While a roof of Zürich's pool is located all over the city, it can be admired by Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton: The Turkish swimming pool is filled with a window from which we can observe the animation on the ski track.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits the nagers in Langgenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal resembles an OVNI that has just landed on the Alps.
In winter, the steam rises from three open plates, while in the background the mountains of Ötztal ascend to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
the smell of Javel's water does not attract all the pools of the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths create a smell of suffering, from the Arpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsba, which is hard to believe, to be found in a healthy spa.
The smell comes from the therapeutic alkaline water containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its lemon picks you up to the skin as soon as you let yourself slip into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her search for beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also came up with discoveries: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor swimming pool and in full air from Czechoslovakia, she found herself in a barricated area.
The bath designed by the Dušan Jurkovic architect in 1902 was inter-timed.
By throwing an eyebrow through the window of the New Art furniture in red-white-jaun, she observed the spread of bad herbs among the cars.
She observed an opposite effect in a swimming pool in the Black Forest: Bad Wildbad thermal palace.
This building has already survived three phases; it can be discovered not only by the neo-Roman elements that come from its design in 1844 but also by a poor Alhambra style room that was added to it in 1900.
Since its early modernization in 1995, the thermal palace remains the popular pool of the expert in swimming pool, Iris Meder - and not just because it is the original of Schwarzwald.
"It's already a great performance than to build construction styles if different in a unit if it's possible," says Meder.
With such a palace, the floor in the thermal pool appears to be only a minor issue.
Agricultural Speculation
The German Bank examines in detail the speculation on raw materials
De Christian Teevs
Does the German bank give up its speculation on primary materials?
According to information from SPIEBEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the impact of speculation on the world's poor.
In January, the head of the group then wants to take effect.
Hamburg
For citizens of the Federal Republic, this is clear: According to one study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks rely on raw materials such as maize and wheat.
Two thirds of the respondents even require the German bank and other credit institutions to continue this business venture because it increases the problems of the poorest people in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the organization of Foodwatch consumers.
The study is based on a report submitted by Footwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann points out in this article that the Panels' speculation on the first global material leads to higher prices and that banks share a complication in global hunger.
The consumer protection campaign specifically links itself to the chief of Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even if large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act the same way.
The speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect goods against price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts share the view that couples have been involved in offers and demand - and benefit from the costs of very poor people.
Ackermann responded differently to the criticism of American competitors: He promised to investigate the complaints and said, "No matter is worth playing the good reputation of Deutsche Bank."
According to information from the SPIEGEL Online, an international working group is currently examining the allegations of Foodwatch-Report.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank's Board of Directors must be presented - with recommendation, habit.
At the end of January, the Bank's head will indicate the consequences of the shooting.
It could result in a reduction in the market for raw materials, or even a complete withdrawal.
Ackermann built his image
The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticisms to the financial sector: "The speculating on the rise in food prices shows particularly dramatic, at which point today's banks are in general interest."
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be today especially under obligation.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all the deposits of its portfolio, for which money has been invested on food speculatives," Bode said.
"This is of little importance, for Mr Ackermann, whether it is the question of the hungry or whether the reputation of the Deutsche Bank is in play."
Ackermann's consciousness may appear at first sight surprising, but it is clear that the group's PDG wants to present a perfect picture, a few months before leaving its functions.
The Deutsche Bank announced Monday that the President of the Board of Directors would not change anything within the Board of Directors.
It could improve its brand image with a drop in the agricultural speculations that are disputed.
And with regard to possible losses, he doesn't want to worry about them - his successor will worry about them.
One of the two would resuscitate the placements on the primary materials.
Footwatch strives to maintain a strong pressure on the Manager.
To date, more than 30,000 netizens have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the Mardi survey, with which the Forsa Institute conducted interviews with 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 11 percent found this legitimacy that Deutsche Bank offers deposits for which prices of food products are paid.
Many bank clients would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such operations: one of the two would resiliate, after the survey, all the deposits for which money was injected in the specifications on the primary materials.
43 per cent would recommend such a bank around them, 49 per cent replied that they would consider resiliating their account to change banking.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion that has moved
Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with heights, bass and Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won prices, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell into ruin.
It is now reopened and has an exhibition house.
If we are excited for a modern postwar architecture, for its clear forms, glass hangars, its living and adjoining halls and its new building materials that are typical of faith towards technical progress, then the role of Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for Brussels's universal exhibition in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Pavilion of Schwanzer also receives the "Grand Prix of Architecture" for its construction of steel and glass, light and suspended.
Construction is considered to date as an important step in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavillon for the next Austrian universal exhibition.
With its legendary home at four cylinders of BMW and its adjacent ball-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became famous at international level in 1973.
Its project as a temporary construction had been exposed after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden in the south-west corner of Vienna, was transformed, and in 1962 a 20th-century museum opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically adapted to a museum - no walls to extend art works, so it was not a good environment.
However, it has been used for as long as the contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building has been empty and has grown further.
The architect Adolf Krischanitz has now transformed the Pavilon, now bearing the name "Maison of the 21st century" and will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening the Belvédère museum opened, where the house belongs, the first exhibition - a moment of chance at all sight.
The new launch was conducted by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco has promoted an art historian to a considerable career among others in his youth of artistic patents, then at Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum and as the founder director of the modern art museum in Salzburg, she has led in particular the transformation work with political men and the protection of monuments, has received private funds and sponsorship and has established the operation.
Except contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exposed, a coffee and a library are found, and an office must be built there.
strict monitoring, small budget
So for the implementation of Krischanitz was the perfect interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and expanded with sensitivity the section of Joseph Olbracht and had won the competition, but because he had studied at Vienna Technical University and for him, the pavilion was “a very important place” where he saw the exhibitions “in practice every week-end”.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which was lost in generosity and ease after his move to Vienna and by change of use.
In the current transformations, there were major problems: "building was "a power goof", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of glass frames were changed, the insulated glass reinforced in glass fibres was put and the roof replaced by a special safety glass.
The thermal bridges have been strengthened or replaced, and filled coatings have been re-habilitated.
Two subsoils have made the place available for the new operation, a light panel sealed between the house and the road ensures lighting, a bridge leading to the entrance - it's almost a new building, but always the light Pavillon Schwanzer.
The exterior doors of origin are left, the house is painted in a protective tent against the red-brown colour wheel.
And the cinema room is exactly the same as it was sometimes.
And all of this under close supervision of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"Many of the materials that are good and low-loved should be found, and that also appeal to the memory protection office," Kristhanitz said, and he drew attention to a rough soil in the sun.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remains simple and light.
This would have been difficult with the Pavillon, "who came from Brussels", said Krischanitz recently, a typical history of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such a architecture is found "always in the wrong place" and yet wants to "be aware of good conscience".
But in this case, the 21st century House is not in the wrong place, because it is about a time of urban construction: around Jardin Switzerland the "Central Park Square" is just newly planned, with offices and apartments.
And another chance will probably happen: the 21st century House could benefit from the comfort of another Kristchanitz construction, because the collectionist Francesca von Habsburg purchased the Berlinian temporary art centre, and as he said, it already negotiates with the city to get a site in the vicinity of the Garden Switzerland.
Bahn is planning a typical winter crisis in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid in winter train accidents.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the "Deutsche Bahn" company will spend more than 70 million additional roads this year.
The "Bild"-Zeitung daily reported to the preliminary by calling for an internal crisis plan to the group that investments of about 300 million euros would be planned by 2015.
This should also improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks in the event of extreme temperatures.
The number of internal and external employees for the destruction of railway facilities and of which it is appropriate to double and pass to 16,000 persons.
The aim is to unwind snow and ice up to the start of the service phase and 90 per cent of the road equipment required for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, Head of the Rüdiger Grube, maintained the government and industry at a conference at the summit of train accidents that also occurred this winter.
The last winter, the company of railways had serious problems for the transport of users, because it lacked other reservations in case of difficult weather conditions.
This is also the case with many new regional trains for years to be authorised by the Ministry of Railways.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has been doing this for years since it has had to check the ICE train axles more frequently at the workshop, after an ICE cut took place at the central train station in Cologne.
The German bank Deutsche Bank pays millions of penalties to the United States.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann there is a new one in the United States: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay a fine of millions.
As if the problems of the Deutsche Bank were not enough, the past of this sector's giant would be worth more to the United States: the Institute of Frankfurt pays $145 million (106 million), to settle a difference due to the failure of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is about the sale of mortgage documents.
The NCUA Financial Market Regulator brings to large banks a range of charges, and this would have encouraged cooperative banks to make false promises on the purchase of financial products; they would have reduced the risks.
These documents have greatly lost value during the financial crisis and have led banks to the bottom.
"We are satisfied that we can find a solution to this issue without the parties agreeing to a court procedure," said a Deutsche Bank interviewer in New York.
The Bank has made no mistakes in comparison.
This is also valid for the Citigroup, which has committed itself to a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions from the two banking institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. co-operative banks and intervenes in case of failure in order to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to repair the damage caused by several billion dollars.
The comparisons now concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator also took other large banks in part and was assigned to the JP Morgan Chase Court, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Regarding the issue of mortgage documents, it is referred to as "Mortgage-backed Securitys".
Credit houses are based on it.
When the U.S. real estate bull was released in 2007, it was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, in the wake of the financial crisis, the United States Investment Bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though the events have been for a few years now, he still suffers from a storm on American banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have sought a number of remedies or compensation for deficiencies.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) launched the biggest complaint wave.
It refers to 18 major international banks, two US state-owned finance firms Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac, to being benefits in the business of mortgages of about $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has to deposit an appeal to the FHFA, a number of operations amounting to $14.2 billion for the years 2005-2007.
The supervisory authorities request that Frankfurter respond to "substantial losses" but without mentioning a specific sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected requests as unjust and wished to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett increased from 10 billion in IBM
Buffett, the financial gourer, invests Colossal sums in the IBM IT company.
Since March, it has purchased actions for a value of more than $10 billion.
Until then, the large American investor Warren Buffett explains without delay not to invest in IT IT computer companies, since the long-term evolution of companies only appears to be bad predictions.
However, he read the IBM reports and changed his opinion on investment in this sector.
It had already come to understand much earlier than IBM offered services and information systems for other IT sectors.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered a horse attack in the financial world.
The IBM IT activity therefore grants the right to be called "Mr IBM".
Car Buffett has now revealed to the CNBC's economic emissions, which he has purchased since March of the IBM operations of $10.7 billion.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hataway has thus become a large share of IBM with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said IBM never had anything to do with this commitment until now.
He welcomed the leadership, which even during the economic crisis had provided reasonable benefits.
"You did a great job," said Buffett strategically.
IBM has been spending some time on IT-profit services as an "exploitation of accounting centres.
The information pioneer, over 100 years old, offers both software and consultation as well as very effective business calculators.
Buffett had so far been avoiding technology companies.
He said he only invests in businesses that he understands business.
But instead, Buffett attacks on railway freight, lubricant manufacturers or machines.
Its Holding Berkshire Hataway has about 80 branches as well as parties to a series of large groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former municipal Rück.
This 81-year-old octogene had recovered in the 1960s" the small Berkshire Hataway textile company and had expanded it to one of the most prestigious global enterprises, thanks to intelligent investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
That's why it's a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His sense of failure to earn money was worth the nickname "Omaha's Oracle".
After Buffett's investment announcement, IBM's actions increased by one percent at the turn.
"Big Blue", also known as IBM, has a total value of over $220 billion and accounts with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, says Buffett, he doesn't want to participate there.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of Zwickauer's "cell" the Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "blooding ideology", which would now be reborn.
The killings of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extreme context.
Following this news, Turkey as well as the German-Turkey population reacts with fear and concern.
Because for many Turkish brothers the spectrum that had been believed to be dead for a long time was re-emphasized: since Mölln's fire attacks in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more violence compared to this extreme legal context against the Turks.
There was a genophobia in Germany, however, there was never a question.
However, the extreme right network that has been detected reveals the proportions in which the dimension is far from predictable.
"This is a return to the bleeding ideology", "It was the title of the Internet parade of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
The "Sabah" newspaper stresses, however, that one of the authors would have been a human being in the protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the extreme-right bourgeoisie.
It is reasonable that the Turkish community in Germany responded: it called this weekend a silent reminder of victims of racial violence before the gate of Brandenburg.
It was only two weeks before the Turkish community in Berlin and the German and Turkish policies had considered a anniversary of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkey recruitment agreement.
It's with funny colors that cohesive has been staged, symbolizing a successful history.
The reports of some Turkish media have the effect of a gifle: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Also, the German appearance of "Hurriyet" does not seem to be able to remove unique conditions.
"the beginning of fear", Tel is the title of the chronicle of Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people would have been killed, paid taxes and would have made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany by their work.
The police action was perceived very critically on the German-Turkey forums and the results of the successful discussions of their research.
Why it has not come much sooner to the German authorities to do research in some environments of extreme right, the authors are surprised.
More than one shows itself ready to at least radically: "If the case continues to be closed, it will leave migrants nothing but self-defence and arms."
"that will be the best self-defence."
"Internal peace in Germany is strongly dependent on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the whole network," says "Selen".
What this means is if internal peace in Germany is in danger, Mölln and Solingen's attacks in the 1990s have well explained.
The photo of the ruins after the fire of Solingen is deeply rooted in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event has made it clear to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, how the lack of faith and distance from acts of violence could result.
However, the attacks have adjusted our feelings in the Turkish community.
Never repeat mistakes of the past
At other times it is particularly the failure of German policy after the attacks of the Turkish press: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After Solingen's fire, he sent a telegram of condolences to the chief of the Turkish state, representing the funerals in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at the time in his speech, how much taxes the local Turkish population produced.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of his tax duties.
The current Turkish media report shows once more how much German-Turks' mistrust is deeply towards the local rule of law since that date.
In addition to the efforts of a wider clarification and reassessment of extreme-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is this time needed.
Zürich Lake scandal bank
The most adventured Bank of Europe is not found in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has almost failed in the financial crisis and is suffering from one crisis to another.
It's a German who has to run now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After its spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, it was known in July that it would take almost a spectacular position in 2013: President of the Swiss Bank's Large Bank Board - a major step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber was publicly happy, greeted; Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its recent strength and made impressive observations on future colleagues.
"The UBS has won the Turnaround."
"I'm happy to cooperate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
However, since September it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities market in London had broken down all the Bank's security systems and had flashed around EUR 1.7 billion.
The head of UBS Board of Administration Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
the President of the UBS Board of Directors has been regarded as suffering - and all ask: When does Axel Weber finally return?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank from February 2012.
And he will re-chair the administration already in May - not in 2013, as the bank has communicated to him on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber this becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more professor of the economy and President of the bank, and he would certainly need a period of adjustment.
At the same time, it assumes responsibility for a bank's strategy, which has just proved once more that it has long deserved the title of "the largest bank in Europe's scandal".
In fact, the UBS is on a huge side - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other hand, it has been patented for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, leaves such a very high Swiss bank.
This began during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had a great reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset, silent and solid manager, but also stolen, was combined with ambitious objectives: she also wanted to become a very large bank in the area of banking investment.
So the UBS would manage one side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from an empty client than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the link of the world's largest banks.
That made a impression.
The former banker Hans Geiger and later a bank professor in Zurich for many years relates: "I have always taken UBS as a model of good bank before my students."
"In the current perspective, we ask: how could I have simply been mistaken at this point?"
He was deeply wrong.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something didn't turn around the UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli withdrew in a surprising way, which was considered to have been considered to be an intellectual and great banker.
A few months later we presented the reasons why he was a party.
The Bank's division had flagged with sub-primary documents and had to cross over billions.
To offset this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a rise above.
For this, she actually found investors, but they would have broken out the sources shortly ago: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was passed under silence, where it was never even learned its name.
That was not the first time.
In April 2008, that was the case.
The Bank was to announce again the loss of billions of dollars, the President of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, who was still the second Board of Directors of Switzerland's best pay.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS found itself, taking into account its investment errors, in the financial crisis before the failure and was saved by the State.
The National Bank has acquired UBS tens of billions of problematic securities, and the Swiss Confederation has provided six billion francs for convertible assets, for which it could be owned by the bank.
All Switzerland has been dried up - because it has noted how dramatic this can be for a small country, to open up such large banks.
Finally, the total UBS 2007 balance sheet rose to more than five times the Swiss economic performance (see chart).
"We couldn't save the UBS again," said the banker, Geiger.
After the first disaster, he followed the second.
A few months ago, the UBS had been capturing for a tax difference with America, and it was declared ready to publish the data from the secure client, who might have corrupted the tax with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it has accepted a payment of $780 million, reimbursing the benefits of these operations with an increased amount.
Thus, the UBS published more or less that it had helped in tax fraud.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with rich customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
He followed the resignation of the Chief Administrative Board and the President of the Administrative Board.
And from the client's cash issue.
Thus, the bank had lost its credibility in the two main business sectors for a few months: bank investment due to poor speculations and asset management due to tax fraud aid.
And, as there was a little bit of a return to peace, and as we thought, that the UBS would come out, he followed this unfortunate story of brands of title: a single flammable brand of EUR 1.7 billion, before the bank seemed to have anything to turn around.
And it is published: the management of investment bank risks does not always seem to work.
"In the Aboboli case, we have been able to see that the risk management is too small," said Martin Janssen, economist and financial teacher at the University of Zurich Banking.
Similarly, the financial director of a large German bank is sure that "the UBS problem is that it does not have the ability to control risks in its own hands."
However, it was precisely the idea of caution, with which Swiss bankers had long assumed their role, that of becoming a guardian of the world's great fortune: not too high risk, but security for money - and the world could well go beyond the Alpine Republic.
The treasures of the Swiss banks have become the symbol of an unbridled reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS centre in Zurich is still going to match the strong click of the Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its seat at the central station of Zurich, which runs directly from the central station to the lake of Zurich, which is surrounded by the summits of the Swiss mountains.
Buildings are prestigious here, store houses are among the highest in Europe.
Bijots like Tiffany's, are found here among Swiss traditional stores and like those of the Sprüngli Conserie.
For centuries, Swiss banks have settled here: from the National Bank through the Swiss Credit Palace to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
We arrive in the UBS entrance hall with a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, there are large leather chairs, and on the side of the bank logo, a large label for "safe".
UBS knows what the client is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank is one day or another different from the market - or brings the two large Swiss banks, the UBS and the Swiss Credit, as the head of a Swiss private bank is.
He would not want to read his name in the newspaper, at least as all Swiss bankers do business with the two big banks.
UBS would have become too big, it would have been found - especially in banking investment, where Anglo-Saxons would be in another range.
The Swiss would have nothing more to say.
"And at the same time, they've been adapted to Anglo-Saxons' masters for a long time."
This was in effect the Anglo-Saxon Investment Bank that changed the UBS, made high profits and then debulged: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the sub-primary jungle as the large Swiss bank.
The disaster occurred on 15 October 2008.
"This Wednesday the government coalition of the small country to seven million inhabitants has undertaken the largest rescue operation in their nation's history," writes author Lucas Hässig in his book "The Crash of the UBS".
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the big bank from failure.
How could that happen?
If we talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially at the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks concluded a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too big for the Swiss little one - and registered without delay an increase.
What helped was that the two different pre-disputed banks of UBS have completed: a rich but Latvian bank with a strong asset management point in Zurich and a more poor one, but certainly more strongly internationalized.
At the same time, international investment banks have had a great deal of money access, with which they have been able to turn into a huge route.
Two names are associated with the UFC's Ascension: Peter Wuffli, 2001-2007 Chief of the UF Group, and Marcel Ospel, also president of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," said banker Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, who is very well understood in models and statistics, and Ospel, the inductive, who has broken a path up to the summit with the bank's learning."
But Ospel would be trusted until the end of Wuffli.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: exuberance has arrived before the fall.
The UBS staff clearly recall the meetings of the leaders during which the chief of the Wuffli group has always spoken the same word of order: destroy Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She ordered the "League Tables" classifications, which at this time documented the success of banks.
After all the UBS wanted to mount everything up.
Some steps have already been made for him.
In the case of securities and securities transactions, it played a very important role.
However, corporate consultants, who were responsible for it, highlighted a weakness: in international interest operations, in the Fixed Income banking garage, there would be a huge difference between the largest banks.
UBS would have defects at the level of American mortgage products.
To combat this defect, the UBS launched into an adventure, which almost cost his life.
As regards growth, it is as well the bank itself as a management fund created before it in the U.S. sub-primary positions that have invested.
It was transformed into a massive machine that wrapped and passed the securities based on American mortgage loans - but also saved risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a long time to land.
"In the summer of 2007, while the US real estate market was in flames, UBS bought there," said the bank expert Geiger.
The larger the euphoria, the greater the fall is brutal.
One manager after the other had to leave, when one end of the attempts became more difficult than we thought.
ITS posts have become attractive and are so far banking.
The one who manages the big bank has a job that's almost impossible.
It must find a strategy for a bank, for which all proposed business models have disappeared.
The banker, Geiger already has an idea: to put an end to the investment bank, to focus on the management of goods, to return to Swiss races.
But the bank doesn't (again) want to go too far.
But the investment bank must be actively involved, as it is clear to date.
Next Thursday, the bank chief Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss was only supposed to be a transitional when the bank suddenly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he was obliged: he had to carry out the UBS business on a regular basis, and on Tuesday the Bank of Zurich was informed.
Ermotti wants to reduce the investment bank to the state of progress in the mid-1990s.
The 3500 jobs are cancelled.
But that's not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to earn from money?
These are the questions that "Axel Weber has already asked.
He said publicly so far only he and his wife were going to look for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
The fear of the recession in Europe is on the American boutique
The threat of a recession in Europe at the end of the week has discouraged US investors.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained unaffected.
The industrial production on the continent has aroused the hopes of stabilization of the debt crisis in its brother.
The general settlement of the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be imposed.
The euro has fallen in proportion to the dollar.
The Italian and Greek wine I had not yet completed in the last week, not in the first half of the week - but now the problems appear once again in the foreground, said Mark Luschini von Janney Montgomery Scott.
Especially the financial values were on sales pages.
The default values of the Dow-Jones-Index showed a loss of approximately 0.6% to 12.078 points at the end of the markets.
During the exchanges, the market barometer fluctuated between 12027 and 12170 points.
The S & P 500 index took a wider stop at 1251 points, a 1% deficit
Nasdaq, the technology exchange index lost 0.8% and ended with 2657 market points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax ended with a decrease of 1.2% to 5985 points.
The industry in the 17 countries of the euro area has significantly reduced its production and adjusted to the end of recovery.
As announced by the Eurostat Bureau of Statistics, companies produced less than 2% in September last month.
American investors expressed themselves in a sceptical way: "We are not an island, contrary to dependant," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, and there will also be other signs of weakness coming from banks.
The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, has just confirmed this caution: "It is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do anything to end the crisis," he said in an interview with CNBC.
As a result, it was too early to invest in obligations arising from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett threw an old principle into the wind for several decades and entered the American technology industry.
His investment in IBM over $10 billion supported the course of the traditional group's actions and enabled him to report almost 1 per cent against the trend in commercial management.
The paper has almost changed to $187.35.
Buffett claims to have paid an average of $170 per piece, and now holds 5.5 per cent.

The Boeing aircraft has increased its operations and therefore has limited its losses in the Dow.
The actions gained 1.5°% after the company collected the largest order in its history.
Emirates Airlines ordered 50 long-recorded aircraft of type 777 and estimated the value of the order to $18 billion.

Intelligent corals thrive in cities
In many places, streams are considered as "flying problem" but experts say that these very intelligent animals are no longer allowed to flee cities for a long time.
Some loved ones, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Cornells have been in the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of residents are multiplying because of the well-being and noise of animals.
An antidote to "the problem of birds" is not yet in sight.
During the first ostfriesich Symposium on the hills, experts said that it is no longer possible to cast the city’s streams.
Experts from all Germany discussed possible solutions.
They're looking for alternatives in cities
The protection of nature was also based on the issue of particularly protected forests: The use of chemicals in agriculture further destroys traditional living areas.
The hunt, the amalgamation and the destruction of typical cotton trees made life difficult for birds.
The corals are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 couviasone couples in the Westfälische Soest, in the north-west of which are Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had gained negative publicity due to the cornels massacre in the region.
Critics have found the capture of birds in pieces and their slaughter with particularly brutal gordins.
"The normal expulsion, the adventure, is nothing," noted the planner of the city and landscape of Leer, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of the nests with water under pressure or well cut down trees often results in adverse effects, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr in Bade-Wurtemberg.
"The animals move away, the great colonies split and spread in other places."
The event is only imaginary in exceptional cases such as in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We find ourselves obliged to live with them, we can no longer end them."
The problem is not to be resolved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of Major Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
It is a useful combination of the evolution of animals to an aversive condition and growing supply to allow them to reinstall themselves.
Psychology and ethnology, Uta Maria Jürgens looked at "the information panels at the place of thrones" in order to establish relationships completely different from those: "We can finally better support a button on the face with a dose of confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-Education-Education Corbeilles in Schleswig-Holstein, road panels informing about the life of these very intelligent fries.
This project has been adopted by tourists from time to time.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "There's a lot of communication, these birds have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: Frequents not only use tools to get to a rule but also make their own tools as tools of work.
Cambridge University ethologists tested four times recently, to what extent the intelligence of birds is achieved.
In an experience, birds quickly learned that they had to cross a gap with stones to reach a well.
Without much training, they firmly recognized that a stone had to have some size and shape to expand the platform.
In a second test, the astute corals should then solve a further problem.
In a vertically placed cylinder, the researchers had placed a small layer with a lens.
The birds could not reach their nest with their beak.
However, the researchers had put iron wires on their disposal.
All four animals formed a crochet with the help of which they fished the little fish of the little turtle.
Three of the four frequencies have been achieved since the beginning.

Jiracek has set a goal for the Czech Republic

After an attack against Helder Postiga during Bosnia, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card in Portugal (36e).

But after the break, the 2004 European Vice-Champion has won four times and everything has become clear.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubt for 81 minutes.

While the national coach Guus Hiddink also had to leave his seat on the EM-third bank in 2002, the Croatians were able to enjoy their fourth round at the end of the European campaign.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost captured a dream departure.
Selcuk Inan marked the seventh minute with a long shot with only the pot, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the balloon.
After the moment of fear, Croatia gained more control.
Even after the break, the Croats left nothing to burn.
Another Mario Mandzukic of the Wolfsburg VfL, replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund at 62 e Minutes, members of Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Intracht Frankfurt) remained on the ground.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China
Europe's largest software company, SAP, aims to invest billions in China in the coming years and will double almost the number of employees in the country.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (EUR 1.5 billion) will be allocated, the Dax Group said Tuesday.
"We will create additional research facilities and development centres and hire employees as a result," PDG Bill McDermott announced to his clients on a fair basis in Beijing.
The effect will increase from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world leader of business software will double from five to eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Some 4,000 of the 176 000 global customers of SAP are located in this country in full expansion.
The growth plans in China are also an important element of the 2015 Tax Group Strategy.
SAP plans to increase business figures by 2015 to EUR 20 billion.
Last year, Walldorfer recorded a income of about EUR 12.5 billion.
Currently, the software provider's business management, which employs 55,000 people, has never been marketed as well.
SAP has been active in China for over 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," McDermott said.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by full information."
The reduction of personal mass
Peter Englund's new book offers depth and generosity. "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An intimate History of the First World War" (The Beauty and the Chagrin: an intimate history of the First World War), it begins with a long list of characters that close your heart.
Tip to start: carefully reject this page and make your page mark.
You will learn to know these people in detail. In this Roman novel by Peter Englund, this list of personnel will be your GPS, a ballast during these few moments where, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and disappointed in the wounds of the war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which delivers the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote here a book outside the community that he described, with accuracy, as "an ancient book."
It contains some well-known names, important treaties or famous battles; there is almost no Ambassador or discussion on strategies and materials.
This is not so much a book about what happened, he explains, but a "book that describes what it might look like".
"Purity and shame" summarizes the experiences in wartime of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, both sides of the war, young and botanists on stairs, passing by doctors, ambulances and vendors.
Some will become heroes.
Other prisoners of war. Some will lose members, become fools, or lose their lives.
Their lives are empty here like the graves of a church: while some are scattered, there are new ones.
Peter Englund's book differs from traditional history books.
It undermines the idea that the First World War would only result in the terrible war of earthquakes on the west.
"The beauty and the chagrin" is well described by other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, the Mesopotamian and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under the streets; a Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the moose is an intrepid problem.
This book is loving from the first page.
The war engulfs the lives of these people like a natural disaster, such as a Hurricane Katrina that can bring it to an end.
When canon cuts stay away, and what are you a mother at the funeral, you're staying or you're running?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, not even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been overcome by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and the chagrin" is followed by individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English food in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young seaman of the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memories, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be terrible or passionate, but they are more preserved by the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most address privatization and the ability to get out of it.
Describing the history of a German school, Peter Englund wrote: "Erastz, all of us."
"Purpose coffee, false aluminium, caustic imitation, paper tapes, wooden buttons."
It continues on replacement food in Germany.
It describes the "scarried rice rice wine in the mouton fat (and ends with a fragrant egg), the tobacco made with dry roots and the dried soiled skin; the seeds of cassava in wood."
He states that "837 authorized replacement meat are registered in the production of sauces. There are also 511 replacement coffees."
Some stories deal with honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own pulse to the rescue and declares about the war: "You feel that after all, it is what men were destined to, instead of sitting in a comfortable wheelchair, a cigarette and a whisky hand-held, reading a newspaper or a best seller, and rather than claiming that such a vernis is a symbol of civilization, and that there is no barbara behind your shirt stopped and locked.
On the contrary, a British soldier realizes that he is at risk of death and that no one will notice or pay attention to him.
"When we are assigned to sacrifice, we hope to have a public," he wrote.
Unfortunately, it's rather comparable to "a man convicted in secret".
Other observations relate to the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict becomes more and more a history of economic competition," writes Peter Englund, "a war between businesses."
He learned the arrival of what he called "a new species within the farmer of the beginning of the century: the well-arranged mass murder and is ideologically convinced, in well-matched clothes, who executes his mouth while sitting behind a counter."
People act in unexpected ways; they are both fundamental behaviours and heroism.
Peter Englund speaks of soldiers who tried at any price to catch a veterinary disease in prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
"There is the biggest expression in the trade of gonorrhea, which soldiers buy and depend on the genetic organs in hopes of completing the hospital," he wrote.
"The most desperate are applying it to the eyes, which is translated by a living quote."
In this translation of the Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is simple but not ostentatory, perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of short-term scenes, he learned how the war has "declares only uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, an avverse for religion."
People start asking themselves why their leaders make them a war.
The best works dealing with World War I are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussel, or "In the West Nothing Again", by Erich Maria Remark, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is a little conventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most appealing thing I have read in a non-fictional work.
I wouldn't reveal it.
But it's as if it came out of his book, get out of your hands this page where the list of people and burned with a light.
After a first false step, a minutely planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing anti-emed helmets.
Monday night to Tuesday was chosen because the Zuccotti park would be the most lively.
The operation is kept secret from all threats of some high-ranking officers and other information from the beginning that they were going to perform for a period.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, highlighting the risks and challenges of the Police Department.
There could be no repetitions of episodes over the past few weeks, such as the use of dust gas against protesters, which are opposed to the department's regulation and have created a threat of public solidarity for the protesters.
The operation to clean the Zuccotti park of its exhibitors was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
Police were prepared to observe the conduct of occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on Randall Island for operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against embezzlement - anti-terrorist measures that are fast moving a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was held on Monday evening, on the east River side of Manhattan.
The orders for moving into the park were reached " in the last minute " , said a habit, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise " .
"The few police officers I know and who have been called did not know that they would return to Zuccotti Park," said the person under anonymity.
"The only thing to know that they're going to be back is at the top of the hierarchy of the Police Department."
The city has a lesson to learn from the operation's secret.
On the last 14 October, police wanted to clean the park, but they had been replaced by hundreds of reporting agents.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from all over the area - ten officers from particularly criminal districts.
Mr. Kelly said that many people went and came to the park during the day, as migrants. So an hour in the morning was a good time.
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park accounted for at least one person," he said.
Cars of emergency services equipped with spot and speaker equipment were gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge, before intervention.
The lights and messages from high speakers seemed to frighten the protesters.
While community affairs officers were in the park equipped with their clear blue wind, many protesters simply collected their cases and were involved.
No attempt was made before 1h45 the police declared, which left time for employees to collect their cases.
Other police teams were consulted on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists present inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, head of the Police Department, said that this measure had been taken only by security.
But after many journalists, the police would have prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, strictly detained by the officers.
Mr. Browne said that the television cameras on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
While the police moved to the west through the wide folds of protesters' business, including luggage, plastic gas and filled-in sheets of clothing, teams of the cleaning department followed, cleaning everything that the employees left behind.
Some protesters who refused to leave were trained. Images were posted on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of protesters took place near the campsite's kitchen, not far from the center of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the police have moved to stop by methodically.
A dozen people who were at the camp's epicenter joined together.
In the end, two people turned to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency services have been called to cut the chains.
There was no arrest in the park before 3:30 a.m. said Mr. Kelly.
According to the Police, the cleaning operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
the majority for "public and rebellion trouble ".
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the most ranked officer to be found on the premises.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "did not run operations" said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police were patient along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, where necessary.
Barricades were placed on Cortlandt Street, a courtyard of houses in the north of the park, as well as on Pine Street in the south.
We saw the Police expand the perimeter right beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most of the vocabulary teams, would have even been seen moving people away from them.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most vivid actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At 5:00 a.m. in the south of Pine Street, a manifestor jumped over the head of a police car. Others were seen covering the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a wave of opposition emerged from the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a manifestant were hospitalized.
The union of school aids continues the city for licensing
The union, which represents hundreds of schools that have lost their employment in the last month, plans to attempt to secure a trial in the city for unnecessary and discriminatory licensing. The impact is disproportionate to schools hosting disadvantaged schools.
The prosecutions are probably the last weapon of the union, Council of the 37th District, to try to cancel the licence.
Six hundred and sixty-two school assistants, parent coordinators and other employees, who were part of the least paid city, lost their employment on October 7th. The union leaders compared these licences to political revenge so that the city did not have access to a health fund managed by the working groups, which would have allowed the budget gap to be closed at the latest.
The municipal authorities have not categorically objected to this charge.
At a municipal council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis Mr. Walcott stated that the licences were part of the budget closed in June.
A member of the Council replied, stating that school aid licences were not specifically specified in the budget.
The officials of the 37th District Council stated that they would submit a claim notice, warning the Department of Education that it would continue; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to formally announce judicial proceedings to the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
Dennis Mr. Walcott and the City Education Department will be the defence party. The complainants will be represented by eight licensed workers, all of them black or of Latin-American origin, like most of the school aids that have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman of the city's legal department, said that the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a survey of complaints received by the New York Times, the union would miss the number of licences in the most disadvantaged district schools in the city to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most assistance due to regular funding.
While there is no licensing on Staten Island, and some in prison in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa facilities, 17 school aids have lost their jobs in the 23rd Brownsville District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th districts of the southern Bronx districts.
Noting the loss of five schools of eight employed at Harlem's 36 public school, where 68% of the students live in poverty, the prosecutions state that "It is not an easy parent's neighborhood that can raise funds to compensate for the lack of budget."
The budget of the 36 public school was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each student registration.
The union also claims that the school directors have been mistaken in some terms in a memo authorising parent coordinators' licensing.
The meme used the term "extreme" to describe the action, even though "extremely" is more generally described as moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the project of complaints, "six-six parent coordinators were licensed", and "not only because of excess".
Finished Mission: Congress finds agreement on Libya's issue
Finally, it would seem that the Republicans and Democrats had found an agreement in the Chapter on the issue of lifting in Libya.
There will be a failure to succeed in the capture and death of the long-term dictator Muammar Khadhafi as well as the American involvement.
The Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate will have to take a next Tuesday decision, supported by President John Kerry (Democrate - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republic - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independant - Connecticut), commending the Libyan people for their rebellion and the American troops for their "religion".
"This resolution is to honor the courage of the Libyans as they start rebuilding their country," said John Kerry.
"It's a part of their democratic aspirations."
The language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
In the past, both parties' legislators have entered into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions to approve the United States military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution to authorise the limited employment of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was won by a broad bipartisan margin and has never been voted in the Senate.
However, on the same day as the failure of the draft law, the House of Members also rejected a measure aimed at reducing the financing of American operations in Libya.
Thus, the American mission remains in a legislative Purgatory form - Congress is opposed enough to criticise the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to cut the grass under his feet.
The decision of the Congress was exceeded by the events.
Tripoli fell under the riots in August and Kaddhafi was killed on October 20th.
The NATO mission was officially completed on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The Committee ' s resolution on Foreign Relations " congratulates the Libyan people for their courage and extraordinary determination for freedom" and "Happy the men and women of the American armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also states "the United States's national interest in achieving an irreversibly transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the Commission's support for foreign affairs of the Senate, or will it divide the legislators as in June?
The Senator and Chairman of the Commission, Richard D. Lugar (Independant), was against the latest version.
His spokesman said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project.
Within the Chapter, the House must vote this week for an amendment to the Constitution in order to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans of the Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure supported by the Republican Bob Goodlette (Virginia) will constitute the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other issue, to obtain a vote to appeal to the House or to the Senate.
Other legislators have not so far been able to approve their amendments, but this is not without trying.
The amendment of Goodlate is part of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been tabled at Congress on a wide range of subjects.
Some are recursive - the same bill proposed both in the House and in the Senate - and others are minor variations of a previous one.
There are at least 15 versions of the amendment to the House for a balanced budget, and another item that " would control federal expenditure " .
Some of these draft laws are identical, but they support them - including the new Republicans who want to pay their CVs - the chance of being "the author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act approved last August required the House and the Senate's vote on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators were voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members wish to limit the number of mandates during which Congress members can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrate - New York) wishes to raise the threshold of two mandates for the Presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrate - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other things.
An amendment prohibiting marriage between individuals of the same sex is continually proposed, as is the amendment prohibiting the profanation of the garment.
Some legislators also wish to authorize the annulment of federal laws if the two-thirds of the States are against it.
Assuming that they were members of the amendment, they are not as fast as they were in the past.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The decline was slowed by the beginning of the 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate library.
But these amendments did not have much more success than they have today.
The last amendment to be added - 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to the Congress in 1789.
"Massacrée but Not Battua" said Gabrielle Giffords during his first interview from the Fusillade
Ten months after being shot by an armed man at Tucson, the representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrate - Arizona) appeared on a television show last night, sang "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" from Broadway and said he wanted to come back rather than come back to Congress.
When she appeared in the TV magazine "20/20" on the ABC channel, alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form phrases and needed help to walk.
The release approached its difficult return to the ball that broke his skull and passed the left side of the brain through the head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the Chamber of Representatives to vote in favour of the text on the debt ceiling.
During his first interview from January's fusion, which killed six people and injured 13 others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed, and sang - and qualified for his "hard" recovery.
After Diane Sawyer asked him how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41 years old, answered "very well."
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronomer Mark Kelly, took place in a special edition of an hour of "20/20", published the watch on the release of the new book entitled "Gabby: A History of Courage and Hope".
The special issue has delayed the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords since the merger on 8 January.
In the videos filmed by Mark Kelly in the first few weeks, he was seen on his hospital bed, his head shaved, and a broad scarf on the front.
She comes to use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair while doctors learn to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
It's a hair movement.
And finally, his first word, "Quoi."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords quoted another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu of her breakfast.
The videos released by ABC show the important role of music in Gabrielle Giffords' recovery: is the representative seen singing with doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Nwana Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin".
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours every day with doctors, said he did not remember the fusillad.
According to her husband, she was reading an article on the fusion of 12 March when she stopped and asked for the first time information about six people killed in the accident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, was detained in a Missouri prison and was actively treated while waiting for the trial.
"There's been a lot of deaths," said Gabrielle Giffords to Diane Sawyer.
"Stop, stop, stop."
On his return, Mark Kelly said to Diane Sawyer, "I've been hit."
"So I would say, 'Gabby, you haven't been beaten,' said Mark Kelly.
You've just been massacred.
And you're gonna go out, get back and come back stronger than ever.
More loving than respect for the troops
The event: a gala at Wall Street to collect millions of dollars for the unfettered veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballade on impudence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, marines, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in costume-crawled himself on his feet to arrest him.
"Militarys, men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of the spring fund collection.
A high military rank in the Galway, which also participated in the U.S. Army Chief of Major Staff, Michael Mullen, saw the role of troops in a different way.
"They were presented as a sort of orphanage," wrote the military senior in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know.
But that wasn't respect, just the love.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations that have been established between the military and a passionate American public often.
Praises are offered to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they had a certain price, they said some soldiers.
The public acts more and more as if it were sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not all victims," declared general Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it would seem that the only way to support us is to nurse us in the role of evil spirits."
This is a very sensitive subject for military leaders who do not want to appear unrecognised or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of Vietnam's renegade troops has been much worse.
Thus, most of the conversations on the pie have taken place in all privacy among the Veterans.
After his two sons returned from the battle with the Marines, Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service under two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they were confronted with insurgents and traveled to distant contradictions.
Others would wonder if "a veteran in anger and violence hid under the surface" declared Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work in the Government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said he felt that some people who were making him pass the interviewers were asking subtlely if he would be able to handle the stress of a job demanding in Washington immediately after his return to the battle.
"When you discuss the subject of service, you are faced with negative impressions," recalls Colonel Cancian when he spoke to his children.
The military's difficulties arise, in part, from the American indifference to wars.
The winners are rarely welcomed by such a small country as the army and who sees little direct benefits from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value the heroism of the same way as for the Second World War " says Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of political men and people are largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a soldier.
The troops are recognised for the number of periods of service, the number of friends lost or the extent of injury.
The Army Faces the Growing Pressure to Fight Violence
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will proceed against the army for alleged violence inaction.
If that happens, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
Elizabeth Lyman's first-class soldier was 25 years old and 11 weeks old the night she said she had been raped by a soldier.
It was October 2008. She went to her home at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having met a friend when she met a colleague carrying a package of beer.
He asked if he could meet her in his room to drink a glass.
"C" was an alarm signal," said Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texane left his concerns behind.
I thought, no, 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after getting into Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man caught her behind, thrown her to the ground and raped her, claiming.
This week, November 18th, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other soldiers, some still serving and others not, will eagerly await the decision of justice during a historic trial that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and who will decide whether a trial against the former Secretary of Defence Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
The latter are accused of not stopping the generalization of the violence within the army, thus against the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Classified in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, the trial involved 17 plaintiffs. This number rose to 28 months later - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by members of the armed forces. They also claim that the army has not investigated, continued or provided justice adapted after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says he's taking the galloned soldiers because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she said.
"Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture of hostages? The leaders."
The lawyer also states that since February nearly 400 other survivors have been contacted, most of which could be part of future judicial proceedings.
Its strategy: instead of collecting all the complainants in this case - thus putting all his eggs in the same panel - will try several processes, if necessary, to keep the pressure.
The defence team, for the Department of Defence, headed by American lawyer Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to reject the case.
The judicial documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defence strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be pursued by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused by the armed forces.
According to a decision of the Supreme Court of 1950, entitled Doctrine Feres, the Federal Government is not responsible for the injuries suffered by the staff in active service.
" The alleged evil is inherent in the military service of the complainants " indicates the documents.
The Department of Defence refused to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are not always officially entitled to go to war, this distinction is only written on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely male.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women's military teams play an increasingly important role, including in contact with local women.
As a result, 150 soldiers lost their lives - two thirds in a battle situation.
It's time for the army to modernize themselves Susan Burke.
It is not alone to engage in this fight: three other trials are ongoing in more than six months.
At Yale Law School, the Center for Legal Services of Veterans is preparing a case against the four main military academys in order to be willing to encourage a mixed environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America prepares a trial against the army, focusing on the "difficulty of personality" diagnostics assigned to victims of violence in order to leave them - a relatively normal fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Women's Action Network, a group for human rights.
His group sought a trial in December with the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in order to deal with claims of advantages for persons claiming to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bill projects were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, offering various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded by the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office of the Department of Defence.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, according to the Pentagonian estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred this year.
The March report also examined the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20 per cent of the cases recorded in the army were conducted by a process - half of the percentage of the civil justice system.
Susan Burke's complainants describe their aggression as the first of a series of traumatisms.
In Lyman's case, she informs the Military Police of violence less than an hour after the facts.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell him 11 times in detail her violence to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She went up a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and the blood of her attacker - due to a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman was sitting in front of a judge, during a trial in which he was asked about his sexual relationship with his little friend earlier on the day of his aggression.
Six persons testified as witnesses of morality for the author of the crime, who ended up being executed.
"I remember the day the verdict was made," said Elizabeth Lyman.
"I think I'm going to start having contracts, and I'm going to cry after the trial."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commander, "It was not his trial but mine."
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who ended up diagnosed with a personality disorder, which renders him unfit for service.
In January 2010, it was sent under terms less than honorably, preventing any benefit from being received.
Whether Lyman and other complainants will progress or not, it is a long story, said John Turley, professor of law at the University of Washington University of Law.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to advance."
Only this doctrine that has been criticized since its introduction is found between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The army has been in the past decades because it has not had the same advantages and means of dissuasiveness as the responsibility.
"The chances are heavy against them... but it's important that they try," he added.
These things only change when the good have the will to fight.
If the trial doesn't turn into their favor, Susan Burke, the lawyer of the complainants, will collect hundreds of other complaints for other trials.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is no reform," she said.
Until we die, one or the other of the two options.
The walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy who shared his views on online immigration.
Mondi, Breivik, who admitted to having been arrested in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was confronted with his first trial.
While Breivik was acting alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, discussing with some of the millions of nationalists who support extremist groups on social networking sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy... connect to Facebook.
"We realized that it was not so difficult to find them," said Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report published by the DEMOS group on digital population in Europe.
Facebook strengthens so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could just use the site's advertising tool to find the people they are looking for with scientific accuracy - the way marketing people have done it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team discovered that half a million members were members of extreme right groups in Europe. She targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to respond to a survey. The questions concerned their level of education, their attitudes towards violence and their optimism about their own future.
By contacting these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues have been able to ask 10,000 participants from 14 parties on the right in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"It's a new way to do research," says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not surprising: right-wing parties are rather men, young people and anti-immigrants.
But surprisingly, "those who pursue online and offline activity are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen."
The study of DEMOS is just an example of how Facebook became the new uninterrupted tool between scientists.
Reflective groups, medical researchers and politicians use the site to study all health issues such as social trends, thanks to the "I'm Love" publications on walls and updated statistics.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content per day, the "data supernova" generates a research explosion, increasing the number of research work on which the site's name appears in almost 800 per cent over the past five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you cannot approach in the street.
"Before, when you tried to investigate the people of the British national party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should go to the party, but they would never have allowed you to come in," says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all of this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could offer a way to identify and address health and social problems.
According to a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, the young students who spoke on Facebook about their embryo's exploits had far more opportunities to be alcoholic than students who were aware of it.
Megan Moreno suggests that students' colleagues, such as counsellors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student where the status would be too often to talk about alcohol.
"You can't handle a problem if you don't diagnose it," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Centre for Health, Children's Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, says Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would otherwise not be recognized."
Facebook also regularly accesss the information of its users.
The website's data team studied statistics on the loving situation and the day of Saint Valentin, the 2010 mid-command election rate and a national happiness index (only information available - digital freedom campaigns have long supported that the site could make its data treasure available to other people for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site observes them, whether they like it or not - instead of being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of an investigation that they haven't even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined indications of how to collect information other than through the Internet, there is something else online.
"I do not think that a large number of users have already thought that a researcher can study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, after a 2006 study he conducted observing his students' Facebook walls.
"While they know, the exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even without internet access, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or the wall of a user.
"What you say on Facebook and what you actually do are two completely different things," says Neil Selwyn.
That is why, despite his experience as a technological researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a block-note and style remain the best tools we can use.
"Nothing will replace the real world and contact with people," he said.
"Social studies are designed to deal with the social aspect - and social, it's not in front of a computer."
"Froid and inhumanin": first comparison of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to having organized the two deaths in Norway this summer, described himself as a fighter "resistance" during his first appearance in the process in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Temples of Norway," he explained in front of a hearing room filled with 500 people.
"As for the jurisdiction of the court, I reject it, because you have your mandate of organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts, but I don't ask for any condolences."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to let him use this trial to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to leave Breivik, who brought him a paper speech, to talk to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the Police to keep Breivik in custody for another twelve weeks, prevented him from talking to the media for four weeks and warned him that the authorities would monitor very closely all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Thirty parents of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came in hopes of looking at Breivik in the eyes, others to make sure it would be placed behind the bars.
All participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found it cold and inhuman" said a survivor of Utoya at the Norwegian television channel NRK.
"I wasn't easy, but I personally made some progress after I saw and heard the suspect."
He looked at journalists and survivors in his eyes as he entered and left the court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belonged to a broad movement of "resistance", the judge decided that he was not crazy. He also stated that there was no evidence that he was dealing with complications.
The expectations of 22 July therefore seem to be the work of an extremist rather than of a whole group of radicals, which may be some.
But this does not reduce the grief or confusion felt by the whole nation.
"I would have preferred it to look like a monster, but that's not the case," said a victim's parent.
"That would have been much easier."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' missing interview this week's film
After Steve Jobs died last October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical genius and inventor of modern information.
But what Apple fans can find more revealing in a Steve Jobs interview recently found and will be broadcast this week in the first part of a film on the main markets, is what this creative spirit had included the processes and the flow of work of products.
There was no doubt a creator and a dreamer. He was identified by a hippie but was also very methical and organized, as well as an organizer of organization - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from "a disease that left them feeling that a brilliant idea makes 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a generic idea of an exception."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds". This series delays the computer's birth, and he spent more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At the time, this was about 10 years ago when Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, with a view to popular Internet adoption.
While a small part of the maintenance with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that major copies have disappeared in transport.
It's only after Steve Jobs' death that a complete video is found in the realiser's garage.
This video, slightly remounted, is the basis of a 68-minute film entitled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be released to the film Wednesday and next Thursday.
For someone who knows how to hate deep entertainment, Steve Jobs seems extremely excited here to expose technological philosophies and their commercial strategies.
You're incredibly careful.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly sets out his thoughts, in order to provide a specific answer.
There are also times when Steve Jobs' perfectionism, where he seems eager to understand the questions of Cringely, giving him cuts to speed it up and to deal with issues or issues of greater importance.
Filmed before the age of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, there is an extraordinary aspect of Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he sees good or bad in other companies and shares his own view of the future of the information.
It's a thing to read the posthumous evaluations of Steve Jobs' career, but there's something ugly and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dream of watching the size.
It has a vision of how things can and must be.
He then explains the steps to be taken.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
In the way he learned to run a business:
"For all these years, I have always asked, 'Why do you do things?' and the answers are constantly the same: 'Oh, just because you have to do them.'
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a business.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues giving details of his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Perplexe as to how costs were recorded - often started by a "standard cost" assessed for nose, then adjusted with a "variation" - developed an automated tool that would guarantee the precise calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour to the Pope:
Steve Jobs relates the anecdotes of the "Blue Box" that he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that used to pry the telephone networks and to call free of charge.
The device is made up of many letters in advance, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contaminated.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a public phone, by passing a call from an AT&T network to another via as many satellites as possible.
"We develop the bubble of different things a half-to-twenty times and you hang out in the public phone and this was a minute later on the public phone," Jobs explains, laughing.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something that could control billions of infrastructures around the world."
We don't know much about both of them, but we have invented a small thing capable of controlling great things. That was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would have existed a day without that.
Steve Jobs continues to tell a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak have made: he called the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night by passing on to Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are called in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two complications begin to laugh just before the Pope himself was revealed.
On his love with technology (and the launch of Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 years old, at the age of 12, he searched for Bill Hewlett's number in the newspaper and passed him a piece of thread.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs receives a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. C" was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my definition of a company and the way employees are treated."
Steve Jobs became one of HP employees to visit the company's research laboratories, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first never-designed office computer."
He was as big as a suitcase, he owned a small cathode tube, and I fell in love with him.
The youth I was back at HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On the improvisation of innovation:
On several occasions in the interview, Steve Jobs is talking about inventing new products on a top of his head.
At the beginning of his career, while he was installed to sell some printed circuit cards, a client asked him to collect a complete computer.
Working for only 30 days of credit, the assembly and the delivery of finished equipment must be covered.
Later, at Apple, he recalls the difficulties he faced in developing a computer voice:
"I remember great disputes... I was raised up claiming that I would need five years [to make a shed that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer."
Forty-nine days later, we had a smile that we could make for $15 and that would be incredibly reliable.
On the big companies that are wondering:
Before he was forced to relive Apple, Steve Jobs had predicted how many industrial leaders would cheat and lose control of their market share.
"Admitting that you work at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copyor or a better printer, and then?"
You have the market monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [this is] these types of people who end up leading companies and the specialized staff in production are set apart from decision-making.
The product genius that led to this monopole position is completely capable of people who cannot imagine to design a good product in relation to a bad product - the manual work required.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have stopped the entire computer industry.
She would have done ten times her current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They drew the defeat to victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
"A huge part of manual work separates a brilliant idea from an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn about its subtleties.
There are commitments to do... Some things you can't do, the electrons can do it, the glass, the robots, the tools too.
You must keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by bringing them together to each other.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. It is about trying to expose you to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring these things to the product you create.
Picasso said one day that the good artists are copying and that the great artists want to.
We're always ashamed to want excellent ideas.
This is part of what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who just had the best computer sciences in the world.
If this were not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another area.
Scalia and Thomas are engaged with enemies of the right to health while the court meets
On the day on which the Supreme Court met closed to discuss the issue of political dispute, namely whether opposition to President Obama's health law would be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noted at a dinner sponsored by the lawyer's office to defend the case before the high court.
The event was last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss applications for review.
One of the cases concerned was a process that 26 States were seeking to reform the reform of the ambitious health care voted by Congress last year, a law that was a point of reference for conservatives at the national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5 a.m. was expected in March, and the result will probably be of a nature to promote the destabilization of the 2012 presidential course, which will be in full place at the time of the court's decision.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and argue on the rejection of the law will probably be Paul Clement, who served as the general applicant of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
Clément's Legal Office, PLLC Bancroft, has been part of two dozen cabinets that have helped to celebrate the federalist Society's annual dinner, a long-term group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another cabinet that held dinner, Jones Day, represented one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical genius Pfizer Inc, who presented a huge financial challenge in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference.
There was, among other things, Mitch McConnell, the top Republican of the Senate and a declared adversary of the health law.
You see the guests at dinner?
This is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Federal Society for years.
And there's nothing wrong with the rules of deontology.
In fact, judges are exempt from code of conduct which governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would no doubt argue with the Canon 4C code, which states: "A judge may attend the collection of funds from law-related organizations and others although the judge may not be an intervention, an invitation to honour, or on the program of such an event."
However, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the lawyers' cabinets in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, has sufficient to alarm government ethics activists.
"This violation of ethics and superabundance of the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges gathered and went to a collection of Gala funds with lawyers who had cases before the court."
Their presence and participation in the collection of funds of this event demonstrates any claim for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little concern for critics claiming that they are too easily mixing court affairs with the agenda of groups such as the Federal Society.
And Thomas' wife, Gini, is a high-profile conservative warrior.
In addition, conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general applicant for the administration of Obama when the first objections to the law were brought to court at the level of the first instance.
His criticisms forced Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying that she was too investment in the defence of the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication what she would do.
Boeing registers a record order of $18 billion for line planes
The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777, bi-coulier line planes, with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, an estimated market of over $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order containing 50 of its products.
This is all the case when the company is the manufacturer of Boeing aircraft and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the total record of $18 billion.
It's also incredible who Boeing has received this command: the Middle East, a golden mine of future plane orders.
In the forecast published Monday, Chicago considers that the airlines in the Middle East will need a total value of $450 billion in the next 20 years of 2,520 aircraft.
During the weekend, Boeing reported the most expensive commercial aircraft order - 50 Boeing 777 bi-colouriers.
It is the air carrier Emirates based in Dubai who passed this Pharaohic order.
Boeing announced to the Dubai Aircraft Salon 2011 that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total amount of the order to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing indicated Monday that the Oman Air company ordered six Boeing 787-8, called Dreamliners, a model that features important fuel and conveniences for passengers.
The amount of these six devices is worth more than $1 billion.
"It's clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, an analyst at Morningstar.
"These customers in particular have an enormous value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries own a lot of their airlines.
Therefore, they have not only the means to pay these aircraft, but an amount of fuel price - which is usually harmful to airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so harmful as the country would earn money with the oil price.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or separate their orders when oil price increases, Dihora said.
"They have a natural risk cover," he said.
The Emirates order strengthens Boeing's predominance on the market in large-port aircraft and helps to counter the attempt to improvise Airbus with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the Aeronautics Hall comes four months after Airbus' announcement to report the beginnings of the largest version of A350, which coincides directly with Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus restates its initials in order to increase the pressure following the request of its customers to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
Boeing's operations increased by 1.5 per cent to $67,94.
The Mexican President's sister was publicly beaten by the election of Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon states that drug dealers helped his adversary Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the course of the governor's post.
President Philip Calderon's sister seems to have lost her attempt to access the government functions of Michoacán during violent elections, and she said Monday that drug dealers promoted one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was the head of the course at the position of the governor of this Western State.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the entire country," said Luisa Maria Calderon to the radio during an interview on Monday following the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral agents... they took up urns, installed road barriers... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for sixty-ten years until the presidency was lost in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in the Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have noticed only a little of Calderon, who was head of the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate from his brother's conservative party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or the PRD, who is currently in charge of the government's functions, has arrived third, a criminal failure before the 2012 presidential elections for this divided and unhappy left.
Aureols also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the capital of the state, has broken down all ties with drug dealers and has strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
The Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine trafficking.
This is the State of the origin of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Violence, however, has continued.
A week before the elections a PAN mayor was killed while he was campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates gave up the campaign locally because of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michael elections had the air, a winner will help the party in its wake.
The man who is expected to represent the PRI in the course of the presidentials, Enrique Pena Nieto, has congratulated Vallejo since Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for the next year."
The BASD strongly urges Asia to come to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare themselves to help the euro area get out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, head of the UNDP-based Manille, stated that the two world's fastest growing economic powers should "do everything they can" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary area through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at Europe's difficulties with an "indistinct eye" and noted that Asian financial support from European leaders and resources would help prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this crisis together."
"That is why anyone can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times during an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected up to a certain point, but it is not open."
"So if China and India can help, nothing can prevent them."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a crisis of sovereign debt.
Recently, the cost of the Italian Empire was dangerously high, and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece were decommissioned.
The booming crisis of sovereign debt in Europe has intensified the fear that the global economy will not be rebounded, and has led to the call for major emerging economies to meet together to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr. Nag stressed that the IMF would provide all Asian aid, but he also stated that this bilateral assistance - such as purchasing the obligations of the U.S. financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - had a greater power to negotiate with the Asian partners in Europe.
And Sharma, Minister for Trade and Industry of India, said that "India will do all it can" to help the euro area because its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and a shift in foreign capital revenues.
"No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and aggressive," he said.
"We have monumental challenges to face and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an imperative, because where would we find work for tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others claim that developing economies such as India should not help European rich people while facing their own important economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, stated that it would be very politically difficult to accept European assistance to 1.2 billion Indians, of which at least 800,000 live with $2 per day or less.
"One day, they will find out that the Greeks take their 50-year retirement and go on vacation in the sun and they will have the evil to evaluate," he said.
Lee Howell, President of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India's reserves should be used to maintain many well-paid Greek officials in mismanagement jobs, such as in the railway sector.
Mr. Nag said that the euro area crisis was likely to cause "significant impacts" across Asia.
The BASD projections of 7.5 per cent economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 are now facing "lost risks" due to the European threat.
He noted that vulnerable emerging markets needed to develop "sustainance plans" to protect themselves from economic returns and important capital flows.
Major warnings of the Pentagon on potential defence reductions
The Defence Secretary, Leon Panetta, has raised the pressure on the Monday Congress, warning that the imminent automatic budgeting compressions would know national security, and has launched a financial response to the pentagonese colouring chain in Afghanistan's battle camps, passing through civilian collections.
The Pentagon has already estimated $450 billion in reductions for the next decade, but fears now that an additional amount of $600 or more would be imminent if Congress did not reach an agreement on expenditure.
"The impact of these reductions would be devastating to the Department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He stated that the failure of Congress to reach a budgetary agreement resulting from the so-called segregation would result in 23 per cent of reductions as well as many new projects.
"A so important reduction, applied without discretion, would make most of our ships and construction projects ineffective - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or building - and bring serious damage to other modernization efforts," wrote Panetta to the senators.
"We would also be obliged to separate ourselves from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we would certainly have to send civilians away without pay to achieve the goal."
"These changes would undermine the faith of those who support our soldiers and seriously damage our preparation."
The reductions would possibly affect the fighting troops, Panetta continues.
"Although the financing of foreign contingent operations during the war is not directly affected by sequestration, war efforts would be adversely affected by serious disturbances in the basic budgets," Panetta warned.
"The contractor would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and oversight of contracts supporting the war."
"The staff managing the salaries would be reduced, resulting in delays in payment to war providers, and legal and political support would be disturbed."
The two senators had written in Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of a sequencing on the Department of Defence would have begun a rapid decline in the United States as a world leader inconsistencies in military power."
"We are deliberately opposed to this dragon action," the senators declared in a joint Monday afternoon communication when the Panetta letter was published.
"It is not a consequence with which we can live, and it certainly is not what we should impose."
"Secretization is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen."
That the letter of Panetta and the recent warnings of senators increase the pressure for a budgetary compromise or a call to avoid the Pentagon de reduction, remains to be seen.
Panetta was increasingly vulnerable to possible compressions, even though it had reached the highest level of the Pentagon, culminating in years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing that it was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defence drew a summary of what might happen - a soldier with a coquile but not a knife.
"It's a ship without marines."
"It's a brigade without balls."
"It's a hunting plane, not enough trained pilots."
"It is a piece of paper, a casserole army, buildings and bombs that do not have enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panetta said in her preliminary remarks to the Pentagon.
"It is a depressed, ill-prepared and unable to face potential enemies."
"In fact, she calls for aggression."
In an addition to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how new reductions could " generate significant operational risks: time of response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and unacceptable risks in future combat operations".
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects could be covered, including those already tested and some just at the first stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bomber, the ballistic submarine of new generation, the new battleship and the new land vehicle, which would replace the Humvee of the army and the sea.
An end to the development and testing of F35 could generate $80 billion of savings over 10 years, but its partners say it is an essential step in improving and responding to China's potential threats and other rivals.
How to Report a Bug
A review of the recent shortcomings indicates how much deception and deception are common in everyday life.
The Republican candidate to President Herman Cain is engaged in the exchange of sexual harassment allegations with several women; each party accuses the other of lying.
The administrators of Penn State were charged with fraud in order to have reportedly covered up reports by which a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by an open microphone saying to American President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has destroyed careers and confused countries.
The member of the New York Congress and the celebrity of the Internet Anthony Weiner, has become an idiot by quickly issuing statements against irrefutable evidence.
The former candidate to President John Edwards was charged with violations of the funding of campaigns related to the coverage of an extra-conjugal link.
And then, none of those who have lived the story will never forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton launched in his second mandate on his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
Trichery stories at school and university tests are legitimate.
There were cases where teachers gave students tests responses to their performance assessments.
Liers who should teach the opposite send the message according to which lies and trichery are acceptable.
How many trolleys do we meet?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are worse lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their encounter.
Detecting or detecting lies is an essential competence that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game of society similar to, say, of the ways in which the objective is to write, "I've got you", the detection of fraud is a serious knowledge branch based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted a thorough research on such projects, including psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths on the lie have been proved.
The liars look at you in the eyes.
They don't smile, smile, or they don't always get tired.
Do not conclude that lies are difficult to detect and difficult to remove.
A qualified lying detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial micro-expressions, the training of the question and the time of the answer.
I have spent several years examining scientific results in the vast body and always emerging from the knowledge of fraud, and it is clear that the detection of fraud is a modern competence that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include recruitment, interviews, negotiation or management.
Good liars are capable of reading to others, putting them at ease, managing their own emotions and intuitionally detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that aliens lie more than introverts, that men say more lies "centered on them" than women say more lies "centered on others" - usually to protect the feelings of someone - that married people lie less often to their partners than married people (but the lies they tell have a tendency to be arrogant).
We also know that if you feel like a liar, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How can you say if someone thinks?
First of all, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
That's what we're called "to establish the reference data."
This helps to provide a reference point to measure subsequent changes.
Watch your subject, smile, voice quality.
You need to know if someone usually removes his feet from standing so as not to launch unjust accusations when you see him remove his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for signs of verbal and nonverbal misleading behaviors.
Consider these indexes as red tapes, not evidence of the trumpet.
Smuggling people can real estate the body's height when they try to remember their history, they can point their feet to the door, think to a exit, change their position in a significant way, or present a relief of "post-interview" - an exhilarated breath of relief, a change of post when all difficult questions are passed.
The questionnaires often erroneously indicate that the maintenance is done just to try to slow down the post-interview reaction.
Also, pay attention to your subject vocabulary.
The famous Scott Peterson was disappointed with the past, claiming that his murdered wife was alive, starting a national search to find her.
Individuals who cheat can also use a remote language: "I didn't have sexual relations with this woman... Ms. Lewinsky" or simply repeat a difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood language" when he answers a difficult question, "Well... to tell you the truth... if I remember my assets... to my knowledge."
This makes the perceptual answer rather than fact and is often a red suit.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize fraud is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid the victimization by kidnappers in their professional and personal life.
The disputed oil plan will be delivered after the United States' late approval threat
A few days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of an oil project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - fueling the anger of the unions while visiting the environmentalists - the company seeking to build the oil said it was ready to direct the project to put it back on the rails.
TransCanada announced Monday evening that it will move the pipeline planned outside the environmentally sensitive area of Nebraska's dunes, and it is confident that the project will still gain its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the capital of Nebraska.
TransCanada official Alex Pourbax claims that the company remains confident that it will end by obtaining the approval of an olive oil, but with a different route.
This was followed by the announcement by the Department of State last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it received new potential inkling studies to avoid the areas of the Nebraska dunes and Ogalla aquifer, from large underground water sources.
"It's a real way forward," says Lee Terry, a Republican of Nebraska in Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Department of State would probably have rejected any decision by 2013, following the elections next year, although officials do not have the involvement of policy in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the Department of State, and expressed his support.
The 2,735 km oil would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels per day from the province of Alberta to the Texas refineries.
To do so, he would have to cross six States.
He is a hero of the ecologists, but he is loved by working groups, who have placed on the estimated 20 000 jobs related to oil.
However, the legislation against the opposition of Nebraska is a force for the removal of the Sand Hills region and Ogalla, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The environmental impact study in the Department of State found that the project would have only limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry stated that the Department's Director-General had ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist engaged in TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign consultant for Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice from its relationship to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle continued for claims caused by a young child to be afraid
A New York family claims that the Disco Patti LaBelle diva launched in a violent detonation in their Manhattan apartment hall, terrorized their little daughter at the point where she was terrified.
The drawing of the song "Lady Marmalade" left little Geneviève Monk 18 months old, so far as she had "the personality changes, sleep problems" and "the fear of strangers" had increased," said her family during the trial of the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was November 10th of the last year when scene technician Kevin Monk, his teacher's wife of the children's garden, Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing to leave for family trip.
While Kevin Monk was going to find the car, Roseanna Monk came down into their apartment hall at Riverside Boulevard with their bags, carrying Geneva in his arms.
Roseanna Monk said she had stopped by the door and had put her daughter for a while.
"Someone came behind me and said to me, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes" and I went looking for her," she said.
LaBelle was angry with the pregnant woman.
"She said to me of an aggressive tone: "You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said to him, "I don't care what you say or think."
She became pregnant and began to use jurons - the word """ and the word "" of a strong voice...
She had a bottle of water, and she began to spray me out of the bottle.
She said that at this point Geneviève became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look at what you did to my daughter," the mother of the child said.
LaBelle fell on her mother - who had always been Geneviève in her arms - and had to be held by her surroundings that drove her to a car that was waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so hard that she got drunk, she added.
Later, the family sent a note requesting LaBelle's apology, but received no reply.
The lawyer and the representatives of LaBelle did not return our calls to comment.
The complainant complained about the unexplained damage, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, declared that he had taken the case freely and that the family intends to give all the money received for a charity work against cancer for children.
"The aim is to hold Patti LaBelle responsible for her conduct," said Mr. Davis.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially to a mother teacher who has a child of 18 months."
Climate aversity has shaken the economy
During the first year of the management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa, unemployment and informity increased, foreign investment decreased and the economy became engaged
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, called the change, which has generated great expectations for economic progress, but given the climate aberration of the beginning of the year, there is no increase, but there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures in February, apart from the loss of billions for the agricultural sector, limited the possibility of the state's economy for growth, caused a contract of economic activity in general by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, largely justified by the history down to 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the report by the Mexican Council for Rural Development, there have been 582 million hectares of cultivation, 78.03 per cent of which have suffered total damage and 21.07 per cent have suffered partial damage, the main crops in question have been legumes, maize and small fish.
The decline in economic activity has generated, until November, a constant increase in unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of unemployment in the first three quarters of the year has been observed accelerated, as during the first half of January 55,053 signallings, with a rate of 4,53 per cent of the Active Economic Population, in the second quarter, the rate has been 5.28 per cent and from July to September the average rate has continued to grow to 6.19 per cent, a rate representing more than 74 thousand signages, compared to the first half of 18 million,969 people.
Less liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the U.S. Department of Economic and Social Sciences, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly by actions undertaken by public policy.
"What we observe is an increase in unemployment due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market leading to a restriction of resources by the legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who earn dollars in an illegal way it is not easy for them to work for them, to invest them and use them in something," he said.
_Other Organiser
López Cervantes noted that the increase in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the State to work abroad has been limited to the United States, first because of the difficulties of entry and second because they have already had many difficulties finding work, these people remain here and ask for work sources, which makes unemployment grow," he said.
No serious errors
The analysis of the labour market in the signalled labour market is compounded by the high level of a serious lack of labour conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in this state of work without being employed as a worker in no social insurance institution.
In addition to the unemployment and the lack of seriousness, another reason for the state's decline is the low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Prediction.
The average monthly income of signal workers was, by September, 5 thousand 352, much lower than the national average, which is 7 thousand 375.
IED Contract
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, the strongest reduction in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years was recorded in 2011 according to the IED secretariat in January to June, it reached $630 million 697, representing a decrease of 87.74 per cent compared to $5 million 143 million 312 registered in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Economic Development Secretariat of the Government of the State accounts for a total investment of 17.280 billion weights per year, primarily registered by the tertiary sector companies.
Make this a recurring event
Given the economic contract scenario, in July the Government of the State requested the approval of a 3 billion pesos credit for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities, with the aim of rehabilitating the economy, the approval of the State convention was 2,600 billion pesos and until November there was no benefit from recognition in any sector of the state's economy.
Reactions
For the representatives of the patrol sector, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés demonstrated a lack of capacity to manage the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said there was no harmonisation of the wishes of the various sectors, including the Government of the State in 2011.
"The performance of Sinaloa's economy during this year has been very poor, it is necessary to work intensively to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, it has been necessary to align the efforts of all and, above all, the good market already modernized by this new Government team, hoping that the next year will be much better," he said.
Economic Lent
Loredo López stated that events such as the ices of the beginning of the year kept the state's economy and limited its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is produced by several events, including ice, one of the main effects was a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate economic dynamics that enables us to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year, we are much closer than we expected," he said.
Redefine the vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Confederal Confederal of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa, stated that it is intended to channel the State into more dynamic productive activities.
"In general we have observed that it has been worked, we believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefinites the state's vocation and economic direction, as it is important that all the potential of the material and human resources of Sinaloa is reduced," he said.
A lot to do
The President of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better channels the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to deliver good results in various areas, with regard to economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in the way public policy is managed.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that much has been worked and the Government is aware of the fact that there is still much more to do," he said.
Sentenced for 8 kilograms of Marihuana
A resident in Novolota was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for eight kilos of marijuana.
The General Park of the Republic reported that the convicted minor is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for health crimes, in his marijuana possession variant for sale.
In accordance with document AP/SIN/CLN/68/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by members of the Mexican Army during a monitoring operation in the Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small passenger was traveling in a white-colored pick-up truck in which he carried a black colour bag in the vehicle's luggage and on the side of the plane a small bag to two where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of Marihuana.
For this reason, the confiscated elements have been made available to the District Judge's Second, and the conviction is still in the Crimes Legal Implementation Centre.
These are to be contributed to the work
Social works in programmes such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants are likely not to be completed where to record serious delays from the lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda reported.
The municipal Social Development Director indicated that even though construction programmes have progressed so far, they are in a situation of risk, as the Government of the State has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions of over 11 million weights in the three programmes.
He noted that, in total, the investment of these three programmes was approximately 50 million, of which the State had to provide 25 per cent and so far only the Federation and the municipality had provided resources for the works, so there was a possibility of delay in their finalization.
"They must make a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year is soon to end, they have given us nothing, even though since July they have had to give us a part," he said, "and we, to not delay, have started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need money."
He noted that during the past year, during the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, so at the beginning of the administration, the municipality had to request a loan to cover 7 million that the State administration had not provided at that time.
"We have already done this in the previous sex period because the State had no economic capacity to participate and the programmes continue to operate and this year, to have access to these programmes, we had to obtain resources to cover what the State had not paid," he explained.
Despite the commitment of the State authorities to provide these resources, he stated that they had made a request to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the management so that the corresponding percentages would be reached as soon as possible.
"They must provide nearly 12 million and despite the fact that the year is soon to end, they have given us nothing."
The valid Court "the analogic cut" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the United Nations (SCJN) has raised constitutional disputes that the Senate and the Chamber of Members have formulated against the presidential decree, which goes on to say "analogous cover" from 2021 to 2015, since the eight votes required for invalidation were not met.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his duties when he issued the decree detailing the steps to be taken to establish the transition to terrestrial digital television.
As a result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic has been resolved not to reach the qualified majority of eight votes in order for the Court to speak on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree to continue to be in force.
The draft judgment, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutional, because radio and television regulation is a duty reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), contrary to the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Members have promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the order and, by adopting complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the order and all the actions envisaged by it for the digital transition.
The Plenary Meeting of Ministers also decided to draw up the complaint made by the House of Members, without discussing the draft which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his intervention, the Prime Minister said that he was not in agreement with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive could not structure the measures for the public administration to prepare them through general standards.
"I no longer consider that it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," he recalled that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has the constitutional authority of the State.
The replacement of analog signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years, and this is the result of a better operation of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more channels.
To update the change, he supported, would update the benefits of digitization, which involves a decision of public interest which is not only a technical dimension, "which also includes national economic, social, political and security issues".
These issues, he stressed, "requires the operation of any established system, in accordance with the principle of state economic management, to include a group of tasks granted by the Constitution to the Executive of the State".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition and have done so through the Executive, although they had highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested order, has in one way taken over the sphere of Congress's competence, as it ensures in the administrative sphere compliance with the laws issued by the Act.
Analysis of the possibility of a "vote vote" deficit in Michoacán
According to the data provided by PREP, the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without accounting for the votes corresponding to 879 out of the total 6 thousand 74 votes.
The possibility of "vote vote" is a reality with regard to this year's electoral process in Michoacán, where according to the data provided by the Pre-Trial Electoral Results Programme (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without accounting for the votes corresponding to 879 out of 6 million 74 total.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Institute of Electoral Affairs of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Angeles Landeral Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with federal electoral reform.
It will be recalled that Michoacán did not approve either his Constitution Political or his Electoral Code or his Electoral Justice Act, while the Congress of the State approved reforms shortly before the end of the legal period so that this electoral process could enter into force and Governor Lionel Godoy Rangel had issued his publication within the time-limits provided by the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that he had some objections.
On the same November 9th, the Supreme Court of Justice of the United Nations (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the local legislative power and qualified as "invaluable and illegal" the vote of the State's mandate for constitutional reforms, as it did not have the right to "sanctify or challenge".
Interviewed on the possibility of "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Landeral said that through the approval of the relevant guidelines by the IEM General Council, it would be possible to make partial and full voting statements by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, can only be: the results of the oral proceedings do not match; there is no oral trial and there is no record in the prayer file of the President; or there are obvious errors or alterations to the oral proceedings.
In addition, the total number of votes received in all election sessions can be achieved when there is an indication of the fact that the difference between the candidate claimed to win the election and the candidate who received the second place in the poll is equal or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition by the representative of the party and/or coalition who submitted the second of the candidates notified.
The total outcome of the survey may also be achieved if at the end of the joint report the difference between the alleged candidate and the second candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is a request by the representative of the political party whose candidate is the second, where the electoral packages are excluded from the partial report.
It should be noted that this is the situation of Morelia's election, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second places is only 0.16 per cent, even without accounting for 129 votes in 923 votes in total.
Its last will
His ashes will be placed in the Sera of Zapalinamé, confirming the family.
The rest of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive at Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday to the night, and Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a request.
According to his family, the last wish of the colonel was that his cells be placed in the Sera of Zapalinamé.
After receiving compensation for the death of others in the accident, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the capital of Coahuila on a plane from the Mexican Air Force, the closest ones attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
In the middle of the employee's funerals, they arrived at the bulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where the family and friends returned.
At 17:30 a.m., he was given tribute to the Saltillo Institute of Technology organized by his former colleagues of technology backup and the American football team, which was part of Felipe Bacio when he was preparing for the backup.
"He would like to return to Saltillo and his ashes would be placed in Zapalinamé's serra, he always said this to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
For her, the colonel had fulfilled all his dreams, she considered that he was in the fullness of his life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, extraordinary, a loving brother and he cared for much of his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo to register at the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn't believe him, because they said he had even a bad truck; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he met in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as was the occasion when he brought Martha Sahaccoon to Saltillo."
The young man remembers even the fact that when he was seven years old, he traveled to Zapopán for his parents' graduation, so he knew that his uncle was killed by doing what he loved most in his life: piloting an aircraft.
Last Played
It was said with honor to see Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, who, at the head of Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the Government of the state, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, the directors and students of the Saltillo Institute of Technology, where he studied in 1985 and distinguished himself in both studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was flying broke down, along with the government secretary, José Francisco Blake Mora and six others, all officials of this service.
The rest of the Batio Cortés pilot born in Saltillo arrived (incinerated) at 18:05 to be delivered by the funeral to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the team's beach, where he was expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, his brothers and other parents, students and teachers.
Three abandoned bodies located in the property of Cadereyta NL
A few hours before it was found, the military authority had presented to the media 11 persons who had been arrested in the same municipality for organized crime crimes.
Three men were found killed by shots of fire in different parts of the body and with the cut of gratitude, in a abandoned property of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place about 1.5 km from Cadereyta road in Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.

In terms of the interior, approximately three meters, they located the bodies of three persons, which they immediately informed the respective authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with bent jeans, without shoes; on his side there was another with a white T-shirt, with glasses.
At a distance there was the body of another individual with a red T-shirt and blue-coloured jeans.
The three were extended on the roof.
According to the data obtained in place, three people had been murdered elsewhere, because no injuries were found in place.
In the closing of the property there were legends sent by a group of organized crime to the other, apart from a few whale origins in it and in the portal.
11 captures in Cadereyta

The new Italian government will be formed believing
The first Minister appointed, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the brink of economic disaster.
The first appointed Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and has put the whole Eurozone in jeopardy.
A communiqué of the Presidential Palace announced that Monti, named Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he could form the Government.
It is expected that it will present a cabinet composed of most of its technocrats, even if it is not clear when the new executive will take his place.
Monti said he would present to the President the outcome of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner to journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The "frame is now well drawn," he adds.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a shorter period than normally, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has caused the costs of its debt to be borne at levels that cannot be supported.
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Monti must approve a strong asylum package required by the European leaders to recover confidence in Italy that had been affected.
Stressing the pressure on Monti to move, the instability of the markets in place of the performance of the Italian BTP obligations of more than 7 per cent, the level in which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcagglia, leader of the Italian patronage Confindustria, said to the media after his meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to face this emergency.
Monti's chances of success were greatly encouraged by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, where the crisis was forced to release last Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti will have a good outcome," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of PDL, the largest part of Italy, is significant because so far many of its members have been opposed to the Government of Most Technology as Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monti must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be impudent austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could lead to a new and destructive attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by observing that Monti's failure would be a disaster.
Monti began his consultations with political parties, unions and sponsors and youth and women's organizations.
He will finish his tour of meetings tomorrow night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, which enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief review at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was about to resign, the costs of the Italian debt are now falling to critical levels between the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.9 billion, would be too much for the current financial defences of Eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should continue until future elections, planned for 2013, despite general forecasts that politicians would only give him time to implement reforms before the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his office, but the large parties insisted that he should be trained only by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process required by the financial pressure.
Political sources have indicated that mutual misunderstandings and disputes between parties are complicated by the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of the Spanish is superior to that of the Costa Ricans.
Of the 22 footballers called Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
On the part of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 participants attended 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to Costa Rica, if it is compared to 22 convened by the two countries for today's friend at 15:05 a.m. at San José National Stadium.
While national and European champions, the number one of the FIFA's monthly rankings, account for a wide record of Class A inter-election games, the Tricolor has only the champion Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached on Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and powerful clubs of the First League of England maintain an intense activity in national leagues and cuts and fights in European Cups such as the League Championships.
In addition, experience with Furia Española must be added during the complex eliminations of the European Cup and the World Football.
Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have an international experience limited to a zone, such as the Concaaf, which is considered to be lower in the FIFA.
We see that the largest record of the Spanish Selection is that of the goal guard Íker Casillas, who had the previous Saturday against England (defence 0-1 in London) equaled the record of the old goal guard Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play against the Tricolor today and will create a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, a celebratory flight from Barcelona in 106.
Casillas and Xavi were also recognized last week by UEFA alongside the other hundreds of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and Schalke's former centre Raúl González with 102.
The century's prize is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Ineista, with 62; Cesc Fabregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the coastal side, and close to Michael Umana is the left side of Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and Bryan Ruiz butter, with 45.
After that, only five were over 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
At least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, there are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appeared with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even reach 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are not starting yet.
The historical butter of Spain is David Villa, with 50 mice, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz is the one who registers it the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its tour to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"To go to Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said the group is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have waited for more than 20 years, but the group ensures that for them it will also be a dream that has become a reality in this country.
It is that the bassist and founding member Jeff Ament made sure, speaking exclusively with Viva, Brazil last week.
The group is located in the South American ale of its two-day workout tour, and on Sunday 20th it will make its only scale in Central America.
That day will be at the National Stadium, from 19:30 p.m. on the side of the Los Angeles Group The X and the Nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an extract of the conversation, where complete transcription is found in La Nación on the Internet.
For its cost-effective adaptations, the fact that Pearl Jam will take place in Costa Rica is a dream that has become real. Are you aware of what your fans are living in?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has come true for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America, and so far it has been huge.
I went to Costa Rica only once; it's such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
So it makes us excited to bring our music down there.
I ask you, because there's a kind of devotion to the group, the boys live with intensity the days before.
What is your message for your most comfortable fit?
Thank you for staying with us all these years.
It took 21 years for us to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that it had to take so long until this concert.
Some people already say that their concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the larger shows we've offered over the past 21 years have been in place in the past two weeks.
We have offered two giant shows in Sao Paolo and we hope it has formed us for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are very impatient to produce it.
We love this country, we love to make surf and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you find Costa Rica and its cows to make the surf?
We have many superior friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and vagues are incredible there.
My friends were always going to make surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along the coast of Mexico, are great places to make surfing; that is how we learned it through people who love surf.
When you saw the tournament, you offered huge shows, with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we are never produced there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and different record.
You never repeat the directory.
What's that got to do with?
I think it's partly because we have nine discs and we can interpret more than 120 songs and each one likes different songs, so it's very difficult to choose which songs to interpret every night.
When we have two or three songs in the library that we have not been interpreted for so long, it helps us to stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we love these songs and that we can have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us, and as a result, I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it difficult to believe everything you've accomplished?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us had imagined we were going to form a large rock group, and the fact that we've done it for more than 20 years makes it look like a dream.
We continue to enjoy our blessings and the ability to continue to make music together makes us very excited.
We love and worship to create music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world where we've always wanted to go.
Things couldn't go better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunt?
This has always been a honour for us to be part of this large group.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's amazing when a movement arises from a group of friends and it's not common.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups leave the same city at the same time.
We're proud and it's a honor to be part of Seattle's group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden in their tour, so we're lucky to be still friends with them all and it's an honor to be part of this Seattle sound that has risen.
It is also very strange that a group like yours maintains unity and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and that's just a lot longer than many groups usually endure.
First of all, I think we are all lucky to be alive and secondly, we are all concerned about others.
We are all intimate friends, and thanks to this there are musical bugs that give each one the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other with each other's music, and this could not be better.
Your relationship with the celebrity word was not easy; however, thanks to your success, you were able to do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier to find a balance.
We'll make sure that we don't spend too much time around because it's easy to fall into this game of the great crowd and people who love your music.
If we don't forget that people are here for music, it helps us not to forget that we need to respect music and what brought it, without focusing on the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which is not really interested in any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and this was great at first.
We were a group for almost three years and did not publish a disc before Andy's death (Andrew Woods).
There have been many frustrations because she has endured so little and most importantly the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the group with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think of the amazing person Andy was and how he laughed, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a wonderful human being, and he misses us.
The Las Robertas National Group will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose to open it?
Yes, production has sent us videos with different proposals and it has been the group we loved most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer directly and that must be very interesting.
Why do you always change Yello Ledbetter's words directly?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
It's him who sings it, and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There's so much...
Among the first I remember was Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, that I could talk every afternoon about the bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunt relevant despite the fact that he is no longer in fashion?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the Grunge word.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the groups I have just mentioned, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who have come up at the same time and, if that's relevant now, I think it's wonderful because it's a music that's hard to listen to and groups like Mudhoney are doing the best music now than ever.
At first, his music had a more darker content and now it has become more positive.
What does this change involve?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe, which are highly obscure songs, even though they may sound a little positive.
With the two, when Ed played them for me, I wept when I heard them, and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you're big and there's a trauma in your life and you lose a parent or friend, these things start to influence your art and music and these songs, of course, are for me.
I also think that we can also be happy and even as this can be done from obscure music.
Peru:
Sujimori re-hospitalized for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength he is presenting on his feet, informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years old, who serves as a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from various infections, including language cancer for which he was four times under control.
Congressman Alejandro Agugunaga, his personal doctor, said for TV channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplasic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in its lower members.
Agugugaga commented that in her opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to benefit from the release of the punishment for humanitarian reasons, he said that he did not want it because he felt innocent.
It has been operated four times by language cancer, has lost weight of 18 kilograms, and other pathologies, such as severe erossive gastritis, pancreas, kidney calculations, arterial hypertension and foot circulation problems, have listed the doctor.
Fujimori has been in detention since September 2007 in the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people due to an army manipulating retreat that had been carried out underground for the first years of his government.
Mujica trip to Mexico to consolidate political links
An official cortex, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and formed by various ministers and employers, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade among the two nations and address regional political issues.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with its Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long-term agenda of meetings with the political, commercial and community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to the agenda circulated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "near to exchange information in political affairs between the two nations", according to the information published by the Presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France when Frenchman Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of fiscal paradises, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude the international community from the countries that continue to be fiscal paradises, a statement that caused the rejection of Uruguay and the appeal by its ambassador of this European country.
Mexico has been the president of the G20, a group of emerging and developing countries, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan Government has tried to secure the establishment of tax exchange agreements to emerge from the "greet list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implement all international standards of tax cooperation.
From 2004 onwards, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Treaty (TLC) that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustachu flower passes to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has struggled, inflexible, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from poor Bowser's flu, but he never did it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of youngster in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which takes place this month at world stores, has been designed from the beginning to exploit the features of Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using moons.
"Mario is the person who has to say how to work without moonlight stereoscopy," said Nintendo's specialty press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez pointed out that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally designed for this support", because so far successful as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's speech portal supported that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows a fast and fluid part.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simply" to reach the least qualified users.
Once mounted, the most experts will be able to make a "second tour" at the levels of the game, which is more difficult this time.
In addition, users will be able to really choose between a "D aggressive" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but this would be necessary to play three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and to "do not succumb to optical illusions".
This super Mario intrusion in the three dimensions also assumes the return of personnel to a mobile console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo makes an eyeline for the saga adapters and repeats the success formula of the previous games, which consists of the fact that the moustachu bomber has to walk through the mines platforms to free Princess Peach.
Even though I am a player finding news in movements, environments, customs and enemies and also in the case of Luigi "joyable".
Colom gives his avalanche to Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy of 70 million US dollars.
This concludes the trial so that Guatemala will respond to the request of the northern country that claimed Portillo to judge it.
At the press conference, Columbus stated that his decision was subject to the independence of the judicial and executive authority, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He stated that during his mandate "he had not assisted" in any judicial resolution and had given all the extraditions he had known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extracted for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extracted for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done has been an executive step after all judicial and constitutional proceedings have been conducted to judge the former mandate of the 2004-2004 interval.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after settling its legal situation in Guatemala and after ensuring its human rights.
Portillo was absolutely responsible for the transfer of Q120 million funds to the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the process prior to the extradition, but the Ministry of Public Affairs called and re-acted the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity is born to avoid marginalization of young people without training
The first 25 years of life of the Trinijove Social Support Unit is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of the century.
This adds to the hundreds of jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary was used yesterday to balance a famous act in an old industrial complex of Fabra i Coats, where more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the village of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping people who are not trained, without work, with problems of drug abuse or marginalization.
The celebration of yesterday in Sant Andrew has concentrated a large number of entities and institutions that have collaborated with the association for the past 25 years.
The range of political representation, in full electoral season, showed the unitary nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Along with the President of the Catalan Regional Government (General), Artur Mas and his predecessor, Jordi Pujol, attended the event by former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and former mayor and current councillor of Eco-Socialist Richard Goma.
We also attended Fabra i Coats' large room to the current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Joseph Lluís Cleries and the Director General of Charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he claimed that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that it is now too, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The President gave Trinijove as an example to fight bad circumstances and to give people hope in difficulty.
"The crisis is nothing new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Owned by squatters for micro parties, evacuated
Invasors were suitable for 11 of the 13 buildings of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 employees left their property at noon last night without any resistance.
It seems to indicate that the closure of Rue Balmes' 51 residents was over.
Twelve people left the facility on Wednesday yesterday voluntarily and organized micro-fests that were expecting neighbors, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the doors were changed to prevent the situation from repeating.
"From now on, there will be access checks," said the administrator.
The squatters, which had occupied 11 of the 13 buildings of the building - the rest were used - carried the electrical installation and part of the water, apart from painting the walls and leaving all sorts of waste, especially of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the stage of mass festivals, which would last for up to two days and expect the tenants.
On the side of the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europe Press that since the construction occupation her business has decreased by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the owners of the property made it of the deloyal competence, because they sold the wines to three euros, while the discotheque was worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the loisier area had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors for the noise, while, according to that, the damage was not caused by the customer of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the house occupied and especially by the participants at the festivals organized there, which were more frequent and intense in the last few weeks, according to the area's irritations.
The discotheque officer explained that the weeds were so large that they even had an agreement with the owner of the furniture and that it took nine months for him to "forgive" the rent.
Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that they had received more complaints from neighbors over the past few weeks.
The president of the municipal group of the Meria PPP, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had requested last week "the immediate evacuation of the furniture to end with the problems of common and civil life that it caused residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but in recent months the squatters had occupied all stages of the building and almost all apartments and that in some apartments there were also flights.
It is in this sense that he added that "it must end with impunity and be implacable against the antisocial behaviour generated in the property".
Yesterday too, the Mossos (the Catalan local police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 15.30 p.m., the police moved to Rue Mont-ral's 35th place, after receiving the call from a neighbor who had observed four people arriving at the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the opportunity to call beyond the polymers on honoraries
The municipal competition on the 16 gates reopens the debate on the role of Collseroola in Barcelona
In the mid-80s, in full support of the Barcelona Metropolitane Corporation (CMB), this administration has printed Collserola's promotion posters.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not look at the north-south axis but rather high (mountain) - low (sea).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park is the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with candles in the role of our Yogi.
This was the situation until, in September, the mayor called for a fair competition composed of 16 competitions for all access ports in Collserola.
A door closes to the idea of park, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question appeared only: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both with regard to its organization and with regard to the thinking of the city, is a subject of discussion of all the architects in Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme, which two members of this former elite caste speak when they recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this is just one of the rare views on which three architects of Barcelona, university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Rolldan, Daniel Modol and Martha Bayona: the competition is appropriate.
For Rollan, after addressing the literary front "it is necessary" to discuss "the mountain front" because Ildefons Cerda's speech, that of green houses, was not completed.
"It must be from the base that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," he gave the architect the title "Callserola gates" which means a "chickle": it should not be considered "how access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which it must act".
Modol, like Rolldan and Bayona with experience in the urban world, defines the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "a few losses".
Perils resulting from "uncertainty of public space projection" after experience in the 1980s and had been in the Forum's "song song".
The first fear is the very delimitation of the borders on which it can be built.
"Limiting something means setting up the next step," that is, its excess.
"It is necessary to consider new urban and planning instruments, because current [in reference to the General Meteorological Plan (GPM)] may cause real disasters."
In keeping with the question further, Modol believes that, by simplifying the reader of the region El Valles de Collserola "may be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, no".
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola which "should not be lost" thanks to the opportunity the mayor offered to his corporation to intervene in this project "from the first time".
In addition, he believes that the approach of the mountain with the city is the save-way that allows architects to enter into the debate, but "doubt" if this technical profile should lead multidisciplinary teams ("all success", he says) that it has to be created: "We, architects, should be only a tool".
Bayona is not suggesting that the answer to the question that gives the title of this room is complex, because the basis of the competition is missing a global vision of Collserola: "There have been 16 cross-border competitions - say it - in the sense of mountain-sea, but there is no longitudinal reading that goes and understands the area as a whole."
This is, at least in this case, what he chose to participate in the 16 competitions.
In another way, a project for one of the doors to jump into the program and definition with the architect of the nearby door.
In his opinion, yes, the mayor should ensure that the band immediately higher than that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, throughout its extension, an area of equipment that carries out a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino apologizes to Jonas Larrazabal and he will be released free
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the legal authority fund of Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged singing
After 72 years of arrest, Manuel Jonas Larrazábal will be released after the legal power of the Casino Red grants him forgiveness before the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a trial against the mayor of Monterrey's brother.
After waiting for Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonas alleged to require him to pay for an economic quota so that the Mayor of Monterrey will allow the clandestine operation of the game house.
After the public complaint, the Park opened a criminal trial against the PANIST mayor, and on 2 September he was arrested and detained for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Public Department Agent 3 of Patrimonial Crimes, he was transferred to the 1st Detention Centre, located in the Old Quarter of State Capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days when he was sentenced to a second detention order after the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs had removed the offences of corruption and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Cadereyta's criminal centre as alleged to have sung with a million and a half people in the Casino Red; but he spent only a few hours in the middle security detention centre because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue his trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolas de los Garza.
On 25 October, a arrest order was issued by the Registrar of the Second District Criminal Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient evidence to establish Jonas' guilt, such as that of reaching 1.5 million pesos of the role of the board of directors in exchange for his operation.
This Monday, the foundation of the legal power of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, was presented by Judge José Luis Pesina to apologize for the mayor's brother of the region; therefore he could recover his freedom during the following hours.
During the legal formalities, the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and who the members of the game house had been the one who had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to disclose the name.
According to document 197/2011, a legal apology was granted to Jonas Larrazábal and no claim for an attempt against him will be made; no damage will be requested and no penalty will be imposed.
After hearing the legal authority of the game house, at 15:50 a.m. the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Breton was ordered.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolas de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been legally forgiven and his case would be classified.
He will also communicate to him the order of freedom immediately issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome tells us the details of the plane accident in which the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and seven others lost their lives.
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) reported that the results highlighted on the incident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven others had lost their lives, indicating that the helicopter was directly shocked at the soil in full structural integrity, without the pilot being able to try a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that prior to the landing of the aircraft, the pilot found that climate conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the soil, the pallets had been contacted with trees at 25 metres where the unit lost the fuse".
It also reported that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so it met the requirements for transporting staff.
In addition, he said that investigations in the affected area do not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In a study it was reported that there were no parts or components of the aircraft in another place, the impact was structurally presented.
"The helicopter had been designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements for transporting them.
The soil had a floor of seven to 30 degrees inclination.
For the moment, the Secretary has made sure that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation may take a few months, it may even last for a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Airports and Assistive Services, made sure that the moment of impact, the helicopter of the Presidential State was operating rapidly to cross and that happened on an ascending ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of normal functioning to cross at the time of impact," he said.
During the press conference, the SCT holder, Pérez Jácome, identified six important elements in the investigation:
Visual volume:
According to the aeronautic regulations, the flight has been carried out according to the rules of the visual flight, which means that the crew must have visibility during flight and land.
Meteorological conditions:
The reports in the ICM referred to appropriate conditions for deceleration, and to the wind and measured that the aircraft was moving towards the DF-State border area and there were low levels of nebulence.
Selected paths:
It is likely that because of the conditions of nebulousity, the crew has sought a lower altitude area and more visibility to the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of the impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the latest recording of the aircraft on the consistent radar, probably before the impact, have not been lost or the control or alteration of the flight trajectory.
Dispersion of the remaining aircraft in a reduced zone:
The information available so far allows us to assume that the impact has been placed on a straight and side trajectory.
The model of dispersion of the remaining aircraft allows us to assume that the helicopter has hit the ground under structural integrity conditions.
Fire or explosion traces have not been detected:
There is always no trace in the rest of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple contacts with the soil.
During the field work, it was found parts of the aircraft at a height of 9 miles 200 feet above the average sea level, and the soil was presented with a pen that ranged from seven degrees to 30 degrees inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he may have been disarmed along his trail.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have multiple effects with the soil.
After a minute of research in a wider area than the area where the accident occurred, there were no dispersions of the aircraft, which supported the assumption that the impact was carried out under structural integrity conditions.
MSS protocol announcement to find the gene of obesity
Social Insurance conducts research to find the gene of obesity in the case of children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is conducting a research to discover the gene of obesity in the case of children and young people, called the 'Genetics of Obesity of Children and Adolescents' protocol, which will enable them to have symptoms associated with obesity.
In a communiqué, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the National Medical Centre's 20th-century Hospital, Miguel Cruz López, explained that he had been formed a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social assistants.
This team is supported by third-cycle specialists and students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IGN).
In the investigation, it is invited to participate in the legal or non-legal population, to attend the IMSS participating sports units in Valle de Mexico, where there is evidence for minors from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the Protocol had begun in the Sports Unit Cuahtémoc (State of Mexico Ponente) and that since 8 October the activity was carried out in the Sports Unit of Nezahualcóyolt (State of Mexico East).
After reaching the goal of meeting 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sportive Independence Unit (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Sportive Morelos Unit (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the objective of this research and that of identifying the components and importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and identifying risk factors among children and young Mexicans in order to prevent the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
As the World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on 14 November, he mentioned that the goal is to gather three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and their previous family heritage of their disease, to avoid risk factors that trigger problems such as diabetes or renal failure.
He explained that the salmon will be applied to all participants in anthropometric measurements (weight, size, size), arterial pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (to identify people associated with child obesity).
Cruz López noted that this research is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming burden in the case of minors.
The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that only six years ago there had been an increase of 77 per cent in obesity and 47 per cent in girls; a dramatic increase in survival was also observed in IMSS.
He stated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the country's population is different from others by its genetic history.
He reported that, on average, Mexicans have 65 per cent indo-American heritage, 30 per cent in Europe and 5 per cent in Africa, and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and obesity.
He explained that, in general, obesity genetics are being converted into the inability to burn the excess energy consumed (calorie), which is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the full assessment of children, which enables them to detect if they have a degree of obesity or obesity.
It even says that the presence of more acanthosis (acanthosis) on the neck and arms indicates the likelihood of suffering from metabolic and even diabetes.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, which doctors provide in writing to parents, explaining each of the measures and changes in the lifestyle they need to make in order to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause surpoid, obsessiveness and other chronic effects: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, stay most of the day sitting in front of the television, and use means of transportation instead of walking on short distances.
Another reason is the high caloric intake, i.e. the largest consumption of sugard beverages, carbon hydrates (tams - meat pasta of maize wrapped in maize leaves -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and genetics analysed in this protocol.
UNAM's asphalt would avoid cases
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the University of Chemistry of UNAM, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair approximately 200 thousand cases each rain season in the Metropolitan Valley area of Mexico, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the University of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who has ensured that if the construction and maintenance process of the bitumen pipeline is adequate, the cases could be reduced or even completely eliminated.
During its conference A technological opinion on cassies, organized in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory responsible for developing modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture having similar characteristics to those of the asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera considered that this type of modified asphalt could be used in areas where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve performance, and consequently the formation of cases.
He explained that the asphalt, the heavier part of the oil, is a combination of hydrocarbons molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called Malteses, which together give the pope its viscosity.
The viscosity of the asphalt consists of the fact that at high temperatures of about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C it presents a nearly solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes falling, adding it.
This means that in the streets the asphalt resistance is not uniform and changes during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, warns the chemical engineer.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City in most of them were covered by a flexible floor consisting of six layers of materials, the last three involving the asphalt.
Among the most surface layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stone cut into asphalt and later compacted.
Each of the small stones forming the layer, it signaled, is washed in asphalt.
When vehicles make efforts there, it allows the forces to thrive very well in the deck.
If we had changed the asphalt, they would have spread better, considering the chemical engineering.
On the asphalt layer, he said, it was put on a last layer called a rolling layer, made in fine stone, that is, of the sand that is also washed in asphalt.
As this is the boat in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the axle of the asphalt and provide the adhesion in the street.
As the part of the pave that receives and distributes the effort, the rolling layer also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material it is made must be cared for.
The climate, particularly humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, because these significantly affect the performance of the asphalt layer.
When the soil melts, the water spreads inside the layer is difficult to produce, which brings back all layers of the floor and consequently causes cassies.
In the process of training a case, he said, the first one to be caught is the rolling film and only later the asphalt layer is affected, but the damage did not immediately occur, but it is a process that must be cared for by the first signals with appropriate care programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for the formation of cassies and therefore the length of each floor must always be linked to the load of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, in order to avoid frequent formation of cassies.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on the asphalt, for example, the bitumen emulsions that exist in other countries already on the market and allow for easy repair of cases and without having to use high temperatures.
What happened to Valle's candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that made Melina Ramírez Serna not getting the crown of Ms. Colombia.
Valle received her title number 14 from the princess.
Again Valle del Cauca remains with the desire to win Miss Colombia's crown.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with the fact that she was on the winner's podium, bringing the crown of money and the band that credited her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico is mounted with the crown and the sceptre, the department already has 14 titles from Princes and Melina with a female legend from Valle del Cauca who have been found near the crown but have been declared princesses, including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Rosa Mary Alvarez (1981), Olga María Arena (1987), Leila Blanca (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1993), Giselle Garces Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007) (Garces).
Today the big question that many people ask is:
What did he miss? Because the result is the absence of a great favor that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected Queen of the Police and Best Visit Jolie de Vogue, titles obtained by the Queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who carried the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered in the decision taken by the jury of the First Princess is that she did not agree with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you, and why? put by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here's the answer from Valle's candidate to this question:
"I read a lot, I think enough in literature, I think it's a form of culturalization, definitely I think that the book that marked my child is "The Little Prince", it's a very deep book.
Now I read "Crime and Châtiment", is a universal literature book that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nimirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Blood Loss".
This answer was not first applied because of the term "culturalize" and secondly, in order not to explain precisely how each book mentioned it had marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony, she said that she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wisdom, it happens what has to happen.
And for everyone, please read, "The Little Prince" is a big book.
Among the hypotheses launched there was the one that Valle was destroyed by favoriteism.
A journalist from Bogota pointed out that being the preferred, the occupier and candidate who received all the preliminary prices (Oster gastronomy deficit, the public vote for the best artistic costume, and Queen Mother), "it revealed the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that it did not shine on the scene."
And this was noted in his first presentation in a bathroom on the Hillton beach and his two missing from the crown guard.
Although it seemed safe for the two missing persons, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osario, journalist of the "How to Home" program, of the RCN Canal, said that the fact that Melina was appointed prince "confirms the fact that the candidate who receives most of the prices during the competition does not receive the crown of queen".
In addition, Valle avoided the pressure at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social initiatives, which is actually the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That is why two days before the election, international jury Lucy Doutty said they were looking for a woman engaged in the social needs of her country.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Ms. Colombia, it is necessary to look beyond physics and focus on its social sensitivity, but before starting the Competition, it is already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also said that Valle sinned by his faults behind him and the fibrosis that was observed in his body, but this is contradictory, because the jury chose him as the "natural beauty" candidate with the healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
Queen-maker Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledged that Melina had no better body than he had, "but his problem of fibrosis on the abdominal, which in fact was not too familiar to me, left him the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos, of the Cromos magazine, considers that the error of Valle's candidate was the surgical intervention she had taken.
"The surgeons are good, but Valle has no power to do them.
His body has never been his body and it has lost because of this aspect."
For this price, that the National Beauty Competition was awarded for the first time, after the Bain Maillow Defiil came up with a terrible prediction that was fulfilled last night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo did in Melina so as not to give him the taste of the crown.
In reality or not, the truth is that Melina is starting today a year of rule, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that enables her to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions designated by the National Competition.
However, she will go through history as one of the queens who, despite her revealing passage through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
So it was the work of Cali's person who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
A dactyloscopist from Cali went through history as the man who confirmed the death of 'Alfonso Cano'.
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4th, a dactyloscopist of Cali's CTI passed into history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Chief of the Farcs: "Alfonso Cano", in comparison with his digital impressions.
Of the seven dactyloscopists working in the CTI's local offices, this week was the "applicability" tour of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working for 21 years in the field of judicial research.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the towns of Chocó, where he often had to spend more than five days in the forest to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital of Valle and after having followed appropriate courses, he specialized in dactyloscopy, which is the study of the hair of frying, i.e. the feet and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was warned to take at least three days' customs with him.
Something really big was waiting for him.
Friday night he is part of Cauca in a Palmira helicopter.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that he was suspected that one of them was the man who was leading the world's oldest hero, so he was asked to import the card with the ten digital printers of Guillermo Leon Sáenz (on his behalf).
But when he arrived with the body's research team, he did not recognize him because he was very different from what he saw in the media.
He didn't have a beard, he was dressed like a landscape in the area, without moons and much more magic.
But the impressionors don't lie.
Along with a galtonian loop, the encre, a receiver and a Lantern, Eliazar compared the digital prints of the body to those of the card.
His eye did not deceive him: it was about "Alfonso Cano."
On the same night, Puerto Tejada's original man was the defendant who confirmed to the Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinzón that he was the Supreme Chief of the Farcs.
In search of print
For a dactyloscopist in Sijén de Cali, the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González at a press conference for the operation against "Cano" is very significant.
Many people didn't know our job.
The dactyloscopy is an exact science, without the margin of error, which can be crucial in the resolution of crimes.
In addition to identifying bodies, dactyloscopists support investigations for crimes such as flight and homicide and confirm the identity of persons captured.
When captured, many criminals have false identity cards or do not have documents.
We take their digital impressions and research into the database.
The researcher said that in a flight case he had to remove a part of the wall from a house, because in this place the flighter had supported his hand to make out a gift full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to draw a digital pressure, but in this case we have been able to get the pressure from all hands and identify the offender who had participated in various flights," he recalls.
Entrepreneurs may also remove or confirm suspects in cases of homicide.
Recently we found a dead man with drinking bottles around him.
During the investigation, it was determined that a parent may be suspected of crime and that an impression on the bottle was consistent.
Even if this doesn't guarantee that he's the killer, it's the place on the crime scene.
A CTI dactyloscopist explained that it is derived from "the digital pressures of objects with chemical or physical reactions".
When they appear, they use a receiver or a band to pick them up.
Afterwards, the printers are sent to Asif, the database of offenders, or the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without paper," the CTI expert said.
He explained that everything is not how it is shown in the CSI television program.
Like everything that shines is not gold, everything we touch doesn't necessarily become a shock.
However, it can be used if the necessary comparison is made.
The "independent" defends the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters raced in front of Zuccotti to camp there.
A large part of the people had access to the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The integrations of the Occupe Wall Street movement challenged New York's authorities this morning by attempting to reenter, through a judicial order, in Manhattan, where they were evacuated to the abe and when they tried to occupy another park of the Great Pomme.
Hundreds of protestors raced to the Zuccotti place, where they wanted to access a judicial order that allowed the 'indigenous' camp again in this place, while the rest of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park more north of the city, where there were new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the place, we will install ourselves elsewhere and continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through websites and peaceful demonstrations," said one of the speakers of the movement "Occupe Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the 'indigenous' response to the evacuation of their camp personally ordered by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, reached the courts where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation of the place and allowed demonstrators to stay in the camp.
In addition, the 'indigenous' occupied a new park located at the confluence of the Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Dutch tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, owned by the Trinity Church parish.
At least one hour they managed to take over the place, but after the police moved there and stopped some protesters, even though Bray could not confirm the specific number, ensuring that he saw some journalists who had also been there for minutes.
The organization ensures that there are hundreds of persons who have been installed in this area, where a delegation of religious leaders has moved to support the members of the movement and has tried to intervene in favour of them before the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti place - which is a private property institution - remains closed waiting for the celebration of a judicial hearing scheduled for this Tuesday, during which the legality of the evacuation of this morning is to be analysed.
Several delegates moved up to the point where they carried and distributed copies of this court order at that hour and even delivered it to the local authorities, which caused 'some small confrontations', reported Bray, who reported that some officials had beaten the protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evaluating the members of Occupe Wall Street or applying laws published after the commencement of the occupation or prohibiting the protesters from re-entering the park with the temptations or other properties they used earlier.
The Mayor Bloomberg pointed out in front of the press that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and to the protesters, who were warned that local laws did not allow them to install themselves with tents and bags to sleep.
The municipal councillor personally defended the eviction carried out at Zuccotti place, an operation during which 200 persons were arrested, which was decided on account of the fact that the demonstrators 'were violating the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered that the place be evacuated because it was "a place where people didn't come to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases to harm others", because "some stores had received threats" and the residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"The eviction of this morning at the abbey has been rejected and shows that the Bloomberg fund is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of American workers," adds the spokesman for the movement, who accuses the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression".
"Occupe Wall Street" officials also indicated that they do not intend to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Marie in a special Noel television program
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, she will come out in the television program "It's Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1
Canadian Pamela Anderson was the assistant of Tim Allen in "Home Improvement", a co-founder in "Baywatch", a lapin in "Playboy", married to rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special program of the Noel of Canadian television.
The private CTV TV channel has announced today that Anderson, alongside the "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear in the television program "It's Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st to interpret a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV distributed today images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide dissemination on the Internet of a private pornography video in which she appeared with her husband at that time, the "Mötley Crée", Tommy Lee, appeared dressed as the Virgin Mary in support of a crowd representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently introduced a part of "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen, appeared like Joseph.
On the side of Anderson and Peters, the special program of Noel de CTV also presents Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and who is not far from the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian 'pote' during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan came back after the earthquake
GDP increases by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the drop spiral from March
Since March the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, even after the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in the country since World War II.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo calculated the material losses of $300,000 million, a time that, despite the difficult world context, seems to have fallen.
After three consecutive quarters of losses, the Gross Internal Product data between July and September were used to finalize the page: GDP increased by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter and 6 per cent at an annual rate.
He registered the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - and supposes to be the largest growth rate since the January 2010 period.
The recovery is partly explained by the recovery of equipment acquisitions to restore areas destroyed by earthquakes and tsunamis.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1 per cent, compared with the reduction of 0.9% of the capital expenditure observed in January to March, the first recovery after six months of uninterrupted increase.
However, the real incentive of the Japanese economy is not solely based on the Kenyan impulse that invites the crisis to consolidate or rebuild infrastructures, use the need for zero growth.
Japan has revealed itself mainly through the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of the Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increased expenditure on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The y-axis
Tokyo returned to the internal market when the yen - the Nippon coin - became one of the "refugees" chosen by investors who were the debt crisis in the eurozone and the United States' forecasts, a privilege that was lost as a contribution to the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a stronger division, products are more expensive abroad, a serious reverse for a country whose economic fluctuation line is determined by the health of large technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, were responsible for their poor results between July and September.
While markets continue to sit in the periphery countries of the EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not lose its guard.
"The risks persisting, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand's floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And indeed, the prospects are not of any encouragement.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) noted that most member countries had made clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the global economy's inflation points has highlighted that the main powers are frozen.
Because it dropped four decimal places to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurozone was even below the average, which is at level 100, not falling eight to 99.13 points.
Add food again to doubt
Papadimo says the adjustments will be approved, but the conservators will not sign a written commitment
With the risk premiums released and the uncertainty reinstalled in the parks, Greece continues to climb into the labyrinth which leads to the emergence of the great crisis of European debt.
The sense that the "consensual" of the new Greek Transitional Government is rather imposed by the requirements of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of political forces begins to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister Lukas Papadimos pointed out yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period set out in his appointment could be short to apply, the leader of the conservative party Nouvelle Democratie, Antonis Samaras, would ensure that he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his requirement of new elections for the scheduled date on 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to apply the decisions of the October 26th summit," Papadimos said when he opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that would end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to stimulate employment, reform of the Disciplinary Code of Staff and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras does not raise doubts about its position: "We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we are committed to nothing more."
The conservative leader has gone a step further than the EU and the IMF, the agencies that need to unlock 8,000 million more urgently than Athens needs, and has clearly stated that he will not approve any letter of commitment to the implementation of the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still frustrated by the impact of the whole of the Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its requirement is firm: it will not block the aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity as soon as possible".
The Economic Affairs portal, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that Troika inspectors would return to Athens "too fast" to discuss with the new Government "the elements needed to pay the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, although there is no final date.
The Greeks still have much to do.
The Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen underlines Spain's "presiding" position with regard to this type of funding
Spain "has reached a world-wide position in the role of the Microfinances".
Queen Sofia recalled that in the last two decades, the country has become the second provider of the planet with regard to this instrument of cooperation, which is “the essence” of the fact that it is a “ instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on confidence in human beings”.
The Queen opened the World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid yesterday with the assurance that "there is no doubt" that such operations are "absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations for 2015 and, "very specially, in the one with the goal of reducing half the volume of people living with incomes under one dollar a day, which is the "poverty threshold".
Spain "continued to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all parts of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofia, who hoped that initiatives and contributions from the Summit, which extended until Thursday, "ensures the creation of new capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have "a lot of goals" and "we face many challenges".
The Microcredit Summit is considered not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which it has to push "two basic goals".
Thus, His Majesty explained that the objective was that by the end of 2015, there were 175 million poor families who had access to these financial services and that hundreds of millions of these families were from the poverty line in which they now live.
The momentum in the design of microcredit in Spain and in the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneer way" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted Queen Sofia as a "two-year act of justice and recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as a "immigrant idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work she had known since 15 years ago when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her loan policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "on every meeting I have been able to see a continuous change", explained His Majesty, whose relationship with this project gave him the "family head" qualification at Valladolid, on the part of the "poor Bank".
Finally, Queen Sofia has completed its intervention by encouraging the people present to participate in the debate and the search for solutions to progress in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for all democratic states.
In this sense, she expressed that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to economic prosperity times, as this is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredit was a "serious and rigorous policy devoted to eradicating poverty", and now "more than never" the Governments of developed countries had to work under the solidarity criteria and not let it be the victim of compressions.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main lines of cooperation for development”.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, commended "the success" for giving "out of trust" to the "excluding people who are totally at the door"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva, wished to welcome the people present in a city who "opens its gates of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to lift the European President to the universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian-Democratic Union Congress (CDU) held in Leipzig on Monday, 14 November, was without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, a Chancellor and president of the Christian-Democrat Party.
Europe's future was not originally planned for the programme, but it was committed to self-determination, especially in order to satisfy the fighters who judge the government's policy too low-visitive to the Greeks today and perhaps Italians tomorrow.
The motion for a Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Directorate, has been adopted in almost unanimity.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The stand-up of several minutes which they were entitled to, following their interventions, Angela Merkel then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, did not leave any doubt.
The idea-master of the Chancellor - and of the Movement - holds in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less than Europe but more than Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the chancellor, "Time has come from a perpetuation in Europe".
This could be translated by amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but it could also be based on the election of the President of the European Commission to the universal suffering "in order to face Europe".
In any case, this is one of the motion proposals adopted by the convention where the inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the Vingt-Septs will soon agree on this revolution: Great Britain is hostile there, and the CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also there.
But the jalon is set.
In the same way, delegates rejected a growing majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country to the Director of the European Central Bank on the basis of the weight of each economy, which obviously meant strengthening Germany's weight.
The chancellor has made many references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has no longer sought to win her conference on the two European "little" countries or countries with immediate difficulty to criticize the arrogant Germany.
If the movement on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "the French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not mentioned France.
Except for the crest.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been in the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonian army.
What is the fraud of sick arrests?
After the allocations, the UMP and the government launch the attack on disease arrests.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 November to visit a family rent box, and to give a speech on the theme - they have been running since 2007 - from combating social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which is part of a willingness to make savings in a rigid context, but is no less adverting an axis of the right presidential campaign, the majority want to focus on disease arrests.
Firstly in a budgetary economy: the government intends to impose a fourth day of unemployment on the private employees before taking over a job.
Obviously, without a specific business agreement, a payer who falls sick would lose four days of pay, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that could lead to anger, but which would make it possible to report €280 million, according to Les Echos.
And who would be accompanied by another measure, which would be more symbolic: impose on employees a day of unpaid unemployment in the event of termination of work (they have not so far had a period of unemployment, against three days in the privacy).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also reject the theme of fraud, focusing on the abuses associated with the job creation.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you're taken, you'll be reimbursed," Xavier Bertrand told the RTL micro on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of advertising seem somewhat disproportionate to the reality of fraud at the workplace.
This has been the subject of constant follow-up and political offenses since 2002, which have most often brought their fruits.
The French are no more ill than in Europe.
Let's start with the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), over EUR 237 million of daily payments have been issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Research and Documentation, daily remuneration was 5 per cent of health expenditure in 2008 with EUR 11.3 billion.
Of this sum, 46 per cent were related to maternity leave and work accidents, and 54 per cent were related to health arrests, or EUR 6.2 billion.
And that's 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French reported an average of 14.5 working days, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by Alma Consulting group.
One medium that hides some discrepancies: another survey published in 2007 by the Monster.com career management site showed that 75% of the 40 000 French employees interviewed said they had not taken a day to stop the disease.
Another study, this time of disease insurance, stated that in 2010, 37% of the disease arrests were from 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% from there.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are no longer confined to jobs.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence (for health reasons or not) was oscillating between 10 and 11 per cent, compared to 20% and 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom or 16 per cent and 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The fraud of the disease arrests is very small in the face of work in the black world.
As far as fraud is concerned, it only reaches a low range.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic controls on disease arrests for over 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million controls, CNAM found that 13 per cent of 285,000 short-term arrests were "unjusted or too long" or 37,050 cases.
In the case of more than 45-day arrests, systematically controlled, 11 per cent of "inadapted or unjust" cases were estimated at 1.2 million, or 132 000.
In total, therefore, 169 000 "unjusted" cases, on several million employees who had a disease arrest.
A figure that represents a very small face, for example, to one who works in the black field.
According to UMP Dominique Tian, author of a June report on the issue, it would represent 9 to 15 billion euros of lack of tax per year, or more than the total cost of daily wages, and therefore more than the fraud to the latter.
Papadémos: Greece will have to apply a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to restore its economy.
That is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos told Parliament on Monday 14 November, adding that the hundreds of days given to his government of the Union would not suffice to carry out this task.
"In order to continue economic recovery efforts, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who delivered his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote on trust in the Mercred Parliament.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro area summit on 27 October will be the "primary task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area "is in play", he added.
As a result, Mr. Papadémos predicted that the country's public deficit would be reduced to "about 9 per cent" of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
The right refuses new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right file, gave his support to the measures already approved to try out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not engage in an additional austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with the Members of his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing deficits and debt, and of combating hostages but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
In Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who said that the IMF and the EU would not block the loan of EUR 8 billion needed without the written guarantee of all parties supporting the proposed measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
A committee of experts on euthanasia and suicide must be legalized.
Canadians live in the death penalty, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
In terms of palliative care, the Committee claims that governments, health institutions, and doctors work together to provide better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in the grip of death.
Only 9 per cent of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
It is one of the conclusions of a report by the Royal Society of Canada, which has been attended by six experts in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code so as to allow the assisted suicide and euthanasia, when this option is imposed, to a patient competent to make such a decision.
At the beginning of the game, experts cite a recent survey of the United Economist Intelligence, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
If Canada is classified as 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death".
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, reports to us the experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada.
And although most Canadians wanted to die at home, 68.6 per cent of them ended up dying at the hospital.
In general, in Quebec, this rate is the highest, with 86% of deaths from hospital.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to the conclusion that the federal government's position, which had already said, did not want to change anything to the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or discriminated against, there is no evidence that such discrimination leads to abuses in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or suicide involving persons not competent or authorised.
On the contrary, she stated yesterday at the teleconference Jocelyn Downnie, rapporteur for the report, that there would be more cases of these debriefings specifically in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"The assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downnie.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
We recall that 85 per cent of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it would allow people at the end of their lives to cope with their suffering, according to Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
66% believe that the fact of legislating euthanasia will not have the effect of sending the message that the lives of the elderly or persons with disabilities are less valuable.
As for people who have been involved in the practice of suicide, it is estimated that 41% should not be continued.
In the case of maintenance or termination of care with a patient, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggested that it should be indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which a legally valid refusal was not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained to comply with a life-long refusal without fear of criminal prosecution.
In terms of palliative care, the Committee claims that governments, health institutions, and doctors work together to provide better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Finally, in terms of palliative or terminal sedation, already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and that it be subject to the same procedures.
Reserves of other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already issued reservations regarding the conclusions of the report of experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
Me Pierre Deschamps, a right-wing health specialist, has described the position of signatories of the report, among other things, as it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to terminally ills.
"This opens the door to a situation where everyone who would be tired of life and who would have been more than 18 years old could ask for help to kill himself," said Me Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
My Dischamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the individual's autonomy above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
But, "in society, he says, there are whales and obstacles."
Health Law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "a strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which she described as "pro-euthanasia manifeste".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly answers the data of the report on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, both in the Netherlands and in Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to withdraw his power
Ladies announces a "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bachar al-Assad's supporters appeared yesterday at the premises of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressures have intensified on the Syria of Bachar al-Assad yesterday, which, with Russia's support, resists and denounces a "complet" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union reinforced its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, took a position in favour of the departure of President Assad.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader to call President Bachar al-Assad "reside in power" in Syria, where a quarter of civilians and members of the regime were still killed.
"If Bachar was interested in his country, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
On the other hand, the chief of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has disappointed that the efforts of Turkish mediation from the beginning of the year to the Syrian regime have been fought by a mistake.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their people and can't satisfy them," he said, speaking to Syria, a neighbouring country on which Turkey adopts a more durable line.
The United States is pleased to have a "strengthening of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries such as Turkey, adopt a stronger tone" in response to the repression in Syria, Mark Toner, a spokesman from the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime died in the region of Dera, south of Syria, announced the Syrian Human Rights Observer (OSDH).
Two other civilians lost "times of shooting and pilnage to the heavy metallic loads in Jobar" in Homs' city, according to the NGO.
At a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem, however, felt that the country would "direct towards the end of the crisis".
He also has a strong response to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damas from his work, which is “a dangerous step”.
Syria "does not flinch," he added, ensuring that "the conspiracy against Syria will fail."
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a “Civil Protection Mechanism” and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Minister of Foreign Affairs Alain Juppé also said that he welcomed the sending of UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime that he claims to be in the "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held in Rabat tomorrow to mark the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on 2 November and to provide for the withdrawal of armed forces from the cities in response to and release of arrested protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov considered the Arab League's decision "inaccurate" yesterday, while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, while supporting any sanctions against Damas.
Italy
Mounting demand for time in the Italian markets and sacrifices
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, called for some time on the markets to form his team and implement a programme, which would contain "sacrifices", to recover the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was discussing with political parties yesterday before meeting today's unions and patronage.
It should set up a relatively limited cabinet composed of external technologies in Parliament.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the meetings, after meeting the appointed President of the Council.
The President of the House of Members, Gianfranco Fini, for his part, hoped that Mario Monti would ask for a vote on Friday in order to ensure that the new Government had sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr Monti of a restricted list of undoubtedly twelve ministers to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on the nervousness of bourgeois and mandatory markets yesterday, asking for time.
In "democracy, there are specific times" to prepare a government and its programme, he stressed, saying "certainly the markets will be patient and understand".
Its appointment by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but the concern was echoed, in particular, after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The first appointed minister should be a team, especially of technocrats, even if he stressed that he would like to include "politicals".
The new government has to endure until 2013, the date of the next legislation, which it estimated.
According to the President of the House of Members, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain the confidence of Parliament this Friday.
Mr Monti once committed himself to working in the emergency and in order that Italy "regresses protagonist" in Europe.
A speech by European Commissioner Olli Rehn pointed out that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy has not changed".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary balance objective in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for new rigid measures.
The Italian "parent of patrons" Emma Marcagglia, who will see it Tuesday, also stressed the need to relaunch the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot respect the parameters of deficit".
Mr. Monti, considered competent and independent as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "time change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" representing "the challenge of the serious" and an "other Italy", according to editorialists.
The great stranger will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy has to take over April 2012 for 200 billion euros of State obligations.
A Russian scientist helped the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a usable detonator with a nuclear weapon, claimed a special American NGO on nuclear risk Monday.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (IAEA) and other documents from this United Nations agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA participated last week in its "serious concerns" about a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, which was widely used in AIAA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades from 60 years in a Soviet nuclear power plant in Cheliabinsk (Ural), and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to establish a company producing "nano-diamantes" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact Iran's Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
It would then have cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its last report, the IAEA referred to "strong indications that Iran's development" of a nuclear detonation system "was assisted by the work of a foreign expert, who was not only well aware of this technique, but who, as a Member State informed the Agency, worked during its career on this technology within the military nuclear programme of its country of origin".
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes have increased by 50%.
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by nearly 50 per cent from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, other racial and religious violence has decreased slightly or slightly, according to the FBI statistics performed on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence against Muslims was from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, 49 per cent increase, 13 per cent increase in Catholic violence, 4 per cent decrease in Jewish crimes, and 14 per cent overall increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes increase again," stressed Human Rights First, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," added the organization in a communication.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," adds one of the leaders of the organization, Paul Legendre.
"The American Government can and must do more to deal with these abuses," he added, believing that this could result in an improvement in police reports on hate crimes.
The "crime of hatred" in American federal law is an inheritance of the era of civil rights struggle.
This legislation had been adopted after the death of Martin Luther King in order to punish racial, skin color, religion, origin and sexual property.
Twitter modifys its platform and looks more like Facebook
The micro-blogging Twitter site has introduced changes on Monday in its platform, to allow its users to observe the activities of those who follow it, which makes its service a little more similar to that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" will allow you to follow more closely, directly, the activities of other "Twittos", the internet that follow the messages ("tweets") and those that follow you.
This allows you to know whether they follow messages, if they join new accounts, if they have favorable messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being distributed across the network Monday, the Twitter portal, Carolyn Penner, indicated to the AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive operation, with some esoteric terms (RT to redefine a message from someone else, #Flowfriday to recommend follow another user) making the initiative happy, thus opens to a wider audience with a more comparable management than that of large public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users were discussing "tweets" cut off on the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, invasing, and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"Activity functionality will help me better track some elements of my Twitter stream," @dannykronstrom sent.
Austria
Incorporating a budgetary "gold rule" in the Constitution
The Government of the Great Social-Democratic/Christian-Democratic Coalition of Power in Austria decided tomorrow to include in the Constitution a budgetary "gold rule" in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid any degradation by the authorities of the Austrian sovereign note (Triple A).
It is the social-democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision to the Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6 per cent, largely above the 60 per cent ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but below the debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was not reduced only from one Cran from AAA to AA+, we should pay three billion euros of interest every year," argued Deputy Chancellor and Christian Minister for Foreign Affairs Michael Spindeleger.
Austria therefore submits a request for a summit in Brussels of the euro area member countries of the last 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had then claimed the inclusion by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a law of the same value.
The device adopted by the Austrian Government is close to the German model, Germany being the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
As of 2017, the structural public deficit will be reduced every year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (PIB) and, by 2017, the federal government's structural public deficit will not exceed 0.35% of GDP per year, while regional states and municipalities will have to report budgets to the balance.
The objective is to cover public debt under the 60 per cent criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty in 2020/21.

Noda threatens a new intervention on the change market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again on the market if the Yen continued to mount.
"We will intervene as we have done the last time if we find an excessive volatility" in the change rate of the yen, explained Mr. Noda to the Senate.
Mardi, the Yen was not far from the historical levels that forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold heavily against dollars in order to reduce the value of the Nippanese loan that had been to set up a new record of life since 1945 in front of the green ticket.
But the yen has been regularly reimbursed since, doubled by the purchases of investors who consider it a "refuge value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and of the crisis of identity in Europe.
The dollar has been reimbursed on Tuesday under 77 June and the euro has fallen under the 105-year symbolic bar, near the levels that have triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar cost about 120 yen and more than 160 yen euro.
This flame of the Nippane Debit night at the archipelago's exports because it recovers the cost of Made products in Japan and reduces the value of foreign revenues from Japanese firms when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild" since the seism and tsunami of 11 March that destroyed the Tohoku region (north-east), said Mr. Noda, who was afraid that this Yen's invasion would not kill the fragile again.
The third world economic power has renewed with growth in the third quarter - 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in one year, thanks to a rebound of exports and consumption of households that are affected by the disaster.
However, the Prime Minister ruled that the yen's Thursday did not reflect "the basic economics of Japan".
The Finance Minister, Jun Azumi, for his part, called the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to reduce yen.
However, the Deputy Director of the Institute, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", letting it be understood that no additional monetary assumptions were to be expected for Wednesday.
At its last meeting, at the end of October, the Emissions Institute increased its spending of 5 billion yen (47 billion euros) from Tresor's assets, bringing it to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) to the ceiling of the amounts it spends on the purchases of different financial securities in order to launch the liquidity market.
Euro area:
the floating rates, the Sources start
The risk of contamination of the debt crisis is always the European index.
Despite the designation of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and the better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the fragile countries continue to rise.
Always concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European Councils are building a little more in negative territory on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The tax in Frankfurt dropped 0.4% and 0.1% in London.
" With new tensions over the performance of the euro area loans, the world-wide action markets continue to be part of their recent gains " .
"Enervous investors are just too aware of the risk of contamination," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional court at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Forum closed at 0.7 per cent, suffering from renewed fears of market participants about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
" Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe and trades will continue in a corridor of sharp variations as long as investors will not have evidence that the situation is stable," believes Mitsushige Akino, managing funds at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This series of concerns about the future of the euro area criminalises the single currency, which continues to decline Tuesday.
The euro has evolved to its lowest level for a month and a half.
At 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1,3570, in excess of 0.4%.
According to the Courts, after meeting at Monday's Congress, the Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, adopted a motion which, in particular, provides for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well below 6%
Italy and Spain's improvisation rates remain at very worrying levels.
This morning, the performance of the Italian obligations at 10 years of age is 6.85%, the same Spanish title as the same age of 6.2%.
These tensions over the interest rates of the countries of the South, but also in France, continue to feed the fear of stakeholders.
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, called for time on the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened by asphyxiation by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos stated that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be the " main task " of his Government.
Spain is in the market-oriented line, while the country's legislative elections take place on Sunday.
The gap between the 10-year-old obligations of Germany and Spain has reached a new higher historical level.
In the waiting for euro area growth figures
Statistics: France recorded an economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, or slightly higher than 0.3 per cent in the household consumption.
However, the Insee revised the second quarter's figure, with a return of 0.1% of gross domestic product (PIB) instead of a stagnation.
And it's really the fourth one who's worried most about the economists.
Germany, on the other hand, recorded an increase of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just taken a look at the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must be imported on the dogmas
If it is a subject that cannot be dealt with from short-term or short-term considerations, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is good to have an electoral meeting be the opportunity to reflect on such issues and the place where the nuclear power is held.
The debate will be useful only if it explores the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the options proposed.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic evolution will result in a double demand for electricity from here by 2050, less than privatizing a huge part of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, there will be a need to rehabilitate fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
Fukushima's accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear weapons.
This is not the case with Belgium, which underlines the need to be able to find a replacement source, nor with Switzerland, who just wants to build up the latter generation centres.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote only their projects with determination.
The United States, they decided after Fukushima, to add a unit to their park by renovating the construction of a breached centre after the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, focusing on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality contradicts the speech.
Berlin's choice will be to invest in electricity, an energy dependence increased by the increased use of imported gas, in particular in Russia, a bond of CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and carbon centres.
In a few months, all of these side effects are already felt.
Denmark's case is to meditate.
Europe's oil champion, which takes 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest users of carbon and gas because of the intervention of the wind; thus, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours achieve a factor of more than 40% of the French households.
While in a globalised economy, the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the maintenance of the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies are benefiting from the most expensive electricity in Europe.
Thus, any significant reduction on the part of the nuclear power would result in a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would make the beautiful statements on the re-industrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of Frances refuse to pay, since they do not manifest a principle of this energy, the surveys show it.
We recall that our country's energy policy has enabled us to build an industrial line of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 jobs.
Strong exporter, it introduces a galaxy of specialized SMEs on international markets and makes them very creative of non-delocated jobs.
If France had decided to leave the nuclear industry, it would have sacrificed a great number of these SMEs by reducing the 6 billion euros of French annual exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electricity would an EPR be designed to operate for sixty years while its manufacturer's deceleration would be programmed?
To solve energy equations, it must be admitted that there is no source of production of miracle electricity, no more than there is no Devil.
The development by Areva of low CO2 emissions solutions, nuclear and renewables, demonstrates the additionality of energy sources.
For the nuclear, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a Security Authority that carries out uninterrupted control and transparent control over existing centres such as the Flamanville castle.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are accustomed to the same security obscenity.
In a half century, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
One single, Three Mile Island, has intervened in normal operating conditions; it remains without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and the improbable human faults caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident results from two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that have caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn the teachings of this incident, as it did for the two previous generations.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between the safety authorities, operators and French and German constructioners, the EPR presents a concept that makes it possible to resist such phenomena.
While it is considered by all the electricians who wish to build a centre, the end of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift offered to Areva and EDF competitors by leaving them free to compare leadership with the unconquerable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to search for the best energy bottle for our country, but it would be irresponsible to leave the "emotion, dogmas and divisive maneuvers to dominate a debate which is also decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised in various English - in the form of police, judicial and administrative services submitted to the digital policy, compatibility of this policy with France's self-proclaimed "human rights countries".
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students who have made the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Release of May 23) declaring that France "does not need foreign talent, car and restaurant servers".
But it is only rarely analysed under the economic angle.
It is that there is a rather broad consensus on this matter between the left and the right.
On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac, who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployment workers should not be a problem in a country with about 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot welcome all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by Polish bombers was shared to the left as to the right.
For both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden for the French economy and society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that it will be difficult to provide for immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande sings to bananas, indicating that cod development will help to solve our "migratory problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electoral; but it is very cost-effective.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent book highlighting the most recent knowledge on immigration (Excellent People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restrict anonymous immigration to growth and night employment.
Fears of the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they are likely to be replaced by national workers, especially those with limited qualifications, with pressure to lower their salaries.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, which are mainly in employment-related sectors.
Low-qualified immigrants work in sectors that do not affect national employees, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where training is not a job offer.
A positive effect on salaries
In the same way that a surgeon will have a bad job in a country that knows a lack of anesthetics, these supplements between national and migrant immigrants have a positive effect on the salaries and employment of immigrants.
Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% of the migration flows would result in an increase of 0.6% and 0.9% of the real long-term salary.
This is without prejudice to the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a strong proportion of natural immigrants among the US Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo have been founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors of social systems, with an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that a 30-year-old immigrant in Germany will make a net contribution of EUR 150000 to public budgets on average throughout its lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his mandate, to look for the missing growth points "with his teeth".
The teeth in question, using to discourage immigrants, had the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, remaining to think of European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember that, for its invention in Athens over two thousand years ago, during the twentieth century, the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Goullag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonies in Greece.
Some have been able to believe that it would be sufficient, so that democracy is finally triumphing over its enemies, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct manner.
We know, since Napoleon's "the Little One" it was an easy thought.
The universal suffering, in order to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not enough and can even become a "pressure instrument" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires more: public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of power, education, Light, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we live in is an economic crisis, but it is a political and democratic crisis.
The palinoid of the true Greek referendum will have a dual revelation in this regard: the need for a strong return from politics, as well as the disturbing feeling of its incompatibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalentity must be considered to be exceeded.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle are now moving, and that, for many of them, Republican soldiers are no longer in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from requiring a succession of national referendums, organized in the light of the needs and in a distributed order.
A white-seing in the absolute European monarchy or a joined footing in the empty nationalist reply: what choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want to be involved but a common, legal, serene and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we should no longer stop counting - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that falls to the dictatorships of markets and rating agencies, which is suffering from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
This is the whole of Europe that is humble on the international scene.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but this is the whole of Europe that slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to redefine the European project's piloting to the people's sovereignty.
As a whole, Europeans will be able to reduce their debt, free the markets and prepare the future by investing.
The outcome of the crisis will support decisions at European level that will not be taken without a total democratic legitimacy, unless we are sure to lead to disaster.
After a long fight against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, the whole world today complains of the European economic government.
I'll call you back.
But thinking without a stronger political and democratic integration, and living as such by citizens, would be a new phenomenon and a new epidemic.
We must take a new step towards European construction.
In order to make the Republic of France, it was necessary to "make" the Republicans.
The Revolution in the interest could not be sufficient.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more integrated Europe on the economic level.
This will only be possible by building a more democratic Europe on the political level, a real European popular sovereignty.
To make Europe, we do Europeans.
The cards in "without contact" are distributed
The world round map hall opens Tuesday in Villapinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 should actually end with an increase of 11% of world sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, SIM card phone...) to over 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart.
The most powerful segment is the technology without contact that allows the public transport to be paid or to regulate its purchases by simply approaching a reader's card.
This year, 460 million cards were to be sold across the world, against 320 million a year earlier!
Their share should continue to grow in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent close to 10% of the overall market in the lead card (6,925 million cards).
Long after the journey from Asia-Pacifique region, Europe receives land for payment without contact.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this functionality and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 cards without Visa have been deployed.
But the big surfaces put the double boots.
Carrefour thus issued this year 2.5 million cards Pass MasterCard without contact.
In order to survive the higher speed, banks now need to equip their customers.
"Two large French institutions have undertaken to disseminate regularly to their clients of banking cards equipped for contact without contact," announced Gérard Nébouy, Director General Visa Europe France.
Banks test the payment by mobile
But this is not just a first step towards the means of payment for the future: mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology needed to perform transactions.
"They took the delay."
"But they should finally know a real harvest next year."
"Our tables on sales of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 in the world," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a December-June test in Cain.
The iPhones of some 200 clients and collaborators will be equipped with an evaluation that allows payment without contact.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society also said yesterday to prepare the market for a offer that allows its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front expands
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaida to the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
In the long term, the links between the Al-Qaida terrorist group to the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian section Boko Haram are confirmed.
Monday, Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even said that Alger has now "achieved the truth".
"The way both organizations operate and the reports of information services show that there is good cooperation," he explained without any further clarification.
Paris seems to do a similar analysis.
The investigation on the rape of two French people in Niger in January would have taken place in the last few days.
Killed in a restaurant in Niamey by neighbors of Akmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory should be killed the next day as many of their rapists during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the aftermath of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several telephone lines belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist axis
Analysis of past appeals towards several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers are of particular interest to the investigators: one month to a Nigerian who lived long in Maiduguri, one city in northern Nigeria, the Berceau of Boko Haram and the other to a man who is close to Aqmi and the sect.
"It is an advance, but there is no doubt a need to wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"It has been known for years that the sect has benefited from external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming increasingly active," said Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months these "supports" have been increasingly evident in the evolution and discourses of Boko Haram or in its operational modes, which now involve the use of more complex and explosive devices than those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, then pressed on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long considered the group to be a small-scale light community of interest.
A Speedy Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist leader Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in Haoussa "western education is a sin" - the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is known for its rapid success.
It is political and demands strict respect for the Charia as its soldiers engage in the fight against the corrupt central government.
These last are the churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram's militias became particularly active, increasing attacks on the commissions.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, uneasiness.
The army invests the city, 800 dead.
Mohammed Joseph, a living prisoner, was killed in prison.
So in the section, it's going to radicalize and remove its leaves from the north.
In the last Christmas, she repeats a warning that makes 80 deaths in Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, it is still in Abuja that Boko Haram takes them to the secure QG of the police during a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters will be its first international objective.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria is now concerned about all security experts.
While Aqmi invested Mali and Niger, the Somalis of Al-Cebab in Kenya, Boko Haram appeared to be a new threat to the heart of the continent.
Last week, during an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé took custody of Boko Haram, and he said he was ready to share all the information.
The World According to Republican candidates to the Presidency
On China, on Iran, on Israel's help, Mit Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are self-evident and ignorant.
A poor American can manage a complex world with simple ideas, do you want simple?
To listen to Republican presidential candidates, voters could believe it.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry, and others have multiplied torturing statements and reports on foreign policy, traditionally a strong republican point.
On China, on Iran, on Israel's help, the slogans - often non-stated - went away.
Mitt Romney, the best place in the race for the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to train Chinese in front of the WTO and cause them "to manipulate their currency", a theme in an American exhilarated by the migration of entire pans of its industry to Asia.
As bad as that may have meant the outbreak of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador in China of Obama and only candidate for a sophisticated foreign policy vision, failed to stand out in the face of an attitude that "flates" the emotions.
He called for a flexible but constructive dialogue with Pekin (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who stands in the depth of the polls, remains unheard of.
In Image of Reagan
Romney also promised military attacks on Iran if sanctions failed to stop his nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran, he'll be fine."
"If Obama's real, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance in Israel, accusing Obama of failing to fulfil its obligations in view of this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second candidate for the best place, shows him a confusing knowledge of the files.
Recently, he called against the Chinese military threat because Pékin " trying to develop a nuclear capacity" - apparently ignoring the fact that China has the military atom since 1964!
The German governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants attacks against Iran, said he was ready to engage the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
It is far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
The current president's opponents complain that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he had won the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine on anti-terrorism.
They insist on the failure of their naïve dialogue with Iran, on the too early departure of Iraq's "boys" on its terrorist attacks in Libya, thus taking a low label.
But the attack is not so easy.
The population considers the national security balance of Obama, which eliminated Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, she has been angry with military interventions that lead to expulsion.
And, arguing that it is necessary to rebuild America economically in order to resurrect its leadership, Obama is more just.
The North Stream, new port of entry of Russian gas in Europe
The Nordic Gasoduc Stream, directly connecting Western Europe to Russia by crossing the Baltic Sea, has entered into service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million feeders.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with excitement.
More than 500 guests from four Heads of State and Government participated, last Tuesday, on the Baltic side, between orchestra and final buffet, in the opening of the North Stream, this new Gazaduc that directly connects Russia to Germany under the sea.
symbolicly, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart of the Netherlands Mark Rutte turned together from the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas into the western European network.
With this new gasdoc, 27.5 billion additional Russian gas cubic metres will be reached each year in Western Europe by the first tube of 1,224 km from the Saint Petersburg region in the Land of Meckleburg-Pomérania.
A second tube must be completed at the end of 2012, allowing the total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, the equivalent of all French consumption.
And we have already mentioned the possibility of building a third on the same path.
For Gazprom, the completion in time and time of this huge building has air to win.
The project had been strongly challenged by Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream will be able to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding any land passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries lose some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to burden Russia by threatening to close access to the Western European markets.
As far as the debate was concerned, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the North Stream with a " new German-Soviet-Soviet Treaty " in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
This is whether the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, with its support for the Russian project, has gained greater security of its supplies.
But it is at the price of a energy reduction in Europe, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has, in five years of imprisonment, had its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, highly gas consumers, and whose dwellings are falling.
"This Gazoduc is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new art that puts us organically," François Fillon confirmed by opening up this Gazoduc, showing how large gas contracts are both political and economic.
All of this explains the broad smiles displayed by the leaders of Gazprom, who are present in a number of Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this gasduc is also a technical operation.
The underwater tube is made of concrete steel to protect it from the anchor of ships.
It lies on the bottom of the sea, 200 m in the middle.
In order to build it, it was necessary to avoid mines from the Second World War.
" A hundred had to be removed or destroyed, by caution," says Jens Müller, a North Stream company spokesman.
There was also a need to increase the measures to protect grass and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy as 242 Eiffel Towers, which does not interrupt any of its length: no valve, no maintenance station.
A control platform was planned throughout Sweden, but the project officials rejected it while the Swedish people were unwilling to see a Russian State company permanently established along their borders.
"In case of a war, we stop gas passage in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of escape, the gas contained in the gasduc can then disappear in the air.
However, this case is unlikely to be judged by the builders who have planned to find out a flight every 100,000 years.
The monitoring of the state of the Gaza Strip is provided by a submarine, trained by a ship, for external observation, as well as by a device that travels within the Gaza Strip.
From the form of a cigarette, it is introduced into the inside of the tube, width of a diameter meter, and is pushed by the gas.
On arrival, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 second meters, it provides specific information on possible metal deformations.
The gasduc has been designed to operate for fifty years without having to undergo the least repair.
Gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
It's 200 bars from the start, and 100 from the arrival.
Five companies have united their forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which keeps 51% of the parties.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French GDF Suez group (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for building and operating the gas pipeline.
It has its seat in Zuug, Switzerland, where tax is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then praised this company for twenty refurbishable years the total capacity of gas transport.
"Gazprom pays for total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Müller.
Funding for the construction of the gasduc has been ensured to 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of work should be EUR 7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
However, minority shareholders are sure to return to their costs, as only Gazprom takes the risk.
The gas doc emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sablonic litoral plant of pines.
Valves, heights of 4.5 meters, form the gas exit door.
Captors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the gas that occurs before being transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since the last Tuesday, this terminal receives a million meters of Russian gas cubes every hour.
In full capacity, it will be 3 million hours per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand card.
Created 15 years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wanted to redefine the taste of writing.
It has a perfume of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a bow.
The Moleskine Carnet is easily recognized, with its black rectangular cover, its elasticity, its leaves of a fallen white color, as old as time.
However, the Moleskine Carnet as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time of launching a card of design but differentiated notes.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant for the company, is responsible for launching the new product.
The carnet is inspired by an old production technique, the skin mollusc (tap) that describes a vernis cotton used to cover banquets, for example.
This type of carnet was very popular for writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has delivered to the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of pre-gardist artists until the 20th century " , says Maria Sebregondi, who has been responsible for the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 per cent to make up 12.7 million schoolrooms.
It is far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3,000 carnets were designed.
Moleskine exceeds the Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a buyer's robotic portrait, because the note card is also seducing both the businessman and the student and professionals.
In the image of Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open mind and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which accounts for 12 employees at its beginning, is now almost 100 today and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her wallets in the libraries, from the Fnac to the small shops in the city center and has its identity.
" We have followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the source of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature is accompanied by the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition " Down " where architects or artists exhibit their own carnet.
In August, she also launched a cover-up in oleopard, during the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural era, Moleskine has to diversify its products: bags, agendas, styles, computers... The brand is displayed on a range of media.
A success that made wishes: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the Investment Fund SG Capital Europe, today syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers so high?
About 19 per cent of persons with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of disabled people is open today.
Despite a voluntary public policy in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is still two times higher than the average: 19 per cent, against 9 per cent for the whole population.
Disappointment?
"No, Mr. Eric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of persons with disabilities. "
" The progress that has been made for fifteen years is considerable."
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."
"However, it remains enormously still to be done."
It must be said that for disabled drivers, the obstacles remain many before accessing employment.
They are rather older: 37% have over 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the bab and 2.3 million students of higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very high: 53% for disabled people, compared to 38% on average.
Bref, so much of the criteria that make the return to employment a single challenge, which " constitutes the core of the problem " , according to Christian Grapin, Director General Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
This is for the target brakes.
It remains the non-edit, the thoughts that evolve, of course, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Employment Association for the City indicated that the managers interviewed had " a low level of knowledge of the disabled " with a " super-representation of people in wheelchairs, mental or intellectual disabilities " .
As a result, more than 20 private companies are still far from reaching the employment objective of 6% of workers with disabilities, as laid down in a Act of... 1987.
The latest known figures, which date from 2008, are 2.6 per cent.
" We are now around 3%," said Pierre Blanc, Director General of the Agefiph, the organization responsible for collecting the contributions of companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence: the number of " taxed " institutions, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
" The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on companies, explains Pierre Blanc. "
" But this improvement also translates into a real sense of conscience, particularly in large groups. "
According to the Employment Department, only 59 per cent of the 20-49 employees employed disabled workers, compared with 82 per cent of 100-199 employees.
Hazard: "What's good?"
Before facing the Blues Tuesday evening (20h45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure of looking for this friendly match.
It will not be until we write that there was the confusion between them, but the image is symbolic.
Assis is on the side of the auditorium of the city of France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have a beautiful and peaceful life.
Five months after his attack against Turkey, the Belgian elector has only a few exceptions to his subject.
"I am very happy about Eden, its progress and the fact that it is Belgian."
"I want to go ahead," says the Lillois.
As for the contrast between his performances in club and selection, "it's one thing, he's justified."
"Lille, I've been there all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I must take my marks."
Manned against Romania Friday evening for this match against France, Hazard came to Saint-Denis to finally "briller".
However, not to mention the notion of "satisfying".
The Bleus has been encouraging them since the age of 7 and the successful campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been supportive," he said.
It is strongly involved in further strengthening the "particular" character of this meeting.
In the face of it, "he's in Mathieu (Debuchy), Johan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami), " he's got it.
"It's all crossed in time."
"You can play against them, that's nothing but happiness!"
With bonhomie, Leekens has for his part called "fertility."
"Fire" to argue "a match of gala."
"Fert" also to note - as a "visin" - that France "came a very high-level team" a little more than a year after Knysna's traumatism.
"Laurent Blanc did a toner job," he was excited.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, it would be good for the technician to share the plane with the Blue Direction... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians become big," he pointed out.
"We're building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You're going to count on it during the next match." That against France is included.
Portugal is very confident
Portugal of Paulo Bento begins with many optimistics his barrague back to Bosnia (22:00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
On the way, the two teams had lacked realism.
" At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento has already seen it in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that the Selecçao, which has been on the Manats since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a game to play, and an enemy, Bosnia, to fight.
In view of the game going (0-0), Friday in the fire of Zenica, it seemed clear that the games were not done.
Portugal has dominated the party for more than an hour, of course, but it has been unable to mark this very valuable goal, which would have relieved it.
"It's a good result, however, which carries a certain risk because we haven't marked the goal outside."
But among them, in their bright Stadium of Light in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, before a public that should be also busy, even though the party clearly announces "very close", said a very optimistic Bento but lucid.
"We are waiting for a very close match, but we are all convinced that we can take it up," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have 50% chance of being in the Euro 2012," even though Carlos Queiroz's successor was involved.
Bosnia's zero Friday report obliges the Portuguese to mark and win.
A zero can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to mark.
"It's a good result, however, which poses a certain risk because we haven't marked out purpose," Bento regrets.
" We are going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to introduce a maximum pressure on the Bosnians so as not to "give them time to reflect."
A good idea, provided you're realistic, this time.
