Members of the Galglis Assembly are worried that "they identify as Muppets"
Several members of the assembly expressed their condensation before the proposal to amend their title by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Galaxian Parliament).
This polemic has emerged around the plan to change the name of the Assembly by the Galician Parliament.
The members of the assembly of all the different political parties have shown their concern that this measure could become a cause of confusion.
A member of the Labour Party's assembly said that in his party he was concerned about the fact that MWP "refused with Twp or Pwp".
For non-gallar readers: In galleys, twp means stupid and, pwp, excretion.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party assembly commented that the group of his party "does not see it with good eyes" and has proposed various alternatives.
For its part, a Galician conservative said that his group was showing "open" before the name change, but he also commented that there is a very small difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it should be said that the letter "w" in galleys is expressed in a similar way to the letter "u" in Yorkshire.
According to the Committee of the Assembly responsible for the drafting of the legal removal to introduce changes in names: "The final decision on any qualified person to name the members of the Assembly will come to an end in its own members."
The Law 2017 of the Galaxies Government gives the Assembly of Galaxies all the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with a broad support for the proposal to change the name of the Assembly by the Galiles Parliament.
As for the title of the members of the assembly, even though the committee was delineated by "Gallian Members" or "WPM", the option of "MWP" was that it received a wider support in public consultation.
It seems that the members of the House are suggesting different alternatives, but the attempt to achieve a consensus may assume a whole misunderstanding for the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal deletion on the changes in the matter of weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the Assembly, such as now standards on the desalination of its members and the design of the Committee's system.
The members of the Assembly will hold the final vote on their nomination during the legislative debate.
Macedonians will vote in favour of the change in their country's name
Citizens will choose Sunday if they want to change their country's name for "Northern Republic of Macedonia".
The popular consultation was decided in an attempt to resolve a dispute that lasted decades with Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has insisted for a very long time that the name of its north-easter is a way to claim its territory and has repeatedly opposed the efforts of this country to form part of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, contrary to the pelebiscite on the change in name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, those who are in favour, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev now, believe that the change in name is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's campaigns stop sounding: the difficulties of Harlem's churches
"History, the great people I talked to said there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, don't stay here, either."
According to Adams, the disappearance of the bars can be understood.
"People have another way to socialize today," he says.
"The bars have already stopped being that kind of living room for the neighbor where people went periodically."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of assets does not last as long as their leaders "and that later or later they return to where they came from."
The churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartments and condoms with the kind of people who will not be of any help to the temples that remain in the bar.
"The vast majority of people who buy condoms in these buildings will be of a white race," he says, "and so what they will do will speed up the closure of all churches, since most people who move to these condoms have become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white man who had been in his early 30 â€™ s left the white congregation.
A black congregation nearby acquired the property of the building.
St. Martin's passed into the hands of a black congregation led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boy to retail merchants on the 125th street, one of Harlem's main trading streets, who refused to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when the gladiators of the River Johnson made plans to rebuild it, it was then when they carried the cart.
Reverent David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's church, described all pride as "the campaigns of the poor."
The expert who made the scroll sound the julio described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also observed that it was also the world's first carroll that was touched by a black race music, Dionysio A. Lind, who had to move to the largest chariot of the Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has been done in St. Martin's for the past few months, on the contrary, has been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them brought by the lay leaders of the church and others for the episcopal diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, formed by lay leaders, wrote to the diocese last month of July all expressing its concern that diocese "had intended to transfer the costs" to the council, although the latter was not involved in the contraction of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some happy ones have complained of lack of transparency by diocese.
A tiger will make a 13-year-old boy while looking for prey in California
A terrorist attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was on a march to search for prey in California on the first day of the flood season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before the 7th of the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel explained to the KSWB-TV of San Diego, he spent half an hour busing with friends on Sunday morning when he heard the screams of a boy asking for help. Then they stopped with a group to the place where the boy was to help him get him out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was about the joy of having caught a fish, but then he realized he was crying 'I've moved!
I'm tired!'
He had all the broken keyboard," observed Hammel when he got to the boy.
"Because everyone came out of the water, I cried, 'There's a tube in the water!' adds Hammel.
The boy was transported by air to the Lady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he got into a bad state.
You don't know what kind of tavern is responsible for the attack.
In a press round, reliefist Larry Giles commented that he had been working for weeks that had detected a tavern in the area, but that it was decided that this species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper tower area.
The authorities closed access to the beaches from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami's to Ecinitas for research and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of tuberculosis in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
The plans of Sansbury's, to the United Kingdom's beauty products market
Sansbury's decided to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beautiful products in the style of large stores occupied with specialized employees.
These great pastries are only part of a considerable investment in the United Kingdom's beauty products market, a market that moves about 2800 million GBPs and continues to grow while fashion and land products sectors remain behind, and they will be tested at 11 shops throughout the country to expand to more stores the year that they see if the test is successful.
The investment in beauty products is a product of the obsessiveness of supermarkets to use the space in their performances that were previously intended for televisions, microwaves and land products.
Sainsbury's claims that she will double her offer of beauty to offer up to 3,000 different products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space with areas of brands similar to those that can be found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket company is also in the process of relieving its Boutique makeup product range so that most of the products are now suitable for occasion, a aspect more often demanded by younger consumers.
The minority chain The Fragrance Shop, in addition, will open concessions to two stores in Sainsbury's. The first one did this last week in Croydon, south of London, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and changing no one's habit of buying food in smaller quantities every day on small supermarkets has made big supermarkets have to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, stores will increasingly be gathered to large stores in an attempt at the chain of supermarkets to fight Aldi and Lidl account supermarkets with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's gone to introduce points of sale of Argos to many of its supermarkets, plus a number of Habitat stores since he acquired both chains two years ago, which, he said, has served to slow down the sale of rents and increase the profitability of acquisitions.
The previous attempt of the supermarket chain to slow down its departments of beauty and pharmaceutical products resulted in a failure.
Sansbury did a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended early on not to agree on how to divide the benefits of the pharmaceutical chain into supermarkets.
This new strategy goes up after sale three years ago by Sainsbury's business of 281 pharmaceuticals in Celesio, owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for 125 million GBP.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will play an important role in the global plan, as it will expand the range of product brands for skin, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four bottles.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of the Sansbury's business, commented: "We have transformed the aspect of our beauty products landscapes so as to improve the face environment for our customers.
We've invested in format workers specifically that will be of great help in providing advice.
Our brand range is designed to adapt to any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and practical location make us now one of the preferred destinations for beauty products and we reject the traditional way of making understandings."
Peter Jones "furious" after Holly Willoughby's behind an 11 million GBP deal.
Dragons' De Peter Jones' star went "furious" after Holly Willoughby's television presenter was made behind an 11 million GBP deal with Jones's life-style brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to dedicate himself to the joint trade of land products and Truly accessories.
The business of these two media characters had arrived compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning used Instagram to announce his departure.
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragons' Star De Peter Jones enfrusted by withdrawing in the last minute of the joint business brand brand of life to focus on their new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also report great benefits.
According to various sources, Jones was "furious" when the red star of television admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the center of his empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the new bids of the presenter, with a value of $1.5 million, meant that it would no longer have time to devote to the combined brand of land products and accessories Truly.
The deal had arrived to compare with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and hoped to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million GBP.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, used Instagram to announce his trip to Truly, Jones took a private plane to one of his vacations outside the United Kingdom.
According to one source: "Truly was far from Holly's main priority.
It was meant to be his future in the long run and where we would see him for the next twenty or thirty years.
His decision to go back left without words all the parties involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
Right now there's a lot of stores in your Marlow center just to be sold."
According to experts, the march of this morning's representative, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost millions to the company due to the important investment made in products, from kitchens and mirrors to clothes and clothes for the land, and from the possibility of delays for its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had maintained a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined the president's position last March.
In addition, Jones has a 40 percent share in Baldwin's TV producer.
Willoughby will be the next M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as a representative of the I'm Celebrity of the ITV program.
A source next to Jones commented last night, "We're not going to make any comments about his business."
Serious accusations... "and then we fell in love with each other."
He made a joke of the possible criticisms he received from the media to make a comment that some would consider "a little bit of a president" and have a very positive opinion from the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump give up so much?
Trump said, making noise of the voice tone of a news reporter:
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore on June was declared a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations towards denuclearization are underway.
More than three months after the summit held in Singapore in June, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho commented on Thursday to the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "response" response by the US to the first disarmament initiatives undertaken by its country.
However, he noted that the US continues to apply sanctions with a view to maintaining pressure.
Trump's point of view, in turn, was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We used to declare war in North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now we keep this big relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to improve Kim's relationship have had positive results: the end of the missile tests, help free hostages, and return home from the rest of the American soldiers.
And he defended his little focus on Kim's relationships.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this new crowd, we'd have about 200," said Trump, pointing out the crowd that was before him.
An island destroyed and hundreds of deaths due to tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, it was said to non-governmental organizations in other countries that were not necessary.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared necessary in order to catalyze international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not require international assistance, so that the situation is very demanding," said Mrs. Sumbong.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not sure that foreign people can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, rapporteur for the National Disasters Agency, commented that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international agencies were allowed to contribute to the time of providing assistance.
Given the persistent sixties that plague Indonesia, the country continues to suffer from a lack of preparation for the anger of nature.
Although in Aceh refugees have been built in case of tsunamis, they are not frequent at other costs.
The parent lacks alert sirens in Palu in case of tsunamis, although there was a warning in force, it is very likely that he has contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the huge number of Indonesian islands is, in the best case, a challenge.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was caught in Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake is now headed to Palu; however, it will take at least three days to reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo was a central element of his electoral campaign to improve the poor infrastructure of Indonesia, and has invested enormous amounts of money in road and rail life.
However, Joko's government faces the year it comes to the re-election of financial deficits.
The game is also faced with the pressure of the country's permanent sectoral tensions, where members of the majority of Muslims have adopted a more conservative faith.
More than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands of displaced persons are the result of wars that take place on the streets between Christian and Muslim bands with matches, bows, arrows, and other blood - war weapons.
Note: Daniel Sturridge del Liverpool makes the tail of the amphagus with a yellow hole in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the First League in front of Chelsea with his throat marked at 89 o'clock in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Jerdan Shaqiri to about 27 meters from Chelsea's port when his team lost from 1 to 0.
The pilot settled on the left before leaving for an incredible suit directed toward the second suit.
The shot opened the whole area with a big lift while pushing himself towards the top right corner of the portal.
The pilot finally started the descent over an Arrizabalaga Kepa in full jump to try to stop her and end up at the bottom of the network.
"I just tried to get to that position to be able to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it to the best possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that KantÃ© came, I made a joke, and I didn't think about it much, I just dedicated myself to gambling."
Chelsea won 1 to 0 at the rest after marking a gol in 25 minutes by means of his Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the game, the advance of the Blue team returned a pass to Matthew Kovacic before starting almost half the field and printing to Liverpool's camp.
Kovacic made a quick combination from the middle of the camp.
After all, he did a profound past, which left Hazard in the area with the controlled pilot.
Hazard crossed the defense to finish the second suit with a jig with the left bed where he couldn't reach the port of Liverpool Alison Becker.
Liverpool will meet in Naples at the season of groups of the League of Champions the next Sunday at 15:00 at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, for her part, will play videoton at UEFA Europe League Sunday at 15:00 in London.
The death toll for Indonesia's tsunami rose to 832
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, according to data from the country's disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped between the ruins of the scattered buildings due to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that took place on Fridays and caused waves of up to 6 metres, according to the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a press round.
The city of Palu, of more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the ruins of destroyed buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man as a suspect of murder after finding a woman shot.
The murder investigation began after the woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The woman, 44 years old, was found at 7:55 with several sentences in Grayson Mews, John Street; then a 32-year-old man was arrested as a murder suspect.
The police have asked the residents of the area who have seen or heard something about the crime they are facing before the authorities.
According to Inspector Brian O'Hagan, "although the investigation is still in a preliminary phase, I would like to make a call to everyone who is close to John Street in Birkenhead and who would have seen or heard anything suspicious, which is put in a hurry to contact us.
I would also like to make a call to any person, especially the taxis who have been able to catch anything by means of the car's camera, which are in contact, as they could have vital information for the investigation."
A police officer confirmed that the woman's body they found was from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived at the scene of the crime to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
As the investigation continues, the police have commented that they are reporting on the facts to the closest relatives to the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back to his room, but the police have informed him that no one has permission to enter or leave the building.
When he learned what had happened, he felt empty inside.
He's warning the residents that they'll spend hours until they can come in again.
He could feel like a police officer told a man that the whole area is treated like the crime scene.
A woman appeared in the crying scene.
Don't stop saying, "It's terrible!"
At 2:00 a.m., two police vehicles were found in the agreed area with another parked car outside.
A number of Romanian agents in the area under the control of the floor block.
It is requested that anyone who can have information to send a message directly to @MerPolCC, call to 101 or contact Crimestopers anonymously via 0800 555 111 and espressive 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell of the British Parliament became the last monument affected by the discussion about "rewrite history"
His disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the destruction of the purest style of the Taliban of many cultural and religious objects in England by their fanatic Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "budgery" and a "one attempt to re-write history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate about the withdrawal of states, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster's palace would become one of the main objectives.
The iconoclastia of the English civil wars was not ordered nor was it due to the end of Cromwell.
Perhaps he would end up sacrificing the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his predecessor that he did during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many still believe is worthy of being remembered.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than not now, as a parliamentary defender in the face of external pressure, in his case obviously of monarchy.
Whether or not this event constitutes a fully-accredited Roman historical debate.
What is true is that the middle of the 17th century conflict was consistent with the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents a side of this division.
Their asylums as Lord Protector are also worthy of being celebrated and commemorated."
A pig killed by a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local sources.
The man, identified solely by his nickname "Yuan", was found dead with a cut artery and all blood covered near a piece of porcelain in the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou, according to reports on Sunday the South China Morning Post.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject pigs into a court in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
As you know, he had traveled with his cousin for a few days from Yunnan's neighboring province to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave him a piece of porcupine.
As he said, there was a big porcupine in the court with blood on his mouth.
The federal investigation confirmed that the 250 kg grain was injured by the farmer's death, according to the report.
"My body had ruined legs and filled with blood," said the cosy, as "Wu", according to the news of the evening of Guiyang.
The scenes recorded by the security camera show how Yuan enters the market at 4:40 a.m. on Sunday morning to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither owned nor owned by Yuan.
One of the market officials commented on the news of the evening that the pig remained locked and isolated so as to avoid any further attacks, while the police gathered evidence at the scene of the crime.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market officials are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although very rare, there have been previous cases of porpoise that attack humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at the Massachusetts farm, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a porcupine of about 300 kg took a galley farmer against his tractor until his wife was able to scare the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told the CBC news that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a "dangerous".
"They like to play.
They're like children, they're very curious... they don't have the idea of harming.
They only need to be respected," he commented.
The rest of Rosa's hurricane will bring torrential rains across the southwestern United States.
According to prognostics, the Rosa hurricane is weakening as it moves on the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will carry torrential rains across the north of Mexico and the south-western United States during the next few days.
Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, itself from a category 1 hurricane at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, U.S. summer, and was located 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it is starting to form a depression in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of the Netherlands of California on Mondays as a tropical storm, she will start leaving a strong tropical humidity in the north-west of the United States.
The Rosa will leave the moon to 250 mm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Next, tropical humidity will interact with the depression that is approaching to generate generalised torrential floods across the south-east during the next few days.
At various points, the 25 to 100 mm rain will cause dangerous rains, waste flows and the possibility of land degradation in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause some precipitation indexes close to 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected from 50 to 100 mm of rain in parts of the south-west, especially in large parts of Arizona.
There's a chance that it's going to become rhyme, since the situation is getting very fast because of the widespread character of tropical raindrops.
It is strongly advised to enter the desert just before the threat of tropical rain.
The torrential rains may cause the gorges to become uncontrollable rivers. In addition, storms can bring winds and dust clouds at specific points.
The depression that is coming will bring torrential rains at certain points on the south coast of California.
It is possible to record a total of precipitations for over 50 mm, which could cause lower residue flows and relative paths.
It would be the first precipitations of the rainy season in the region.
Tropical rain droplets will begin to arrive in Arizona between Sunday night and Sunday morning, before the rain becomes more generalized between Sunday and Tuesday night.
The torrential rains will spread to the region of the Cantonians on Tuesday and will continue for all the afternoons.
There will be several important temperature oscillations in October for all the US as the Arctic cooled, even though tropicals will fall into strong heat.
This phenomenon may lead to dramatic changes in temperature in a little distance.
The Central American region Sunday is a clear example of rapid temperature differences.
There are approximately 20 degrees of temperature differences between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, the constant heat of the summer will try to expand again.
It is expected that the month of October will begin with hot mostly in the central and eastern regions of the United States, with temperatures around 27 degrees south of the Plana area to the north-east.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would represent about 10 degrees above the average.
According to the long-term forecast, there are many possibilities to record temperatures over the middle of the US East during the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers saw Brett Kavanaugh's statement.
More than 20 million spectators saw the passionate witness of the candidate to a member of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which was supposed to have taken place in the '80s, Christine Blasey Ford. The witness was sent back to six different television chains.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with the issuers interrupting the usual Friday programming due to a series of events in the last minute: an agreement designed by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake because the FBI is conducting an investigation of the charges for a week.
Ford explained to the Senate Committee for judicial matters that he was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh had touched her drunk and tried to get her clothes off at an institute party.
Kavanaugh, in an outstanding witness, said that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that more than 20.4 million spectators have seen this witness on Friday.
The company counted the average CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC viewers.
The auditing figures were not immediately available for other lines that retransmitted the witness, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen only has problems in calculating the people he sees from his office.
In perspective, it is a similar hearing to an American football playoff party or the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have clearly supported the name Kavanaugh, was the chain with more audiences, with an average of 5.69 million spectators in the day-to-day witness, according to Nielsen.
The ABC was second with 3.26 million spectators.
The CBS received 3.1 million, the NCB 2.94 million, the MSNBC 2.89 million and the CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen's data.
The interest remained high after the witness.
Blake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
After the office of the moderate republican press issued a communiquÃ© saying that they voted in favour of Kavanaugh, Blake was arrested by CNN and CBS on Friday morning while he was encrypted by demonstrators when he tried to bring up an elevator to see a judicial committee.
Flake had a couple of minutes with the naked look while he was online for television at the CNN.
"Here you have me, before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They told him "You have power, while there are so many women who don't have it!"
Blake said his office had sent a communiquÃ© and, before closing the elevator doors, he commented that he would have more to say in the Committee's view.
Within hours, all cable and diffusion chains were being forwarded directly to the time when the judicial committee had to vote whether or not to proceed with the appointment of Kavanaugh to the floor of the Senate to vote.
Blake said, on the other hand, that he would only understand that the FBI would investigate allegations against the appointment of face to the week he saw, the condition required by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations he had with his friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
The option chosen by Flake had influence, since it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation for allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" in relation to Brexit
First Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized their plans to leave the European Union to "go on politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and to lower national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is attending the conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In a further interview with May on the agenda, former Foreign Minister of May Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, stating that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU are repeatedly withdrawn from taxes is "in vain".
Killed by Wade Sims: Police stop Dyteon Simpson's suspect for the death of LSU's team player
The police arrested a suspect for murdering Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who fought with the LSU team.
Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, has been arrested and sent to a charge of murder in a second grade, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities made a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to the police, Sims lost his eyes during the battle.
The police recovered the glasses at the scene of the crime and claimed they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS WAFB's branch report.
After asking Simpson, he admitted that Wade had died of a stroke, according to the police.
His loan was $350,000, according to the lawyer's report.
The East Baton Rouge District Forensic Office published a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a weapon wound to the head towards the neck.
The department welcomes the operational refugee group of the state police in Louisiana, the state's criminal police lab, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area for the assistance provided in the investigation that has taken place in this detention.

"Those like this are the ones who hurt you all the time," said Wade.
A scaffolding volcano in Mexico City
The scenic center of the Popocatepetl volcano has arrived in the south-west of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans on Sunday that they would stay away from the volcano after they were detected in the crater and that 183 gas emissions were recorded and stayed in a 24-hour period.
The center was monitoring a number of strokes and traumas that had recently occurred.

Geophysics have observed an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km south of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The Volca, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police deal with Catalan separatists shortly before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after protesters in favor of independence faced with the anti-avalot police and thousands of people joined in opposite demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the vote that took place in Catalunya on their sex.
A group of independent individuals detained by the anti-avalot police began throwing their eggs and paint into dust, which caused the appearance of dark clouds of dust on the streets normally engulfed by tourists.
Later that same day, Batuses were produced with the police, who used their bags to contain violent protesters.
For several hours, independent groups sang "Don't forget, don't forgive" face-to-face with Union protesters calling "Long life in Spain".
Forty people had to be affected by injuries suffered during the protests, according to local sources.
The tensions have not decreased in this region of independent mentality a year after a referendum was held on 1 October that was considered illegal by Madrid but also due to the end of Catalan separatists.
The voters chose independence for a large majority, although the participation index was low, while the opposition to the secession voted mostly.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote by entering the electoral colleges throughout the region, resulting in violent confrontations.
Independent groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support to the national police.
The demonstration took place at the same time, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independent demonstration together with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of opening up the possibility of Catalunya independence.
"Last year we lived one of the best moments.
I saw how my parents cried with joy because they were able to vote, but now we're locked up," he commented.
Despite achieving a vital victory, although in the autonomous elections last December, the independent Catalan parties have suffered to maintain this year's imputation, while many of their main leaders are in a self-imposed exile or detained waiting to be judged for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, records the police support demonstration on his phone, claims that the conflict has led to both sides' politics.
"The tension only increases," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the new Catholic leaders imprisoned before the trial since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Presenting as a candidate to the European elections is the best way of declaring backlogs in democratic values and the repression we have seen on the part of the Spanish government," he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after investing a house with a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car repatriated against a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Growing on Sunday at 19:30 a.m.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says they caused damage to the doors and the same building.
It is also possible that, at some point, someone has shot a ballast against the car.
A Menga game gives the victory to Livingston for 1 to 0 in front of Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston assumed victory
Livingston, who had graduated this year from the class, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in which it is just the second defeat of Steven Gerarrd in 18 parties as a trainer at the Ibrox bar.
Dolly Menga's game marked the difference, since, with this victory, Gary Holt's team can take the second position, which they share with the Hebrews.
Gerard's men, on the other hand, continue without winning home at the Premiership this season, and the next Sunday they will face the leader, the Hearts, who will separate them from eight points.
But before that, the Rangers get this pleasure of Vienna's Speed to Europe League.
Livingston, while at the same time, extends up to six parties his rat intrusive to the league, with a Holt as a coach who still doesn't know what the defeat has been since she replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston does not take advantage of its opportunities in front of the visitor's direct game
Holt's team should have gone in front of the marker long before the goal, since its direct game caused all kinds of problems in Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened his way between the defense, but he missed his chance when he was found in front of the gate.
The locals already had a good idea of letting Rangers join their area, because they knew that visitors could be in trouble in isolated games.
And that's how this decisive wave arrived.
The archipelago was missing from Rangers' interests, and Livingston was opening up to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson were combined so Menga could touch it first and finish it from the central part of the area.
Until then, Rangers had dominated the property, but he found himself with an impeccable defence and a porter Liam Kelly who had a very little work along the party,
The stage was repeated on the second side, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to stop dying.
For his part, the Ranger porter Allan McGregor stopped with his feet an occasion by Scott Pittman and Lithgov ran away from another Livingston combination game.
The Rangers had dedicated himself to prison once and for another pilots in Livingston's area, only to be rejected. They were also charged with two sentences, one for a alleged entrance from Halkett to Glenn Middleton's replacement, and the other for hands.
Livingston "fenominal": analysis
Lasadair Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great performance for Livingston.
A man thinks they were excellent, and they continue to overcome all expectations in this ascending trajectory.
Their game style and staff have almost not changed from their return to the top category, although most merit has to be attributed to Holt for the way he has galvanized the team since his arrival.
There was a good bunch of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, at the head of a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be standing in Menga during the party.
The Rangers lacked inspiration, however.
Although the brilliant moments displayed with Gerard as a trainer, they certainly did not know how to maintain the level.
They didn't know how to create occasions (only once they clearly exceeded local defense), and this Rangers, which is located in the middle of the table, should be taken as a warning.
Aggressive reception for Erdogan in Colonia
All were clear smiles and heavens on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met to breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of the Polish visit of President Erdogan to Germany, which was aimed at repairing relations between the two NATO allies.
These have fallen because of human rights issues such as now, freedom of press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan, however, moved to Colombia to open up a new giant mix.
And this city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside Turkey.
The police set up security grounds to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from being gathered in front of the mosque, although a large number of followers applied to the surroundings to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan, many of them deaf, were also made to feel as they condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to grant him a welcome welcome to the country.
Both demonstrations reflect the division of views around the visitor, considered a hero for some German Turks and titled dictator for others.
Deptford's traffic accident: a dead cycler meeting a car
A cyclist has died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the top of the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street streets, an area with a transistor force from Deptford, south of the city, about 10:15 p.m.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, and even though paramedic services cared for the cyclist, he died in the act.
The accident takes place months after another cycler died in a refugee camp at Childers Street, 1.6 km from the scene of the Saturday accident.
The metropolitan police said their agents are working to identify the man and inform the nearest family members of the facts.
The road has been cut down and deviations have been applied for bus routes. Also, drivers who avoid the area have been advised.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six wounded agents in an alternative
Six prison officers have been injured in an alternative in this high-security prison center, according to the centre's office.
The facts were produced in Long Larsin prison, Worcestershire, at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, local time, and still missing.
Specialized "turned" agents moved to the place of the facts to put an end to the counter, where eight prisoners were seen involved. The plane could be held by a band.
The agents had to be vigilant for injuries to the face instead of the facts.
According to a prison service provider: "We have deployed special-trained personnel to solve an incident in Long Martin's prison, which is still missing.
Six employees have had to be vigilant with injuries.
We're not going to tolerate violence in our prisons, and we're sure that those responsible for this shift will have to keep the police accountable and may have to spend more time in prison."
There are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals, at the Long Lartin prison center.
In June, he learned that the prison chief had to be in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, anti-avalot agents took action in prison to solve a serious change in which staff at the center were attacked with billboards.
The Rosa hurricane threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with important rivers (areas with almost any benefit)
It's not uncommon for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but that's exactly what it's likely to happen at the beginning of the week that you see when the rest of the Rosa hurricane passes through the desert of the south-west, with the resulting risk of rivals.
The national weather service has already been alert for winters and afternoons in West Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will arrive directly to Phoenix on Tuesday and approach the night of the Monday with tears.
Phoenix's national meteorological service commented in a Piulada that only "ten tropical cycles have maintained the state of tropical storm or depression in a radius of 322 km from Phoenix since 1950.
The Hurricane Katrina (1967) remained 64 km from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the national centre of hurricanes provide 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated points where they will be recorded up to 150 mm in the Arizona Mogollon.
Other parts of the south-west desert, including the Central Rocaloses and the Grand Conca, could be recorded from 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of landing points up to 100 mm.
For areas beyond the risk of floods, the rain of Rosa could become a very good news, as the region suffers from a severe drought.
Although the riodos are a serious cause of concern, some of the precipitations could be very beneficial, as the region of the south-west is currently suffering from a drought.
According to the U.S. drought control service, more than 40% of Arizona's state suffers as at least extreme, the second highest category, reports weather.com.
But first, the Rosa hurricane will touch the land on the peninsula of Baja California, Mexico.
Rosa continued to have a force of Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, which makes me lose my strength.
So it's expected to hit the ground in Mexico with a tropical storm at night or in the evening.
Precipitation in different parts of Mexico could be strong, with a significant risk of rivals.
According to weather.com, "there are 75 to 150 mm of total rain from the Netherlands to the north-west of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching up to 250 mm".
After that, Rosa will head north across Mexico with tropical storm force, before arriving at the border with Arizona on the first day of the morning with tropical depression force, to finally create Arizona's state and reach southern Utah well entered the night of the afternoon.
"The main risk we expect of Rosa or what is left of it is strong precipitations in Lower California, northwestern Sonora and southwestern USA," according to the national centre of hurricanes.
It is estimated that the floods produce dangerous streams and streams of waste in the deserts, along with land sludges in mountain areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Middle East Terrace area, at 4:00 a.m. on Sunday, at 4:00 a.m., local time.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he's "stable."
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds, and a 20-year-old man, were arrested the next day in Radstock's area, according to Avon and Somerset's police.
The agents have made a call because any person who might have any kind of recording of the facts with the mobile phone is put in touch.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has suffered the mixture and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote of rebuff to the bitter and ininhibitive tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump declared in an electoral act in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had "difficulty and anger" of the Democratic Party during its nomination process.
Kavanaugh said before the Congress Sunday, ignoring Christine Blasey Ford's claim that she had been sexually abused decades ago, when they were both teenagers.
Ford also declared the view in relation to his deputy.
The president said Sunday that that day, "the American people saw the genius, the human quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
"The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the brightest thoughts in the legal world of our time, a lawyer with an amazing service trajectory in the city," said many of West Virginia's sympathyers.
The president referred directly to the appointment of Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of the index of the participation of Republican voters in the election of half of the mandate.
"We have five weeks of one of the most important elections of our lives.
I didn't run, but actually I did," he said.
"That's why I go everywhere fighting for our great candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are dedicated to "resisting and obscenity".
It is expected that the first procedural vote that will be held at the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will take place as soon as Friday, according to the CNN, an assistant to the leaders of the Republican party has been informed.
Hundreds of deaths from earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, where the number of victims continues to grow
As at least 384 people have died, and many have been arrested by giant waves shouting at the beaches because of a terrible earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday because of a festival held on the beach in the city of Palu when waves of up to six meters had impacted the coast on the capital, throwing many people to death and destroying everything they had found on their way.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude.
"When the tsunami threat hit yesterday, people were still running their activities on the beach and they didn't run after it. That's why they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, responsible for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a communiquÃ© in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, broke cars, towers, houses, destroyed everything that was found on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved by sea at open speeds of 800 km/h before impacting on the coast.
There are people who went up from a tree running from the tsunami and could survive, he said.
Some 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centers in Palu.
Air photos published by the disaster mitigation agency where the amount of damaged stores and buildings, broken and disintegrated bridges and a mix of water is appreciated.
The police continued to raid this coastal city on Sunday.
The series of earthquakes was heard in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the earthquakes of Friday was 200 times the power of the nuclear bomb launched on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographical characteristics of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bath, could have increased exponentially the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial centres and hotels were scattered.
The bodies of some of the victims, he said, were found trapped between the ruins of the scattered buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 displaced.
According to Nugroho, the deaths and damages could increase to the coast about 300 km north of Palu, a area called Dondria, near the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely paralysed and therefore no kind of information was reached" by Dongrea, says Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there," commented the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, which unfortunately could end much worse," he said.
The agency was strongly criticized on Saturday for not informing the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although the agents said that the waves arrived during the time the notice was issued.
In recording an affidavit shared in social networks, it can be felt like a man in the upper floor of a building gives desperate warnings to people on the street about the tsunami that is approaching.
In the case of minutes, a water wall is hidden outside the sea, carrying buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not authenticate the registration immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a generalized amount of electricity supply that has interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Although the army has begun to send humanitarian aid to cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, evacuaters continue to urgently need food, as well as other basic needs.
The city airport has been opened only for relief tasks and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was planning to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death figure for Indonesia's tsunami is over 800.
The situation is very difficult.
Despite the fact that World Vision workers in Dodrya were able to arrive without and saved in the city of Palu, where employees competed in refugee shelters at the site of their office, Doseba says during the march they had to present scenes of total destruction.
"They said they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's a disaster.
Although the relief groups did the dissolute gesture to begin the relief tasks, some people complained that they were preventing humanitarian workers from traveling to Palu.
According to the Indonesian regulations, the collection of funds, supplies and staff from abroad can only begin to flow if the place where a disaster has occurred is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Ariani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says "well, it's a national disaster," we can start asking for international assistance, but this level has not yet been declared."
While crying the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that took place on Fridays, friends and family of missing persons maintained the hope of the miracle and their loved ones elucidating the devastating report of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was rescued in a locker.
On Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the run for two days with her motherâ€™s body beside her.
Gendon Subandon, the coach of the Indonesian national team of parapets, had trained two of the missing parapets for Asian Games, which ended in the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandia, among the people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, there were his students.
"I have my own emotional burden," he pointed out.
Mr. Gendon explained that, in the hours following the fact that he was passing the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel between the Parapentist community, he had unexpectedly sent messages from WhatsApp to Palu's competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
However, messages appear with a grey check mark instead of a double blue mark.
"I think this means that messages are not received," he added.
Several thieves carry $26,750 while filling an automatic box at Newport on the Level
On Friday morning, some thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was filling up an automatic cashier at Newport on the Level, according to a press release from the Newport police department.
Agent Dennis McCarthy pointed out to the communiquÃ© that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the automatic casserole into the maintenance complex and was preparing it to distribute more money.
While he was doing his job, another man "was running behind Brink's employee" and stole a lot of money for distribution.
According to the report, the witnesses saw several suspects running from the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about his identity should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes the name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
On Saturday, while announcing the change to Twitter, he wrote: "It was formally known as Kanye West."
Some time ago, 41-year-old West, the motto with the nickname Ye, and he used this alias as the title of his eight album, which was published in June.
The change takes place before its appearance to the Saturday Night Live program, where it is expected to present its new album, entitled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled his participation by "emotional motives", according to the programme author.
Rather than being abbreviation of his current artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I think it's the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you," said West at the beginning of this year, while talking about the title of his album to the Radio presenter Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us.
I've gone from Kanye, which means the only thing, just yes, that's a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confused part, everything.
The album is a quick reflection of what we are."
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has met with various names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year has announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former West co-laborator, has come from his nickname with the no-guineath and in major schools.
Mexico's President, AMLO, promises not to use military force against civilians
The elected president of Mexico, AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador, promised never to use military force against civilians, when little is done to bring the country together on the 50th anniversary of a cruel repression against students.
LÃ³pez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco's place that "the military force would no longer be used to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the death of 300 people at a time when the student movement on the left was surrounding Latin America.
LÃ³pez Obrador, who has committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
He said that the attitude and lack of educational opportunities make young people feel attracted to criminal gangs.
The US should double the funds allocated to the IA
"While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount of money they spend on research in this field," says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and professional specialist in artificial intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments arrive after several members of the US Government have announced measures on IA, although there is a general lack of formal IA strategy in the country.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become world number 1 for innovation in IA in 2030.
"Dualing the budget for the IA research would be a good start, since the rest of the countries are very behind the US and we want to be pioneers of the IA's own progress in the IA field," Lee said.
"Dublining funding could double the opportunities the United States has to raise the next major discovery in IA," Lee told the CNBC in an interview held this week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, is the director general of the company Synoving Ventures, who invested in Face++, one of the most prominent companies in China.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in an IA system that exceeded Othello's American player with the best rating and, later, served as executive to Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee appreciated the positive value of previous technological competitions in the North American Government, such as the Challenge Robotics of the Advanced Defence Research Agency (DARPA), and asked when the next place would be to identify the respective visionaries.
"Many times, North American researchers have to work hard to get public benefits," Lee said.
According to Lee, "it's not China that carries academic leaders; it's companies."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university emmenades to work in the IA field.
Lee commented that the task of the US in the IA area could also be seen motivated by changes in immigration policy.
"I think that permanent residence cards should be offered to doctors in IA," he added.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council presented its latest generation's Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
"The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China grants funds to people of academic institutions in the same way that the Foundation for Natural Sciences and other public agencies of the United States spend money on North American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower than China," Lee pointed out.
At the beginning of the year, the U.S. Department of Defence created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, designed to participate in the industrial sector and academic institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of a select Artificial Intelligence Committee.
In addition, this month, DARPA announced an investment of 2,000 million USD in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the Natural Sciences Foundation, it is currently planning over 100 million U.S.D.s per year for IA research.
Meanwhile, months ago no measure was applied in relation to North American legislation that was intended to create a National Security Commission in Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold a referendum to decide whether they change the country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the change of name in the Northern Republic of Macedonia, a measure that would resolve a dispute that has existed for decades with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's applications for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its north-east route constitutes a claim from its territory and has led it into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the new name proposed, but nationalists argue that the change would preserve the ethnic identity of the majority of the people of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has shown that he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign will question whether it will be at least 50% of the necessary participation so that the referendum will be valid.
The question set out in the footnote is, "Are you in favour of accession to NATO and the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The parties to the change in name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to ensure Macedonia's accession, one of the countries that were created after Yugoslavia's deintegration, to agencies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, because Macedonia's young people can live freely in the European Union because it means that we all will have a safer life," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have shown that it will end the vote to make it a decision.
To change the name, a majority of two-thirds of Parliament is required.
The State Electoral Commission reported that no irregularities occurred at 13 p.m.
However, participation was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent registered in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered persons voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski to the capital, Skopje.
First Macedonian Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in the referendum held in Macedonia on the change in the country's name, which would open the way for accession to the European Union and NATO to Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov in front of the Skopje Parliament was preparing a small scenario and placing chairs in front of the tents installed by people who would vote for the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join the head, not the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"I am a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can travel to other countries, such as China and Russia, and form part of Euro-Asian integration."
First Minister Zaev claims that NATO's incorporation will be accompanied by more investment than you need in Macedonia, which has a rate of stress above 20%.
"I think the great majority will vote in favour, because more than 80% of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev pointed out before depositing his paper.
Zaev showed that a "yes" would assume the "confirmation of our future".
In a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute, between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum required participation.
According to the results of another survey, conducted by the Macedonian chain Telma TV, 57% of the respondents are planning to vote Sunday.
Of these, 70% said he would vote "yes".
In order for the referendum to be valid, participation must be 50% more than one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first difficult time for the prooccupational government's policy since it took place the month of May last year.
Watch the video: Sergio Aghurro, from Manchester City, takes a bullet after the entire defence of Brighton
Sergio Agurero and Raheem Sterling canceled the Brighton defense in Manchester City's victory for 2 to 0 in the party at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England last Saturday.
Yesterday he marked a goal at 65 minutes in a game that seemed ridiculously simple.
The forward silver received a passage in the middle of the camp at the beginning of the sequence.
He went at a speed between three Brighton's defenses, drawing what he was going through in the game field.
Later, Aguro saw himself surrounded by four green Samaritans.
He had a defense before he passed over a few more on board the Brighton area.
Then he made a pass on his left side that he found Sterling.
The English front turned the pilot back to the first touch, inside the area, in Aguroro, which with the right leg hit the gate of Brighton, Matthew Ryan, with a hole that broke into the inside of the network on the right side.
"Aghuro has trouble with his foot," said Pep Guardiola, a city trainer, to journalists.
"We decided to play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky I've marked a bullet at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the fight for the First League.
His throat arrived at 29 minutes.
In that game, Aguro received the pilot in deep space in Brighton's field and
He made a precious passage through space for the left side of Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the pilot before passing her to Sterling's long skin.
The Sky Blues forward ended the pilot inside the network before he left for the background line.
The city is facing Tuesday at Hoffenheim in the phase of the League Championships groups at 18:55 p.m. in the Rhine-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, no options, wants to remove Rockies
With the Nationals removed from the fight for play-off, there were no valid reasons to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, looks forward to going out on the launch Monday against the Colorado Rockies, if the Rockies, who keep a party of advantage over the English Dodgers in the West National League, have the opportunity to play the playoff.
The Rockies were able to secure a deal with the victory for 5-2 against the Nationals Friday night, but they are still trying to get their first division title.
"Although we don't play anything, at least we can go out to launch by knowing the environment here, in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably discuss every point at the highest level, as no one has done this year.
Why would I want to lose this game?"
The Nationals still have to announce an open launch for Sunday, but they appear to be determined to let Scherzer go if this situation happens.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, held a daily heating session and would launch Sunday, on his usual day of rest.
Washington's right-hand launcher has a record of 18-7, with an ERA of 2,53 and 300 removals per strike in 220 2/3 entries at this time.
Trump has a meeting in West Virginia
The President referred directly to the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking of the importance of the participation of Republicans in the election of half-mand.
"All we've done is in play in November.
They're missing five weeks for one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the great, great. I don't present, but I actually do. That's why I'm everywhere fighting for the fantastic candidates."
Trump continued: "You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, it's happening right now.
They are determined to regain power for all the necessary means, their magic, their evil intent.
They don't care who they are doing bad, about who they're going to get power and control, that's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them."
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is to "resist and obstetricate".
"And this can be seen in the last four days," he protested, and titled the Democrats of "unsuitable, mixed, gross and false."
Trump mentioned Diane Feinstein, the highest-ranking democratic senator of the Senate's Judicial Committee, who had caused a strong writing of the public.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did you filter the document?
Hey, hey, what?
No, uh, no, wait a minute... this was a very bad body language expression, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Laborist Party has stopped being a different party.
It's intolerant with those who say what they think.
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, it didn't surprise me.
In the end, I'm the last of a series of British parliamentarians who told us we weren't welcome, to say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because he demonstrated with determination against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the motion of censorship, I was criticized for discrepancies with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe.
In the notice of the Meeting of the Nottingham Labour Party, "We want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During most of my eight years as a local parliamentarian, the meetings of the General Committee held on Friday night were exactly like this.
Unfortunately, this is not the sound of many meetings, and it has long been forgotten the promise of "more generous and kind" policies, if it ever existed.
It is always more obvious that divergent opinions do not tolerate the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable for the party's direction.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as you had previously thought that he shared a political vision like they hoped I would make a 180th turn and take positions that would never have been adopted, either on national security or on the EU's single market.
When I speak in public, say what I say, social networks are filled with aggressive messages in which a call is made because my candidate is not renewed, they are accused of central policies and I am told that I shouldn't be at the Labour Party.
And that doesn't just happen to me.
In fact, I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues, because the messages I receive are often political.
I'm impressed by the professionality and determination of the colleagues who have to face a torrent of sessist and racist attacks every day, and they don't go down.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this was politics is to see how it was normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn stated last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that game so different, and with every move of "untrust" or every change in the selection standards, the game became more extreme.
In the last two years, I've received much advice and I've been recommending that I keep my head down, that it wasn't so expressive and "all would be fine".
But I didn't get involved in politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, at my time of studying, inspired by that strange government of Thatcher, which left my whole class literally confused, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it, whether local counsel or government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could doubt my political positions and the points of disagreement with the current direction.
To those who promoted the movement on Friday, I would say that at a time when the country is heading towards Brexit that will damage lands, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to lose time and energy in my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in fact, the message I want to deliver has not directed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are workers or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of non-renewal of my candidate or any political interest will prevent me from acting, according to my father, in the interests of all of you.

Day 38 - 17 Melrose: Day Ones Intended Leaders
Two last hour's attempts have corrupted the final result, but there's no doubt that the Ayrs earned victory in this lively part of the day of Tennt's Premiership.
The Ayrs, who are the only team of ten, take the first position on the classification table.
In the end, the local team was grateful to its defence superior and to the fact that he knew better to take advantage of the opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reasons to be satisfied.
"The parties we've played so far have tested us and we're still busy, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said: "Thank you for the Ayres, they have taken the best of opportunities than us."
Grant Anderson's test at 14 minutes, converted by Frazier Climo, put before the Ayrs, but a rough card for the Scottish international Rory Hughes, awarded for the Warriors party, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the digital superiority and Jason Baggot recorded an unconverted test.
Climo expanded the advantage of the Ayrs with a penalty and, just in the middle, recorded and converted a test to put the 17-5 mark for the Ayrs to rest.
But the Melrose started well the second part and Patrick Anderson's test, converted by Baggot, reduced the difference to five points.
Later, the party broke down for a long time because of the serious injury that Ruaridh Knott suffered, which was withdrawn in writing, and in the arrest the Ayrs resumed the distance with a stafford McDowell test converted by Climo.
Next, the deputy captain Blair Macpherson was amnesty with a rough card, and again, the Melrose enjoyed the superiority of a more man with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of a moment of great pressure.
However, the local team responded and when Sruan Hutchinson saw a rough card to make a ticket to Climo without a pilot, from the sanctions alignment, MacPherson recorded a password behind the windmill of the Ayrs.
Climo noticed, as he had done almost since the arrest, after Kyle Rowe picked up a bug from David Armstrong and passed the pilot on the third line to Gregor Henry to record the five tests of the local team.
The Still Game series star seems to be about to start a new career in the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, seems ready to go to the hotel sector, after it has been discovered that he has been appointed director of a restaurant company with a license.
The actor, 56 years old, interprets Jack Jarvis's character in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-protagonizes with Greg Hemphil, his comic partner for a long time.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the Director of AffÃ´morn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the respect, although a source of The Scottish Sun newspaper pointed out that Kiernan intended to enter the "flower sector of the restoration" of Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, without litoral, expects the court to reopen the path to the Pacific
Marines patrol for their ship covered with ice in La Paz.
Public buildings ignore a blue flag of sea.
The ship's bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are packed with the theme: "The sea is our right.
Getting it back is a debt."
Around the landless territory of Bolivia, the record of a lost coast before Xile in a severe resource conflict in the 19th century continues to be very alive, as it is the tendency to re-locate for the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the deepest in decades, while Bolivia expects the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and seriousness, and, not to say, waits with a positive position the result," pointed Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the TIJ resolution in large screens around the country, with the hope that the Hague Tribunal has declared in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Xile is obliged to negotiate the granting of a sovereign exit to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the Indian charismatic president of Bolivia, who is facing a Polish re-election battle the year he sees, has many hopes that will be held in the resolution on Monday.
"We're very close to getting back to the Pacific Ocean," he promised last August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Court will decide in favour of Bolivia and that if it did, things would not change much.
The United Nations body based on the Netherlands has not been able to assist small territories and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible conversations.
The IJ resolution, which only six months after the submission of the final submissions, indicated that the case was "not complicated", said Paz ZÃ¡rate, a Chinese expert at international law.
And far from being popular, Bolivia's cause may have experienced a relapse in the last four years.
"The current Bolivian Administration has taken over the issue of sea access," ZÃ¡rate pointed out.
"The beautiful retortory of Morales has threatened any gesture of goodwill on the part of Xile," he suggested.
Bolivia and Xile will continue to talk for a while, but it will be very difficult to keep conversations after this episode.
The two countries did not exchange ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo RodrÃ­guez Veltze, representative of Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the idea that the Tribunal's decision was extremely rapid.
The next Monday, Bolivia will have "a unique opportunity to start a new era of relations with Xile" and an opportunity to "end up to 139 years of discrepancy, with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who continues to be one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, were using the maritime issue as a political cross.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The resolution is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can be trusted in the US.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will not eliminate nuclear weapons if it can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke last Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
The Minister urged the United States to keep the promises made at a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His statements arrive at a time when U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo is about to resume the nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit held in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a mistake to think that the continued sanctions and the US objection to a declaration that put an end to the Korean War can make North Korea ever worse.
Washington is disappointed to accept the statement if Pyongyang doesn't do important disarmament movements before.
Both Kim and president. North American Donald Trump want to celebrate a second summit.
However, there is a generalised exception to the fact that Pyongyang is seriously taking the issue of giving up an arsenic that the country considers the only means to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion files reveal the last range of large size bars, on the way to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your collection of bars or you want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't have to look for more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented to the passerel a range of disproportionately disproportionate sizes of their SS19 collection, which included the style defined at the Paris Fashion Week.
This is the Instagram has been drawn by very few practical bars, and these designers have brought their amazing creations into the passage.
The top piece of Valentino was an exhilarated, decorated brat with a wide, plom, which covered the head of the models.
Among other oversized accessories, there were happy sandwiches, a brat and, even, a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep the hot head.
Tom Browne also presented a selection of extrafoliary masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, of living colors, had costumes and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than no high costume.
A creation was like a complete team of submarines, with tubes and glasses, while another looked like a giant ice-cream.
And if you follow the great trends of fashion, you're lucky.
Style observers predict that huge bars could be installed on the main streets near you.
The large size bars trap the hills of "the Bomba", a wooden bar with two feet wide, which everyone has brought, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The label of cult behind the barret so little practical that it spread through the social networks brought another great creation to the passerby: a wooden box for the beach, almost as big as the model dressed with the bathroom that carried it.
The pink box, of dark taronja color, decorated with paints and finished with a white leather ring, was the prominent part of the collection The SS19 River of Jacquemus in the Paris fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to the FC: "I hope to see people carrying large bars and stock boxes on the main streets the next summer. Given that the designer has had a great impact, it would be a shame to ignore the demand for large-scale accessories.
John Edward: Linguistic competencies are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain an academic excellence trajectory that has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is strengthened with individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by the Independent Schools Scotch Council (SCIS) are trying to provide a service of the best level to students and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for postgraduate and higher education, for the race they choose, and for their place as citizens of the world.
As a educational sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a very popular and desirable choice material in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language that he understands, you will come to his head.
If you speak it in your own language, you will reach your heart."
This is a very important reminder that we can't rely only on English if we want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of the survey, we can see that languages lead classification tables with higher qualifications in independent schools.
68% of the students who studied foreign languages received note A above.
Data, collected from 74 ESCIS member schools, reflected that 72% of students received higher A qualification in mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students, and 63% of Spanish students also received an A.
This shows that Scotland's independent schools support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages, as a electoral assignment, are kept in the same consideration as STEM assignments (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
One survey carried out in 2014 by the United Kingdom Employment and Competence Commission revealed that for the reasons that the entrepreneurs had given up their vacations, 17% had been assigned to the lack of linguistic skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
As there are ever more potential jobs that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the race that a person pursues, if he learns a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competence like that.
The fact that you can communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person in front of competence.
According to a survey carried out in 2013 by YouGov among more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75% could not speak a foreign language enough to keep a conversation, and French, with a 15% speaking, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
For this reason, investing in language learning is important to children today.
Knowing different languages, especially the developed economies, will give children the best opportunity to find an important job.
Scotland has a variety of schools for which it is taught in the languages.
Some schools focus more on the more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered more important for the United Kingdom in the future, rather than 2020, such as the Mandarin or Japanese now.
Whatever your son's interest, you can always choose between a series of languages in independent schools, which count with staff specialist teachers in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills they need to succeed regardless of what the future holds.
In the global commercial environment of today's time, it cannot be denied that languages continue to play a vital role in the future of the country, and that must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered as international communication competences.
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to Scottish young people.
You need to do it.

LeBron will start with the Lakers in San Diego Sunday
The wait has virtually ended for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton announced that James will play the first pre-mier game against the denger Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But they still have to determine the minutes they're gonna play.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48," said Walton at the Lakers' official place.
Mike Trudell, a Lakers journalist, claimed that James would probably play a few minutes.
After the training of principles this week, James was asked about his plans for the calendar of six early Lakers.
"I don't need premature parties at this stage of my career to be ready," he protested.
Trip Mitting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a campaign campaign campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five Trip's programmings for next week, which includes visits to sympathetic places, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote for confirmation for his candidate to cover the vacancy in the Supreme Court is pending, Trump intends to obtain support for the next half-mand elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voting is held in November.
What time is Trump's encounter in West Virginia this night, and how can you see it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19 a.m. on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
The mix of Trump in West Virginia can be seen online in the link specified below, via direct video transmission via YouTube.
It is likely that Trump cancels the hearing initiated this week with the candidate named at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was detained for sexual abuse charges, while the anticipated confirmation vote of the Senate was pending until one week and the FBI was investigating the case.
But the main goal of this round of talks is to help the Republicans present at the delicate November elections to take the momentum.
Therefore, the five summits of President Trump's campaign scheduled for next week are aimed at "encouraging volunteers and sympathy, while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so important for its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can, when we are heading towards a time of campaign that has been reached," said a transporter from Trump who refused to be identified, according to Reuters.
This evening's meeting, programmed at Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could collect sympathy "from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the coverage of Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday will be the second time Trump visited West Virginia, the state where he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate at the West Virginia Senate, who is experiencing adverse results in the investigations.
"It's not a good signal for Morrisey that the president has to come to push him into the polls," commented Simon Haeder, politician of West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team shows its ambition to keep alive the hope of face to individual parties on Sunday
After three different sessions, Saturday mornings were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The basculin pendulum of dynamics is an invented sports concept, in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
So on what side is positive dynamics now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now it's four, so I think we're in a small positive drop," Jordan Spieth said while he left at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has a advantage, four points forward, with twelve more in the game.
Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind blows a little to its advantage and have many reasons to be animated, largely for the state of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and they both count three points four.
Spieth has been gentle from tea to green and he's giving an example.
The gruesome screams of celebration rose in intensity as he continued his turn and stood a crucial hole to get the fourth party, when he and Thomas had been down two after two forts.
He celebrated the pont that made them win the game at Forat 15 with a similar scream, which indicates that he believes the American team is not yet out of competition.
"You have to work at the maximum and worry about your own party," said Spieth.
It's all that's left for these players now.
18 forts to drop pressure.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the incredible feeling of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple bear four and do not make mistakes.
"Moliwood" were the only couple who didn't make a bogey on Saturday evening, and also avoided Sunday mornings and Fridays on evenings, and the last nine o'clock on Friday mornings.
For this result and the way its energy seems to flow to and from public polls, it is reaffirmed that they are players on Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory while the sun is on Le Golf National.
I prefer both times in different forums.
However, talking about European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's football matches, who made her partner with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two pairs of the new first forts put the Spanish and Swedish into a hole where they never had any choice to get out.
Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you get out of the hole.
The furballs and fursoms are very fascinating to see for the interactions between the apparatus, the advice they give and those that they don't give, and the way a strategy can change from time to time.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this forum session has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the United States, have questioned.
Europe comes to the end of Ryder Cup with a favorable 10-6 marker
Europe will face the last day of Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after completing football and Saturday games with a 10-6 win over the United States.
The inspiration of two formats for Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to win two victories against a Tiger Woods in difficulties and to leave his record, up to now, at four points in Le Golf National.
The European team, captain of Thomas Bjorn, who was hoping to preserve the trophie that was lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team with little concordance in the morning's suburbs and put the series in 3-1.
The U.S. presented more resistance to the forums and won two parties, but they were unable to reduce the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed to get eight points to 12 individual parties on Sunday to save the trophie.
Fleetwood is the first European candidate to achieve four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known as Molliwood after a week's sensibilization, are only the second couple who win four points in their first four parties in the history of Ryder Cup.
After enslaved Woods and Patrick Reed to the Fourballs, they called for a brilliant act to beat a Woods deflate and American debatant Bryson Dechambeau for an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had been rocked in two parties on Saturday, showed sporadic geniuses, but he lost 19 of 29 parties in furballs and fursoms, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning's football, remarried with Henrik Stanson in the competitions and fell for 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, classified as the first and third of the world, respectively.
However, Europe had nothing to do with it on a pleasant day and winds in the southeastern part of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three times the tournament champion, and Justin Thomas set a point on Saturday for Americans getting two points.
They won a victory with determination for 2-1 against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter on the Fourballs and later they won Poulter and Rory McIllroy for 4-3 on the Fours, after losing the first two forts.
Only two times in Ryder Cup's history a team had raised a difference of four points to individual parties, although Furyk's team, the champion of the title, just needed to save it.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems like a day-to-day attack is out of your reach.
North Korea stated that it would not be unanimously disarmed if there were no signs of trust
The North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs communicated to the United Nations on Sunday that continued sanctions were intensifying its confidence in the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world's organization that North Korea had taken "good-willing measures" in the previous year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, detonating the nuclear testing centre and committed themselves not to proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not observe any response to the US consensus," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not start disarmament unilaterally in any way."
While Ri took North Korea's complaints about Washington's resistance to a "fashioned" denuclearization approach for which North Korea would be rewarded as it took step-by-step action, its statements seemed significant because it did not reject the unilateral denuclearization of full, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, in which Kim committed to working on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea has tried to formalize the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has reported that before Pyongyang has to eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the call to ease the heavy international sanctions imposed in North Korea.
"The US insists that denuclearization must first be produced and increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its objective in a coherent manner, in addition to countering the "declaration of the end of the war", Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions will make us mad is a smile of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions are intensifying our mistrust."
Ri didn't mention plans to celebrate a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted to the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the part involved in the issue of denuclearization was South Korea instead of the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this stage of closure."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year's, when he said to the General Assembly of the United States that focusing on North Korean missiles was inevitable after President "Mr. Evil" Trump titled Kim of Rocket Man on a Swiss mission.
According to the United Nations, Trump, that last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, commended Kim for her courage to take disarmament measures, but showed that it is still very much to do and sanctions are to be maintained until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Tuesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this and that "it doesn't matter if they marry two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia support that the UN Security Council should award Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said yesterday to the United Nations Security Council: "The application of sanctions by the Security Council must continue energetically and without exception until we confirm total and definitive denuclearization."
The Security Council has consistently imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an effort to reduce the financing of the ballistic and nuclear missiles programmes in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly and then reported that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go very well.
He left Pyongyang the month of July saying that progress had been made, but in a few hours North Korea accused him of making "the own demands of a guest".
At a meeting with Moon held this month, North Korea committed itself to disarming a missile centre and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "consensual measures".
He said Kim had informed him that the "consensual measures" he was looking for were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, in addition to actions to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a lesson on rest habits
Enguayy, a new course at Harvard University has allowed his students to sleep more, in an attempt to fight culture, increasingly, to study all night, stimulated by caffeine.
One academic observed that students at a number of universities or in the world are often disappointed by the basics about how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Sound Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his species in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after having a discussion about the impact of the private sound on learning.
"At the end of the conversation, a girl approached me and said, "Why are they telling me now, all of this, in my last year?"
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sound, which surprised me," reported The Telegraph.
In the course, implemented for the first time this year, students are told the basic concepts of how good sound habits improve academic and sports performance, in addition to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said that the University decided to introduce the course after learning that some students were suffering from a severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course, for a long time, includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there's an image of a sleeper, where students have to click on coffee cups, dishes, babies and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light, about how the sport performance affects the lack of sound, and about the importance of maintaining a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sound privacy can increase the risk of heart attacks, cerebral palsy, depression and cancer.
Next, a map of the camps with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily course.
"We know that students' conduct will not change immediately.
But we think they have the right to know, as a person has the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes," Professor Czeisler pointed out.
The culture of pride to keep awake all night is still there, he said, and he added that modern technology and pressure growing that students suffer makes the private sound a problem more and more large.
To enjoy a sound of good quality for a long time should be a "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, it added, even to avoid weight gain, as the privateness of the sound puts the brain in an induction mode and makes students always win.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after having attended one of his classes last year in Harvard during his first year.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask postgraduate students to carry out a programme of similar studies before joining the competition institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students take into account the fact that they are alarming when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and that they are aware of the harmful effects of the blue light that emits electronics and LED lights, which can change the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause sound problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's gol ends with Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's gol condemns Steven Gerarrd's disarmed team to a 1-0 defeat at the house of Livingston, which assumes another ambush outside.
Ibrox's team sought to collect his first home victory from the triumph of the past February 4 to 1 in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team attacked the second defeat in Gerarrd in 18 parties as a trainer to leave his team to the derivative, at 8 points from the Hearts, the invisible leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga recorded the hole seven minutes before the middle part, and it never seemed that Rangers, lacking inspiration, was about to equal the marker.
While Rangers now falls into the sixth place, Livingston has the third position, behind the Hibernian for a difference of waves.
And Rangers could face more difficulties later, as the Calum Spence line judge needed medical attention for a wound to the head caused by an object that appeared to have been launched from the grade.
Gerard made eight changes in respect of the alignment that the Ayrs threw out at the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same 11 title that started a point against Hearts last week.
Although the Rangers dominated the possession, Livingston was more dangerous when they had the pilot.
In fact, they should've marked the two minutes of the game, when Menga's first intervention left Scott Pittman alone before Allan McGregor, but the migampist jumped away and took advantage of the big occasion.
A missing Keaghan Jacobs launch was met by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow just made a jump off the back.
The Rangers took control, but they seemed to have more hope than they did at the end of their game.
Alfredo Morelos really believed that he should have had a penalty on the 15-minute signal, since he and Steven Lawless met, but Arbitr Steven Thomson ignored Colombia's claims.
The Rangers only led two jerseys at the front gate, but the first porter of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's head and the kid before Ovie Ejaria.
While the first act of the Livi could have been against the race for 34 minutes, no one can deny that they deserve it only for their efforts.
Again, Rangers couldn't break with Jacobs' work.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher passed the pilot to Scott Robinson, who kept calm to choose Menga for a simple final.
Gerrard acted on the break to change Coulibaly by Ryan Kent, and the change had an immediate impact, since the extreme had made a passage to Morelos, although impertinent Kelly ran into the blockade.
However, Livingston continued to catch the attention of visitors playing exactly like them, with Lithgov and Halkett making long passes, one after the other.
Holt's band could've given the direction at the final stages, but McGregor kept standing to reject Jacobs before Lithgow made a move from the corner.
The replacement of the Rangers Glenn Middleton still asked for a final sentence for a dispute with Jacobs, but again Thomson made the big eyes.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Accountant
And now a page of "Sunday Morning" Germanic: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day the physical of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually replaced the device we know as "geiger counter".
Count Geiger, who has been a scientist's pillar since then, has also become a pillar of pop culture, such as the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, sponsored by Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, some apparently failed physical vacuum cleaners:
Man: "What is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger accountant, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these auriculars, you can listen to the effects of the atoms that generate radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans, "I'm sure you're breaking up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd anniversary.
But the invention that brings his name is still alive.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" and remove malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malaise cells as part of treatment
Method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and alter them to the laboratory
You can see a common protein in many cancers and then re-inject them.
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize the malignant cells, saw the ovarian cancer disappearing for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells of a patient, changing them to the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and then reinject them again.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland (USA): "The results we have achieved suggest we have a promising vaccine."
Her2 protein "failures the growth of various types of cancer", including the mother, ovaries, lungs and colorectal, has explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar focus consisting of extracting immune cells from patients and "instructing" these cells like treating cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West broke into a pro-Trup diaphragm with a MAGA gor after her performance in the SNL program.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was written in the study during the Saturday Night Live program following a caotic act in which US President Donald Trump said he would be presented to the 2020 elections.
After his third night song, entitled Ghost Town, in which he wore a dress from Make America Great Again, he began to criticize the Democrats and repeat his support in Trump.
"Always talking to white people says to me: How can you like Trump if he's racist?
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd left the United States a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program began with a parody by Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star was inspired by Brett Kavanaugh's witness to the Senate's Trial Committee for sexual assault charges filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't issued, eating Chris Rock picked up the recording of West's disprovement on social networks.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to redefine the West with the publication.
However, West has complained to the public that it wasn't treated well among bastards because of the pride he had.
"They threatened me with guns.
They told me you didn't come out with that shit.
I'm an asterisk.
And then they say I'm in a lower position," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the lower position?" while he said he would put Superman's layer so they couldn't tell him what to do. "Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comments provoked the public's writings at least twice, and the program team members seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, that there was a reporter who explained to the publication, "The whole study was completely mute."
West took her as a substitute for the last hour of Ariana Grande, the ex-wife of which, the rapper Mac Miller had died for a few days.
West left a good part of the audience with the interpretation of the song I Love it, surrounded by Perrier.
West obtained the reception of the head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who shot: "To one of the most powerful spirits: Thank you for putting it into the multitude."
But the chairman of the debate programme, Karen Hunter, pointed out that West was just "be who it is and that it is absolutely wonderful."
"But I have chosen not to reward anyone (including his music or his dress or his "art") who I think adopts and speaks of a ideology that damages my community.
He's free.
And so do we," he added.
Before the program, the rapper announced to Twitter that his name had changed and that he was "the first known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague, Snoop Dogg, before he was called Snoop Lion and the missing legend of Prince's music changed his name to a symbol and, later, the artist known as Prince.
Impunity murder charge for shooting at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been accused of attempted murder after a man's arrest in East Belfast.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
It is expected that the accused will be compared to the first instance court in Belfast on Monday.
The tax office will review the charges.
The throne star, Kit Harington, claims a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known to represent the role of the army leader Jon Snow in the violent media fantasy series of HBO throne game.
However, 31-year-old actor has denounced the virological stereotype, claiming that these papers allow young people to understand that they often believe they must be strong enough to be respected.
In an interview with the Culture magazine of The Sunday Times, Kit said he thought "something was going wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity at the #MeToo era.
Kit, who has recently married the co-protagonist of the throne game, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, has admitted to be determined to deal with this problem.
"I personally wonder where we've been mistaken for what makes masculinity," he says.
"What have we taught men during their development about the problem we are experiencing now?"
According to Kit, television can be part of the responsibility of increasing toxicity thanks to its virulent characteristics.
He added, "What's inside, and what's acquired?
What does it teach on television and on the streets that makes young people feel they should have this kind of violence?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time: how do we change it?
'Cause there's no doubt something wrong with young boys."
At the interview, he also admitted that he wouldn't do any pre- and post-traumatic game when the end of the series is scheduled for the next stage, saying he's made of battles and horses.
Since November, Kit will promote a restoration of Sam Shepard's True West work, which explains the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that getting to know his friend Rose is the best thing he's got to do with the throne game.
"I knew my wife in the series, so she gave me my future family and my future life," he said.
Rose did the role of Ygritte, the love of the character representing Kit, Jon Snow, in the winning fantasy series of an Emmy.
The couple were married in June 2018 at Leslieâ€™s family farm in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health officials.
Only the second quarter of 2018 declared 40,000 new cases.
The vast majority of new cases are sexual transmissions, in contrast with what happened in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some regions of China due to blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who fight HIV for this cause has been reduced almost zero, according to Chinese health officials' statements at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Over the years, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem for China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was eliminated in China in 1997, but discrimination in the LGBT collection is common.
Taking into account the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who maintain homosexual relations will end marrying a woman.
Many transmissions of diseases are due to lack of adequate precautions for sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has filtered data from the Republic Party senators and deplores "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. representative Maxine Waters denounced the allegations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The democracy of Los Angeles claimed that the demands were critical and websites on the right.
"Minds, lies, and most menypreblems," said Waters in a Twitter statement.
Of course, the information published contained the addresses and telephone numbers of Utah's United States senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
The information appeared online on Sunday and was published by someone unknown to the Capitol during a session of the Senate committee on sexual abuse charges against the candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was filtered after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative locations, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of publications was related to the Waters office and that it revealed information from a member of Waters staff, accused the Capitoli.
"This unfathomable complaint is completely false and a pure lie," continued Waters.
"My staff member, identity, personal data and security that has been compromised because of these false and misleading accusations, was not responsible in any way for this information filtering.
This unfathomable complaint is completely false and pure invention."
Waters' statement quickly generated criticisms online, including the press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleescher.
"This denial is full of indigence," Fleischer wrote.
"This makes you think you don't have the time to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to get angry.
You don't have to show a challenge.
You don't have to question the reasons for the attacker.
He must keep peace and Sir."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, who were accused of being too angry during the Sunday session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was presenting to expel Waters from the media elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"It's important if it's true," he whispered.
In his statement, Waters said his office had warned the authorities and the relevant security forces of these false statements.
"We will ensure that the criminals are revealed, he continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all the actions that have taken place and that they have lost everyone and every member of my staff."
Critic of Johnny English Strings Again: limited spy parody of Rowan Atkinson
It's already tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British focus, and this reposition of Johnny English's paradigm, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and re-appeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
Will this humorous self-sustainment about how menyproblems are going to be a new export opportunity from the country?
In any case, the incompetence of the naked eye and the face of the English Goma Johnny has been able to renew his license for the second time. His name indicates more than anything else that is a chemical creation designed for non-English speaking territories with tradition of going to the film.
Obviously, it is the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims of liquid glambre, has a bit of Clouseau, a point by Mr. Bean and a touch of this guy who brings a single note on the theme of Carros of fire at the inaugural ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Initially, it was based on the international and mysterious Atkinson journey that represented the now forgotten advertising ads of Barclaycard, where he was sowing the chaos around him.
There's one or two good moments on this last J's trip.
I liked Johnny English who was wearing a helicopter dressed in a medium armored armored and the helms of his helmet were pulling him back to the chest.
There's the reason Atkinson has for the physical comedy, but humour seems quite fluid and extremely superfluous, especially because cinematographic brands as "serious" as 007 and Mission Impossible already include the comedy as an ingredient.
Humor seems to be for children more than adults, and for me, the absurd adventures of Johnny English are not as clever or focused as the oral gags of the character Mr. Bean who represents Atkinson.
The topical premium now is that Great Britain is in serious problems.
A computer pirate has been infiltrated into the British supersecret website network and has revealed the identity of all British agents on the ground, which is causing the arrest of the service agent, a sad little paper for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last resource for a prime minister who is a pretentious and sadistic figure, which is already suffering a total collapse of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives her the best of herself with this cut-in character of Teresa-May, but the guide doesn't come up anymore.
His intelligence advisors inform him that, as each active space is put at risk, he will have to recover some of the youth.
And that includes poor Johnny English, now employed as a professor in some luxury institution, but involving extra-official classes on how to become a cover agent, with some good gags, like when English offers a spy academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his next patient, Bugh, who is again represented by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, linked to the commander of a submarine, an exciting paper, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little useless.
So, Batman and Robin, when things get very light in His Majesty's secret service, they get into action once again and find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "fatal woman" Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the first minister falls dangerously under the edge of the technological billions of charismatic charisma which claims he can solve the computer problems of Great Britain: left-wing Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their hatred of ridiculous bourgeoises: chambres, they fire a French fast-food restaurant, they smell the chaos fighting on Volta's luxury iot and English causes great confusion by trying to use a virtual reality box to familiarize themselves with the inside of Volta's house.
All the stops have certainly come out of this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise that they present, everything seems like a childish program.
Things are pretty normal.
Like Johnny English's other films, it's not helpful to think about whether the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a paper that justifies his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it's a plan because the British have a working week of four days and five days in total.
Jeremy Corbyn's Laborist Party will have to consider a radical plan that the British will work for four days and five days.
Of course, the party wants the heads of companies to spend the savings obtained by the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to the workers giving them a more festival day.
Employees would enjoy a three-day head of the week, but they'll get the same as you.
According to sources, the idea would coincide with the economic agenda of the parties and plans to attract the country in favour of workers.
The shift to a four-day work week is supported by trades Union Congress as a method so workers can benefit from economic change.
An experimental source of the Labour Party stated to The Sunday Times: "It is expected that a policy revision will be announced before the end of the year.
It won't be from night to day, but a working week of four days is an ambition that fits in the view of the party to balance the economy in favour of the worker and the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a working week of four days during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspirations in a joint way right now.
According to a spokesman of the Labour Party: "A working week of four days is not a party policy and the party is not considering it."
The shadow minister John McDonnell used the conference of the party last week to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of the "anonymous directors" and "speculators" to public service companies.
The Prime Minister's shadow plans also imply that water business shareholders could not recover the entire investment, as the labor government could apply "deductions" to the crimes I perceived.
It has also confirmed plans to place employees in companies' associations and to create property funds including to release a 10% of the private sector's shares to employees, which are expected to cover annual dividends for up to 500 GBPs.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains "60 Minutes" if Kavanaugh's investigation could make them change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote for the Supreme Court for at least one week, and has raised the question of whether the agency's findings could influence some senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that will be published Sunday, the representative of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring them to the light something that makes them change their mind.
Kennedy showed himself more open than her South Carolina colleague.
"Speak it seriously," said Kennedy.
"At the session I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when he passed out and the charges were made public, and I asked him if he had done it.
It was shown to be firm, determined and secure."
But Graham's vote seems to be written in fire.
"I have my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and would make an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett rejected it round," said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people who don't name can verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see anything changed again."
What is the Global Citizen Festival?
New York will host this Sunday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event, which presents an absolutely impressive star programme, which brings about a mission of the same impressive: eradicating poverty in the world.
In the week's edition, Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people meeting in the Great Law area of Central Park not only to enjoy events such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awaken awareness of the global goal of ending the event with extreme poverty in the world before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international defence group that looks forward to ending poverty by increasing the number of people who are helping to combat it actively.
To get a free entry for the event (when someone wants to pay a VIP entry), the assistants had to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteer work, send an e-mail to a world leader, make a phone call or any other activity to alert awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
What success has Global Citizen now had in reaching its goal for 12 years?
The idea of awarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand an action call or just one more case than we call "clictivism" (who thinks it marks the difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has stated that more than 19 million "actions" have been registered by its sympathy, which has helped to achieve various objectives.
It states that these actions have helped to stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to $37,000 million, which would have influenced the lives of more than 2.250 million people before 2030.
In early 2018, the group highlighted 390 commitments and ads derived from its actions, which have already been disbursed or received at least $10,000 million.
The group believes that the funds currently protected have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the major commitments include the foundation of The Power of Nutrition, an association of investors and contractors with the United Kingdom, which is committed to "help children grow as much as possible" and promises to send $35 million to Rwanda to help combat malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"Thanks to the support of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can turn social injustice of malnutrition into a bit of history page," said the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the crowd during a direct concert in London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions requested by the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of his website P+F who asked, "What makes you think we can end with extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen answered: "It will be a long and hard way, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights defence movements and the former apartheid, we'll triumph, because together we're stronger."
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle MonÃ©e are some of the artists who will act on the event in New York, who will present Debora-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "blocking" to block Russian energy exports (Interior Secretary)
Washington can, "if necessary" travel to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including the Middle East, revealed the US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner mentioned.
Zinke has claimed that Russia's intervention in Syria, mainly where the legitimate government is invited, is a prerequisite for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason why they are in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate with energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern corner of Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this issue.
"The United States has the capacity, together with the Navy, to ensure that marine life is open and, if necessary, for blocking, to prevent its energy from entering the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants to the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as the "view of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiate with Russia and Iran, and he pointed out that they are actually equal.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia consists, more or less, of using and replacing fuels," he said, pointing out that Russia has only one resource, since its economy depends on fossil fuels.
Statements arrive while the Trump administration has been in a mission to encourage the export of its natural gas liquid in Europe, instead of Russia, the most economic option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to come out of the North Stream 2 "inadequate", which, according to Trump, converted Berlin into Moscow's "capitulate".
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the North Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which has cost 11,000 million dollars and will double the gas pipeline capacity of 110,000 million cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unillegal competence.
I think we share the view that Energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers, Russia's Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with the U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The US position has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organisation of the German sector, FDI (Federation of German Industries), has called on the US to base EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempp, director of BDI (Federation of German Industries) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren has stated that he will "think carefully" his candidate for the presidency in 2020.
Senator Elizabeth Warren stated on Saturday that he would "think carefully" his candidate for the presidency after the mid-legislative elections.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his application.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix the government's fracture, that women take high positions," said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take seriously my term of office as president."
Warren intervened on President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and said "he was taking the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm clearly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy," he said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a weekend, Warren said, "Of course, an FBI investigation is needed before the elections."
However, a survey published on Sundays showed that a majority of Warren's own voters thought they shouldn't be present for 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters have said that the senator should not be present, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent would support the application.
The survey revealed a broader support for the candidate of ex-conquisitioner Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favour of a possible candidate and 48 percent in opposition.
Other high-profile names among Democrats who took account of a potential candidate for 2020 include Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially reveal his decision to the general, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin boasts the impact of TEPT Track Palin on Donald Trump's match
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after his release on September 11, 2007
Monday night he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"With what is happening to my own son since he came back, I can understand other families that suffer from TEPT ramifications and some of the emotional wounds that our soldiers return with," he explained to the audience in a statement by Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the living room" and said the next of his son and other war veterans: "they become a little different, they become persistent, they return to wondering if there is respect for his military and pilots, like any other member of the army, they have given the country."
He was arrested on Mondays in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence against a woman, with a declaration of domestic violence and arms possession under the effects of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, the police department of Vasilla.
18 states and DC support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Twenty states and the Columbia District support the legal challenge of a new US policy that rejects asylum to victims fleeing from gangs or domestic violence
Representatives of 18 states and the district presented a friend of mine Fridays in Washington to collect an asylum applicant who challenged politics, according to NBC News.
The full name of the request for the Grace vs Sessions that the American Union for Civil Liberties presented the August against federal policy has not been revealed.
He said his partner "and the sons of the gang" added it, but the U.S. officials rejected his asylum application on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum applicants are generated in the United States, such as countries facing generalized gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy repealed a 2014 decision by the Immigration Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to escape domestic violence to ask for it.
The prosecutor-general of the Columbia District, Karl Racine, stated Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
Federal laws require asylum applications to be assisted according to the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to the curial friend.
Lawyers also argued in the report that the policy that rejects immigrants' entry is damaging the US economy, as it is more likely that they become entrepreneurs and "proportional jobs necessary".
In June, General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant any more victims of domestic violence and gangs.
"The asylum is available for those who leave their country for persecution or for reasons of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions in their announcement of 11 June of this policy.
The asylum has never been able to solve all the problems, not even the worst, where people face each day around the world.
Relief efforts in Palu as human losses multiply in an esprint to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly hopeless.
"The environment is very quiet," said the 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma while comforting her son with fever at an evacuation center in the city destroyed by Palu.
"Every minute, an amplitude brings bones.
There's no drinking water."
People have seen residents return to their destroyed homes to take in rain and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of injuries, and hospitals, ill of the sixth magnitude 7.5, are satisfactorily satisfied.
Some of the wounds, including Dwi Haris, that broke the spa, are outside Palu's military hospital, as patients are treated outside because of the strong wounds they repeat.
The tears turned down his eyes as he explained how the violent earthquake seized the room of the fifth plant in the hotel where he met his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haras explained to Associated Press, and added that his family had attended a wedding in the village.
"I heard my wife ask for help crying and then I didn't hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
US ambassador accuses China of "advertising ads".
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page announcement in a North American newspaper promoting the mutual advantages of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump addressed last Tuesday in the supplement of China Daily to The Des Moines Register, the most recent newspaper of the state of Iowa, after urging China to join the elections at the US Congress of 6 November, the US, accused China of refusing.
Trump's claim that Beijing tried to join the US elections marked what North American officials have explained to Reuters that it is a new phase of the Washington campaign to intensify the pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to introduce ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently working in an intensifying trade war that has seen the oranges on mutual imports.
China's venereal facilities at the beginning of the trade war were aimed at punishing the exporters of states, such as Iowa, who now supported the Republican Party of Trump, according to Chinese and North American experts.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and ex-lord of Iowa for a long time, an important exporter of agricultural products in China, says Beijing had lost workers, farmers and businesses in the United States.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article in The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "It is redoubled by advertising advertising advertising to our free press."
"In publishing its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the beloved North American tradition of freedom of expression and free press by inserting a payment notice in The Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, if there's a road down here in Beijing, you'll find a few discrepancy views and you won't see any real reflection of the opinions that Chinese citizens can have on China's worrying economic trajectory, as the media are dominated by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent journals was the offer to publish" his article, but he didn't say the name of the publication.
Republicans leave women voters before the mid-legislative elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, warning analysts
As many of the main Republicans support and defend the candidate at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, facing various sexual assault requests, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, especially among women, to the next mid-legislative elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high, and most of the Republicans have already officially indicated that they want to take a step further with a vote.
These things cannot be undone," explained Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, in The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that she doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last hour's pressure to complete an FBI investigation is sufficient to calm angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday, not tomorrow nor November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national spokesman of the progressive movementOn group, Friday, according to Washington's newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters called "November is coming!" (November is coming) while they showed up at the Senate hall, while the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee decided to continue with the appointment of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to the Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be out of the picture," said Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst independent of the news site.
"People say they've already been high; it's true.
But there may have been more, especially among the voters from 18 to 29 years of age, who often don't vote while the president doesn't like them."
Even before Ford's public witness, where he described his requests for sexual assault on the candidate at the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a negative response could be made if the Republicans were to press for confirmation.
"This has become an embolism for the GOP," said Michael Steele, president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not only about the vote of the meeting or the final vote, nor about whether Kavanaugh is sitting in the bank of the accused. It's also about how the Republicans have managed this issue and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to choose Democrats, in the news channel.
However, North Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in Ford's star and the witnesses of Kavanaugh, with the balance that slowly declines to the last.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents believe in the Ford testimony in an improbable or unlikely way, while 35 percent claim to believe in an improbable or unlikely Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that he believed that Kavanaugh had probably lied or was improbable during his witness, while about 30 percent claimed for Ford himself.
After Flake's press, the FBI is currently investigating applications filed by Ford and, at least, another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate's Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had raped him under the effects of alcohol when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate to the Supreme Court taught the Genitals at a festival while studying in Yale in the '80s.
The World Wide Web inventor plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the web inventor is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform of Berners-Lee Solid.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data are stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intention was "dominate the world."
"We have to do it now," said the sudden company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own personal data storage or a POD.
It can include contact lists, pending tasks lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They're all available in a browser then.
What's exclusive from the personal data store is that the user decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it "personal capacity through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's delegate John Bruce, is that the company integrates adequate resources, processes and skills because the Solid platform is available for everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a safety platform acquired by IBM, some designers in template contracts to work on the project and a community of voluntary codifiers.
This week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralised applications through the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that none of his team is talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely empty during the night.
"We're not asking for permission."
In a Sunday publication in the Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website integrated into the Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when the World Wide Web Consortium founded the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Church of the Victoria I GM
The only clergy of the Church of England who won a victory in World War I as a warrior has been honored in its birth city 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Governor Bernard Vann arrived on September 29, 1918 for the Bellenglish and Lehacourt attack.
However, he was beaten by a franchiser four days later and never knew he had won the most important British military honor.
His two grandsons found a memorial lamp on a Sunday afternoon in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was "magnificently symbolic" that the sheet was presented 100 years after the guarded prosthesis of his grandmother.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann directed his battalion through the Canal of Saint-Quentin "through a very thick cloud and under the intense fire of cannons and metrolabors."
Later he ran to the fire line and, with the "maximum validity" he made progress the line before he threw himself on a cannon with a single hand and left atone three members of the highlight.
The Colonel was shot by a German franchiser on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's actions were a project that could never be equal, which makes you feel humble.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after defeat, directed by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of the defeat and added that the value of an authentic hero is demonstrated by the support that many people will receive.
The fans of the MMA who were left alone all night to see Bellator 206, saw the Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine being awake all night to see Bellator 206 and need to see the most important event.
The map of San JosÃ© contained 13 matches, including six of the main cards, and had to be seen directly all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, the United Kingdom's spectators were atonished when the programming changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed that the night before they saw the fight, they became discouraged.
A Twitter follow-up described the change for animated drawings as "a kind of vomitious acuity".
"The government law says that at 6:00 this content is not appropriate, so they changed to child programming," said Dave Schwartz, vice-president of marketing and communication from Bellator, when they asked him about retransmission.
"Pappa the pig, yes."
Bellator's president, Scott Cooker, said they were working on programming to include United Kingdom spectators in the future.
"I think when I think about repetition, I think it can work," said Coker.
"But there are six in the mornings of a Sunday and we can't fix it until Sunday at our hour, Mondays at its place.
But we're working.
Believe me, when I changed from channel, there were many messages coming and coming, and not all were pleasant.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to leave it in five fights, instead of six as usual, we tried to show it again by the followers, but it ended.
It's a desperate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" about sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he has grown to feel lower than the rest of the people because of his sexuality, but that gave him motivation to triumph.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize until he went to secondary school that wasn't everybody like him.
In the program Desert Island disks of Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of gas to give "hope" to others.
He also said that being a father had been important to him to win the Olympics.
The usual representative of the long-term programme, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off by disease.
Daley, who appeared to be a nuance in Laverne's first program, said he felt "less than" because "he wasn't socially acceptable as children and girls."
He said, "Today, those feelings of inferiority and differentiation have been real things that have given me power and strength to triumph."
He wanted to prove it was "something," he said, so he didn't find anyone when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The twice winner of the Olympic bronze medal has become a high-profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image of the Games of the Commonwealth of Uganda in Australia to request more countries that discriminate against homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he was lucky to be able to live openly without repressives and that he wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world's triangular champion explained that he had fell in love with a man, North American realtor Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "he caught me by surprise."
Last year, Daley married an Oscar winner, 20 older than he, but he says that the difference of age has never been a problem.
According to him, when you're so young (he participated in his first Olympic Games when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find any of the same age that he's experienced at high and low levels.
The couple were parents in June of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley.
"If you had asked me last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold," he said.
"There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is like his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 because of a brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept the fact that he had to die, and he felt that one of his requests was if he had already entered London in 2012 because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell you," he said, "you won't be there to take care of the first row."
"As he took his hand, he stopped breathing, and it was not until then, that he was already dead, that I finally accepted that it was not inviolable," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home in some Olympic Games. There was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired the selection of his first song (Proud of Heather Small), which he had heard while preparing for the Olympics and still had his gallon skin.
Desert Island Discs is issued to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
An impetuous Mickelson presented himself to Ryder Cup Sunday
North American Phil Mickelson will catch a record tomorrow in playing his 47th part of Ryder Cup, but he will have to change his physical status if he doesn't want to become a happy girl.
Mickelson, who will participate in the binary event to score a record 12 times, was presented by Captain Jim Furyk for "fourballs" and "foursomes" on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as has been usually done for the United States, the winner of five main tournaments spends his time doing animation and working in his game in the field, hoping to correct what is wrong with him.
He has never done more direct drivers, not even at the time of his career, but the 48-year-old player is not the ideal option for Le Golf National's hard-trajectory, where the long rough is used to punish the missing times.
And if his own trajectory isn't quite dissociating, Mickelson, in the new Sunday party, will face the exact champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has joined the Rocky Tommy Fleetwood to win the four parties this week.
If the North Americans, four points down at the start of the 12 individual parties, they start strong, the Mickelson party could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more.
"He perfectly understood his role for that day, made me a palm on the back and rolled me around with his arm while he told me he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He's got a lot of confidence in himself.
It's a salon of fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I figured it out more, but that's how I trained, and that's how we think we should move forward.
He wants to be there, like anyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will exceed Nick Faldo's record of the maximum number of games in Ryder Cup.
It can mean the end of a race to Ryder Cup which has not equaled its individual record.
Mickelson has gained 18 victories, 20 defeats and 7 hits, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought intangibles to the team.
"It's fun, sarcastic, bromissist, he likes to get out of people and he's a big company for the team," he explained.
"I think younger players also have fun staying with him this week, which has been fun to see.
He's taking a lot more out of his game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage can soon be forgotten
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage of the two individuals of Ryder Cup's last day can easily become into a hard day.
The Danes started in 1997 in Valderrama, when the team headed by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the American team, but eventually they won the victory for the minimum, 14.5-13.5.
"And still remembering that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but for a while," said Bjorn, in the picture, after seeing the 2018 team victory for 5-3 as many Fridays as yesterday, leaving the marker in 10-6 to Le Golf National.
The story has taught us to me and all the team members who have not yet finished.
Tomorrow you have to go to the whole machine.
You have to go out and do it all right.
This doesn't end until the points don't fit the marker.
We have a goal, try to win the trophie, and we have to keep the concentration to do it.
I've already told you, I'm focusing on the 12 players we have on the team, but I also have those who are our rivals: the world's best players."
Splendid with the performance of his players in a demanding golf field, Bjorn added: "I will never regret this.
It'll be different tomorrow.
Tomorrow the individual performance will mark the difference and change everything.
It's fantastic to be with a company when it's all right, but individual duals test your ability to play golf.
This is the message you have to deliver to the players, get the best of yourself tomorrow.
At this point, you leave your partner and he has to go out and get the best of himself."
In opposition to Bjorn, the rival captain, Jim Furyk, expects his players to do better individually than the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points of four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin on the last day's peaks, as he became part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he lost the "Miracle de Medinah" he won Europe.
"I remember exactly all the words," she answered the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 chapter, motivated his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important parties, but we want to start with a good start, as was seen in Brooklyn and Medinah.
When there's a team that's inspired, there's a lot of pressure generated in these two centers.
We've prepared the alignment based on circumstances and the best way to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the challenge of trying to start the uprising against Rory McIlroy at the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I chose this order because I think it covers all the possibilities," Bjorn says about his selection for individual confrontations.
The new German warship, repatriated
The new armament of Germany would have ended in 2014 to replace the former warships of the Cold War, but it will not, at least, do so until the year they come from defective systems and an increase in cost, according to local media.
The completion of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg class fractures, was completed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which mentions a military carrier.
The ship should have joined the Army in 2014, but the subsequent construction problems have marked the terms of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg-class ships that the Army was responsible for in 2007 will replace the old brakes of the Bremen class.
It is believed that it will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-anthropic and anti-bucco missiles, as well as technology against furtive actions, such as now a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other highlighted features include longer periods between maintenance: new brakes should be available for up to two years without passing through national ports.
However, these continued delays mean that warning ships, which were expected to be able to project in Germany as a powerful foreign force, will already be closed when they enter into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 broke was already news last year, when the German Army rejected the ship and returned it to the castle Bloom & Voss of Hamburg.
It was the first time the Army returned a ship to the builder once released.
There are few details of the reasons for the return, but the German media have cited various "material and technical defects" of the ship that made it unservable if it was used in combat missions.
Technical problems are important, since about 120 mariners, half of the crew needed for the old Bremen class broken, operate on Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg class ships.
Moreover, it has also been known that the weight of the ship is excessive, since it reduces the performance and limits the ability of the Army to add better futures.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tons will weigh twice as much class ships as Germans use during World War II.
In addition to the defective materials, the project cost, which includes the formation of the crew, also begins to pose a problem.
It is believed that it has reached some 3,100 million euros (3,600 million dollars) from an initial budget of 2,200 million euros.
The problems of the new fractures have become an issue of special importance, taking into account recent warnings indicating that Germany's maritime military power is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, has recognized that the Army "is staying without ships that can be used".
The officer has stated that the situation has been complicated over time because they stopped using the old ships, but they didn't provide any more than I did.
He has regretted that none of the defeats of the Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg class could join the Army.
The National Foundation spared the secret life of the rappers
A new research carried out at a summit of Scotland's Highlands aims to discover how the raspberries use the landscape to feed themselves.
It is expected that discoveries can provide new data on the behavior of these single flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study of scientists from the National Escocia Foundation will continue to be held early and common, in addition to northern hearings and water in the Botanical Garden of Inverwe, located in West Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key property locations to monitor the activities of the rapper during the station.
Volunteers and staff of the United Kingdom National Health Service will also perform mobile surveys with portable detectors.
The analysis of the audio recording by experts will determine the sound frequency of the raspberries and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a habitat map will be created to create a detailed image on the landscape of its behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural conservation adviser to the National Foundation of Scotland, expects the results to show which habitat areas are more important for the raspberries and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the advantages of habitat management activities, such as the creation of grasslands, and how to improve forest maintenance for raspberries and other associated species.
The population of orphans in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has been considerably reduced in the last century.
Construction and restoration tasks threaten the rappers, as they affect the nuts and can cause the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning also pose a risk, such as the deadly paper and chemical treatments used in construction materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
In fact, rappers are not blind.
However, because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they have to catch a trap.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to place insects and obstacles that interfere with their flight.
The Scotland National Foundation, responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is taking very seriously the raspberries.
He has ten experts with the proper training, who perform surveys, surveys of the young and, at times, typically rescues.
Even so, the organization has created the first and only reserve of Scotland dedicated to rappers in the Treve State Finca, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the eighth country of Scotland's ten species.
The Finca administrator, David Thompson, says he's the ideal territory for the species.
"Here, in Threave, we have a big area for the rappers," he says.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and a good habit.
But we still don't know a lot of aspects of the raspberries, so the work we do here and other properties will help us understand better what they need to grow."
Note the importance of verifying whether there has been rappenes before maintenance tasks are carried out in property, as it may be that the possible accidental destruction of a single motherhood will kill more than 400 women and young people, as it could lead to the disappearance of a whole local population.
The rappers are protected and it's illegal to kill them, attack them, disturb them, and destroy the young ones.
Elizabeth Ferrell, official of the Scottish Conservative Foundation for Rappens, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
He said, "We still have to learn a lot of raspberries and, in the case of some of our species, we don't have enough data on their population."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while his lawyers prepare a complaint against a German magazine
Christian Ronaldo has indicated that the charges of rape against him are "false news" and has stated that people "will become famous" thanks to his name.
His lawyers will demand the German weekly Der Spiegel magazine, responsible for publishing the charges.
Portugal's front and Juventus has been accused of violating a state-owned woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Supposedly, he paid at his time $375.000 because the incident wasn't made public, according to the information published on Fridays by Der Spiegel.
In an Instagram Live video directed to its 142 million followers hours after the charges were made public, Ronaldo, aged 33, said they were "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," says the five-time winner of the Gold Pilot in the camera.
"They're going to make famous thanks to my name.
It's normal.
They want to use my name to be famous, but they're part of my work.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers have already prepared the complaint against Der Spiegel for the charges, which have qualified as "inadmissible information about private life," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz has said that the player will seek compensation for "moral days for an amount corresponding to the severity of the crime, which is probably one of the most fragile violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at a hotel and casino in Palms de Las Vegas.
After meeting in a night club, Ronaldo and Maorga returned to the player's room, where, apparently, he raped her analally, according to the reports filed at the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo became angry after the alleged incident and told him that he was a "99% good boy", except a "1%".
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that they both had sexual relations, but they were allowed to.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and took pictures of the injuries in the hospital, but later she accepted an agreement outside the courts because she had "preserved" and was concerned about "publicly humiliated".
The woman, 34 years old, says she's trying to cancel the agreement, as she's still traumatized by the accident.
Ronaldo was about to hit the Royal Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer was fixed by the Italian giant in a 100 million-euro operation.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "will always repent" of losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "will always repent," if you lose the world's leader status in post-Brexit manufacturing, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "an concern" that the United Kingdom's Toyota base had stated to the BBC that, if the United Kingdom had left the European Union without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production in the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays on borders in the case of an unaccompanied Brexit could cause loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures the Auris and Avenue models of Toyota, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My point of view is that, if the United Kingdom comes out of the EU without agreement at the end of March, production will stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Out of the EU without any agreement on how trade will work with the rest of the EU countries has woke up the hundreds of other UK car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW claims to close the Mini plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider to be risks in Brexit's production chain without agreement.
The Toyota production line is made on a "just in time" basis with pieces that reach every 37 minutes of United Kingdom and European Union suppliers for the manufacture of cars.
If the United Kingdom comes out of the European Union without reaching an agreement on 29 March, it is possible that there have been disturbances at the border, which the sector considers could result in delays and loss of fish.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than one day on Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production would have to be stopped as a consequence.
Clark says that theresa May's Chequers' plan for future relations with the EU is "correspondingly calibrated to avoid these border controls".
"We have to reach an agreement. We want to get the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," said the BBC Radio 4.
"The tests not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers indicate that we need to be able to continue with a set of production chains."
Toyota has not been able to confirm for how long the production would cease, but, in the long run, has warned that added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and could cause loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of the Union at the plant, said that members are beginning to be very concerned about the situation: "For experience, when these jobs are lost, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could go back
Donald Trump's expected meeting with the general prosecutor-in-Office Rod Rosenstein could be "possessed for a week" while continuing the fight on the appointment to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in statements from the White House Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference with the elections, links between Russia and assistance to Trump and a possible obstacle to justice by the president.
If Trump is fired or not the general prosecutor adds and endangers Mueller's independence, he's been feeding rums in Washington for months.
This month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of holding a microphone to record talks with Trump and also the possibility of depositing the president with the 25th floor.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Sunday he went to the White House between rumors that he was about to quit.
However, a meeting with Trump, who was in the United Nations in New York, was announced on Sunday.
Trump said that "no" accused Rosenstein, but the meeting was held to avoid a confrontation with the hearing of the Senate's judicial committee to which Kavanaugh was testified and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's investigation to the FBI on charges against Kavanaugh, given that the whole Senate vote was delayed.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared at Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he answered the following: "There hasn't been a date yet, it could be this week, though it might be a week more for all the matters with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists may repeat this statement: Sanders has not been holding an information session in the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of information sessions was not because he didn't like the fanfaronry of TV journalists, although he said, "I won't deny they're fans."
However, he suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press should be increased.
"The president has more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, before adding the following without citing us: "We have consulted these data."
Sanders has said that information sessions will continue to take place, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it is much better to talk to me infinity.
We're trying to do this often, you've seen us doing it a lot in the past few weeks and will replace information sessions when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open-ended or press rounds with official visits.
Individual press wheels are rarely common.
This week, in New York, the president may have shown why, after an informal appearance, and, at some point, strange to the assembled journalists.
The Secretary of Health writes to EU workers of the Scottish National Health Service in fear of Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and wishes to continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months after the EU's exit.
The Swedish government has already committed itself to covering the cost of residence requests for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on exit have continued, and it seems to have led to the expected decisions this afternoon.
But the government of the United Kingdom has also begun preparations in the case of a possible scenario without agreement.
I know it's time for all of you.
So I wanted to reiterate that I deeply appreciated the contribution made by all members of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
EU companies, and above all, provide valuable experience and relief that strengthen and improve the health service, while benefiting the patients and communities that we are dealing with.
Of course Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency operation after suffering a stroke on his head.
Christion Abercrombie, a reline of the Tennessee State Tigers, has been subjected to an emergency operation after a raid on the weekend in the defeat of 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, according to information from Mike Organ, Tennessee.
Tennesse State trainer Rod Reed has reported to the press that the injury occurred shortly before the middle.
"He came to the band line, and he exploded there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before placing it in a letter and leaving it for further testing.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris, from Nashville WSMV, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left cherophane at Vanderbilt's medical center.
Harris added that "there's still no information about the type and the extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It's the first time of Abercrombie, the second year, with Tennessee State after it was fixed from Illinois.
I had completed five Saturdays before I left the game, which makes it a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher price on buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher price by buying a property in the United Kingdom with the extra money used to help people without getting to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn's movement to attract young voters.
The increase in the stamp tax will be recorded in those people who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom.
Hisenda expects to earn up to 120 million dollars a year to help people without food.
It is expected that foreign buyers will be grossed a higher price tax by buying a property in the United Kingdom and these money will be used to help people without food, as Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's movement's success in attracting young voters with promises to provide more suitable habitats that affect higher returns.
The increase in the stamp tax will be recorded in those people and businesses who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom; these money will be directed to the government's action to combat the numbers of people without land.
The overload, which will be added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in real estate and real estate speculation, could be up to 3%.
Hisenda expects to earn up to 120 million dollars per year.
It is estimated that 13% of London's new construction properties are of residents who are not British, as it increases prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to open up on the property scale.
Many well-being areas in the country, especially in capital, have become "fathomal cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new measure goes up weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the time-limit to help young people have their first home.
He accused the great constructions of maintaining high prices of property buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel the quotas on land eligible for correction of the Great Britain's real estate disaster.
Corbyn has announced a series of real estate reforms proposed, such as now controls on the location and completion of the "no blame" designations.
He also wants to give more power to the events to build new lands.
May said, "Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restore the British dream: life must improve for every new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Great Britain will always be open to everyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it cannot be just as easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for businesses abroad, to buy housing compared to British residents who work hard.
For a lot of people, the dream of having a place in property is too far and the indigence of people without reading makes it even more real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to train Scotland."
Sunderland trainer Jack Ross said his "maximum ambition" is Scotland's trainer at some point.
The Scottish, 42 years old, has accepted the challenge of reviving the club in the north-east, currently occupying the third position in League One, at three points from the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St. Mirren to Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
They called me once as a support, and that's all," Ross said to BBC Scotland's Sports Sound program.
"But I grew up seeing much to play Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was young and always it's something that makes me retreat in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I'm successful at clubs, but."
Ross's predecessors in the Sunderland coach career include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The Alloa Athletic extractor claims that it is not the pressure to be the next on a list of names given to such a large team, after having rejected previously offered by Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"From now on, my criterion to measure my success will be if I can make this team back to the First League.
With the structure and facilities of the club, it is clear that its place is the First League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd just think I've been successful here if I can make it back to the club."
Ross only has three years of experience as a trainer, after a period as a second trainer in Dumbarton and 15 months in the heart's technical body.
It helped the Lord avoid falling into the third category and transformed St. Mirren into fighting for the salvation of champions at the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his stage as a player in Clyde, Hartplepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It must have been a decisive moment," he recalled about accepting responsibility in God.
"I had always believed that training was the best that I had been given, rather than playing.
It sounds strange because I did well, I came out reasonably and I enjoyed enough good moments.
But playing can be very hard.
There's a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in aspects like stress and pressure at work, but I feel good as a coach.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable time I've ever felt like I'm an adult."

The perfect time for a painting is 17:30 a Saturday, according to a study
The summer heat wave has destroyed consumption in the bars with difficulties in Great Britain, but has added more pressure to restaurants chains.
Bars and bars have achieved an increase of 2.7% in sales in July, but the consumption in restaurants has decreased by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, of the CGA financial assistant, the company that has collected the data, says: "The continuous hours of sun and England's participation in the World, which has extended beyond expectations, have made July follow a pattern similar to June, with an increase of 2.8% in bars, except in the case of restaurants, which have suffered more.
The reduction of 1.8% in consumption in June's restaurants has been imposed on July.
Bars and taverns, led by drinking, have achieved the best results, while the consumption of restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer food have also suffered from the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to get out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we have consulted, drinking sales have increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales have decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, of the analysts here and the RSM hotel, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Time and impact on large social events or sports remains the main factors related to foreign market sales.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to have problems, but a decline in sales of a 4.8% in-year would be particularly damaging, rather than constant cost pressure.
This is so long and calories couldn't have arrived at a better time for the food-serving shops and the time will say if the more moderate temperatures we had in August would provide this necessary breath."
The total increase in bar sales and restaurants, including the recently opened ones, was 2.7% July, given the trend in brand presentation.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales indicator for United Kingdom restaurants, bars and taverns collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined loss of over 9 million pounds and is the sector's established reference point.
One out of every five children has secret social networks that hide their parents
One of every five children, some 11 years of age, has secret social networks accounts that hide parents and teachers, according to data from a survey.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students has indicated an increase in the "insta false" pages.
Newspapers have increased the fear of sexual advertising
20% of students say they have a "primary" account that shows parents
One of every five children, some 11 years old, creates social networks that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students has indicated a rapid increase in "insta's false accounts", a reference to Instagram, the place to share photos.
Newspapers have increased the fear of sexual advertising.
A 20% of students say they have a net "primary" account that shows parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who discovered the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter saw a message from a teenager who invited others to "square me".
Research, conducted by Digital Awarenss UK and the Private School Directors Committee (HMC) of Independent Schools has revealed that 40% of adolescents between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, half of which are admitted to have private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create spaces online where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elidh Doyle will be the "views of athletes" in the Scottish Federation's directive
Elidh Doyle has been appointed non-executive director of the Scottish Federation of Athletics Directive at the annual general meeting of the organisation.
Doyle is the field and track athlete with more Scotia medals, and President Ian Beattie described the movement as a great opportunity for those leading sport to benefit from his international experience in the last decade.
"Eilid has respect for the community of Scotland's athleticism, the United Kingdom and the whole world and we are sure that Scottish athleticism will benefit from its inclusion in the directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I've got a lot of interest in acting like athletes' voice and I hope I can make sport grow and contribute to Scotland."
The U.S., which won the gold in the 200th and 400th Olympic Games in 1996 in Atlanta, between a total of four Olympics and currently a regular BBC commentator, was prevented from traveling after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell me if I can recover or how much.
It's been boring, but I've recovered from everything, I've learned to walk again and today it's going to be an agility exercise!
Thank you for the message of eternity!"
An anagram of thiralls that compares the sea with cows divides the opinion on the Internet
A shooting company has divided the opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares milky mothers to cows that are mixed.
To mark the launch of what is considered the "first silencer that can be brought from the world", the technology company Elvie has launched an inspired announcement in a music video of jokes to show freedom that gives the new tyrant to the sea.
Four real mothers dance in a garland full of grass and cows at the rhythm of a song that includes letters such as, "Yes, I believe in myself, but you won't see anybody" and "For if you hadn't found out, they're not arms, but my feet."
The turn goes on: "Bombija, bombs, food for babies, bombs, bombs, munitions for girls."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a range of reactions from those who have seen it, many of which claim to show the "horrors" of the lactic industry.
"Very bad decided to use cows to announce the product.
Like us, they have to stay pregnant and stand up to produce lettuce, with the difference that they are separated from their babies a few days after they're married," wrote a person.
Elvie Tirallet is secretly hidden in a lactating support (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: "Probably traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But why don't you use them to announce a trail for seams that will keep their babies safe?"
Another user added, "It's an ad out of place."
Other people defended the announcement; a woman admitted that she found the song "for fun".
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I still had to give it to my mom.
Bombing for the trigger made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a little crazy, but it has to be taken as it is.
It's a great product," wrote a user.
Another person commented: "It's a fun announcement for seams that bomb with thirallets (usually at their place of work or at the bathroom and feel like they're empty.
It is no announcement that I lie or judge the lactic industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they've beaten everyone with a tape set discreetly to the supporters.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say they feel as if they were empty when they use the trigger.
However, Elvie's arrow is completely silent, has no cable or tube, and fits slowly into a lactating supporter, giving women more freedom to move, subjecting babies and, even, getting out while bombing.
Ana Balarin, a sociologist and first childhood developer of Mother, said: "The Elvie Tirallet is such a revolutionary product that deserves a shameful and provocative campaign.
In dealing with the parallelism between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how a tyrant is used and the challenges that are supposed to do so, while we demonstrated, in a conservative and educational way, the incredible sense of freedom that the new tyrant offers.
It's not the first time the Elvie shooting's on the news.
During the week of the London fashion, a mother of two children appeared at the passport for designer Martha Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children, silently moved to a tenement camp at the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased despite the fact that monthly entry through the border has been practically stable, in part because the heavy rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to be kidnapped.
Traditionally, most parents were immigrants without papers, who were afraid to risk their ability to stay in the country if they decided to take a child.
The risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that possible parents and the rest of adults living in their countries would have to send digital press, which will share with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-level immigration and customs control officer, testified before the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested to receive minors not accompanying them.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrests had no prior criminal record.
"About 80% of the people who have taken or live in the land of a person who has been arrested are illegally in the country, and a large majority of them are criminals.
So we'll continue to pursue these people," said Albence.
In order to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new standards that require some to present themselves to the court within a month after being detained, instead of 60 days, which was the pre-trial standard, in agreement with refugee workers.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, instead of present, to defend their case in order to obtain the legal status before an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered fit for help will be deported immediately.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they will be to suffer anxiety or depression, which may result in violent attacks or attempts to escape, according to the workers and reports he's given to know the system in the last few months.
Lawyers claim that these concerns can be intensified in larger installations, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that because of their size, they will pass on the signs indicating that a child is suffering.
They added that moving children to the camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to their friends can cause them a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria urges the US 'occupation forces', France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem asked Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country had lasted eight years.
Muallem, who also acted as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "the issue will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must be removed immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that "the war of terror has virtually ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displaced persons.
Damascus has stated that it would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we purge the whole Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and of "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish and Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground of a war-affected country.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem has stated that the conditions were good for his return and has blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "illegal parties" that make refugees want to stay away.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations that facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politics a matter that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid in the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats have stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral area at the last large rebel fortress, Idlib, has improved the opportunity to continue with political findings.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces with Russia's help in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem noted that the agreement has "clear terms" and expressed the hope that military action would face the Jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Nusra Front, bound to Al-Qaeda, who "will be expelled".
Stephan de Mistura, sent by the United Nations, is waiting to convene early meetings of a new committee formed by government members and opposition to start generating a post-war constitution and preparing the way to the elections.
Muallem expressed the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, the task of which should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump's gonna win a second time
According to this logic, Trump would again win the election in 2020 when, as many liberal spectators are likely to expect, the scandals and the destruction process ended with its presidency in a premature manner.
Which would certainly be "the end of a more dramatic presidency of history."
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in maximum audit time has doubled to 1.05 million to CNN and virtually tripled to 1.6 million to MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in maximum audience hours, from 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show", from MSNBC, has led TV audiences per cable with up to 3.5 million viewers in the main IT networks.
"People have been tried because they don't understand it," says Neal Baer, executive producer of the ABC's "Designed Survivor" series on a cabinet director who is going to be the president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
In Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him I'd vote for Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
"I answered that because I laughed at him," he said to me.
There's a point of training in chaos.
Of course, unlike television programs, the guide from Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families could meet and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only privileged viewers can be allowed.
And yet, being an informed citizen is going further when you find in the sixth hour a group of experts to discuss the use that Bob Woodward has made of "for private use" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's leather jacket of 15,000 dollars ("a piece of rough clothing like his pride", titled Washington Post) and the terrible consequences of the descriptions that Stormy Daniels made of, let's say, Trump's Anatomy.
In my case, I won't see Super Mario again.
"Part of what makes me part of a telereality program is that every night it gives you something new," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and founder of "Pawn Stars" about the changes in the characters and guided lines of the Trump program (to fight with NFL, rent Kim Jong-Un).

When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and he was alone outside the house on the north coast of Kaui, but he was locked up looking at the MSNBC while he was recording the CNN.
He couldn't stand it, not with Brett Kavanaugh to face the Senate's judicial committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
"I remember when we made those then forgotten programs and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it would be a kind of joke, but it seems they were right."

External money neglects the course of the mid-legislative elections to the House of Representatives
It is no surprise that there is a cash flood in effect at the 17th Pennsylvania district, thanks to the realization of the congressional districts that have made two current members compete for the same place.
This recent reassignment of the Suburban District of Pittsburgh involves the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who obtained the place in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is in conflict with the new 17th district.
The maps were reimbursed after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled that the former districts were divided in an unconstitutional manner in favour of the Republicans.
The new 17th district course has launched a financial war between the main financial organizations of the parties, the Committee for the Democratic Campaign for the Congress (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republic of the Republic (NCRC).
Lamb was named in Pennsylvania after an adjusted victory in a special election later held in March to represent the 18th convention district of Pennsylvania.
The Republicans have been in charge for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points of difference.
Political experts give Democrats a little advantage.
The United States imposes sanctions on Salvador for its support in China, but they withdraw
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with Panama's president, Juan Carlos Valera, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his associates made it out of the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of state diplomatic missions to Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "renewal decisions on the fact that Taiwan is not recognized," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, this month.
However, only the possibility of punishing El Salvador, which received US$ 140 million in 2017, is estimated to be for drug control, development and economic improvement.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial assistance and restrictions on visas issued, would be harmful to the Central American country and high numbers of deaths by murder and accident.
With the steps of the internal meetings, officials from both countries held a high-level meeting focusing on security and economic prosperity to continue with a similar finding held last year and that it was seen as a step forward to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the meeting to be held, since it ended effectively with any possibility of sanctions for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has been elected for the meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance of administration, according to diplomats.
The three statesmans turned to their ranks in Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no hard messages or sanctions for Washington.
A spokesman from the Bolton White House refused to comment on the details of the debate that the three officials, including two diplomats, agreed to discuss the internal deliberations since the anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the administration and since the anonymity, confirmed his statements.
History study
The next event to be performed could be the Special Prosecutor's report by Robert Mueller on the possible obstacle of Trump to justice, of which there are numerous evidence in public records.
As you know, Mueller also investigates whether Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in his election attack.
If the Congress changed its hands, Trump could be found accountable to the organization, just when it is prepared to do so in front of the voters, and even before a party jury.
There are many circumstances, and I do not mean that the fall of Trump, nor of any of its European human beings, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be taken on both Atlantic rivers that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officials were willing to take a stand against Hitler, only if the western block had resisted and supported the Czechs in Munic.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history revolves around points of influence like this and it accelerates or leads to unprecedented progress in democracy.
The United States is facing a number of points of influence at the moment.
What will happen if Trump is accused of Rod Rosenstein, the deputy general prosecutor, the man who controls Mueller's investigation target?
Rosenstein has been with water on the hill since this newspaper reported that last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculating that it was not appropriate for the charge.
Rosenstein says the Times information isn't necessary.
"How do we respond if the new investigation that the FBI has requested about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed by the Supreme Court all the credible allegations of sexual abuse and false witnesses?
And, in particular, will we vote in the middle of a Congress that will be responsible for Trump?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will begin to run the risk.
But I don't think we'll fail because I've learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz for the same Nazi regime that occupied the house of the ambassador.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, he sent me to burn Sabat's mirrors on that table with the swastika.
With this baggage, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans, from Rangers, front-hand optimist against the speed of Vienna
The Rangers capture the Speed of Vienna daily, recognizing that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive summit in the Villa-real field this month, would leave him in a good position to be classified as the G Group of the European League.
A knee injury prevented mig camper Graham Dorrans from playing the first minutes of the season until the 2nd round against the Real City, but you think Rangers can use this result as a trap to get big results.
"It was a positive point for us, because the Villa-real is a good team," said the player, aged 31.
"We played the game believing we could get a valuable result and we went out with a point.
Maybe we could've done something more in the end, but, in general, the impact was probably a good result.
They were better in the first place, but we were better than they were in the second.
On Tuesday, it's another big European night.
We hope we can stay with the three points, but it's going to be a difficult game because they're bringing a good result to the last game, but I'm sure we'll give it everything and get a good result with the office's support.
Last year it was really hard, with the injuries I suffered and changing them to the club, but now it's a good place to be.
The team is good and the boys enjoy it, the training is good.
I hope we can do everything we can, leave behind the past season and be successful."
Women lose the sound of the fear of the survivors for the Jubilee
Although the participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to take care of them, few people spoke to the family.
About half of the respondents at the national level claim that they have spoken to their long-term payout partner.
Only 10% of the polls say she talked to the children.
"People want some family to take care of them, but they don't dare to plant it," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of the National Life Insurance Company.
We need to start over here.
Talk to your mate and children â€” you canâ€™t prepare your family for this if you donâ€™t share your wishes with them.
Work with your supervisor and your family to decide where and how to pay attention, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial adviser in the conversation: It can also help you to determine how to pay these expenses.
Your long-term funding options may include a long-term care insurance policy for long-term care, a hybrid life insurance policy that helps you to cover expenses or own insurance with your own resources, if you have the money you need to do so.
Prepare your legal documents: cut step into legal battles.
Look for a representative to appoint a trusted person who monitors your medical attention and ensures that the professionals complete your wishes if you cannot communicate with you.
Consider also the possibility of contracting a notary deposit for your finances.
You can select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your invoices are paid in case of incapacity.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your old family has a medical emergency and is on its way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergic drugs?
Specifies the details in a written plan to be prepared.
Finance is not the only factor that has to be determined, but also what doctors you want to deal with," Martin said.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have this plan ready."
A man shot several times with a compressed air shell in Ilfracombe
A man has received several cuts from a compressed air shuttle while returning home after going out in the night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the area of Oxford Grove of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot at the chest, abdominal and arm.
Officials described the shooting, which took place around 2.30 a.m. (in the British summer hour), as "a random act".
The victim has not seen his attacker.
His life is not in danger of injuries, and the police have made a call to find witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died because of a strong earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu Friday, according to the authorities.
As communications are cut, aid units have not been able to obtain information about the kingdom of Dodrea, an area in the north of Palu near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude teratremol.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
The following include some important data about Palu and Dondria, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the Province of Central Celebes, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Dondria is a kingdom that extends more than 300 km from the coast to the northwest of the island of Celebes.
The kingdom, a region less administrative than a province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the Central Celebes Province, especially in the coastal region of Dodrya.
The mine exploitation of the lake is also important in the province, but it concentrates mainly on Morowali, on the coast of the other extreme of Celebes.
Palu and Dondria have suffered several tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dodrya.
In 1996 there was also a tsunami in the west of Dondria that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific fireplace and is often produced by earthquakes with certain frequency.
The main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are listed as follows:
2004: On 26 December, a large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Ace, north of Sumatra, caused tsunamis that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people at the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of those in Aceh.

Sarah Palin's eldest son, arrested with charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of Alaska's ex-government and candidate to the Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for aggression.
Palin, 29 years old, of Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested as suspects of domestic violence, interference with a domestic violence report and arrest resistance, in accordance with a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a acquaintance tried to call the police to denounce the alleged crimes, he got his phone.
Palin is detained at the Mat-Su temporary detention centre, where he is held with an unencumbered bond of $500, according to KTUU.
He compared himself to the court on Saturday, when he declared "no blame, with certainty" when he was asked how he was declared, according to this chain.
Palin is facing three missing Class A, which means he could go to prison for a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
It is also accused of lack of Class B, which can be punished one day in prison and $2,000 in fine.
It's not the first time there are criminal charges against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of adding his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
Currently, the case is at the hands of the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic aggression, interference with the reporting of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in the state of emergency.
His partner declared that he had given him a puny face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans to associate his son's violent behavior with a posttraumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after a earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of lands.
Electricity and communications networks don't work, and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake has just occurred on the coast of Central Celebes, north of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Social networks are circling videos at the time of the impact.
Hundreds of people met at a festival at the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand an exceptional death penalty for a suspect of the terrorist attack in New York
New York's federal prosecutors ask for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people: an extraordinary punishment that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, assumed to use a Home Depot housing truck to complete an attack on a bike on the West Side Highway, in Lower Manhattan and to locate travellers and cyclists during his track, in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors have to demonstrate that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and that "intentionally" caused serious personal injuries, according to the intention of requesting the death penalty presented in the South New York district.
Both crimes could be a death penalty, according to the court's document.
Weeks after the attack, a large federal jury attacked Saipov with a 22-off charge that included eight murder charges for organized crime, which federal prosecutors often use in case of mafia, in addition to a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The prosecutors claimed that the attack required a "considerable planning and premeditation" and described how Saipov acted as "inhuman, cruel and excessive".
"Sayful Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucco," according to the intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since New York's South District brought a death sentence to court.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug dealers, but eventually he was sentenced to a chain that lasted in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being sentenced for conspiracy to take action against the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the documents of the court, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not demonstrate repentance in the days and months after the attack.
The police explained that he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the record of charges, Saipov explained to the authorities that he was inspired to bring the attack to its end after seeing ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, he also requested the ISIS flag to be deployed to his hospital room.
It has been declared innocent of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the public federal defenders representing Saipov, said they were obviously disappointed with the decision of the charges.
"We will consider that the decision to ask for the death penalty, instead of accepting a declaration of guilt and a continuing chain without the possibility of freedom, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked the prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Member of Parliament of the Conservative Party states that NIGEL FARGE should be put in charge of Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage promised "mobilize the popular troops" today during a protest at the Conservative Party's conference.
The former leader of the UKIP stated that politicians must "smell the pressure of Eurosceptics" when one of the members of the House of Lord Theresa May suggested that they should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bonne told Birmingham that the United Kingdom would already be outside the EU if Mr Farage was the Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May at the time of conciliating her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted when conservatives in favor of the Union have presented themselves in another protest against Brexit in La City.
The first minister is struggling to preserve his Chequers' compromise plan between the attacks of Brexit's parties, the Union's and the EU's parties.
The allies insist that it will reach agreement with Brussels despite the negative responses and press the Eurosceptics and the conservative party to choose between their package and the chaos.
Mr. Bone told Solihull's mixed Leave Means Leave that he wanted to cancel the Chequers compromise.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge, we'd be out already,' he said.
Parliament member Wellingborough added: "I'll defend Brexit, but we have to cancel the Chequers compromise."
He added: "We have not fought world wars to become servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestions that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false."
The Conservative Party of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and said in front of the reporters, "I just tell you, first minister, that people listen."
"The Chequers commitment is impotence between the general public, opposition will not vote in favour, it is impotence between our party and our activists, who are the people who get out of the street and get us to win elections.
Leave the Chequers commitment and start listening."
In a message directed to Mrs. May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said that mitigating politicians must feel pressure if they want to take the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This, now, is a matter of trust between us (people) and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to bring Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let them do it."
In a message to the excited crowd, he added: "I want you to make the political class, in order to bring Brexit, feel pressure."
"We are moving the popular troops of this country who gave us victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the Union's parties took a trip to Birmingham before a two-hour rally took place in the city center.
A small number of activists reacted flagged against the conservatives against Brexit after the group's launch this week.
The conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis laughed at the conservators because of the security problems they suffered with a party application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for Canada's agreement more, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no option for a good Brexit," he added.
Warren is planning to examine the possibility of presenting himself as a candidate to the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says he will consider the possibility of presenting himself as a candidate to the president after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at an open meeting in the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, the usual criticism of President Donald Trump, was presented for his re-election in November against GOP representative Geoff Diehl, who was the Vice President of the Tromp Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It was a centre of speculation about the possibility of bringing Trump back in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with constituents with the open-ended meeting format since Trump took up his career.
An assistant asked him if he was planning to present himself as a candidate to the presidency.
Warren replied that it's time for "the women to go to Washington to repair our government that doesn't work, and that includes a woman in the bathroom."
A person arrested for killing Sims by LSU
Baton Rouge's police announced on Sunday that a suspect was arrested for the death toll of LSU Bayde Sims Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, at the press conference at 11:00.
They published a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for collaboration to identify the man in the metrage.
Sims, aged 20, was shot and died near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a shot at his head that finally killed him," the police officer Murphy J. Paul began on Sunday in the media for 247 sport.
Wade tried to defend his friend and received a tip from Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being in the scene, possession of a gun, and shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was taken to custody at the East Baton district police department.
Sims, a young player of 2 m who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 parts with 10 beginners during the last season and had a mean of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 bounces per game.
Russia's Great Prize: Lewis Hamilton gets the world's title after the team's orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas stayed in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes's team orders would play an important role in the race.
From the field position, Bottas had a good start and almost shot Hamilton as he defended his position for the first two times and invited Vettel to attack his company.
Vettel entered the boxes before and let Hamilton run with the transistence on the back of the package, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop at boxes and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after a certain wheeled action that caused Ferrari's pilot to leave the inner part free with the risk of staying out after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen began at the last row of the grid and at the end of the first time he went to the seventh position on the day of his 21st anniversary.
Then he continued in good position most of the way, since he kept his way to save time, advance to Kimi Raikkonen, and move to fourth place.
He finally entered the boxes around number 44, but he couldn't increase the rate to the next eight times, and Raikkonen placed himself in the fourth position.
It's a hard day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all week and was a real gentleman who told him to let me go.
The team did a great job to have a u-do" said Hamilton.
Your body language was terrible
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diane Feinstein on a Saturday meeting to insist that she did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she accused the candidate to the Supreme Court of Sexual Abuse Brett Kavanaugh.
In a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's testimony before the Court's Judicial Committee, but commented that what was going on in the Senate proved that people were "bad, cruel and lying".
"One thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that's happening in the last days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people angry, angry, cruel and lying," he said.
"When you look at the communications and the filtrations and say, "No, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document?" "Eh, what?
No, no.
I didn't filter it."
Hey, wait a minute.
We filtered... No, we didn't filter it," he added while imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the statements against Kavanaugh from Ford in July and was filtered in September, but Feinstein denied that the filter was carried out from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't filter his story," Feinstein explained to the Committee, according to The Hill.
"I asked you to be confidential, and I kept it confidential, as you asked me."
But his denial did not please the President, who commented on the meeting on Saturday night: "You know what? Your body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing with his defence of the candidate to the Supreme Court, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the statements with their own intent.
"They are determined to regain power through the necessary means.
You see evil, cruelty, they don't care who do evil, who have to struggle to have power and control," said the President, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer marked two waves for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the weekend defeat in Elite against the Belfast Giants, as they won the 5-3 turnout in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants then received a two-dollar advantage thanks to the completions of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised their team level, but then Dwyer restored the advantage of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard was equal to the Dundee.
It was the third defeat of the season at the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who came to win the Dundee 2 to 1 in Belfast Friday.
It was the fourth of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from Kendall McFaull's assistance. Four minutes later, with David Rutherford's assistance, Beauvilleer would double his advantage.
During this early period, Sullivan relocated the home team to the game at 13:10 a.m. before Matt Marquardt eased the equivalent at 15:16.
Dwyer guaranteed the advantage of the Giants in the first pause when he got the second gol of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to its level with a powerful wave at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined in helping Nielsen to give Dundee the advantage for the first time during the party at the end of the second part and guaranteed the victory of his team with the five goal near the end of the party.
The Giants, who have already lost four of the last five parties, are home to Milton Keynes and have their next Friday party.
Aerial controller for saving hundreds of passengers from a certain earthquake
An Indonesian air controller has become a hero after death to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers will safely land.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a great earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday and set off a tsunami.
There's a lot of funnels going on in the area, and there's a lot of people trapped between the ruins in Palu City.
But even though his companions escaped to save his life, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his place at the Tremulous airport control tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed in his place to make sure that Batik's flight 6321, which was on the track at the time, could take the flight safely.
Then he came out of the air traffic control tower when he thought he was sinking.
He died in the hospital later.
A representative of Air Navigation, Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from BalikapÃ¡n to Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"That broke our heart," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has reported that access to the cities of Dothria, Sigi and Botung is limited.
"It is expected that the number of dead increases because there are still many things under the run and there are still many that have not been able to access," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, with an altitude of up to six meters, have destroyed Palu, which will celebrate a common funeral Sunday.
Armed forces and some commercial aircraft are carrying help and relief.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, explained to Sky News: "Every minute, an amplitude leads to death.
The drinking water is scarce.
All the minorities have been kidnapped."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, explained to the CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross works against clocks to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find.
That's already a tragedy, but I could still improvise."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the armed forces: "I ask you all who work day and night to complete all the occupation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" said the CNN.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aeronautics in Micronesia: Air Niugini says now that a man has disappeared after the accident at the lake
The airline that operated a flight that was going to take place in a Pacific lake in Micronesia now says that a man has disappeared, although it was said that the 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a communiquÃ© that there had been no passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline claimed to be working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find it.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane fell into the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island Airport.
The authorities reported on Sundays that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that on Sunday there were still six passengers in the hospital and that they were all in good condition.
The reason for the accident and the exact sequence of the events is still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane crashed into the lake because the track was short.
Some witnesses think that the plane passed the track by high.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was very low.
"That was extremely positive," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the other passengers were able to walk with water for the belt to the emergency exits of the plane, which was sinking.
He said that the volunteers had panicked and began to cry, and he suffered a stroke on his head.
The U.S. Navy said that the mariners who had been working close to improving a well also helped in the rescue with an inflexible ship to transport people affected on land before the plane crashed about 30 meters in the water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicate that 111 people have died in plane accidents recorded in PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these incidents.
An analyst composed a chronology of the night that burned a woman alive
The tax office concludes the case on Saturday in the review of the trial of a man accused of smoking a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described in the jury how he used the cell phone records to build the 29-year-olds, Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night he died.
Rowlett said he received the location data from different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicted his previous statements, according to The Clarion Ledger report.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sunday, Sanford denied and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying, since his truck was in Nashville."
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis said he had two weeks to meet Chambers when he died.
The phone records indicated that they only had a week to meet.
Rowlett said that, shortly after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted text messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," said Hale.
The defense is planning to start its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he was hoping that the judge would pass the jury on the same day.

Another black person?!
NY Monday calls for a couple to burn after a "racist" message
A New York morning manager accused a couple of a discriminatory harassment after receiving a bad text message from the mother where she protested because she was "another black person."
The couple refuse to be racist and compare the demand with an "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed surprise that the new morning, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived to work on the first day of 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOA OTHER NEGRA PERSON," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After learning of her pipe, a "inclined" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman burned Mrs. Maurice, while claiming that the morning she had burned, that was an African, had done her job badly, and that she was expecting a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received the corresponding payment on her day of work and then sent her home with a Uber.
Now, Maurice calls on the couple a compensation for the acquisition and asks for a compensation of approximately $350 a day for work with a residence of six months for which they hired her, although there was no contract.
"I want to show them that they can't do things like this," he explained to the Post Friday, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple replied to statements that they were racist all claiming that Maurice's compromise was the most reasonable one, since they were afraid they could not trust her after having offended her.
"My wife sent him something he didn't mean.
He's not racist.
We're not racist people," said the husband, Joel Plasco, at the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been jealous of, even if it was wrong?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who compared the demand to a "extortion," said that his wife had two months left to have a baby and that she was in a very difficult situation.
"Are you going to pursue something like this?
It's not a very kind attitude," added the investor banker.
The legal case is still not resolved and the court of public opinion has insisted that the couple be accused of social networks and condemn their behavior and logic.
Paddington's editors are afraid readers don't identify themselves with an os talking, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said in relation to the letter: "It's hard to place someone who was bound for the first time before his publication.
Thank you very much, now we know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
He explained that his father, who had worked as a camera for the BBC before he was inspired to write the child book on a small piece of paper, was optimistic about the book's rebirth. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "agredelÃ§", after his death last year.
Describe Paddington as a very important member of his family and says his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a discreet man; he was not a suspect," he said.
"But, as Paddington was so real to him, it was practically as when your son got something: you're proud of yourself, even though it's not yours.
I think he considered Paddington's success that way.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he always recognized Paddington's own merit."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye by phone.
On the landing, they took their daughter to NiÃ§a's Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where the doctors worked to save her life.
"Nothing often called to say that it was very hard and they didn't expect it to happen," began Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad and he told me he would die in the next two minutes and he had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, beautiful.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The medications they gave her because her body continued to fight were consuming and getting out of her system.
He had died before he was scheduled and that's how it all ended.
I just had to sit and wait, because I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family members and more people.
I had to keep the good shapes."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now in pain for her daughter's loss, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted from the experience that was happening.
"No one knew," he said.
"I had my head cut and tears didn't stop falling.
It's hard to explain, but while I wanted to feel a feeling of sympathy for Ned accompaniment.
The feeling I needed my love and my understanding.
I know I really wanted it."
Doll women pay cards to prevent suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have been murdered are working to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been tapping cards in a galley bridge with inspiring messages and telephone numbers that citizens can call for help.
Miss Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer depression and, at the age of 18, he was killed.
"I don't want no father or mother to hear what I have to hear every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, living in Sydney, said that his son was a boss with a funny contagion.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said their smile could light any room."
However, he left his job before he died because he was in a very dark spot.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after he took his own life.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there's a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "because people know there are people to whom they can hear, even if it's a friend.
Don't be quiet: you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who was a friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, his partner for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother died.
"He never said that he wasn't well or that he was depressed or anything like that," he said.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed a change of attitude.
He played the background on Christmas day, when the children opened their gifts and he didn't look at them in the eyes or anything."
He said his death meant a great tragedy for them, but they had to work: "Open a hole in the family.
Destroy us.
But we have to keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is expected for a thread while the FBI is launching an investigation
"I thought if we could get something like what he asked for (a research with an area and a limited time), we could get a certain unit," said Mr. Blake on Saturday. He also added that he was afraid that the committee would be destroyed by the dead spot of the parties.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican party want an FBI investigation?
His reticence has to be seen right away.
If, as expected, the Republicans do not achieve good results, they will be weakened by the fact that the person they want to be elected comes to the country's main court.
George W. Bush was on the phone to call the senators and press them to pick up Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, and he also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, as she was his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI believes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where, at present, there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, to give up his arrest and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korea deserters "cau" with Kim
The number of North Korean deserters in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un arrived in power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, all citing data from the Ministry of the South Union, said 1.127 deserts have occurred last year, compared with the 2.706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in prices covering traffickers were the main factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comment.
Usually, the vast majority of North deserters are offered South Korea nationality.
The sources of Seoul claim that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers illegal migrants instead of refugees and often repatriated them by force.
The relations between the North and the South, which are technically still in war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to keep the talks focused on the negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US Presidents Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work to obtain a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Sunday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions on lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not unify ourselves first," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a "historic" and is not fit to work at the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority of the House Nancy Pelosi said that the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, is a "historic" and that his temper is incapable of working in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Sunday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had acted this way, they would have said it was a "historic," said Pelosi in relation to her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Court's Sunday Judicial Committee.
Kavanaugh, excited, rejected the charges of sexual abuse by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh showed himself very excited, sometimes crying and leaving without words while talking about his family and his years at the institute.
He also explicitly condemned the Committee's democracies and said that the charges against him were a "gross and coordinated murder of a character" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he could not work at the Supreme Court because he had shown his prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualified himself with these statements and how he attacked Clinton and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi showed reticence when he was asked if he would attempt to force Kavanaugh's election, if it is confirmed, and if the Democrats get most in the House of Representatives.
"That's what I can say: if you don't tell the truth at Congress or the FBI, it's not only capable of being at the Supreme Court, but not at the court where it is now," Pelosi commented.
Currently, Kavanaugh serves as a judge at the Court of Appeal for the Circuit of the District of Colombia.
Pelosi added that, as a democracy, he was concerned about the decisions that Kavanaugh could take against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe case against Wade, as it is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, he questioned whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be rejected.
"It's not a time when a historical person and with prejudices enter the Tribunal and waits for us to look wonderful," Pelosi said.
Women must exercise their power.
It's a justified diaphragm: months and years of cold and unable to remove it without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's a little common.
He continued: "I helped a woman who was an executive in some place who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but that she developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and began to cry, tell the person she was talking to, "Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then he went on.
I felt brilliant."
The tears are allowed to come out for anger in part because, basically, they are misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories that I have of one of my first jobs in an office with most men, where once I had been crying with an unreceptive anger, is that of a bigger woman (a cold directive that had always terrorized me a little) who took me from the wheelchair and dragged me to the back of the ladder.
"Never let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy, because they'll have you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Member of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered in an extramarital adventure on a ship called Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of presenting herself as a candidate to the presidency.
"It wasn't a very thought-in-depth decision," she told me while she was 30 years old.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone said, "Blancanu and the seven noses."
As soon as he arrived at the campaign, he went back with the fund-raising, so he promised he wouldn't have access to the race if he didn't get $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found out that some of his supporters, who gave $1,000 to the men, were just willing to give it 250 to her.
"Do you think I have an account?" he asked.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not start a formal campaign, he was so touched by the emotions (thanks to the people who had helped him, frustrated with the system for the difficulty of getting money and being directed to voters, instead of doing it to the delegates, and anger, and sexism) that remained without words.
"It might have thought I had a nervous crisis," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about the press response.
"It might have thought my corporate sponsor was Kleineex.
I remember thinking: What will they put in my grave?
"Will you cry?"
How trade war between the US and China can benefit Beijing
The initial rescues of the US-China trade war were concording and, although the war does not seem to have to end soon, the countries can benefit Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued his first warning at the beginning of this year when he imposed taxes on China's major exports, such as solar plates, steel and aluminium.
The most significant climb took place this week, with new facilities that affect products of USD 200,000 million, which assumes a tax burden on half of all goods arriving in the United States from China.
Pekin has been attacked every time in the same way and has recently raised five to ten percent of the US$60,000 million worth of goods.
China has committed itself to replaying the US, and it is not likely that the second world's largest economy is going back closer.
Making Washington behaves again in response to some requests, but publicly putting herself in front of the US would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, China's President.
However, experts say that, if Beijing plays its letters well, the pressures of the US trade war could benefit China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a fast political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that begin a fall in any of these countries is much more dangerous than the witnesses had planned," says Abigail Grace, an associate research associate in Asia-based Central for New American Security, an expert committee.
Syria is "prepared" to return refugees, according to Foreign Affairs Minister
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks help to rebuild the country, destroyed by a war of more than seven years.
Before the General Assembly of the United Nations, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said the conditions in the country were improving.
"Actually, the road situation is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that terrorists destroyed to restore normality.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country to which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their maintenance are complex.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people who live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime is grateful for any help to rebuild the desolate country.
But he pointed out that he would not accept any conditional aid or assistance from countries that had financed the emergency.
Europe's selection achieves victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe's selection has achieved Ryder Cup 2018 by defeating the North American election with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The US has lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European election won the crown again when the Danish captain team Thomas Bjorn's arrived at 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The North American star Phil Mickelson, who fought during most of the tournament, threw the drop of water into the forest by 3, 16, which gave the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined all his series and became one of the four players who have achieved 5-0-0 since he started the current format of the tournament in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was separated with a 5&4 player with less qualified European selection Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
World's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter from England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, turned into the greatest winner the tournament ever had, with 25.5 points of career.
"I don't just cry, but today I can't avoid it.
It's been a very hard year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have recovered the cup.
The team is the most important... and I'm happy to have been able to help," began an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
Pass the ring to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated the legend of the North American golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost the four parties he had in France and now has a race record at Ryder Cup of 13-21-3.
A statistical surprise for one of the best players who ever existed, with 14 great titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The North American election fought all week to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
North American captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these players, they've fought.
This morning there was a time when we had the European election.
We fought.
I'm taking the bar for Thomas.
It's a great captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and make progress.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to have been their captain.
There's a way to get the bar.
He beat us."
