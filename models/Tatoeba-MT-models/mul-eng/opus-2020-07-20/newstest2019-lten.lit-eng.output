On the first day, all the defendants were gathered at the same trial meeting of the MG Baltic case: Sarūnas Gustaninis, Gintars Steponavičius, Vytutas Gabšys, Eligius Masiulis and Raimandas Kurlianskis.
The hearing began with the testimony of the accused.
In the previous sitting of the Court, a new State appointed by Mr. Gustavi lawyer Aleksandra Dorošev told the Chamber of Justice that it was not yet possible to meet the matter.
At that time, Lawyer Linas Belevićius stated that in order to ensure the full defence of a person, the judicial college must allow a new lawyer to meet the subject of the case and ask him to terminate the trial.
"In order to ensure a person's defence, he must be familiar with the material of the criminal case.
This is not just a formal meeting," said L. Belevićius.
The new lawyer, A. Doroševa, pointed out that he did not expect to know either the alleged act or the whole matter.
Earlier, at the previous hearing of the court, the suspect Mr. Gustanins reported his lawyer's resignation, because he was unable to pay him.
The sitting also heard audio recordings.
Lawyers complain that the records of the hearings submitted to the court are of low quality.
The lawyer argues that politicians supported or initiated a series of favourable decisions in the Seima and other public authorities, and also had an impact on the decision-making of the public procurement winners, recall ELTA.
During the judicial investigation, more than 150 persons, more than 50 of whom were members of the Seimas, were interviewed by several former ministers, members of the European Parliament.
More than 200 interviews were conducted and more than 30 times.
It is estimated that Mr. Gustavis received more than 8 thousand euros, Mr. Steponavičius - 15 thousand euros, V. Gapšys - more than 27 thousand E. Massius is suspected to have received more than 106 thousand euros.
The Labour Party is accused of fraud and trafficking, the Liberal Union is accused of fraud, trafficking and abuse, and the MG Baltic is accused of buying and selling them.
It is suspected that the cheese policy is in consultation with the vice-president of the MG Baltic Group, R. Kurlianski, and later the Seime or other institutions have proposed or supported a favourable initiative for the Group.
Ethical surgeons: Board of the Liberals on the right to vote in the Vilnius chapter
"The decisions taken by the Board shall be in accordance with the statutes" - after the meeting of the Commission, BNS informed its Head, Mrs Vytutas Tamoszyun.
"Our decision was not something new.
The Commission's explanation was already made in July when the issue of Easter and Utuna was raised.
Then we said that under the statutes, this is a matter of government competence.
And if the board decides that a section can act as it wishes - to go with the committee and the board agrees with it, then the section can go, but if the board decides that it will all be a party list which the board has adopted, then it is the decision that all chapters form a party list.
And if there is no agreement with the Board, then there is a chance to stop membership and go with the committee," he added.
According to Mr Tamosjun, the Party's Board will now decide on further action.
On 17 October, the Board of the Liberal Union of the Party rejected the decision of the Vilnius City Division to participate in municipal elections, not with the party, but with a new list of the Committee on Elections.
In the view of the Board of the Party, the decision of the main liberals to participate in the elections in the form of a Social Election Committee violated the laws, decisions of the Board.
By 31 October, Vilnius had to withdraw its intention to participate in municipal elections with the Committee's list.
But the chapter didn't.
The former Head of the Section, the Austrian Parliament, has already withdrawn from the Liberian border.
The mayor of Vilnius, former president of the Liberal Union, Remigius Šimašius, was looking forward to the appointment of another head of leadership, has already presented the team and ideas of the Committee of Social Elections, "Vilnius, who will grow!".
He left the party too.
The elections of municipal councils and maritime councils will be held next year.
The inhabitants of the village in northern India took a train that had previously met a man and informed the officials on the first day.
The forest supervisor Mahaviras Kaujlagi (Mahavir Kaudjlagis) said that soon after a week’s work in the fields, he caught a neighboring bird and, after trying to break up, caught her by tractor.
People say it took about ten days to break down and crush one young man.
The village is located in the village of Dudhvos tigers in the district of Lakhympur Kherio, about 250 km south of the capital of Lakuna, the state of Uttar Pradesh.
They may be prohibited in protected areas.
Director of the Society Rameshas Pandey (Roman Pandjus) said that the case would be notified to the police under the Law on the Protection of Nature.
In April, the neighboring Nigasan region of the state of Uttar Pradesh was struck by another tiger, which suffered serious injuries.
The tiger is India’s national animal; under the Law on the Protection of Nature, it is considered to be an endangered species.
Last year's government data show that at least one person was killed every day during the three years of encounters with wild tigers or dragons.
People's conflicts with tigers have increased gradually since the 8th decade, when India began a security programme for tigers under which prisons were established in national parks, and the killing of large cats started to be considered a crime.
Although the methods of calculating tigers have changed, the census would show that the population of about 1,800 tigers increased to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
The proposed cat and dog must be marked with microschemes
The chairman of the Seima Environmental Protection Committee, Kästutis Smalla, together with other members of the Seima, recorded the amendments to the Animal Welfare and Protection Act, which offer cats and dogs to be marked by underground microschemes.
"We propose that cats and dogs should be marked with sub-microschemes and that local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service should be registered and marked.
In the year 2019, public funds will be free of charge for all birds, and in the year 2020, there will be also disasters, so there will be no concern for the population, and there will be no special coverage of state funding," said the chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Kästutis Mäžeika.
The legislative amendments aim to address the systematic need for the labelling of domestic animals.
It is expected that this will help to avoid problems caused by non-responsive animal producers, illegal wholesalers or sellers.
Preliminaries are estimated to be compensated to all animal family members during the transitional period according to the expected average cost of microscheme and service.
The total price of all animal breeding can reach up to EUR 6 million.
It is planned that these funds will be allocated within three years and will reach EUR 2 million each year.
It is expected that the labelling programmes will be allocated funds through a specific programme for the protection of the environment of municipalities, which will significantly increase their income during this year due to the increased distribution of natural resources and funds.
These funds will be used by municipalities not only for the marking of cats and dogs, but also for castrations and other programmes.
According to K. Mäžeikos, the mandatory labelling practice is widespread in almost all countries of the European Union, it allows for the protection of the animals themselves (unless it is easy to return their owners) and has saved the time of the farmers of the animals themselves, when there is a lot of time and resources to pursue the search for farming.
In addition, EU legislation provides that travel is possible only with marked growth.
At the same time, marking is a responsibility to care for the animal’s entire life.
The previous proposals had to be marked for acceptance, as the programmes concerned were proposed to finance the population's funds.
"The model now provided for this criticism should be avoided, as animal protection is proposed to finance increased income in the environmental support programme and the right to be marked not only for veterinary doctors but also for the public, i.e. for persons of animal welfare institutions who have heard special courses in the Veterinary Academy," the project authors say.
The draft of the Law was registered by a group of members of the Seeds representing the Seeds - Kęstutis Mžéika, Algimantas Dumbrova, Eugenius Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rome Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.

From the beginning, the series "Motherys worship better", then the show "Melages" and finally comes "Melagues".
In this film Brigita is playing a great woman of Danish Kazlausko hero.
"I loved the film "In Melagas," because I'm more an actor of the theatre and I've shown up Chinese very rarely.
A great team of colleagues has been gathering from the very beginning of the winner's excellent results.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
However, the most interesting thing that happened in the area was the dog of Sunny!
For the rest of my life, I thought if I had a dog, it would be really big and serious.
I've never enjoyed those small, decorative fiefs.
However, during the filming Sunny became so attached to me that the sympathy became mutual and finally I even persuaded her to buy it from her family but failed," said the actor.
A new Lithuanian comedy "Melagai", which has been produced by Lithuanian cinemas "Nessary" and "Tarp our boys..." by Paul Virbickas and the merchants Stasys Balticas and Vladimir Razarionovas.
Your favorite thing you've just reported is she's waiting.
It would be great to know, just... your lover is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
If you can't tell everyone the "good news," the parents don't expect to say - they're different!
After 50 years together...
And all of this happens before the most beautiful Christmas of the year - St. Christmas!
But the end will be even more surprising, for none of these atoms believed in them.
All the heroes are not the ones that appeared from the first glance...

Decision on the registration of EUR 100 million free of charge for immigrants
On Tuesday, Seima agreed to consider the amendment of the Law on the Place of Life by Ramón Karbauski, leader of the State.
56 members of the Seima voted, before - 9, and 25.
The Seimas will continue its consideration of the amendments on 6 December or later, pending the Government's conclusions.
According to Mr Karbauski, these payments are calculated for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to Parliamentary, in three years, one person does not pay about 1 thousand euros, and now there are about 100 thousand such persons.
Social Democrat Algirdas Sys said that in this way Seimas would "not hold back from duty" - to declare the departure and then no taxes would be counted.
A member of the Committee on Health observed that Lithuanians living abroad are using a small health insurance tax to treat them in Lithuania - they are provided with the same services as those who pay this tax to residents.
The corrections provide that those who leave Lithuania will be regarded as persons who will pay social insurance benefits in the European Union, the European Economic Area States or the Swiss Confederation and Sodra will be exempt from health insurance payments in Lithuania.
The leader of Sodros, Mindaugas Sinkevičius, has previously said that such a step will facilitate the lives of immigrant people and the activities of Sodros.
On-line video recording of a batting forest reveals a serious problem
Nufilated as the mother slammed into a flat glass of milk, and the baby is still lying on the floor and then re-copy again.
The image entry has generated a lot of reviews and comments.
The people were laughing at the return of a small locker - not once when it fell down, he fell back to his mother.
It is not the first time, but the young man does not try to give up and eventually achieves his goal.
The record of the vision is truly an eye - opener, but it also exposes the threat posed by humans to animals.
Scientists believe that it is important to talk about the need to know the nature of nature and that people may sometimes be harmful.
"I'm obviously very proud of the late queen.
From their movements they see they're panicking.
If the drones did not cross the environment, they would probably choose a safer route or a slower or more cautious effect.
This is an excellent example of how drones should not be used," says Ecologist Mark Ditmer.
Before long, Mr. Ditmer, together with his colleagues, studied how the drones operate.
The animal was adapted to the heart’s muscles.
When the dragon was caught, one of the dragons gave way to tears, the other ran away, but their whole heart began to weep more and more.
Scientists advise animals to use drones for responsible use, not to cross over, not to get upset, and not to jump where they are forbidden.
You asked the president to run through the paper
On the second day, the Kijevo court called on President Victor Janukovy to come to the trial on the ground of his alleged state-examination meeting - the appeal was announced in the State's official permit.
In the appeal of the Court, published in the Government's knowledge paper Uriadov kurier, the former leader was invited to attend a trial hearing held on 19 November, during which his final arguments could be heard.
The document states that V. Janukovyči has the right to participate in a video session.
On 30 October, the Kiev Court of Justice announced the final debate in the case of V. Janukovija.
A lawyer working in Russia, Aleksandr Gorošinski, was given the opportunity to register foreign lawyers by 19 November so that he could participate in a meeting where V. Janukovyči is expected to be connected with his last word.
The Kremlin, supported by V. Janukovyčius, was deported and fled to Russia during the 2014 Medana revolt, which was attempted by the President to sign association with the European Union Treaty.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former Ukrainian leader was exported to Russia through a special operation organised by Moscow.
That year, Russia approved the war on the Ukrainian peninsula, and as soon as the eastern part of the country, the war between the independent separationists of Kiev and Russia was fought.
Since then, some 10,000 lives have been lost, despite numerous attempts by the international community to ensure long - term ends.
List of conservators in Vilnius City Council all Valdas Benkunkas
The Conservatives' candidate has already been approved years ago by the former Minister of Agriculture, Parliamentary Danish Krewys.
On Monday, during the first elections of the conservators, the members of the party presented a list of candidates to the municipal council of Vilnius.
As reported by the Party, the leader of the Conservatives List became TS-LKD-Vilnia's Head of Association, V. Benkunskas.
In the first decade of the candidates, members of the municipal council of Vilnius visited Paulė Kuzmickienė, Adomas Buzinska, Gediminas Švilpa, Audrios Skistis, Rasa Baskienė, former member of the Seimos, Luutara Kazlavicka, President of the Youth Conservative Levels of Mantas Benkunkas, Arūnas Valinskas and Goda Karaziaitė.

Constituent limits on cogenerational forces against the Constitutional Court
The opposition of the Seima, as the author, appealed to the Constitutional Court (CT) to the rulings to adopt a law on the possibility of halting the construction of fire-fighting forces.
On Tuesday, the opposition group of the Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) of the Seimos Group reported that the Group invited the members of the Seimo to the CT, asking for a review of the compliance with the provisions of the Act of Procedure of the Governing Council.
"The Parliament underlines that the provisions of the law aim to call for the projects of the waste combustion plants currently under way, by ordering the Government to set new restrictions (20 km away from the residential area) before the entry into force of the legislation in Vilnius and Kauna," says the report.
"The Parliament notes that, in the light of the law's prohibition on the construction of waste management objects (i.e. the determination of a derogation and the definition of "living territory"), the conclusion is that the prohibition is disproportionately limited or even denied the right to carry out agricultural activities related to the production of waste in the form of waste energy, is essential, because the adoption of the criteria to form such an assessment of the density and distribution of the population of Lithuania would be virtually impossible in the entire territory of the country" - it adds.
The claim is that the law adopted is contrary to the constitutional principle of the state of law.
"KT has not yet been shown that the legislation does not apply to those legal facts and facts that have occurred before the new adoption of the Act.
In this case, the Government shall be empowered to apply the law again in accordance with undefined criteria.
When such a legal regulation violates constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal security, the protection of legitimate expectations, and thus the constitutional principle of the rule of law," the appeal is made.
It also notes that large financial investments have already been made in the projects of Vilnius and Kauna cogenerational forces.
With the constraints of the projects currently under way, the State would not only experience hundreds of millions of financial losses, major losses, and the inhabitants of Lithuania - increase the price of heating, resulting in an increase in environmental pollution in the volume of waste disposal.
The CT was signed by members of the Seimo TS-LKD, the Liberal Union, the Social Democrats Group and the senior members of the ruling Social Democrats working group, Algirdas Butkevićius.
A few weeks ago, Seimas was able to raise 71 votes in favour to reject the amendments of the Waste Management Act adopted by President Dalia Grybauskaitė, which provided for the Government's right to stop cogenerational power building, and also established 20 km from the living area of "karantino" for such power building.
The amendments to the Law adopted by the Seed will enter into force on 1 January 2019. The Court of Justice, which has already proposed the rejection of a 20 km limit.
This proposal is still to be considered at the Seima Green session.
However, the Government's right to stop the projects already under way is not planned.
The CT will deal with this case in a series of cases - not earlier than one year.

Grybauskaitė calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU business
President Dalia Grybauskaitė invites China to create a more favourable investment environment for investment in the European Union (EU) countries, to facilitate the conditions of foreign imports.
In opening the Chinese import show on trade and investment forum in Shanghai, Mr Grybauskaitė stressed that the overall objective of economic development should be to "unite efforts by halting the spread of protectionism in the world", based on the main causes of attacks on trade wars, "production surpluses and unfair competition".
"The European Union is very important for China's commitment to create a more attractive, open environment for investment - it is important to negotiate a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible by ensuring that foreign businesses feel secure here and by strengthening intellectual property protection," said Dr. Grybauskaitė.
According to them, the opening of China is important not only for Europe but also for this country as well as for global economic growth.
The head of Lithuania stressed that the transparency of investment must be "more than any business group's interests".
"The transparency, the superiority of laws, the strict adherence to international agreements - this must be a major part of the new investment relations environment," said Dr. Grybauskaitė.
"The corrupt capital flows should not be expected in any of the world's states - not just here or in our countries," she added.
China's imports are attempting to mitigate the criticism that it avoids opening up its market and only protects its businesses.
Several heads of State, more than 2800 companies from 130 countries and regions of the world, including Lithuania, are involved in trade.
According to the statistics of the Lithuanian Statistics Department, China is currently operating 25 locations between export partners.
Lithuania's exports to China last year grew by 50 per cent - that was worth 180 million euros.
At the same time, imports from China amounted to over EUR 820 million.
Some officials are not concerned that China's investment in Lithuania can have an adverse political impact, while Beijing's exclusive focus is on the EU's unity in Eastern Europe.
Inconsistencies: Mobile signature service is already running
The provider of the mobile letter shall inform the Estonian IT company "SK ID Solutions" that the expansion of the mobile writing system has been removed and the service acts as usual.
Mobilized signatures started again at 14.28 p.m.
The mobile writing system disappeared on Monday 9,52.
These efforts have been experienced by Tele2, Tele2 and Telia customers.
The reason for the "SK ID Solutions" disorder is identified, but it is not disclosed because of safety.
The company apologizes for the inconveniences experienced by consumers.
"SK ID Solutions" specializes in the field of international e-identification decisions.
These are Estonian State partners that issue certificates of national identity documents and give citizens of different countries the opportunity to join in electronic services and submit electronic signatures.
The SK ID Solutions provides nearly 1000 organisations providing financial, health care, education and other electronic services in the private and public sector.
More than two million end-users are used in the Baltic countries for "SK ID Solutions" services.
The reason for the disaster was explained by the "Lion Air": the deaths of the enemy.
The data from the Iron and Steel Box of the Iron and Steel Corps of the Indonesian Air Company show that during at least four recent flights, there has been a rapid deterioration in the work of measurement, the researchers reported the first day.
The president of the National Transport Safety Committee (NTSK) said that a similar route occurred during the last four flights, including a decisive flight to the Jakarta on 29 October when the storm hit the Javan Sea immediately after the departure from Jakarta.
All 189 people were killed during this disaster.
A number of media reports reported on delays during the previous flight of Boeing 737 MAX 8 from Denpasaro to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the black box - yes, indeed, the technical problem was a fast hour, that is, the speed of the plane," said S. Tjahyon at the press conference.
"The data from the Black Box showed that during two flights before the journey, Denpasar-Jákarta was also the same problem," he added.
"In social networks, there are many gaps.
Now we want to explain that in the black box (exclusive data) there are four flights in which there were problems with speed gain," the head of the NTSK said.
During a meeting with the members of the killed families, Mr Tjayon said that the information on the flight record was consistent with the reports that the speed and altitude of the final flight had changed dramatically.
The search command has not yet been found in the second black box recording conversations in the pilot's cabin.
"Lion Air" indicated that it was justified on the basis of the manufacturer's recommendations following a flight from Bali to Jákarta.
One company’s founder, Rusdi Kirana, had not been invited to speak to Minister of Communication, Budi Karyos Sumadi, who moderated the meeting of family members with officials, oversight of aircraft and victims’ search and disaster investigation.
However, he stood up and shook his head when the cheering and cheering family members claimed that R. Kirana, together with his brother Kusnan in 1999, would be built on Lion Air.
"Lion Air" was acting inappropriately," said one man, represented as passenger Shandy Johan Ramadhan, working on a prosecutor's island where the plane crashed.
"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention," he stressed.
Since the beginning of the crisis, Leon Air has never been in contact with me.
We didn't see our son, but Lion Air didn't tell us anything.
After this meeting, R. Kirana went to the meetings, avoiding journalists' questions.
Many families wait for long-term results of the process of recognition of the deceased.
The police medical experts were transferred to nearly 140 lavender bags, which were packed with parts of the people's support.
Only 14 victims have been identified so far.
The parents asked why it was allowed to fly during the 28th flight from Bali to Jákarta two months ago, even though an increase occurred during the October 28th flight from Bálio to Jákarta, in addition, following the landing of passengers at the train station.
"Lion Air" said this effort was removed.
Is it true that the problem was solved?
- If not, the relevant techniques must be taken into account.
The law was very clear, but they did not claim that the aircraft was allowed to be relocated.
These bad techniques must be answered by law so that aircraft disasters in Indonesia will not be repeated.
Mr. Tjayon said that the large quantity of small quantities of deposits and the fact that the deposits were low in a very small area showed that the anchor was the most active in the water by flying very fast.
"The plane was unique when it turned to the sea.
He didn't open his mouth, but the engine flew when he dropped the water, acted with a lot of noise - that shows all the disturbing thoughts," the officer explained.
"Lion Air" lineling is the largest aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997 when Garuda was hit by 234 people killed near Medano.
After the accident, rescuers were led by the accident: injured and incomplete
On Monday evening on the way to Väjaji - Plungė, Tilvikais met with cars "BMW" and "Marcedes-Benz".
Cars were hit by cataclysms, reports of three people injured.
It is reported that the BMW driver, born in 1999, took part in the opposite side of the road and gave a cataclysm to Mercedes-Benz, whose father was born in 1967 and daughter was born in 2005.
The "BMW" driver survived the fires - rescuers.
You're going from Mercedes-Benz to lose your teeth in the summer.
All those who have been hurt to get out of the hospital.
Presidency: there is no need to make any work-in-the-reference improvements
Following the adoption of a proposal by the rulers to reduce the referendum card to the first section of the Constitution which currently has greater protection, the vice-president of the veto, said her consultant Mindaugas Lingė.
"More than half of the citizens voted in favour of the Constitution - that is the requirement.
This and its change, in particular the articles in its first section , should certainly be at least a majority .
It is not difficult to warn that the President will be truly old," said the Dalia Grybauskaitė's consultant on Tuesday to the internal policy.
He stressed that the first section of the Constitution defines the basic subjects of the state - language, background, territory, capital, sovereign state, and therefore, by reducing the number of votes required for these articles, Mr Lingės, would create an "uninformable precedent" and an "unregulated risk".
"In the view of the President, there is no need for any labour facilitation, no more preparation for the referendum itself, no more dialogue with people," he hoped.
The Seimas intends to vote on Tuesday on the adoption of the amendment to the Referendum Act.
It provides for the adoption of a decision on higher protection in the first and fourth sections of the Constitution, provided that it supports at least two fifths of citizens entitled to elections.
At the present time, the first and fourth sections of the Constitution may be replaced by more than half of all citizens entitled to vote.
The right to elections in Lithuania has about 2.5 million citizens: half will be 1.25 million voters, two fifths - one million voters.
This proposal was born after September when Seimas approved the presidential veto on the amendments adopted in the previous Parliament, which satisfied the voting requirements for the change in the nationality defined in Article 12 of the Constitution.
The Charter of the referendum is proposed to reduce the preparation of a referendum on dual citizenship, it should be held on 12 May of the next year and on 26 May when the presidential elections are scheduled for the first and second round.
Emigrants, following the recovery of independence on 11 March 1990 at the present time, except for some exceptions, may not have dual citizenship.
The dual citizenship aims at the Lithuanian community of the world, but fears that there will be no referendums in the present context - that there will not be enough people to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports "frequency", so they need to be updated
The Lithuanian airport and road infrastructure is beginning to fail, so it needs to be updated, says Minister for Communications, Mr. Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renewal of Vilnius airport is a minimum task for the State to carry out.
"The air transport infrastructure is already broken because it has been planned for smaller passenger flows.
We have to update Vilnius Airport - it is not even suitable for further planning, it is a minimum what we have to do," said Mr Masiulis at the meeting of the Democratic Development Fund and the National Press conference on Tuesday.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be very important, as important projects will have to be implemented - the completion of the "Via Baltica", "Rail Baltica", built by Klaipeda's external port, the renewal of Vilnius and Kauna Airport, and perhaps the new airport.
"The next decade will be very important - we have to complete road integration, railway integration, external port construction in Klaipėda, the arrangement of airports, perhaps deciding on the construction of the new airport.
We must not sleep, but now start projects that will cost our potential after 10, 20 or 30 years," said the Minister of Communications.
Mr. Masiulis reiterated that the maintenance of cars has been limited in recent years.
"The condition of the roads is not right, because funds are insufficiently allocated.
We are able to build new roads, but even the most necessary oversight, such as in the Magistral Road, is lacking.
We have to determine the amount to be allocated to several oversights if we want their situation to improve," said Mr Masiulis.
He stressed that the exports of services in the Lithuanian transport sector increased by 18.6% this year, and the largest export market became Germany, surrounding Russia.
Mr Masiulis once again criticized the European Commission's proposal, under which EU carriers will be obliged to return stamps periodically to the country of registration.
"We must strive to make our exporters in Western Europe feel home.
In my opinion, the proposal for regular return to the village is absurd, as empty trucks carried in Europe would be burned to increase their emissions.
In most cases, rails are successful because the costs will increase so much that part of the transport will be transferred to railways.
We are looking for ways to cover our positions," said Mr. Masiulis.
According to data from the Ministry of Communication, 12.2% is created in the transport sector.
Common domestic product of Lithuania (BVP).
It employs more than 118,000 employees and operates more than 7,500 businesses.
Fights with breast-feeding
Last week, Mr Masiusius Seimo Economics' Committee reported on the beginning of negotiations on the cultural purpose of the cultural change of Vilnius airport building - this would allow the old terminal to be broken down and to build a new one.
However, the provisional head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD) called the discussions of Massius by political pressure.
According to him, the building built in the past six decades is a value, registered in 1993, not a policy, but a decision by specialists about its removal.
Mr Massius then commented that modern arrival terminals would contribute to improving Lithuania's image.
"From the heritage of this old terminal, it would be politically important to take this step so that we can seek it and build a new modern arrival terminal so that we can feel open in Vilnius in the modern country, rather than in such an interesting, really not representing our country as innovative," said Mr. Masiulis last week.
Mr. Masiulis then also reported that Kauna is planning to build a completely new passenger terminal and to connect the airport with the Railway Baltica cancer, building a underground station.
This transport should be carried out in 2026 after the end of the Real Baltica.
Pernai Vilnius Airport has served some 3.7 million people, 4.8 million passengers this year, and another 5 million.
The Kauna airport served 1.2 million passengers throughout the country.

The next year, Vilnius will start direct flights to Madagascar
The next summer, Vilnius airport will set off the largest regular flight "Boeing 767", which is the airport of Lithuania directly to Madagascar, based on the information portal "madeinvilnius.lt" by the travel organizer "Ita Lithuania".
It is announced that Blue panorama airlines will be able to select from 259 economic classes and 8 business venues.
The new destination will be reached directly from Lithuania since April 2019.
Dominica Milowskis, Director-General of Itaka Lithuania, says that tourists from Lithuania are trying to offer all new vacations.

New holiday destinations were prepared for the summer season in 2019 by other travel organizers.
For example, "Novaturas" and "Itaka" will start directly from Vilnius to fly to Tirana (Albania).
Minister of Finance on the possible crisis: the importance of avoiding diseases
"For more time, we always have to prepare.
What I would like to say is that for the first time in the history of Lithuania in the third year, we are collecting reservations.
But also a very important thing is not to commit to disease," said V. Shapako on the first day in Brussels.
Elta recalls that the first and second days of the Minister of Finance and Deputy Minister of Finance Miguel Tuskienė in Brussels participates in the meetings of the Euro Group and the EU Economic and Financial Council (ECOFIN).
The ECOFIN meeting will discuss issues relating to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax is aimed at avoiding the fragmentation of the EU common market, as part of the Member States have already introduced or intends to introduce a certain tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed to agree on how to obtain tax revenue for certain digital services in the EU Member States before there is a global agreement.
The euro group will consider the draft budgets submitted to the European Commission (EC) for the euro area countries.
On 23 October the EC rejected the draft Italian budget as incompatible with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time the EC has taken advantage of this envisaged option.
More information was requested in Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain.
The Euro Group will also discuss the issues of economic and monetary union enlargement: the implementation of the European deposit insurance system and the reform of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania maintains a stronger role for the ESM in financial support programmes, but it is considered that the ESM functions must be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of the functions of the ESM and other EU institutions.
Ballys Buračas.
Lithuanian work traditions and customs
He was recently born 120 years after the famous Lithuanian photographer and culture metristine, ethnographer and landscaper Balio Burač (1897-1972) in Sidari, the state of Šiaulian, in that year in the Government of Šiauli.
Speaking of the 100-year-old jubilee of the state of Lithuania, we have good reason to remember how life-threatening national rebirth has called on many Lithuanian people, including their brothers Buraç - Bala, Jona, Bronio - from the village itself, to involve all creative opportunities in our culture's well-being, understanding and preservation.
Balis Buračas, after more than 50 years of travel after the birth of the country with the camera in his hands, presented a wide and real picture of our country's customs, traditions, people's art and material culture.
He sought to preserve rapidly emerging national cultural barriers and had a rare ability to understand the value of his work.
In the photos of Balio Buračo, Lithuania's landscape, the city halls, daily and holy surroundings, our people's national costumes have enjoyed the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines.
This authorisation provides for a number of parts of the Bali Burač's stay for the description of the national jobs and related traditions and, most importantly, their attractive iconography.
The material is presented not only in these traditions but also in our civilization’s progress over the past century, despite two world wars and difficult occupations.
In the book's book, we have a great deal of information about the works of the inhabitants of Germany, particularly the buyers, the north, the coastal villages, as well as the work of the peoples of Austria and Turkey, their churches and other traditions, and their own descriptions of Bali Burach.
Some 10,000 negative remains have been selected for this publication over 400 times from museums and archives, most of which have not yet been published, which have been collected in accordance with selected texts.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture, such as buyers, pigs, other regions of Austria and Germany.
The suspect escaped from the police car in the panic left for 4 hours.
As a young man (in 1994) was able to drive out of the office car, the officers were not able to tell him.
He was taken to the castle in an attempt to defend himself.
About 16 hours, the police distributed a photo of the escape and called on the public for assistance: "From the flight of the car at the service station, it is suspected to be a Russianman, Dalius Malakuskas, in 1994.
The man ran away with his pants.
If you have observed this person, please inform tel. 112 or 8700 60,000.

Tragic wall survival: killed only after a few hours
In southern Texas, the U.S. youth leader was killed only a few hours ago during the terrorist disaster.
24-year-old William Troy's Bylers and his wife, Bailey Raye Ackerman Byler, killed on Sunday shortly after midnight after entering the village 16 km north of July and 129 km west of San Antonio, local judge Steven Kennedy said.
It turns out that the accident took place some 20 miles [24 km] away, as far as the youths were concerned.
A 76-year-old pilot, Gerald Douglas Lawrence, also killed.
Newspapers were being studied at Samo Houston State University, located in the city of Huntsville, Texas.
They met on the sixth day of the evening in the family’s hand near the Kingdom Hall, and after the wedding, a fireman who belonged to the family came out.
The accident occurred after the explosion of about 24 kilometres.
The young people fled to the international airport of St. Antonia, where they were going to fly and fly for a month, said S. Kennedy, not referring to the destination of the final bridge.
"It's a very long, unfathomable place, and that language is about 120-150 meters high," said S. Kennedy.
Mr. Lawrence has been piloting those family planes for many years.
According to S. Kennedy, he was piloting the rockets and serving Vietnam.
After the autopsy, it should be clear what the physical condition of the pilot was and whether it could not be caused by disasters.
The syringe was suspended about 5-10 minutes after the injection.
Its impact is spread across the valley of the valley, and the body remains "hazardous" on the first day of the press conference, said researcher Craig Hatchas of the National Transport Safety Board (NTSB).
The researchers were trying to get rid of the delays and then to look at them carefully, but it would not be easy for the wolf and the carriage to reach that place, he said.
The reasons for the disaster have not been established and the preliminary NTSB report should be published in two weeks.
Israel's prime minister calls Iran's entry into force "historical day"
"Today is a historic day," said B. Netanyahu to Members of his party "Licud", his office reported.
"Today is the day when, under the leadership of the President (Donald) Trumpu (Donaldu Trampui), the United States imposes a particularly severe sanctions on Iran, the most severe sanctions on Iran during the entire period when efforts to suppress its aggression have been made," the Israeli government leader said.
Earlier on the first day, Israel's Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman (Avigdor Lyberman) said that the new sanctions would be imposed on the "equipped" force of Israeli actions in the region.
The measures, which Washington calls "the most severe sanctions of all time", began to apply after the month of May, in which Dr. Trumpo decided to withdraw from the global agreement with Tehran on his nuclear programme.
Sanctions aim to significantly reduce Iran's oil exports, which have already dropped about a million barrels a day since May, and to turn Tehran from international funding.
The ancient Israelites did not agree with the said agreement with Iran and said that its scope and deadlines were too limited.
The Jewish State also claims that the abolition of sanctions has made it possible for Iran to finance combat groups and their own military activities.
Israel is not particularly concerned about the actions of Iran’s neighboring Syria, and he promises not to allow it to be established in the military.
Other agreements with Iran's participants - Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - do not support the US decision and say that the agreement, as it has been envisaged, has not yet allowed Iran to acquire nuclear weapons.
The Court reiterates the circumstances of the young motorcycle driver's death
The death of a young motorcycle driver in Vilnius, the city of the North, will be heard by the court in the case of an accident.
On the second day, the Vilnius Court decided that in order to clarify all the relevant circumstances of the case, one witness would be interviewed at the next meeting on 26 November.
In this case, a judicial decision has already been issued, but the prosecutor does not agree with it.
On June 22nd, the city’s district court, in view of the destruction of the motorcycling accident, executed a car driver, announced by 79-year-old Edward Osipov that the motorcycling in the city was driving too fast and made serious damage.
The District Court of Vilnius asks the District Court to remove the decision of the District Court and argues that because of the accident, the highest level of concern is E. Osipovu and the findings of the District Court are not justified.
Cancel a legal ruling by a family lawyer of the requested and killed motorcycle owner.
Avaria took place on 11 August 2015 about 15 hours after E. Osipovo drove the car " Škoda Fabia" from Lakūnų street to Zirmūn's road and met with the main bike.
The prosecutor accused the driver of violating the road traffic rules and caused the traffic incident - the man who was killed on the main road by the motorcycle "Piaaggo".
The first police reports indicate that the driver of the engine was killed, but later after the investigation, it was found that the vehicle is comparable to the motor vehicle as far as possible.
Judge Roland Businskas BNS, the city’s district judge, has said that experts have found that the motorcycle driver traveled 89.2 kilometers per hour, although it is allowed to speed up to 50 km per hour.
"The driver of the car couldn't predict that the motorcycle would be driving so fast," the lawyer said.
At that time, an old car driver stopped driving just five to six miles [5 to 6 km] an hour.
The driver of the motorcycle was trying to stop and get off the vehicle before he got involved with "Skoda Fabia".
The prosecutor believes that E. Osipovas had to give a ride from the highway to the main road.

The share of money for the parties to the SRC, but the social workers will not pay anything
The Chief Electoral Commission (ECSC) intends to allocate nearly EUR 3 million of the budget to the largest political parties this week.
This spring, the ruling party of the Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDDP), led by Parliament's Vice-President Gedimino Kirkilo, was set up to provide funds for the budget.
However, they may be already subject to a separate decision by the SCR in the event of a change in the legal environment governing the distribution of grants to parties.
Laura Matjošaityte, President of the SR, informed the GZ that "the Commission's meeting on this Thursday intends to take a decision on the allocation of the budget for the parties to the allocation of the budget for the year".
According to them, the decision on this matter must be taken by the CRA by 15 November.
The allocation of EUR 2,751 million is intended for seven parties, six of whom are parliamentarians.
The opposition-Lithuania Christian Democrats should receive more than EUR 0.66 million, the ruling states and the Green Unions - about EUR 0.55 million, the opposition social Democrats parties - about EUR 0.5 million, the opposition liberals - about EUR 0.4 million, the Seimes non-members of their groups - about EUR 0.23 million, recently associated with the ruling parties - about EUR 0.22 million, represented by Parliament, but not the opposition associations of the Polish-Christian families - about EUR 0.18 million.
In accordance with the current law, which has also led the WRK to allocate budget money, grants shall be allocated to parties which meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of the votes in the last Seima, municipal councils and European Parliament elections.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not only allow the LSDDP to expect money from the budget this spring.
This party has not yet participated in any single elections.
It is true that the ruling coalition seeks to amend the law so that social workers will receive at least one hundred thousand euros in the next three elections - municipalities, presidents and the European Parliament.
The amendment to the laws of the political parties and the budget for this year was adopted by the relevant Seima President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The summit has not yet been decided on this issue, but the ruling representatives, Mr. Church and the Head of State of the Greens, Ramón Karbauskis, hope that parliamentarians will be able to reject the opposition of the President.
However, it will not be possible to do so until this Thursday WRK meeting, so, as Mr Matjošaitytės said, "the grants will be distributed in accordance with the existing legal procedure".
In fact, the Executive Director of the CRA did not deny that, if the Seimas would reject the president's veto this week and the new corrections to budget allocations parties could be considered by the Commission on the allocation of additional grants to individual political forces, including the LSDDP.
"In the decision we will take into account the current legal environment, as we are the implementing authority to implement the laws adopted," she said.
If the Seimas were able to reject vetos and new laws, the Government would, in accordance with their additional money to the parties, grant the corresponding amounts in addition.
The grant already granted to the seven parties for such a decision would not be granted.

Advertiser: Activist Handziq's murder warrants must be punished
"I want to say that there is no one version - and today they are no longer than 20 - will be rejected.
Each will be thoroughly checked in accordance with the investigation procedures.
As President, I do not have the opportunity and I do not have to get information that could harm the investigation.
However, the government must ensure transparency and the law enforcement authorities must work effectively.
Only so can we know the truth and punish evil," said Mr. Poroschenka at a meeting with a young Tuesday in Kiev.
He stressed that he was most interested in explaining that Mr. Handzik's murder would be explained, and witnesses, crime organizers and orders "would take the necessary responsibility".
"After this case has been requalified to the murder (the case), they will be fully and reasonably punished until the life sentence is passed," the Ukrainian president said.
He rightly addressed the public's demand for open and impartial investigation of this case.
Mr Proschenka stressed that the statements of representatives of law enforcement authorities in Parliament should show that "the government is firmly committed to attracting criminals and criminals with responsibility for what they do not have".
He also said that political speculations would not explain the situation and would be even more disturbing.
"I call on all, and the government, and the forces supporting the opposition, not to raise unreasonable arguments and, fight God, not to use this killing for public relations," said the president.
- On the contrary, now we need to unite and ensure that the study is effective, accurate and clear, fast - in order to build confidence in the public.
We just don't have another way."
"No one will be allowed to use this situation to destabilize the country," he said.
A month before the collapse, K. Handziq was burned and burned with acid in the city of Cherson.
She was the mayor of this southern Ukrainian city.
After the abortion, the woman was hospitalized but died the next day in the hospital.
The police and prosecutors were not informed by the prosecutors of this explosion, the Ukrainian Attorney General Jurius Lucenka made a statement of resignation on Tuesday.
After her death, the authorities accused the public activists of not being able to carry out the investigation properly.
Actively, the Minister of the Prosecutor-General and the Minister of the Interior was also required.
"Today I will present a statement of my resignation," reported J. Lucenka to the Members of Parliament, reading his research report.
Parliament must also accept the re-establishment of the prosecution.
Mr Lucenka accused the activists that they were under pressure to investigate and provide important information, and therefore it was difficult to identify the perpetrators of the murder of K. Handziuk.
Bill Gates offered the toilet without water
With the introduction of a futuristic toilet, Bill Gates has moved from traditional facilities to the waterless level with the revolution of computers of the past eight decades.
In the exhibition of "Miss" by Bill Gates, Pekine presented a high-tech toilet that does not need water pipes, reported Reuters.
The toilet works without water in accordance with the principle of separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of waste types are processed into chemicals.
"The technologies you see here are the greatest achievements in the area of sanitation over the past 200 years," Bill Gates quoted "Bloomberg".
The technical toilet was created with funds from the charity fund established by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
Over the seven years, the fund spent 200 million dollars on a facility that could convert human waste into waste or water.
In fact, in Bill Gates' words, about 20 toilet models were created.
The device is now finished and can be sold.
However, in order for such toilets to be produced in a mass manner, the Gates Fund is ready to issue another 200 million.
According to the Food Fund, 500 thousand children under five years of age die each year from poor health conditions in the world.
The fight against poor sanitation issues such as cholera and others increases health protection funds that already amount to 233 billion.
In order to better illustrate the health situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates presented the toilet glass with fecals.
According to him, this is a good reminder that in a small example, "there may be 200 trillion rotavir cells, 200 thousand bacteria causing infection, 100 thousand parasites of parasites".
S. Slyva elected President of the Association of Motor Football
On 5 November, Kaunas held an informal meeting of the Lithuanian Association of Mass Football, in which the new president of the organisation was elected Sergey Slyva.
As a result of the request by Anatolyus Stecenko to be removed from the office of the president of the association, an informal general meeting of the members of the association was called.
It was attended by 13 members of the 15th class.

Anxiety in France: People's Deaths · Global Voices
On the first day, the French health guard announced a long-term ban on the use of pesticide, causing concern for several people who had been murdered in the western part of the country in the last decade.
The health protection agency ANSES announced that the decision to prohibit all products with a pesticide metastam was taken after a new safety check initiated earlier this year, even before at least three September's incinerations started at the Mino and Luar's department.
In these cases, the government has already stopped the use of pesticides.
This soil disinfection chemicals should not be associated with plants or agricultural workers.
In order to be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France, it was used about 700 tonnes per year.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, are raised in the Andes region, where many of the islanders are raised, are crying with eyes and throat beatings, breathing problems.
"These episodes confirm the fairness of our decision, but do not confuse it," said the deputy director of the ANSES, Francoise Weber (France Weber) on the first day of the newspaper "Ouest France".
The year - one of the most commonly used pesticides in the United States and Europe - the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USE) is called "expected cancer".
This pesticide, sold as "Vapam" and "Sectagon", is authorised in Europe until 2022 when a new security check is to be carried out.
"There was no other choice but to remove it from the market, regardless of whether it is an alternative," said F. Weber in that paper.
"I wonder what challenges the islanders will face, together with farmers, but society's health is more important," she said.
Farmers have already faced a failure to stop the use of the meta-medium in the region, which is largely dependent on intensive agriculture.
More than half of the 35 000 tonnes of satellite sultans used in Europe each year are growing in this region.
The next season will be "a lot of less satellites, giants and pairs", a month after the government stopped using the meta, AFP said to Philippe Retieras, head of the Federation of Plants of Nanto, Philippe Retieras (Philippas Retjeras).
Talin invested 70 million euros in the trading centre with a review wheel
A new trading centre "T1" is opened in Estonia next week, to which the local capital development company Pro Capital Group invested EUR 70 million.
A total of 130.000 sq.m, or 55,000 sq.m., will be held at the centre of the area’s sale of 150 shops or shops, with more than 30 cabins and restaurants, positive in the development report.
By comparison, Vilnius Acropolis's total area (including the offices with the area) is approximately 110,000 sq.m. and is rented - 91,000 sq.m.
"T1" is the first trading centre with a view wheel installed on the warehouse, a positive developer.
It will start at the beginning of the next year.
In addition, international transport ports will also be integrated into the territory: soon there will be trams, short-term intermodal buses.
Netoliese also prints the basic "Rail Baltica" terminal, which is expected to serve about 1 million passengers every year in 2026.
Paula Michelozi, Director-General of the Pro Capital Group, says that major changes are taking place in the world trading centres, and the development of the T1 has led to a rise in opposition to them.
"We have created a new trading centre that provides emotions and experience that is not accessible on the Internet.
This is the place of public train in the city centre itself, the passenger doors, an impressive and valuable tourist object and the same quality time spent with friends or family," says Dr. Michelozi.
The main focus of the industry
According to the trading centre manager, T1 also has the largest shopping and finding centre in the Baltic countries.
A total of 12,000 kv.m. or a fifth of the total rent area shall be allocated to the whole property.
The exclusive accent is the view wheel installed on the roof.
He will visit up to 120 m above sea level - Talin is only a TV tower.
After the review, on the fourth floor, the "Super Skypark" button park will be opened here, opening the largest button centre in Europe and the first corner and network on the button screen in Estonia, says the company.
The interactive SkyLAB study and finding centre requires children to be employed for at least 5-6 hours.
A 360-degree panoramic 4D chain is installed in the mill complex.
In addition to the usual cinema shown in six rooms, visitors will be able to enter and enter virtual reality cinema with an interactive 7D cinema.
Greta visual effects and movements by film rhythms will strengthen the sense of certainty here, together with the effects of wind, noise or snow, as well as the choice of smell, smoke or smoke in the movie room.
According to the developer, the opening of T1 is expected to increase Estonia's tourism revenue by EUR 13 million per year, attracting more than 300,000 visitors.
Pro Capital Group is listed in Nasdaq Baltic Sea and Frankfurt Sea.
Last year the group received €1.8 million for sales in Lithuania experienced EUR 350,000 losses, a financial report from the Pro Capital Group shows.
In 2016 almost EUR 9 million was sold on the Lithuanian market and a net profit of EUR 2.4 million was earned.
The trading centre "T1" was built by the Estonian company Marko Ehitus.
President Paul Biya, Vice-President of the Chamber, following a controversial election
P. Biya promised to protect the unity and unity of the West African state during the 85-year-old Cavaye Yeguie Gibril's presidency.
The oldest African President, who has ruled his country for 35 years, has been published in the final elections on 7 October, with 71 per cent of the vote.
However, the elections were limited to the activity of the voters, violence and suspected fraud.
P. Biyos inaugural districts of 79 students and three school staff, including the directors, were trained in one Presbyterian school in the North-West region, where the English language separately carried out an armed campaign for independence.
The majority of Cameroon’s 22 million inhabitants are French and the fifth is English.
In the 2016 years in the North-West and the neighboring province of South-West and South-West, the result of the alleged discrimination in the fields of education, justice and economics began to require autonomy.
In 2017, P. Biya withdrew radically from consenting to release the independent State, the Republic of the Amazon, and set up arms.
According to data from non-governmental organisations, the attacks by the separatists and the government's responsible operations this year killed at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security personnel.
More than 300 thousand people fled from violence: some - across the border to Nigeria, but many forced them to live in half a forest.
In the North-West region, the elections were held in a total of only 5% of voters, and 15% of voters were elected in the Province of South-West.
In both parts of the country, P. Biya gathered two thirds of the votes.
Conservative primary selections: error source failure
"When there is a lack of places - understand that the party in its resources has organized everything.
Some municipalities allowed them to use their premises, but not all of them were the voting booths, because we can't buy them themselves.
Thank you for the loan," the politicians said.
In his view, complaints have been filed, but their content is essentially unchanged, and the same violations are not of a pacifical nature.
"The culprits were.
Not all the people who participated in the elections were experienced - they were also new.
Thus, not all the actions of the non-examination were in line with our procedures.
It was therefore necessary to warn the CR to comply with the principles we described.
These complaints are not at all justified in questioning the results," said A. Anushauskas.
According to the President of the CCRC, cases have been raised when voting ballots have not been published - after learning of this, the ballots have been cancelled.
In some cities there are few places, but according to A. Anušausko, complaints and violations related to several decades of billiards.
"Well, since there are several thousand differences, this is certainly not the result of the main differences in elections," explained A. Anuchauskas.
It is claimed that the activity of the party members in the elections was 55 per cent, whereas the activity of non-participating voters was 69 per cent.
Both candidates had 400 observers, and 600 people worked in commissions.
The results published on Sunday also remain unchanged - 79% of the voters voted for the successful Ingrid Shimonytė, while 21% (441 votes).
On 17 November, the TS-LKD Council will officially support the candidate I. Símonytė in the elections of the President of the country in May next year.
Trupas said he'd probably never get in touch with Putin in Paris.
The White House National Security Adviser John Bolton previously said that Dr. Trumpas would meet with V. Putin in Paris this week, where the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I will be held.
However, during the last round of the United States Congress elections, Dr. Trumpas asked journalists to make sure that this would be a good opportunity to meet with the Russian President.
"I'm not sure we'll meet in Paris.
Probably not," said the president of the United States.
However, the head of the White House was added to the meeting of the G-20 summit and "probably many times" thereafter.
D. Trumpas continues to "overload" relations with Moscow, despite the allegations that Russia is joining the US presidential elections in 2016.
Injury Strupas requests the decision of the VTEK to be repealed
The former Director-General of the Santar Clinics of the University of Vilnius, Kästutis Strupas, asked to repeal the decision of the Chief Service Ethics Commission (VTEC) - recognised him as the time for non-declaration of transactions and thus a violation of the law.
Mr Strupo's complaint was examined by the administrative court of Vilnius on Tuesday.
This Decision shall be published in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
The applicant requests that the decision of 23 May be repealed by VTEK, the BNS rapporteur, representative of the Court of Justice, Sigita Jacinevićienė Baltadonė.
Mr Strup, I believe that the grant granted to our neighbours must not be declared as such after having understood the exception of the law.
In May, VTEK announced that the Director-General of Santar’s Clinics, K. Strupas and the head of the Department of the University of Vilnius Hospital Rehabilitation, was removed by Silvia Strupija, who violated the provisions of the law governing the declaration of private interests.
In the investigation, it was found that in the absence of the time-limits, four transactions were declared: loans from the bank in 2010 with a contract from the bank, acquisition of securities from the bank in 2017, a grant from the bank in 2017 and a loan granted in 1996 and a loan not recovered from the contract for the natural person.
S. Strupienja also declared these transactions by passing the terms.
Persons may not be encouraged during the year following the infringement of the Law on the Coordination of Public and Private Interests in the State Service.
The law is obliged to declare not only its own, but also its marriage data.
VTEK conducted an investigation on the basis of information on Info TV.
As explained by Mr Strup and his fiancée, the Department of the University of Vilnius Hospital Rehabilitation conducted S. Strupienė's Department of Public Hospital Rehabilitation, where he declared his transactions in good time.
As Info TV announced, in the past K. Strupa gave his daughter the real estate worth of 125 thousand euros.
However, the head of Santar’s clinic and his wife had not been mentioned in their declarations of interest.
Lawyer K. Strup together with at least ten more persons have applied for allegations of corruption in the investigation - on the basis of legal protection, for the benefit of public computers, the purchase of software in the clinics of companies, which is hired as support.
In this way, K. Strupas is suspected to be active at least five times, in the Santarium clinics for public procurement in the field of information technology.
Even K. Strupa's love is negative.
Corruption is suspected by Professor K. Strupas in September was released from the duties of the director of the Santar Hospital.
The decision of the Ministry of Health and Vilnius University of Santar’s clinical participants to terminate working relations with K. Struptos on his own request.
He has been head of the hospital since 10 November 2013.
The Santar clinics continue to run Professor Juozas Raistenski on a temporary basis until the invitation to a new Director-General is made to publish it this year.

You already want to learn another language in school: asking for fewer tests, more practice
Such changes to the content of education are planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, which will be presented in Vilnius on the first day of the Forum on the "Citizen content change: foreign experience for decisions in Lithuania".
In the debate, the Minister for Education and Science Jourita Petrauskien said that over the past ten years, the content of education has been renewed over EUR 30 million, but the results have not been seen.
"In the light of the results of the international research on scientific achievements, the achievements of researchers are below the average of the OECD countries," said Jurigita Petrauskienė, Minister for Education and Science.
In a report from the Ministry of Education and Science, EBPO expert Phil Lambertas (Philas Lambertas) said that Lithuania was too focused on the provision of knowledge rather than on the practical adaptation of knowledge.
According to him, the common education programmes in Lithuania pay much attention to the literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility of students, but also to the creativity, business, financial literacy, empathy.
Minister for Education and Science Gražvydas Kazakevići, offering changes to the content of general education, said that, starting in this year of research, the scope of programmes will be smaller, more concrete, more closely interlinked.
According to the Deputy Minister of Education, education will become more individualized, schools will be more self-sustained - they will be allowed to prepare from 10 to 30 per cent of their unique educational content, the current educational evaluation system will change into a comprehensive budget, higher burden on skills and informally acquired educational skills.
Small standardised tests.
It is expected that the general education programmes will be digital, user-friendly, linked to the resources allocated to the bank.
The objective of updating the content of education is to improve academic achievements in the international PISA study by at least 10 per cent, to reduce the gap between academic achievement and current competences in school.
Lithuania has been planning to update its capacity for May 2018 to allocate the amount of EUR 7.8 million to the European Union and the State budget.
It is expected that the project of the general education programmes updated in the year 2019-2020 will be tested in part of the schools and will begin to be implemented in all schools from September 2021.
At the beginning of October, the Ministry received criticisms on the implementation of an almost EUR 8 million project aimed at updating the common programmes for initial, basic and medium-sized education.
The first purchase of EUR 1.3 million was announced in early October for the four years to be intended for the purpose of EUR 7.8 million.
After criticising this purchase, he was suspended, Minister of Education and Science J.Petrauskien delivered his office to the Directors of the Development Centre for Growth.
In Lithuania - training to respond to extreme flooding
In Lithuania the first day begins a ten-day extension to improve the response of the authorities to the extreme water supply.
As reported by the Anti-Fraud Protection and Rescue Department (PAGD), in practice, it will be verified how State authorities are ready to work in the country to announce the state-level extreme situation, such as the flood, to eliminate its causes, to coordinate the search for, rescue and emergency release from the covered areas, to organize their supply with drinking water, food, to ensure the necessary supply of energy and to provide other protection measures for the population.

On 5-13 November, a practical phase will be drawn up, while municipalities receiving information from the PAGD on non-hazardous criteria and starting water will take decisions on the management of the extreme situation.
The active exercise phase is planned on 14-15 days of November.
The Department will operate the state emergency operation centre, and the state and municipal authorities will be the operational centres of the institutions' external situations.
The Government shall be informed of the extreme situation at the State level concerning the effects of the floods, the head of operations appointed by the Prime Minister for the eradication of the extreme situation, the elimination of its effects, the protection of residents and property and the rescue actions.
PAGD Deputy Director Mindaugas Kanapickas said that in the course of the extension, it is important to check the preparation of the institutions for carrying out the functions provided for in the legislation, to assess the possibilities of exchanging information, to verify how the disaster is prepared to warn and inform residents, public and municipal institutions, institutions and businesses and "to improve the skills of the management of the external situations of public institutions".
The training will also demonstrate the capacity of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian fire-saving survivors to pump large quantities of water from the covered areas.

Assistant of the Ukrainian Attorney General Jurijus Lucenka
On Tuesday, the Ukrainian Attorney General Jurius Lucenka announced in Parliament a reconnaissance statement that caused the acidic fight against corruption by Katerinos Gandziuk, announced by the Ukrainian news agency Union.net.
In accordance with Ukrainian law, the Attorney-General must submit the motion for a reinstatement to the President of the country, and this is to provide the Supreme Council with a majority of votes.
The second day, the Attorney General, J. Lucenko, presented the case and the results of a legal investigation on the commission of the murder of Mr. Gandziuk in the Supreme Council.
In his speech, he described the study as effective, but expressed confidence that Mr Gandhiuk's death is being used in policy for public relations.
Mr Gandziuk was a Ukrainian activist who fought against corruption, speaking publicly about police corruption in her hometown of southern Ukraine in Cherson.
On 31 July, an unknown burial site near her home was K. Gandziuk in the form of a sleigher’s acid.
She died in the hospital on 4 November due to the injuries experienced.
The protests to the Ministry of the Interior of Ukraine require an answer that killed K. Gandziuk, AFP/Scanpix nod.
According to J. Lucenko, the legal case raises the possibility of 12 persons involved in the murder order of Mr. Gandziuk.
However, one of the most expected research versions has been published, and this poses a threat to the success of the study.
According to the Prosecutor-General, the suspects received basic information as a result of the disclosure of the information.
Mr. Lucenko added personal knowledge to Mr. Gandziuk and will be convinced that some politicians use his blood for public relations.
"In order that no one should be justified in saying that someone has committed an offence to the authorities, I would like to state that I have made a statement to restore it.
I will present it to the President of Ukraine today and you in Parliament will have to discuss this issue," Mr Lucenko said in the Council quoted the publication "Obozrevatel".
It is written that Mr. Lucenko added that "no two-year-olds will be allowed in the country when the legal system is destroyed without any evidence, even for the crimes revealed."
J. Lucenko is regarded as an artificial by Peter Prorošenko, President of the country.
On 12 May 2016, the Prosecutor-General was appointed to remove his predecessor from this post, the accused Victor Scotch, who was suspected of committing corruption at the level of officials and politicians.
Minister for Energy Mr Vaiczyūn meets with representatives of "Orlen Lietuva"
As Energy Minister Aurelia Vernickaitė informed Elta, the meeting will discuss the achievement of the objectives of renewable energy resources in the transport sector by 2020 and after 2020.
According to the European Commission (EC) data, transport is the only sector that currently does not meet the EU level of trajectories provided for in the national renewable energy action plans, which accounted for 6% of renewable energy in 2015.
The EC's assessment of progress towards a 10% target in the transport sector is very slow due to the various difficulties, including the relatively high costs of greenhouse gas reduction and the unexplained regulation.
Renewable energy in this sector is mainly derived from biofuels (88%), while electricity is less important at this stage.
The company has taken up the issue of the issue of the issue of corruption investigation to complement the call by the conservators to the CT
On the second day following the submission, the Seima agreed with the proposal recorded by Agnė Širinskienė for the study on the illegal impact of political processes.

Following its conclusion, a vote will be taken on the adoption of the amendment.
A new political corruption study is currently being conducted to explain the possible illegal impact of the Seima interim investigation commission in 2008-2016.
A. Širinskienė proposed extending this term by stating that "a significant information in the public area has shown a possible negative impact and impact on political processes and public authorities".
A. Zirinskienė is listed in the project as "a possible representation of the interests of pension funds in the legislative process or calling on the Constitutional Court or attempts to influence decisions by the relevant independent institutions such as the Chief Service Ethics Commission".
The Constitutional Court on the Initiation of Pensions was brought to the attention of the opposition conservators.
The governments of the "states" explained that the conservators called on them to support a large part of the arguments of private pension funds lawyers.
With the impact of the Head of State Ethics Commission (VTEK), the leaders of the 'States' claim that Paul Urbš has been a very common figure.
According to them, the former Chairman of the Committee on State Administration and Municipalities of the Seimas was able to refer to the members of the WTO to the former head of the Commission's Prevention Section, Mindaguas Siaur.
At the end of September, the Seimas made the Commission understand the possible illegal impact of interested persons or their groups on the formation of elections, the formation of coalitions, the work of the parliamentary groups, the work of individual policies, the activities of parties and social movements, the financing of legislative processes, public administrations, heads of public institutions, management or supervisory bodies.
It is also proposed to consider the information provided by law enforcement and surveillance authorities to the competent authorities as they have responded to it.
The researchers should submit their conclusions by 1 May of the following year.
There will be a president, the European Parliament election campaign.
Seven of the 12 members of the Commission are representatives of "States".
Its members are also appointed two social workers, after one "regulatory", liberal and representative of the Lithuanian Polish-Christian family union.
Conservatives and social Democrats refused to participate in the work of the Commission.
The new investigation was initiated by Ramón Karbauski, President of the Lithuanian State and the Green Union.
In his view, the study carried out at the last session of the National Security and Defence Committee (NSC) was essentially due to the same factors as the need to continue the investigation.
The German Internal Oversight Director did not take the post
The 55-year-old H. G. Maassen's controversy further raised the claim that because of his mistakes, he was accused of "radical left forces" in the A. Merkel coalition.
As a result, he was not moved to another post, as promised earlier and forced to go to the warehouse.
In addition, last week it was made clear that a few weeks ago, the meeting of representatives of European internal surveillance organisations in Warsaw, H.G. Maassen, criticized the "new" immigration policy of A. Merkel.
For a long time, German Minister for Internal Affairs Horstas Seehoferis, in the press conference on the first day, said that the previous comments of H.G. Maassen were unacceptable and "unacceptable".
H. Seehoferis, who himself suffered pressure on both this debate and on the loss of his party in the elections of the local government of Bavaria, asked President Franco-Walter Steinmeier to send H. G. Maassen to the warehouse.

A pregnant woman's stereotype about clothing shoes
A girl with a white dress in the bathroom - mission (not possible)?
Could it be that the height of the altar is larger than S or M and still looks attractive?
More of the magnitude of reality is shown by the "Evolution (r)" participants today to demonstrate that the beauty and elegance of the moment really does not depend on the woman's kilograms.
But that's not all yet - one of the project's girls will have a happy night in the film theater, her boyfriend will show up.
"There are those who think that the more stupid girls don't pay attention to children or look.
It's just a myth - my boy himself is a athlete, but I like him who I am, and he doesn't ask me for pictures that meet some standards," said aurika speaking in front of the show.
The garment garment is not easy, in all respects, clothing - it is a complex construction, it has many materials, it has a hard, difficult frame for movement.
Some women also think that the female female in the white dress will look even more stupid and therefore less confident of herself.
I can point out that a well-elected fashion model really solves this "sympathy"," explained one of the members of the commission, the fashion designer Robert Kalinkinas.
The remaining remains of the project R. Kalinkinas, together with the entire commission, have opened houses of more size to Erika Vitulskiene, a photographer and social networks in the stars of Nagliu Bierancu and TV producer Laura Paukte.
"The decision which the girl has to take to respond to the show creates a great deal of uncertainty between the Commissioners - and we all represent different spheres, and we have different views of the winner of the show.
The task of demonstration of the vests was still disturbing, and this - I can now reveal - that there were two innovations that were certainly not much worse than the former.
It was a special evening in all sense," said R. Kalinkin.
The New Year - I will act in a scandal in 23rd year, when I saw Ieva and Doville, the mother of two wonderful children in 31 C.E. - as well as the other girls who participated in the selection of the "Dydia (r) evolution" and entered the best twentieth century.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photosis of girls in Vilnius City, they had to be greeted with the project.
The girl returned to the scene to the LNK viewers, for her favorite voice on the television portal.
After the international recognition of the reality of the beauty of the kitchen in Lithuania, a second week is already taking place - here is the name of the star of the first country.
As long as they're only eight - and they're all very well aware that the winner can be only one.
Intriguing and unsatisfied reality show "The evolution of the Earth" is already starting this Monday evening at 20.30 p.m. during the LNK.
Actor I. Elba chosen the sexiest man in the world
The U.S. People magazine announced this year the sexiest man in the world.
He became the 46-year-old British actor Idris Elba.
Although the man claims that this information was unexpected, he did not get confused when he spoke about the new title.
I said, "You can't be!
Rimti?"
And then I looked at myself in the picture and thought -- yes, I look sexual today -- laughing at the actor.
Speaking openly, Idris mentioned that this title was a very pleasant feeling that he had built up his ego.

"You're just getting tired of your hair and your muscles, and I'll meet you in my village's neighborhood," Idris said.
When men are not allowed to be the largest on the Ose screens, I. Elba is working on discoctions on the evenings, in Spain, and especially on the ibiso surming.
In time, a man enjoys the Thai box and has a hat that he realizes by creating his own dress line.
The British actor expects him to be the most important family in the world, so he's planning weddings with the promised Sabrina Dhowre.
I. Elba became the sexiest man in the world in the 33th magazine of People.
In 2017 the title was adopted by Blake Shelton.

The managing majority opposed the president's veto corrections to disrupting the construction of the power plants of the waste.
In addition to the effort to build more than 20 km from the population, the amendment provided for the Government to take decisions on the two futures already existing, taking into account the public health interests.

Speaking on the phone, British Prime Minister Theresa May proposed a review of the so-called mechanism for the settlement of the measures to be taken, which would allow the border between the United Kingdom's Northern Ireland Province and the Republic of Ireland belonging to the European Union.
The Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar sought to consider this proposal, but refused any opportunity for Britain to withdraw unilaterally from this agreement, as stated in a report published by the Irish Government.
In his speech, Th. May "supposes the possibility of reviewing the mechanism of the measures to be considered", he says.
"The speaker agreed to understand that there is an open way for a review of new proposals, provided that the outcome of such a review would not be related to the unilateral decision to stop the application of the measures under consideration," says the government report.
The "Brexit" necessaries do not take a decision on how to avoid checks at the borders of the United Kingdom and Ireland, when Britain withdraws from the common market and the customs union next year.
The two parties agree on "responsibility measures" to maintain the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland until a larger trade agreement is signed to ensure that additional customs checks are not carried out at the border.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants it to be applied temporarily to the United Kingdom as a whole.
On the first day of the day, The Daily Telegraph reported that the Secretary of Brexit, Dominica Raabas, sought to withdraw Britain from the measures to be considered unilaterally after three months.
However, L. Varadkar told journalists Dublin that his government "does not support it".
"The measures to be considered within three months or within a limited period of time shall not contain the value of the paper on which it is to be written," he said.
In the past, London and Brussels did not approve the proposal for a Brexit negotiations after a week's notice in Britain that the agreement is reached.
"I would say that we are still making progress in the negotiations, but there is still work," said Mr. May on behalf of London.
The representative of the European Commission, Margaritis Schinas, also said to journalists, "We're not there yet."
Nobel Prize laureates call for access to reliable information
The group of Russian thinkers, including Nobel Prize laureates, announced the declaration on Monday, calling for the right to have reliable information on the Internet.
Among the 25 people who signed the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are economists Amartya Senas and Joseph Stiglitzas (Jozefas Stiglias), the Nobel Peace Prize won by Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi (Shirin Ebadi), as well as Nobel Prize-winning author Mario Vargass Llosa (Marías Vargass Liosa).
"We encourage the leaders of good will throughout the country to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debates in which citizens can make decisions on the basis of the facts," says the Group report.
They argue that "the global area of information and communication" is a common bridge which "must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and opinion".
"People have a fundamental right to access information that is freely collected, processed and distributed on the basis of the right of commitment, the principles of pluralism and the methods of determining the facts," the authors of the declaration added.
The document asks for assistance from world leaders, including US President Donald Trump (Donald Tramp), who often criticizes the "inaccurate news" but regularly accused of exaggerating the facts.
The world leaders should express their position on this issue when they met in Paris on 11-13 November, the "Taiais Forum", invited the signatories.
This declaration was drawn up within two months under the direction of Sh. Ebadi and Christophe Deloire (Christofi Delului), the head of the press release and journalist rights organization "Reporters Without Borders" (RSF) in Paris.
Among the other signatories were former Senegalese President Abdou Diofas (Abdu Diufas), Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Bio and politician Francis Fukuyama (France Fukuyama).
The company has approved higher penalties for harmful products
The Seima agreed with the amendments to the Product Safety Act, which provided for an increase in the penalties for the safety of products.
The sitting room shall be approved unanimously.
As Mr Antonas Vinkus, a member of the Committee on the Health of the Sea, said about the new project, it is encouraging to set goals related to better consumer protection of products.
Its provisions shall also comply with the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"My mind, the proposed draft legislation is more and more specifically distributed to all operators involved in the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As the practice shows, the current system of penalties has not always been prevented from further violations, as the perpetrators continue to commit repeated violations," said A. Vinkus.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture, after the Government's approval of the Seima Economics Committee complemented it with its proposals.
The provisions of the Law aim to increase penalties for infringements, to strengthen consumer protection, to provide more effective market surveillance authorities and to create a clear product safety framework and their compliance.
As stated by the Ministry of Agriculture, producers are not currently obliged to mark the product properly and thus to ensure its traceability.
Furthermore, according to the Ministry, market surveillance authorities have no right to access the territory of manufacturers and suppliers, buildings, premises, inspection, and this is a challenge to the work of the authorities.
The Ministry’s assessment of the period of six months for the award of penalties and warnings shall include the short-term determination of the infringement, the conduct of the investigation and the award of the penalty.
Also, according to the Ministry, the penalties imposed are not sufficiently effective.
The company often violates the requirements of the law again - only in 2017 did 14 companies do so.
The Ministry of Agriculture has proposed to establish the obligation of manufacturers to properly mark the product and to ensure its traceability so that market surveillance authorities can better explain the suppliers of products that do not comply with the requirements.
It is also proposed to grant market surveillance authorities the right to enter into the market, the territory, the buildings, the premises, and to carry out checks by operators producing products.
The aim is to increase penalties for infringements of the law.
For the manufacturer, importer or authorised representative, the placing on the market of dangerous products and the distributor, their markets, the dangerous services provided or provided by the service provider would be allocated from EUR 150 to 2,500 (now from 144 to 1 148).
The national consumer rights protection service (VVTAT) or other market surveillance authority, after deciding to prohibit the placing on the market and supply of dangerous products or services, would be awarded from EUR 1000 to EUR 5 000 (now from EUR 868 to 4,344).
In the absence of a requirement to remove dangerous products from the market, to recover them from consumers and to destroy them, a fine of EUR 2500 to EUR 6 500 (now from 1 448 to 5 792) would be granted.
If dangerous products have caused harm to the health of the user, a fine of EUR 2 500 to 15 000 (now from 1 448 to 11584) would be awarded.
If dangerous products caused the consumer's death, the EUR 6 500 to 25 000 (now from 5 792 to 23 169) would be awarded.
According to the data provided by the Ministry, Poland and Austria for the infringement of product safety legislation, up to EUR 25 000 (minimum fines are not established), Belgium - from EUR 26 to EUR 600 000, Romania - from EUR 155 to EUR 666, Bulgaria - from EUR 125 to EUR 7,500.

Norway's armed battalion participated in NATO operations in the remotest and northern regions
Soldiers from Norway participated in a series of complex exercises in the mountains north of the capital of Oslo.
This is part of NATO's "Third Union 2018" exercises - the largest NATO exercises since the end of the Cold War.
Most of the wars of the second Norwegian military forces were spent a lot of time away from home, such as Afghanistan - that is, in hot lands.
But most of all, they are capable of fighting under the Arctic conditions, and these skills are very useful now that NATO is changing its focus.
In recent days to the east of the Tinseto mountains, often in the remotest and northern regions, soldiers have participated in the inscenized wars against certain British soldiers.
Soldiers have the ability to survive in this cool, wild nature, but in the remote climate they have a much higher weight on the sand temple - one cup weighs about 50 kg.
The soldiers in charge say that they share their skills, how to survive and fight under such conditions, with other NATO soldiers.
According to soldiers, this practice, which, like any other, does not reflect the reality of war, will teach them to be prepared if a serious threat arises.

In Vilnius, the director of the RESC, who has lived and worked for three and a half years, said that the United States has agreed to implement projects and will make Lithuania's voice more heard on the other side of the Atlantic.
"We've been working hard here for a few months.
I am pleased that the two great institutions are guiding us as partners and looking for opportunities for joint activities.
There is no doubt that niscal activities are taking place, with our analysis of NATO, security, disinformation, the development of Eastern Partnership countries, they are also priority," Kojala said.
The agreements indicate that the RESC and the US institutions will work together to prepare applications for international projects, exchange expertise and experience, prepare expert visits.

At the latest University of Pennsylvania, FPRI's global analytical centres have occupied seven places in its category.
At the same time, CEPA, whose analysts were invited to consult and work at the highest political institutions in the United States, is currently ten in its own category.
"This will give us more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to enter the U.S. information area and encourage us to put quality card up," Kojala added.
One of the first practical steps should be the assistance of partners in the distribution of the newly shown RESC analytical publication "Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review" among US decision makers and in the public area.
The European Centre for Eastern Studies is operating on the basis of projects implemented and is not supported by targeted grants.
The RESC partners implementing the joint initiative are the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.
