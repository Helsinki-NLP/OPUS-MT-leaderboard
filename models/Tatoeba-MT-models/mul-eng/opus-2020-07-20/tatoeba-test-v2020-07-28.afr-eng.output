I'm going to my toothbrush.
You can configure the sliders with a circle or ponym.
When are you going to do that?
She will try again.
Was the soup delicious?
What does he do?
Tom didn’t have the chance that you and I had.
Many birthday cards will soon come.
It's a solo train.
My dad's open on Saturday.
What he said angered us.
He speaks not only French but also Spanish.
I don’t think anything has happened to you.
That's a nice couple of legs.
One, three and five are different numbers.
Did they sign?
He needed water.
Birds drink water.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom's never eating.
How many pens do you have?
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk declared the Turkish Republic in 1922.
His silence surprised me.
This is not just the effort.
We've got a little late.
Nobody's going to worry.
Hello!
Are you sure you want me to help you with your homework?
The package weighs more than one pound.
I know how you felt about him.
It will be our secret.
This potload is white.
He's watching some TV.
Drink!
Do not miss the opportunity.
It's a little cool.
He is better than I am.
Tom showed me his new way.
It is easy to view humans as unique among other living organisms.
The sick person had the best possible care.
You work too much.
We slept in the same room.
I'm not going to buy anything.
Tom wouldn't cry.
"I never thought of it," said the old man. "What will we do?"
Forget about them.
Tom did not tell the story of dying.
Mary is Tom's wife.
Where are the other girls?
Journalists were not allowed inside.
I like cold pizza.
He didn't wear a jacket.
He condemned racial discrimination as a wild beast.
I'm drinking water.
The food was not so bad.
She is two years older than you are.
I never said that.
I don't blame you.
She was faithful to him.
If I were you, I would start immediately.
She has blond hair.
Do you know Tom from Mary?
I'll be here when you get back.
When does Tom eat?
You're the wine.
I forgot about him.
The bird is in the forest.
Another coffee, please.
Who is that woman?
Okay, I'll accept your offer.
Do you understand what he says?
My wife is a vegetarian.
Where's Tom staying?
We implemented that plan.
You had to attend the meeting.
You can read my letter and correct errors if there is.
My conscience bothers me.
A number of houses have been washed away by the river.
Why should I care about them?
Does your friend like tea?
I had to rent a car.
What should I do about her?
If a sick thousand scrolls are filled, her wishes will be realized.
Tom forgot about them.
Don't let it be for the train.
If you find something that's good with you and what you're enjoying, it's a great thing.
You don't believe me.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
I was sad to hear of her.
Whatever you do, don’t let the new phone fall.
Why don’t you help me catch wild ants?
It's not a joke.
Tom is not going to make any deliveries today.
The eye is the mirror of the soul.
The son who best writes wins the prize.
Tom will not stay with us next week.
I work at this company.
Tom can't swim.
You drink water.
She loved him.
Tom didn't go.
Do you have a phone?
Do you know the boy who cries?
Tom will help you.
You don't need a ring.
Birds sing.
If the idiots were to compete, you'd come second because you're too fat to come first.
I wouldn’t be surprised if Tom hadn’t come.
I don't want to remember.
Blitsvinny!
They are in the library.
Tom would rather not have done that.
She's very nice.
I don't want to meet her.
I don't know where we're going to open up.
Tom stood up early.
This is life.
I couldn't stop Tom.
He did not feel sorry for me.
What is your favorite winter sport?
The girl in the blue jacket is my daughter.
Our teacher started singing a song well.
We're not going to open everything.
But you know that these negative consequences would come.
He will never believe me again.
Tom set up his lawyer’s office in a flashlight.
The two villages were divided by a river.
We decided not to expel them.
Can I get a coffee for the road?
I met your daughter.
Tom ate too much.
Do you know any of them?
Where's the PowerPoint offer you promised me?
I'm drinking tea.
I was sad to hear of him.
I'll let you go back to work.
I'm not going to be in trouble to do it.
All we can imagine is real, but what is really real is the real question.
I am now living in Norway.
Tom can't die.
I won't be able to help you.
Nobody tells me what to do.
The smallest continent is Australia.
Can you write an English letter?
My name is Tom.
This is a reminder from Hokkaido.
I told you before, didn't I?
Don't hit the dog with a stone.
This man's crying for me!
Now be more careful.
Please hurry.
Where's the PowerPoint offer you promised me?
I don't want to lie.
The United States will one day choose a woman as president for the first time, and there will be joy about the long-term opportunity.
Thank you so much, you just ruined my life!
We'll contact you when your table is ready.
Good morning.
This is my computer.
There are fifty members in this club.
I received letters from someone I've never met.
My dad's name is Fritz.
Do you speak French?
I'm in a playroom.
Do not believe everything people tell you.
I don't speak enough French!
I'm not going to be able to visit for a while.
I don't want to be late.
There was a cat on the table.
It was a poor, big summer day at the end of June.
Why should I lie?
Let's go.
I'll go back to my office.
I don't speak Japanese.
I'm unemployed too.
Can I survive later?
Tom was very patient.
I have to go.
Tom won't care.
Sami corrected it last week.
What should we do about him?
The food is right.
I'll put my socks in a jacktrap.
Tom tried to keep it going.
Tom won't watch it.
My horse is black.
If this is a lie, she's a liar.
I was worried about them.
My friend wrote me a letter to find out how I was.
I would like to send this package to Canada.
Why should Tom do this?
Don't you add sugar?
I’m not afraid.
She's doing her homework now.
What will you do today when you go to school?
Berlin is the capital of Germany.
The wall was a light brown hole.
You're afraid of him.
Tom won't see me.
Maybe I shouldn't be so confused.
How many letters are there in the alphabet?
He's a man of faith.
Tom won't die.
I don't want to see you.
He's judging jazz.
When did you last vote?
She can answer your question.
Can I take a look at your card?
I wish you were near me.
We think the reason for his success was hard work.
I saw you yesterday.
I don't see anything.
Tom committed suicide by jumping off a bridge.
Dreams always come out.
Ping pong is also called table tennis.
I'm sure I'm not going to be of much help.
The air is blue, the sea is also blue. The air and the sea is blue.
Robert was so busy that he had to show an invitation to play golf from his hand.
Tom won't wait here for so long.
He's my brother.
All human beings are born free, equal in dignity and rights, having reason and consciences and are worthy of imitation by the spirit of brotherhood.
They are worried about her.
Television consumes more than the sunglasses.
You are the most beautiful girl in the world.
I’m used to it now.
Can you make a copy for me?
What's he doing here?
I finish my homework.
Is it hot like that?
My house has two bedrooms.
Where's your luggage?
Who has called this song into dancing?
Can you turn off the light?
He reads the newspaper every morning.
She kept working.
He's young.
Tom was busy.
Who built this house?
He cannot speak many English.
I just wondered if you could find a place to stay.
I don't want to change.
I always wondered what that smell was.
Tom won't stop.
Martha is an excellent piano.
Let's stick to the point.
The news spread quickly.
Do you have a firefight?
Chinese food made the biggest impression in China.
Please hurry!
The dog jumped over the nest, into the garden.
Can I take a day off?
The warm bath relieved my muscles.
Read this book.
Did he write letters in English?
We've got a big garden.
Don’t spend your money on things you don’t need.
Good luck!
Tom told me to do it.
She's got a house at the sea.
Have you ever been to Paris?
That's the last shot.
We know each other very well.
Thank you very much!
She seemed beautiful.
We're all going.
Open your mouth!
It depends on the weather.
He speaks not only French but also Spanish.
I went back to my seat.
Place the door behind you if you leave the room.
There's always something to do.
I'm going to be on the next bus.
Money cannot buy happiness.
Who said that?
Your first name is on the list.
Is this necessary?
Can you wait so long?
Were you busy yesterday?
Sami hates talking about money.
My sister is beautiful.
With the sun’s rising, they left their job.
Who knows where Tom was born?
She's running.
The factory produces toys.
Did she hurt that cat?
He was a good king.
They said that they had always done so.
We're looking for each other.
I'm just looking.
Unfortunately, Tom will not be able to come.
Tom said that he thought that Mary was still living with her parents.
I'll have to come back to you.
Tom will stay for three days.
I wouldn't be surprised.
It smells.
In the past, the boys were taught to defend themselves while they were still very young.
Tom would never have done that.
There's a bird here.
Wait, don't shoot!
I wouldn't blame Tom.
That was his decision.
I really didn’t want to win.
I am no longer afraid.
I hoped we could be friends.
Tom Bewe.
My father made his own furniture.
He does not like traveling by airplane.
We had nothing to lose.
I'm alone with a friend.
He asked my mother.
Does that make sense?
I don't want you to change.
Even Tom lied.
Her music is famous.
It's all yours.
He belongs to the Catholic faith.
I don't want to go home.
I don't want to see you.
Tom was disturbed by the direction of his thoughts.
I'm not going to change my choice. I'm not going to make things that you say.
That's quite normal.
I love your son.
Empty will be permanently lost.
I had to imagine myself.
Let's practice.
It was hard for him to take his pride, which he felt was his success.
I want to know who broke this window.
Tom said that he did not heal Mary.
The clock is up.
I can't get out of this cell.
I don't have time for you.
They said that they had always done so.
My boss was satisfied with what I did.
I'm Robert's friend.
I want to be her friend.
Don't move.
I heard about him.
Peter loves Jane.
I remember listening to her.
Tom wants to spend time with me.
I will be very careful.
Yesterday this time was at the telescope.
Are you a girl or a boy?
Mike has two girls.
Let's wait until he comes.
Tom colored his hair dark brown.
That's what you get!
Are you going to die, Tom?
A dog ran behind the cat.
I also slept for Tom.
Why not join us for tonight’s evening?
It's a horse.
Tom was arrested.
It's not a joke.
You promised you'd come.
I would be embarrassed to expect such a thing.
Kersvader lives in the North Pole.
I was born in Tokyo and burned.
I got a taste of it.
Let's sit down.
Unfortunately, I would not be very good company.
You won't be able to help us.
You are the love of my life.
Yet I would betray you.
Tom drinks more than anyone I know.
I like preaching.
He's not always Sunday home.
My sons are soldiers.
I don't want to hurt you.
Tom is looking for an easy way to lose weight.
Tom had to go.
I don't have anything to sleep tonight.
I want to leave empty.
The song is easy to learn.
Where did you learn it?
You're home.
I completely forgot about them.
She chose to move under pressure from her parents.
I have to help my mother.
He lives in a village near Osaka.
You're not a dog, are you a cat?
What would you have done if you had been in my place?
I'll be right behind you.
Tom went back to his car and got a flashlight.
I think I might be out of a job.
I told Tom I'd be now.
However, my son believed in Kersvader.
I hate to run it.
Sami has to wait a minute.
Are they friends?
Tom knows all about them.
It is dangerous to join in on your own in that area.
Sami did not notice it.
Do you wash your hands?
Can I shake your hand?
You don't know me, do you?
I'm now back with contradictions.
That's why I'm here.
He's my neighbor.
Tom thought it was unfair.
The hotel looks at the lake.
Tom's hand was cold.
She is, of course, forbidden to read.
It seems that he knows the secret.
Do you have a phone?
Mr. Mitchell asked me to pay the rest of the money before the end of the week.
She killed herself.
You're not a doctor.
I know how you felt about us.
She's younger than him.
I put it back where it belongs.
I'll take a book.
Tom delivered his cell phone in the car.
I wouldn't be so sure.
I keep dreaming about her.
Tom did not wear socks.
Tom's gonna say no.
I'm a fireman.
There are islands in the sea.
Where is it now?
We are not yet very hungry.
There is probably a simple solution to your problem.
I completely forgot her.
We have to start doing this.
It is difficult to live in Japan.
I know how you feel about her.
I drank two cups of coffee.
I forgot about her.
Tom, however, was not fair.
I don't want to marry.
I'm talking about him.
Tom might die.
If you get up, he will be studying.
I've got a dry skin.
We are his sons.
Birds are beautiful.
The bakery lasted a week.
When did you last lie?
Tom won't perform a speech today.
Why did you join the army?
I wouldn't blame you.
Flowers and trees need clean air and fresh water.
You're too late.
What we know about health has taught us through the study of diseases.
Tom sits on a window to read a book.
We're not going to be here at 2:30.
I like to eat meat.
Still, we could do it at 2:30.
He was jealous of my success.
Tom knows how to dance?
Did you call him?
He's kicking me!
She reads the newspaper every morning.
The bakery is slowly the victim’s home.
Please forgive me.
"Thank you." "You're welcome."
The food was not so bad.
I eat rice.
Hey, can I open up a window?
This wall is higher than that one.
It smells.
Tom's gonna be late.
I'll take you to the roof.
I just bought a few new shoes.
We want it back.
The competition begins in the morning.
They can overcome their fears.
This cannot be a real diamond.
Tom's gone.
Was Tom there?
My father recently returned to Japan.
This is my friend.
I know how you feel about him.
Please share my collection.
Tom will win you.
Can you open this door?
Her story brings back memories of my parents.
Tom is no longer getting help from Mary.
I am saving so that I can go to Australia.
I know everything about her.
I'm falling in love with you.
Tom and Mary are very busy.
This does not make a matter of what he says, but should not trust him.
You had to visit Kyoto.
I woke up when it was dark.
Find out everything you can about her.
I came to talk to you.
I wonder what happened to Paul.
If God did not exist, we would have to think about him.
Can you help me with this?
We met in 2008. A year later, we were married.
She's not here.
He asked my mother.
Let the waters roar, the wind and the night; and let the cold pass through the thickest garment, especially on the sea, a poor boat with only two men entering the sea.
Tonight's all cat grown.
Styller!
It's my house now.
A bird fly.
He was late for 30 minutes.
He reaches out to an English-Japan dictionary on the reader.
What a man soweth, he also reapeth.
I wish you had said that before.
I love my mother.
Tom won't question it.
I'm much bigger than you are.
Tom looked closer.
I'm your father.
You'll pay for it.
I've been looking for a place to stay.
Tom has a lot on his table.
Do you choose red or white wine?
This is the next one!
I want to see your boss.
He was very tired.
How do you feel about them now?
We forgot about her.
Japan is full of beautiful cities, for example, Kyoto and Nara.
I'll make it back for nights.
I never thought it would be so easy.
Whose books are these?
Welcome to Australia.
He found his parents.
You can eat whatever you want.
It's funny!
The river by Paris is known as the Seine.
I'm glad you finally came back.
