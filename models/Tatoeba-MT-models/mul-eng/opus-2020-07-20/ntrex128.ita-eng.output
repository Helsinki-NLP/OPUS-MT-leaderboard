Members of the Galles Assembly are concerned about "making the image of the pagans"
The proposal to amend their title in the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Wales Parliament).
This proposal is a result of the programmes to amend the name of the Assembly in the Wales Parliament.
Members of the whole political area are concerned that this may sound ridiculous.
A member of the Laburist Party Assembly said his party is concerned that "he can stay with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who do not live in Wales: In Gales, twp means creatinine and pwp means cat.
A member of the Plaid Assembly said that the group in the group "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Polish Conservative Party claimed to be "open" to change the name, but stressed that only a small verbal step separates MWP from Muppet (pagliaccio).
In this context, the letter W in galley is pronounced in a similar way to the English pronunciation of Yorkshire in the letter U.
The Committee on Assembly Affairs, which is currently taking the lead in introducing amendments to the names, said: "The final decision on possible descriptions of how the members of the House will be called will certainly be a debate for the members themselves."
The law of the Galles Government of 2017 granted the Galician Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which provided broad support for the possibility of calling the Assembly of Wales.
As regards the title of the members of the House, the Commission expressed its preference in favour of Welsh Parliament Members or WMP (Members of the French Parliament), but the MWP option was given greater consensus in a public consultation.
The AMs appear to be proposing alternative options, but the difficulties in reaching the consensus could be expressed by thanking President Elin Jones, who should submit a legislative proposal on changes within a few weeks.
The reform law will include further amendments to the functioning of the Assembly, including regulations on the exclusion of AMs and the design of the Committees' system.
The AMs will receive the final vote on their name during the discussion of the legislation.
Macedonians attend the meetings for the referendum on the change in the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change their country's name in the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The popular vote was organised in an attempt to end a debate over the past decades with the Greek border, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly objected to its requests for accession to the EU and NATO.
President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, an opposition from the Plebiscite for the amendment of the name, said he would not take account of the vote.
However, the sponsors of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change in name is simply the price to be paid in order to join the EU and NATO.
The streets of St. Martin's are closed while the churches of Harlem are in difficulty
"The elders I spoke to say there was a bar and a church in every corner in the past," Adams said.
"Today there are none of the two."
He explained that the absence of the bars was understandable.
"People's socialism differently today," he explained.
"The bars are no longer the neighborhood halls that people frequent regularly."
As for the churches, it is concerned that the money from the sale of the homelands will not last as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will return where they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartments with condoms filled with people who will not help the rest of the district.
"The vast majority of the people who buy apartments in these buildings are white," he says, "and for that reason they will face the moment when these churches will close everything because it is unlikely that most people who move to these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by confraternites before Harlem became a black neighborhood - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martin's a decade later.
The original white methodist congregation if it went in the 1930s.
A black congregation praying in a nearby church took possession of the building.
St. Martin's was acquired by a black congregation with head of King John Howard Johnson, who led the fight against dealers of 125th Street, one of the main routes for shopping in Harlem, who refused to take on or promote color people.
A fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's parishioners planned his reconstruction, they also ordered the carillon.
The reverent David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor to St. Martin's, has proudly called the "the peasants of the poor."
The expert who sounded the carillon in July called it in different ways: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stressed that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a color musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who passed on to a larger carillon to the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What was presented in St. Martin's scene in recent months was a complex frame of architects and entrepreneurs, some presented by the church's lay officials, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, consisting of a lay leader, wrote to the diocese in July on its concerns about the fact that the diocese "was trying to download the costs" on the parish assembly although it was not involved in the acquisition of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained of a lack of transparency by the diocese.
Squalo spends one thirteen years in fishing for aragosts in California
Official sources say that on Saturday a squall attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy while he was embroiled in the search for aragost in California, during the opening day of the aragost season.
The attack took place just before the 7th of the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV of San Diego that he had been camping with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming and hung up to him with a group of people to get him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first that it was just enthusiasm due to the capture of an aragost, but then he realized that the boy was crying ‘I was funny!
I've been murdered!'
Her entire clavicle was relaxed," said Hammel once when the boy arrived.
"I cried to everyone to get out of the water: "There's a hole in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was transported with an helicopter at the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was recovered under critical conditions.
The species responsible for the attack is not known.
Captain Larry Giles has declared during a communication to the media that a few weeks before he was warned in the area of a squall, but that he had been declared not belonging to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper area of the tower.
The authorities have prohibited access to the beach from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami's to Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and security purposes.
Giles has reported that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sansbury's programme a boost to the beauty sector in the UK
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with courses dedicated to the beauty products of the large store assigned to specialist assistants
As part of the important impetus to the UK's market for beauty products of 2.8 billion stars, which continue to grow while sales in fashion and household products decrease, the largest courses dedicated to beauty products will be tested in 11 countries' businesses and adopted in more businesses next year in case of success.
The investment in beauty takes place at a time when supermarkets are hunting new ways to use the space on stairs once dedicated to televisions, microwaves and articles for the house.
Sainsbury's said he would double the sizes of his beauty product offering until the 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will occupy a larger space with branded areas like those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique truck range so that most of the products are vegan - a quality more often required by the younger buyers.
In addition, the perfume dealer The Fragrance Shop will experience authorisations in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which has opened in Croydon, southern London, while a second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
Online shopping and a move towards buying small quantities of food daily at small neighborhood shops have forced supermarkets to undertake more to convince people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, managing director of Sainsbury's, said that the sales points will always subsidize to large stores while the supermarket chain seeks to resist discounts such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has introduced the points of sale Argos in hundreds of shops and has also introduced several habitats since he bought the two chains about two years ago, and this strategy has prompted food sales and made the most profitable acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to cut off its distributions of beauty and pharmaceutical products has resulted in failure.
Sainsbury's has tried a joint venture with Boots at the beginning of the year 2000 but synergy has ended in a debate on the division of income from pharmaceutical sales points in supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sainsbury's sold three years ago his pharmaceutical activity of 281 points sold in Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million stars.
Lloyds was expected to play a role in the program, with the addition in four shops of an extensive range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of Saninsbury's business, said: "We have transformed the aspect of our distributions of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in well-formed colleges that will be available to offer advice.
Our brand range has been developed to meet every need and the inviting environment and comfortable positions make us an interesting destination for beauty products, contrary to the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "frequency" after Holly Willoughby comes up with an agreement of 11 million stars.
The star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, is angry after the TV representative Holly Willoughby withdrawn from a 11 million-star contract with his trend mark to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby no longer has time for his brand of Casalinghi and Truly accessories.
The couple's activity was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow's.
The representative of This Morning, 37 years old, called on Instagram to announce his resignation.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons De, Peter Jones, angry after being withdrawn from their credit card activity in the last minute to focus on his new exceptional contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones was "frequency" when the gold girl of TV allowed during a thesis meeting at the headquarters of her commercial empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, whose new contracts - for a value of 1.5 million stars - did not leave them enough time to dedicate themselves to their brand of householding and Truly accessories.
The activity was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop and was calculated to double Willoughby's heritage, estimated around 11 million stars.
Not long after Willoughby, 37 years old, chose Instagram to announce his resignation from Truly, Jones left Britain to move to one of his residences for vacations.
According to one source: "Truly was certainly Holly's highest priority.
It had to be his future in the long term that he would have committed to it for the next twenty years.
His decision to leave had left all the people involved totally without words.
No one could believe what was going on Tuesday, they were so close to the launch.
There is a store full of products in Marlow's general district, ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the resignation of this morning's representative, one of the most productive stars in the United Kingdom, could cost the company millions because of strong investment in products that come from costumes and candles to clothing and homewear and because of possible delays in the launch of the brand.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby invented Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, has joined the company as president in March.
The couples spent their holidays together and Jones had a 40% share of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become the Ambassador of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as host to the TV program "I'm A Celebrity".
A source near Jones said last night that he "does not want to send comments on his business."
It's hard to say, "and we're in love."
He pointed out the criticisms he would have received from the media to make a comment that some would have judged "non-presidential" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his voice to imitate the "televisional driver".
"I didn't give up on anything."
He stressed that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first event in Singapore in June was adopted by Trump as a major step forward towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations for denuclearization are at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho turned to world leaders during the UN General Assembly on Saturday, which North Korea has not observed a "equivalent response" from the United States to the first North Korea disarmament operations.
Rather, he stressed that the United States is continuing to impose sanctions on those who maintain high pressure.
Trump gave a much more optimistic view of this speech.
"With North Korea we're getting excellent results," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great report."
He stated that his efforts to improve Kim's relations have resulted in positive results: the end of the Missile Tests, the contribution to the release of hostages and the rehabilitation of the last American military.
And he defended his unusual strategy by describing his relationship with Kim.
"It's just to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded field, we would have about 200 people right here," said Trump, pointing out the crowd facing him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy an island, causing hundreds of victims.
Following the earthquake in Lombok, for example, non-governmental organizations were reported that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had been displaced, national emergency was not declared an essential requirement to activate international aid.
"In many cases, fortunately, I have been very clear about not wanting international assistance, so it's a little complicated," said Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organizing a team that will return to Palu, it is not yet sure that the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Sutopo, co-chair of the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
In view of the threats to which Indonesia has continued to be subjected, the country continues to be extremely impromptu in the face of the anger of nature.
Although refugees were built at the tsunamis in Aceh, it is not a common structure at other costs.
The apparent lack of a siren of alarm for tsunamis in Palu, although the alarm was given, has probably contributed to the loss of human lives.
In the best conditions, it is complicated to be found among the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship still in Lombok to help the victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu but they will need us at least three days to reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo put the improvement of the infrastructures in Indonesia's brands at the centre of his electoral campaign and reversed money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has hit the administration of Joko while preparing for the re-election next year.
Joko must also face pressures from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority of Muslims have adopted the most conservative framework of religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes because of delays in the roads between Christian and Muslim gangs, which fight using masks, bows and brakes and other handguns.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge del Liverpool vs Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a disaster in Premier League against Chelsea with a point on the 89th Saturday, in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 25 metres from the Chelsea gate, with his team below for 1-0.
He touched the left ball before pulling on the second ball.
The attempt went high above the front of the door as it turned to the upper right corner of the network.
The ball finally falls on the back of Kepa Arrizabalaga insacing itself into the network.
"I was just trying to put myself in position, get to the ball and players like Shaq always play as much as possible, so I tried to create as long as possible," Sturridge said in LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante arrive and I got a touch and I didn't think too much and I shot."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the first time after the goal at the 25th minute marked by the star of the Belgoo Eden Hazard.
The center of Blue has passed through the roof of Mateo Kovacic before walking close to half the field and drop in the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick passage to half-field.
So he made a beautiful passage that brought Hazard into the area.
Hazard has crossed the defense and has finished on the second floor with a left-hand bullet in addition to Alison Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will meet Naples at the season of the Championships League at 15.00 on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will have to face Videoton in UEFA Europe League at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia is 832
The number of victims of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia reached 832, said on Sunday morning the country's disaster management agency.
A number of people have been reported intertwined between the mackerel of buildings broken down following the earthquake of magnitude 7.5 which struck the country on Friday and which has generated up to 6 metres high, reported to the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press conference.
The city of Palu, which accounts for more than 380,000 inhabitants, has been destroyed from broken buildings.
The police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman is beaten to death
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, in Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 a.m. with gun shots at Grayson Mews in John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder suspect.
The police have invited people who may have seen or heard something in the area to contact.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is just at the beginning but I would like to send a call to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and who had seen or heard anything suspicious and invited them to contact us.
I would also like to make an appeal to anyone, especially the taxis, who may have registered something on the dashcam so that you can contact us because you may have important information for our investigation."
A police officer confirmed that the woman whose body was returned was resident in Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, some friends who said they knew the woman came to the crime scene to ask questions about the location of the event this morning.
The investigations are ongoing and the police have said that they are currently informing the victims' families.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mays just tried to get back to his apartment but was contacted by the police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He stayed without words when he discovered what had happened.
The residents have been informed that they will need hours before they are allowed to return.
A police officer told a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman is depicted on the scene in mourning.
Keep repeating "it's terrible."
At 2:00 a.m., two police vehicles were located inside the delimited area and another vehicle was just outside.
Several agents were located within the delimited area under the control of the apartment building.
Anyone who has information about this is invited to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestopers anonymously at number 0800 555 111 by specifying the register 247 of 30 September.
Parliament's Cromwell statue becomes the last monument struck by the "recording of history"
It would be poetic justice for its Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects in England carried out by its Puritan fanatics.
But the Cromwell Society has defined Crick's proposal as a "foliary" and a "threatening attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the light of the current debate on the removal of the statue that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace became a target.
The iconoclastia during the English civil war was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The great representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is the proof of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many believe must still be celebrated.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a parliamentary defender from external pressures, in his case obviously from the monarchy.
That this is an extremely accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the 18th century conflict has defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure that represents a part of this fracture.
Its results as Lord's guardian must be celebrated and remembered."
A Chinese farmer kills a murderer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a mayor in a market in South-West China while the news spread by local media.
The man, identified only with the name "Yuan", was brought dead with a recyclable artery, covered with blood near a porcelain on the market in Liupanshui province of Guizhou, referred to the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A male farmer is prepared to inject vaccines to the male in a plant on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It is reported that he had traveled with the cousin from the bordering province of Yunnan Wednesday to sell 15 maize to the market.
The next morning, the cook found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby porcelain was open.
He said there was a big man with blood on his chest in his pocket.
An analysis from the United States confirmed that the 250 kg mass had destroyed the alleviator, in terms of statements.
"My cousin's legs were covered with blood and maculated," said the nurse identified with the nickname "Wu", as reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance videos showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 on Thursday to give him food to his grandparents.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or the baby.
A market official told the Evening News that the mayor was arrested to prevent other people from being attacked, while the police collected evidence on the crime scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating a refund for the death of the alleviator.
Although they are rare, cases of attacks on humans by monkeys have already been reported in the past.
In 2016, a mayor attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts, causing a series of injuries to man.
Ten years ago, a 300- kg cornmeal buried a galley farmer in his tractor until the wife managed to escape the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was divorced by his grandparents in 2012, a manitoba farmer told CBC News that the monkeys are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can function as a "catalizer."
"They just want to play.
They're funny, very curious. They don't want to hurt you.
Just show them the proper dose of respect," he explained.
The strands of the Rosa hurricane will bring strong east piers in the south-west of the USA
As planned, the Rosa hurricane is losing its strength as it moves on the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains on northern Mexico and on the southwestern coast of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa has recorded twenty to 138 km/h, a category 1 hurricane at 5 Et on Sunday and is 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, there is a drought on the Pacific Ocean and is heading east towards the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of the Baja California as a tropical storm, she will begin to push a strong tropical humidity to the north, in the south-western part of the USA.
Rosa will carry up to 25 cm of rain in some areas of Mexico during the Monday day.
Thus, the tropical humidity in contact with the nearby sacchart will create heavy and widespread precipitation in the south-western area in the next days.
At local level, from 2 to 10 cm of rain can cause unsafe floods, floods of waste and possible streams in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates reaching 2.5-7.5 cm per hour at certain points, particularly in the areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitations of 2,5-10 cm pioggia are planned in some areas of the south-west, in particular on most of the Arizona.
It is possible to verify invasive floods with rapidly worsening conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical raindrops.
It is strongly advised to venture into the desert on foot in the presence of the threat of tropical rain.
The strong peaches could make the canyons of the rivers full and the temporary will bring wind to blow and blow dust.
The nearby scaffolding will cause strong local rains on the coast of southern California.
It will be possible to precipitate more than 1 cm, which may cause limited flows of waste and discharges.
This would be the first precipitation of the region in the cold season.
Some scattered tropical beaches will begin to approach Arizona at the end of Sunday and at the beginning of Monday, before the beaches become larger at the end of Monday and early Tuesday.
Strong woes will descend on the Four Corners Tuesday to last until Wednesday.
In October there will be strong temperatures oscillations in the United States while the article cools, but tropicals will remain quite hot.
Sometimes this leads to important changes in temperature on short distances.
An exceptional example of sensitive temperature differences in Central America will be recorded Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer's heat will try to increase and expand again.
It is scheduled to begin in October for most of the Central and Eastern USA, with 26 oC from the Southern Plains to the north-east.
In New York it will be possible to reach 26 degrees Tuesday, i.e. a temperature of about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a strong probability of temperatures above average for the East US until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people followed on Thursday on six television networks the forthcoming deposition by the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual violence that would have happened in the '80s, Christine Blasey Ford.
At the same time, the political impasse continues, with the issuers who interrupt the regular programming for the final minute of Friday: an agreement created by the Senator of the Jeff Flake Arizona so that the FBI can conduct a week's investigation on the charges.
Ford has informed the Senate Justice Commission that it is 100% certain that Kavanaugh was in a state of irritability and tried to seduce her during a party at the top.
Kavanaugh, during an infamous deposition, claimed to be 100% sure that this didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people indicated by Nielsen on Friday followed the deposition.
The company was calculating the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for the other networks that have transmitted them, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often finds it difficult to comprehend the viewers who follow the programs in the offices.
To put everything in perspective, it's an audience similar to that for a football playoff or Oscar prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose opinions strongly supported the name of Kavanaugh, led all the networks, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the entire day, reported Nielsen.
ABC was the second network with 3.26 million television viewers.
CBS registered 3.1 million telespectors, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of the Friday drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican has issued a statement stating that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, Blake was arrested by CNN and CBS operators on Friday morning while he was insulted by demonstrators while he was trying to take an elevator to a hearing of the Commission of Justice.
It remained with the low eyes for several minutes while it was re-examined and transmitted from live to CNN.
"I'm here right in front of you," said a woman.
"You think you're telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have the power, while many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued the statement and said before the elevator closed, that he would have something else to say during the hearing of the Commission.
All cable networks and transmitters have been transmitted from live hours later when the Justice Commission voted to present the name of Kavanaugh in the whole sitting for a vote.
But Flake said he would have done so only with the certainty that the FBI would have analysed the allegations against the candidate during the following week, as requested by the Democrats of the minority.
Blake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and other senators subsequently, Blake made her decision.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump launched a FBI investigation on charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused the critics of "political making" on Brexit
First Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized his programmes to leave the European Union a "political factor" with the future of Great Britain and to reconsider national interest in an interview with the daily Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, September 29, 2018.
In another interview with the prime minister on the first page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Chequers agreement for Brexit, claiming that a proposal according to which Britain and the EU must take their respective duties is "too ridiculous"
The murder of Wade Sims: the police arrest the suspect of the death of the LSU player Dyteon Simpson
The police arrested a suspect of death by gun by Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested and taken to prison on a second-grad murder charge, said Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities have made a video of the encounter between Sims and Simpson, and the police say Sims lost his eyes during the night.
The police recovered their eyes from the crime scene and claimed to have detected Simpson's DNA on them, reports the WAFB TV station affiliated to the CBS.
After asking Simpson, the police said that the suspect allowed him to accidentally shoot Wade.
The prison was set at $350,000, and the defense lawyer reported.
The medical office of East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report on Friday, in which it claims that the cause of death is a gun wound from the neck.
The department recognized the merit of the task force for the fugitives of the state of Louisiana police, the police science lab, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area who provided assistance to the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director of the LSU thanked the forces of the area order for their commitment and the search for justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm attacker has grown in Baton Rouge, where the father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
The last season the player had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 2.6 matches.
On Friday morning, LSU's coach Will Wade said that the team is "caught" and "shocked" for the death of Wade.
"This is what you're concerned about at all times," said Wade.
Volcano shellfishes City of Mexico
The scene outside the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, after the activity was increased in crater and 183 gas and zero emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was controlling the various holes and shelves.
Social media images have shown subtle layers of scenes covering the paraphernalia of cars in the city of Mexico like Xochimilco.
Geophysicals have seen an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit the central area of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", is active since 1994.
Police interviews with Catalan separatists to monitor the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the pro-independence protesters met with the anti-smos police teams and thousands of people joined in demonstrations of opponents to remember the first anniversary of the Catholic vote on the sexes.
A group of Mascarats arrested by the anti-Smomous police has slammed the police with eggs and cast irons into dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that usually work for tourists.
Further meetings have been conducted during the day with police officers who have made use of manuals to contain the fight.
For several hours, groups of independents who sang "We won't forget, we won't forgive" were faced with the Unionists who shouted "Land life in Spain."
The local press indicated that fourteen people had to receive treatment for mild wounds received during the demonstrations.
The tension remained high in the independent region one year after the referendum of 1 October considered illegal by the Government of Madrid but recognised by the Catalan separatists.
The electors had voted with a shocking majority for independence, although the flow was low, and the Catalans against the secession had voted widely.
In the presence of the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people reported injuries last year after the police tried to stop violent attacks on the referendum that was being carried out at headquarters throughout the region.
Independent groups met on Friday night to prevent a demonstration of support from the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative path.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, is an electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife and claimed that he had no hope of the possibility that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying happy for the possibility of voting, but now everything is blocked," he explained.
Despite having achieved a fundamental victory in spite of measures to the regional elections last December, the independent Catalan parties have made it a fact to maintain this year's slant, with many of the most famous leaders of the movement who find a voluntary asylum or in prison awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded with his phone the protest in support of the police, said that the conflict was fueled by the policies of the two factions.
"The situation is increasingly tense," he said.
Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catholic leaders in prison waiting for the end of the last year, announced that he would be running the European Parliament's elections next year.
"Presenting me as a candidate to the European elections is the best way to denounce the involvement of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government," he explained.
Londonderry: men arrested after expecting a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after they had repeatedly beaten a Londonderry house with a car.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent Thursday, at 19:30 BST about.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused by the canals and the building itself.
It is also possible that the machine was hit with a stick at a certain point.
Menga's attack marks the victory of Livingston at 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston has won
Livingston already promoted has left the Rangers amazingly relegating Steven Gerarrd to his second defeat in 18 parties as director of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's goal has made the difference, while Gary Holt's team has gone through the second division with the Hibernian.
Gerard's team is therefore left without a victory outside home in Premiership this season and will have to face the next Sundays in the Hearts class, from which 8 points separate them.
Yesterday the Rangers hosted the Rapid Vienna in Europe League.
In the meantime, Livingston continues its series of victories in the division remaining packed for six parties, with the Coach Holt who has yet to see a defeat since she replaced Kenny Miller over the last month.
Livingston takes chances against the little incisive guests
The Holt team should have been in advantage before the goal, with their immediate cause for many problems to Ranger.
Scott Robinson dug up but crossed his action in front of the mirror of the door and Alan Lithgow could just climb out the door after being inserted to meet Craig Halkett's head attack from the other side of the door.
The guests were pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could have made it difficult for visitors with flat rocks.
And it was so that the crucial goal was realized.
The Rangers granted a penalty knife and Livingston found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson were able to pass through Menga, which was able to signal from the center of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had ruled in the possession of the palace, but the defense of the host team had proved impenetrable, and the porter Liam Kelly had not had to worry too much,
This scheme was maintained during the second time, although Alfredo Morelos had committed Kelly to a parapet.
Scott Pittman saw his attempt to stop his goal of the Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow made a shot out of another Livingston game.
The cross took place in the Livingston area and were constantly neutralized, while two requests for strength, after Halkett's contrast with Glenn Middleton's replacement, were rejected.
A "fenominal" performance from Livingston - analysis
Lasadair Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a final result for Livingston.
Until the last player, they were exceptional, continuing to overcome expectations along this extraordinary trajectory.
Their game styles and their collaborators have changed little since they return to the maximum series, but you need to give Holt a lot of credit for how he managed to spare the team from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, head of a mostly organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in difficulty throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, were not inspired.
Despite the best performances at some point with Gerarrd, in this case they are well below these standards.
The last pass - only once they were able to enter the opposite area - can be seen as an alarm campaign for the Rangers, which is half-classified.
Erdogan received counter-reactions in Colombia
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29th) during the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It was on the last day of the controversial visit to Germany by President Erdogan to disseminating relations between NATO allies.
They have been discussed on issues such as human rights, freedom of print and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan is therefore heading towards Colombia for the opening of a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest group of Turkish people outside Turkey.
The police gave reasons for security the intervention to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters were present in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including many Kurds, have heard their voice, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The protests reflect the spread caused by a visitor who considered a hero by some Turks in Germany and called a retreat by others.
Road incident in Deptford: Cyclist dies against a car
A cyclist died in the encounter with a car in London.
The incident took place near the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a road trafficted by Deptford, in the south-eastern part of the city, at 10:15 BST about.
The car driver stopped and an ambulance arrived on the spot, but the man died on the ground.
The incident occurred months after another cyclist was dedecided, invested by a pirate on the street in Children Street, about a thousand from where the incident happened on Saturday.
The metropolitan police said that the authorities are working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads and bus stops have been blocked and car drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lardin Prison: six guards injured during a disorder
Six prison guards were injured during an inconsistencies in the maximum security male prison, reported to the prison office.
The tumor is discovered at the maximum safety male prison of Long Larsin in Worcestershire at 09:30 BST about Sunday and is still running.
Specialized "Tornado" agents were used to manage the tumor, which involves eight prisoners and is confined to a prison hall.
The agents were treated on site for mild facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: "The prison staff accurately formated was equipped to contain an incident currently under way at Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate the presence of violence in our prisons and all the officials will be notified to the police and may be sentenced to a longer sentence in prison."
Long Larsin prison is hosted by more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital care following the arrest of a prisoner.
And in October last year, anti-Smoss agents were called to intervene in prison to sit in a violent storm during which staff were attacked with billiard fires.
The Uragano Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with unforeseen floods (which could benefit the areas affected by drought)
It is rare that a tropical depression strikes Arizona, but it is precisely what will likely happen at the beginning of the next week when the last energy of the Rosa hurricane will cross the south-west of the desert, creating unforeseen floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued warnings of unforeseen floods for Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona until the Southern and Eastern Nevada, Southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will direct directly on Phoenix Tuesday, approaching Monday evening with mourning.
Phoenix's national meteorology service has reported on a tweet that "only ten tropical cycles have maintained the state of tropical storm or tropical depression within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane nearly 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the National Centre for Uregans provide precipitations between 5 and 10 cm, with small isolated peaks up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the south-western area, including central rock mountains and the Great Basin will receive 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with isolated peaks up to 10 cm.
For the foreign areas at risk of unforeseen floods, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Although the floods constitute a very serious problem, some of these precipitations will probably be positive because the south-western area is currently undergoing a period of drought.
At the Center for the Monitoring of Sicity, less than 40% of the Arizona is passing through a period of extreme Sicticity, the second maximum category," reported weather.com.
Initially, the path of the Rosa Urgano will be able to land on the ground through the peninsula of the Gulf of California of Mexico.
Rosa, who still held the Uragano force in the morning with winds at a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, in Mexico and is moving north to 12 miles per hour.
The storm will occur with the coldest waters of the Pacific, thus losing power.
So it is expected that it will arrive in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or in the evening of Monday.
The precipitations on the part of Mexico could be intense, creating a high risk of flooding.
"Precipitations are expected between 7.5 cm and 15 cm from Baja California to the north-western area of Sonora, with a maximum of 25 cm," said weather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning with tropical depression, so that she will be headed through Arizona and the southern Utah in late Tuesday evening.
"The main risk that may be caused by Rosa or her strategists is intense precipitation in Baja California, in the north-western area of Sonora and in the south-western desert area of the USA," he told the National Centre for Uregans.
It is expected that such storms can generate potentially lethal floods and streams of waste in the deserts, as well as beaches on mountain terrain.
Aggression of Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys in a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected attempted murder after a decade of shooting shots in Somerset.
The boy was injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at 04:00 BST about Saturday.
It was transferred to hospitals, where it remains under "stable".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in Radstock area, reported to the police of Avon and Somerset.
The authorities have called on anyone who may have taken over with the phone what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has suffered for the capture and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the explicit and offensive tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump during a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh had "pained for the capture and anger" of the Democratic Party during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh left before the Congress on Thursday, rejecting Christine Blasey Ford's charges of sexual violence against her decades ago, when they were still teenagers.
Ford also left the hearing defending himself from the charge.
The President said Saturday that "the American people could observe Kavanaugh's extraordinary quality and courage" on that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most expert of our time's law, a lawyer with undependable precedents in public service," he said in front of the majority of supporters in West Virginia.
The President made an indirect reference to the name of Kavanaugh by referring to the importance of republican influence in the midterm elections.
"For five weeks from one of the most important elections in our life.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm really going to do it," he said.
"For this fight strictly for exceptional candidates."
Trump said Democrats are engaged in "resisting and stopping."
The first basic procedural vote to the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh will be scheduled to take place not later than Friday, as a senior GOP assistant has said to the CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by earthquakes in Indonesia and tsunamis, and the number of victims continues to rise
At least 384 people have been killed, many scattered from where giants have fallen on the beaches, when a vast earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities have said Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palu Friday, when where up to 6 meters (18 feet) they fell down on the beach at the crepuscal, spreading through many people killing them and destroying anything on their way.
The tsunami has followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the threat of tsunamis is sort of yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and are not running immediately, thus becoming victims," said Jakarta Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, manager of the Indonesian disaster control agency BNPB.
"Tsunami has not only come, it has traversed with itself car, trunks, houses, it has hit anything on the farm," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami has moved into the sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mi/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people are out on trees to escape from tsunamis and are survivors, he explained.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Photos of planes published by the disaster agency have shown many destroyed buildings and shops, surrounding bridges and pools and a pool surrounded by water.
The escorts continued to excavate the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was perceived in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) has announced in a communication that the energy released from the strong ground on Friday was nearly 200 times the power of the nuclear bomb launched on Hiroshima during the second world war.
The city's geography, which is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have enhanced the size of the tsunami, said.
Nugroho described the damage as "aesthetics" and claimed that thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial centres and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found buried under the walls of broken buildings and added that 540 people remained injured and 29 were scattered.
Nugroho said that the victims and the damage could be larger along the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in a area called Dongrya, near the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely paralysed, with no information" from Dongrea, said Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living in the area," said the Red Cross, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading towards the areas involved.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could become even more serious," he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not informing them that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities said that the waves had arrived at the time the alarm was launched.
In a amateur video shared on the social media, a man is sitting on a top floor of a building that shouts excitedly to warn of the tsunamis coming to people on the street below.
A few minutes after a water wall, he sat down on the beach, walking through buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to authenticate the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a huge blackout that interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate relief operations.
According to the authorities, the army has begun to send air cargo with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the refugees still need food and other goods from first need.
The city airport has been opened only for grants and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has scheduled a visit to the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The budget for tsunami victims in Indonesia is over 800.
It's terrible.
Although the staff of the World Vision of Dodhea has managed to reach the city of Palu, where the employees have fled under repair from the roof in the court of their office, Doseba said during the tragedy they encountered scenes of destruction.
"They told me they've seen many destroyed houses," he said.
It's terrible.
Even while the relief groups have started the difficult start operations of the relief upgrades, there have been some regrets about the fact that foreign relief operators with extensive knowledge have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
The Indonesian regulations establish that funding, supplies and staff from the outside can only begin to arrive if the site of a disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, "O.K., it's a national disaster," we can accept international assistance, but the status has not yet been defined."
The second night in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday, friends and family members of the dispersion still maintained the hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that eased the stories of natural disasters.
Saturday a child was pulled out by a truck.
On Sunday, the nurses released a woman who had been locked under the macaroni for two days with her mother's body attached.
Gendon Subandono, the founder of the Indonesian national team of parapendo, had trained for Asian Games that had ended this month in Indonesia two of the dispersion pilots.
Others among the people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandaji, were her students.
"As they grow up in the parapet sector, I am carrying my emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours following the release of the news about the Roa Roa Hotel's scroll inside the parapendio community, he had unexpectedly sent messages via WhatsApp to Palu's competitors, who were participating in the beach festival.
His messages, however, were stopped by a single sign of grey spot instead of two blue signs.
"I think it means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Ruban thieves $26,750 during a bank repair at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning the thieves stole $26,750 from Brink's operator who was refurbished a bank at Newport on the Level, and was at a press release from Newport's police department.
The driver of the vehicle was driving a junkie in the entertainment center and was preparing to deliver another money, said researcher Dennis McCarthy in the communiqué.
While he was busy, another man "swiped at the back of Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money for delivery.
Some witnesses have identified several suspects who fled the crime scene while reporting, but the police have not specified the number of people involved in the matter.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the offenders is invited to contact the Newport police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes its name in Ye
The Kanye West rapper is changing his name in Ye.
In announcing Saturday the change of the name on Twitter, he wrote: "The person formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, has been nicknamed Ye for a long time and has used the nickname as title of his eight album, which was released in June.
The change took place before his participation at Saturday Night Live, where he will present his new album, Yandhi.
It replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who has cancelled his participation for "emotional reasons", said the creator of the show.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West stated in advance that the word contains a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and meaning 'to' said West at the beginning of the year, talking about the title of his album with the Radio Big Boy.
"Who are you, we are, it's us.
We've been through Kanye, which means the only, just Yes - the reflection of our goodness, our misfortune, our confusion, of everything.
The album is more than a reflection of who we are."
It's just one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
An ex-laborator of West, JAY-Z, has also changed his name with or without care and capital letters.
Mexico's elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn not to use the army against the civilian population
Mexican elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use the military force against the civilian population, during the 50th anniversary of a bloody protest against the students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelco Square that "never use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
The soldiers were shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when left students were taking their feet throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by expanding monthly subsidies to students and learning more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities push young people towards criminal gangs.
The US should double the funding for the IA
While China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the funds devoted to research in this field, says the investor and operator of IA Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the announcements by various U.S. government groups about IA, although in the USA there is generally no formal IA strategy.
In the meantime, China has presented its programme last year: it aims to be the country No. 1 in IA innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget in the search for the IA would be a good start to consider that all other countries are far behind the US and we need a new revolution in the IA," said Lee.
The duplication of funding could double the chances that the next major success in the IA sector will be achieved in the USA, Lee told the CNBC during an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month from the editor's house Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synoving Ventures, who invested in one of the major IA companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, the Mellon University Carnegie has worked on an IA system that has hit Otello's American player with the highest score and has subsequently been head of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese section of Google.
Lee remembered previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when you'll have the next one, so you can identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get funds from the government, Lee said.
"It's not China that's leading academic leaders, they're multinational," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have taken on lighting from universities to work on IA projects.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could help the US to boost its efforts in the area of IA.
"I think the green cards should be offered automatically to doctors in IA," he explained.
The Chinese Council of State has published its programme for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to those who work in academic institutions, as the National Sciences Foundation and other governmental organizations distribute funds to researchers in the United States, the poor quality of academic work is lower in China, explained Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the Department of Defence of the United States has established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, involving industrial partners and universities, and the White House has announced the formation of a Special Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month the DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in research on IA.
At the same time, the US order to create a National Commission for the Safety of Artificial Intelligence has not registered activities for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum for the change in the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on the possible change in the name of the country in the Northern Republic of Macedonia, a mosque that would resolve the long-standing debate with Greece that has blocked its requests for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its neighbours constitutes a pretence on its territory and has put the flag on Macedonia's entry to NATO and the EU.
The two governments have signed an agreement in June on the basis of the new name proposed, but nationalists believe that the change should damage the ethnic identity of the Macedonian majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote for the referendum and the polling campaign raised doubts about the possibility that the flow would reach at least 50% of the required for the referendum's validity.
The question on the referendum record is as follows: "It is in agreement with NATO and the EU and with the agreement with Greece."
Supporters for the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is the price to pay so that Macedonia can be admitted to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of the former Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for Macedonia's young people, so that they can live freely under the European Union's exile because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament said that they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it final.
The change in the name would require a majority of two-thirds in the paradigm.
The State Electoral Commission stated that there had been no reports of irregularity until 13:00.
However, the flow was only 16% compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters had expressed their vote.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, a capital elector, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko, voted for the referendum in Macedonia on the change in the name of the country which would open the door to NATO accession and the European Union in Struca, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Paramento in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, was preparing a small space and installing seats in front of the tents mounted by those who want to boot the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter high-end, not for the service door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have a dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China or Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO's accession will bring the necessary investments in Macedonia, which will record a rate of unemployment of more than 20%.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30% and 43% of the voters would have participated in the referendum - a percentage below the rate requested.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia indicated that 57% of the interviewees planned to vote Sunday.
Of this 57%, 70% said he would vote for the yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the flow must be more than 50% more than one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious attack on the government's policies since it settled in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero del Manchester City marks a goal avoiding the entire defence of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took part in the defence of Brighton during the win game for 2-0 from Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look extremely easy to sign his point at 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a half-field passage at the beginning of the action.
He moved between three Brighton defenders before catching himself on the free field.
Aguero has therefore been found near four green yellows.
He humiliated a defense before crossing different sides at the border of the Brighton area.
So he made a left-hand pass, where he found Sterling.
The English attacker used the first touch in area to restore the ball to Aguero, which used the right foot to beat the Bridgeton Matthew Ryan's port with a right arrow on the network.
"I'm having problems at my feet" said the journalists to the mayor of the City, Pep Guardiola.
"We talked about playing it 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he was able to sign at that time."
But it was Sterling who initially brought Sky Blues into the fight for the Premier League.
The gol has arrived at 29 minutes.
Agero got the ball deep in the Brighton field.
He sent a beautiful filter ball along the left side of Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before leading Sterling to the second step.
Sky Blues attacker pulled the ball in the network shortly before leaving the camp.
The City will fight against the Hoffeneheim in the corner of the Champions League at 12:55 a.m. at the Rhine-Neckar-Arena Stadium of Sinsheim in Germany.
Scherzer wants to play track against Rockies
With the Nationals removed from playoff, there was no reason to force another start.
But as always competitive Scherzer hopes to be able to launch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, which keep an advantage of a game on Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won at least a resale with a victory of 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday evening, but they still hope to get their title in the first division.
"Even if we play without purpose, at least we can be able to launch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team that will play will probably be at the maximum level of all this year.
And why don't you ever want to ride?"
The Nationals still have to announce a first launch for Sunday, but they are said to be inclined to let it be Scherzer to launch in similar situations.
Scherzer, who would be the first launcher for the 34th time, has held a launch session on Thursday and would be the first launcher in its normal rest Sunday.
The Washington launch is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeout in 220 2/3 inning for this season.
Trump a radun in West Virginia
The President made an indirect reference to the situation surrounding his candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking of the importance of the republican influence in the midterm elections.
"All we have done is played in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important choices in our life.
It's one of the great, great -- I'm not a candidate, but I'm really giving myself to do this for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "We see this horrible group of radical democratics, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using any necessary means, it is possible to see cathtic, mechanicality.
They don't care who can hit, who must work to get power and control, because that's what they want, power and control and we won't give them."
Democrats, he said, have been given the task of "resisting and stopping."
"And it's been possible to see it in the last four days," he said, calling democratics "crazy, dirty, mechanical and bugarian."
He referred to the Senate Commission for Justice with democratic Senator Diane Feinstein on behalf of the Commission, throwing strong fish between the public.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you cross the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I look like a--that was a bad language of the body--the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
The laburist party is no longer very tolerant.
Don't tolerate people who say what they think
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, it was not a great surprise.
After all, I am the last of a series of members of the labor parliament to which I have been informed that I am not welcome, and all because they have said what they have been thinking.
My colleague, Mr Ryan, received a similar treatment because he was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement has criticized me for expressing my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically all arguments similar to those on which Jeremy was in conflict with the previous leaders.
The announcement for the meeting of the Nottingham East Labor on Friday states that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a member of the parliament of the local Labour Party, the meetings on Friday evening were exactly that way.
Today, however, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a 'more kind and short-lived' policy has been forgotten for a long time, if it has never been remembered.
It has become increasingly obvious that different viewpoints are not tolerated in the lobbyist party and every opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable or less for the party leadership.
All of this began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the party, and my colleagues whom I had previously thought to share a similar political vision began to expect an investment of a trend on my part and that I had taken positions that I would never accept, which was either national security or the single European market.
When I speak in public - and it does not really matter what I say - I am following indictive attacks on social media that call for my withdrawal, accusing the centre's policy and telling me that I should not be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I am sure to be more fortunate than my fellow Members because the comments made to me by the leaders tend to be political.
I am impressed by the professionality and the determination of those colleagues who have to face a torrent of harassment on a sexist or racist basis every day but who are not left to be intimidated.
One of the most disturbing aspects of this policy era is the normalization of levels of abuse.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the laburist party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with every motivation to challenge or change the rules of selection, the party is restricted.
In the last two years, I have been given many advice, inviting me to lower my head, not openly expressing my views and everything would be "good".
But it's not to do this that I'm involved in politics.
Since I came into the labyrinth 32 years ago, caused by the government of Thatcher who had left my class of secondary school literally to fall into pieces, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, as local councillor or government minister.
I have never hidden my political opinions, not even the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could remain in some way upset by my political positions and the points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the movement on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is precipitating to a Brexit that will damage our families, companies and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy talking about my loyalty to the head of a laborist party.
But actually the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, who are members of the laburist or less party: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunity will stop me from acting in defence of those I consider to be your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: An Ayr scaled the classification
Two late attempts might in some way have weakened the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr has deserved the triumph in this extremely fun party of Tennent's campaign day.
They're now at the top of the class, the only team of ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense, as well as their audacity, which forced the house team and the coach Peter Murchied had all the reasons to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in our parties so far and we are still involved, so I must be happy," said the coach.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "It is important to recognize the merit of Ayr, that they have taken better advantage of our opportunities."
Grant Anderson's target at 14 minutes, converted by Frazier Climo, but brought the Ayr to advantage, but a yellow cardboard for the Scottish player Rory Hughes, who was robbed by the Warriors for the game, has allowed Melrose to talk the numbers and Jason Baggot has acquired an unconverted target.
Climate has increased the distance of the Ayr with a rise before, right in half time, to sign and thus to convert a target from just to take the Ayr to the range of 17-5.
But Melrose started well the second time and the target of Patrick Anderson, converted by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
So there was a long interruption due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was made to stand, and the Ayr was re-balanced in favour thanks to a target of Stafford McDowell converted from Climo.
Ayr Blair Macpherson's successor, therefore, received a yellow cartel and Melrose paid the man more with an unconverted target of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a moment of great pressure.
The house team is back, however, and when Sruan Hutchinson received a yellow cardboard for a contrast with Air without a ball, from the touch of the rigor, MacPherson signed a touch down behind the bridge in advance of Ayr.
Climo turned, as he had done almost since reopened, after Rowe had collected the knife from David Armstrong's area and sent the flanger Gregor Henry to search for the fifth target of the house team.
Star of Still Game seeking a new career in the restaurant sector
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, decided to move to the hotel sector after discovering that he was appointed director of a restaurant company with a license.
The 56th actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the BBC popular show, who writes and interprets along with long-term partner Greg Hemphil.
The couple announced that the next nine series would also be the final of the show and Kiernan seems to be thinking about a life after Craiglang.
Based on official reports, he is the Director of Affygorn Limited.
The actor refused to release statements, although a source of Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan wanted to involve himself in the "prosperity of the restaurant" of Glasgow."
"The sea is ours": Bolivia without fail on the sea hope a court will open the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol a general shipyard covered with tartage in La Paz.
Public buildings reflect an ocean blue flag.
The ships from the Lake Titicaca to the river of the Amazon are decorated with the motto: "The sea is our right.
Recovery is a duty."
In the whole of Bolivia, without fail on the sea, the memory of the Persian coast and now in hand to Chile after a bloody conflict over the resources of the 19th century is still alive, as well as the desire to search again the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have reached the highest level in decades, while Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the slant, a spirit of unity and seriousness and is obviously waiting for the outcome with a positive attitude," explained Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the judgment of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Aia Court will welcome Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent dialogue, Chile is obliged to negotiate, guaranteeing Bolivia a breach on the State's sea of competence.
Evo Morales, the Indian charismatic president of Bolivia - who is facing a controversial battle for the elections next year - has a lot to do with the sentence of Monday.
"We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will find it difficult to decide in favour of Bolivia and that it would not change if it did.
The United Nations body, located in the Netherlands, has no power to assign the Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the final proceedings indicates that the case was 'not complicated', said Paz Zárate, an international Chilean expert.
And long to advance the Bolivian cause, the past four years might have been delayed.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
The Belgering Retort of Morale has failed any good remaining intention of Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but it will be very difficult to maintain the discussions as soon as possible.
The two countries did not exchange Ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, the representative of Bolivia to the Aia, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was particularly secret.
On Monday, Bolivia will be able to "be an excellent opportunity in relations with Chile" and will have the opportunity to "end up to 139 years of disputes with mutual advantage", he explained.
Calzadilla also denied he Morales - one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - he is using the maritime issue as political eschamotege.
"Bolivia will never deny its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen without trust in the United States
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his nation would never commit nuclear disarmament if it could not trust Washington first.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to keep faith in the promises made during Singapore's summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments arrive at the time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be intended to reopen diplomatic treaties in status after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
It explains that it is an "inlution" that the continuation of sanctions and the opposition of the United States to a declaration of the end of the Korean War can never put North Korea into practice.
Washington is determined to release the declaration without first Pyongyang taking important disarmament actions.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is a widespread scepticism on the fact that Pyongyang is intended to give up an arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare the second summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion sfilates present the latest trend in huge capillaries that will soon be in a high fashion store near you
If you want to expand your collection of puzzles or completely block the rays of the sun, do not look for more.
The Valentino and Thom Browne stylists have pointed out that they have passed over a series of top-level puzzles for their spring-state collection 2019 that have impressed the world of fashion at Paris Fashion Week.
Very few practical hats have angered Instagram this summer and these stylists have sent their enthusiast creations on the pastry.
The main piece of Valentino was an excavated beige hat decorated with a large board similar to a pume that cuts the heads of the models.
Other supersede accessories included indignated angles, a stragon hat and an anaanas - but they were not designed to hold your head in the heat.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of curious masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colored masks have a kukuit lab and look more like a Hannibal Lecter representation than at high angles.
A creation resembled a complete for immersion with masks and glasses, while another seemed to be a frozen rabbit.
And if you continue with the huge statements of style, you're lucky.
The observer of the style predicts that the huge berths could reach you in the streets of the high fashion.
The outer hats arrived on the "La Bomba" boat with a wider roof over a meter that had been seen on anyone, from Rihanna to Emily Rattakowski.
The label of worship behind the very little practical hat that has invaded the social media has sent another huge creation in the pastel: a beach bag with a large flag almost as much as the usual model than the door.
The red-coloured orange box, bordered with brown and a white leather handle, was the strong piece of the 2019 spring-state collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera at Paris Fashion Week.
The celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect these big beach hats and boots to come in luxury shops next summer, because the stylist has had such a great impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for superior accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
The independent Scottish schools maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this has continued in 2018 with another series of exceptional results from the exams, enhanced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other collective efforts.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for higher education, chosen careers and their place in the world as global citizens.
As a sector of education capable of developing and adopting a personalized school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and demanding subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language that he understands, the message will reach his brain.
If you speak him in his mother tongue, the message will reach his heart."
It is a powerful reminder of the fact that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to create relationships of trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are above the graduates, with the highest percentages of success within independent schools.
68% of the students who have studied foreign language have won the maximum votes.
The data collected from the 74 SCIS school members showed that 72% of students received the highest vote in Chinese, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French, and 63% of those who studied Spanish received the highest vote.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as fundamental skills for children and young people, who will undoubtedly need them in the future.
Currently languages, as a matter choice, are considered at the same level of STEM materials (scientific, technology, technology and mathematics) in the study plans of independent institutions and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the United Kingdom Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that the reasons why employees have indicated for the difficulty in covering jobs are attributable in 17% of cases to a lack of language skills.
For this reason, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With increasingly working opportunities that require language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you learn a second language, you will have an effective advantage in the future with a competence to live like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically bring a multilingual person to the front of competition.
At a survey of over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% was unable to speak a foreign language at a sufficient level to maintain a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
That is why investing in language learning is so important to children today.
The knowledge of more languages, in particular those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a valid employment.
In Scotland, every school will be different in taught languages.
Various schools will focus on the most classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as the Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be different languages including your choice in independent schools, with the teacher staff specialized in this area.
Independent Scottish schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the necessary skills for success, whatever their future.
It is not possible to deny at this time, in a global trading system, that languages continue to be fundamental for the country's future, and this must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "International communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You need to do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will start with Sunday Lakers in San Diego
The waiting is almost over for fans who expect LeBron James to make his first entry with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers' alleleator Luke Walton announced that James will play in the pre-commissioned opening match against the dinner Nuggets in San Diego.
But it still has to be fixed for how many minutes it will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
The Lakers' reporter Mike Trudell has tweeted that James will probably play for a limited number of minutes.
After the start of the week, James was asked how his plans were for the program of six pre-negotiated Lakers.
"At this point in my career I don't need friendly parties to prepare me," he said.
The moment of the rally a West Virginia of Trump, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump from the beginning of this day at Wheeling, West Virginia, in a radun raid.
This is the first round of five planned for Trump next week, including stopped in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of confirmation suspended for its choice to cover the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump will try to create support for the next midterm elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress in the November elections.
What will be the Trump commission now and how can you follow it online?
The Tromp commission in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can follow the Trump commission in West Virginia online through live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about the hearings of this week of the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who have become the subject of sexual violence charges with an early confirmation vote of the Senate in custody for a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
But the main purpose of this series of commissions is to help the Republicans who must face the November elections to get a little boost.
Thus, President Trump's campaign stated that these five rounds in the coming week are about to "give energy to volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of the Members' Senate and Chamber," while in Reuters.
"The control of the Congress is so decisive for its programme that the president will travel to as many states as possible while we are in the most busy season of the campaign," said a representative of the Trump campaign in Reuters, asking to remain anonymous.
Programmed for Wesbanco Arena of Wheeling, the committee could call supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the coverage of Pittsburgh's media," being in West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the State where he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate to the Republican Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is in line with the surveys.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, while in Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the US team shows the courage to fight to keep the hopes alive until Sundays alone
After three sessions in a single sense, the Thursday afternoons could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating pendulum motorcycle is a fully invented sports concept in which players firmly believe and never like in a career like these.
So where would the bike be now?
"They had a advantage of six points and now they're four, so I'll say we're keeping a bit of motorcycles," Jordan Spieth said while he was away at the end of the day.
Europe is, of course, benefiting from four points ahead with other twelve in the game.
The Americans feel like they've got some wind in favor, as Spieth said, and have a lot to be hoped for, not from the last form of Spieth and Justin Thomas that have played together all day and every three points on four.
Spieth was thrown from tea to green and he's giving the example.
The guise of partying became stronger hand than the next game, deepening a crucial hole to compare the accounts to the four, when he and Thomas were under two points after two.
His punt that made them win the game at the 15th floor was picked up with a similar noise, which tells you that he believes that the American team is not yet out of the race.
"You really have to worry about your party," said Spieth.
It's all that each of these players can do now.
18 boots to make a point.
The only players with multiple points of Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the uncomplicated version of Ryder Cup.
The strange but devout couple of Europe are four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple not to pull a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the nine o'clock Friday morning.
That way, and the way their energy seems to flow from and towards the Czech people is strengthened by the certainty that they are players to play Sunday, and there would not be a more popular player of Fleetwood or Molinari to suggest a possible European victory while the sun goes down on Le Golf National.
You prefer both at the same time your different shoes.
However, the speeches of European glory are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon got to Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-ball in the morning, when he was married to Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogets on the first nine holes have put the Spanish and Swedish into a hole from which they have not even been able to resuscitate long enough.
But Sunday, there's no one to help you get out of your mouth.
The furballs and fursomas are so fascinating to observe from close to the interaction between couples, the advice they give and the way the strategy can change at a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has gained an important advantage on the final day, but this forum session has shown that the US team has the courage to fight, some of which, in particular the stateside, have doubted.
Europe with a 10-6 advantage on the final day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a solid advantage on the final day of Ryder Cup after having completed the football games and Saturdays with a 10-6 advantage on the United States.
The inspired couple composed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the load with two victories on a Tiger Woods in difficulty to bring the score to Le Golf National at four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, in an attempt to preserve the trophie lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an irregular American team in the morning's fourballs, winning 3-1.
The United States has more resistance in the forums, winning two parties, but they have not been able to recover the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from the 12 parties each Sunday to keep the trophi.
Fleetwood is the first European east to win four points of line while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sentimental weekend, are the second couple to win four points from the four opening parties in the history of Ryder Cup.
After he shot Woods and Patrick Reed at the Fourballs, they worked in a great way to beat down a Woods and the American exorbitant Bryson Dechambeau with another cleaner 5&4.
Woods, who moved for two Saturday parties, showed occasional sprees of excellence but lost 19 of his 29 parties in the fourballs and in the foursomes and seven rows.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning's fourballs, returned to the side of his partner Henrik Stanson in the foursomes to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and three of the world's rankings.
However, Europe did not achieve all the expected results in a pleasant and rewarding day in the south-west of Paris.
The three great winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the reference for the Americans with two Saturday points.
They gained a great victory 2&1 on Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourballs and then returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the fours, losing the two opening boxes.
Only two times in the history of Ryder Cup a team is returned from a four-point discount passing to the individual, although as a titler, Furyk's team needs only one pair to defend the trophie.
After being the second best for two days, however, a Sunday contract seems to be out of their reach.
North Korea has turned its back on unilateral disarmament without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea has told the United Nations that the maintenance of sanctions was countering the country's confidence in the United States, which in these circumstances would have been totally refused to abandon its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho said on occasion of the General Assembly of the World Organisation that North Korea has adopted "important measures of good will" over the past year, such as the halt to nuclear and missile tests, the detonation of the nuclear test site and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see any answers according to the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there will be no security in our national security, and in these circumstances we absolutely refuse to disarm ourselves unilaterally for the first time."
Although Ri has re-used his comments on Washington's resistance to a "in phases" denuclearization with which North Korea would be awarded on the basis of gradual actions, its statement was important because it has not completely rejected unilateral denuclearization as already done by Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump during the first absolute meeting between a US president in charge and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed himself to working towards the "nuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee North Korean security.
North Korea sought a formal end to the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States stated that Pyongyang must give up his nuclear weapons first.
Washington was also opposed to appeals to promote the strict international sanctions imposed in North Korea.
"The United States insists on the need to "have first denuclearization" and to increase the level of pressure with sanctions in order to achieve their purpose in a coherent manner and argues against the "declaration of the end of the war", Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can put us in trouble is an illusion of those who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is increasing our trust."
Ri did not refer to programmes of a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the US leader had announced to the United States at the beginning of the week.
On the contrary, the Minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the contrary of this issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be at this point of death."
But also, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from that of last year's General Assembly of the United Nations, when he said it was inevitable that the US territory would be targeted by North Korea's missions after "the president of the evil" Trump had called Kim a "missile man" committed in a suicide mission.
Before the United Nations Tromp, which last year threatened to "destroy North Korea completely", he re-enacted Kim for her courage in pursuing the path of disarmament, but said that there must be much more to be done and that sanctions will remain in force until North Korea's denuclearization.
Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a deadline, saying, "If we want two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia say that the UN Security Council should award Pyongyang for the actions taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that "The respect for the sanctions of the Security Council must continue with force and without exception until full, final and certified decolonization is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously supported North Korea's control sanctions in 2006 in an attempt to focus on the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri at the side of the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again the following month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip has not gone well.
It was distributed by Pyongyang in July by claiming that progress had been made, but a few hours after North Korea had accused him of introducing "requests by Gangster."
North Korea was committed during a meeting this month with Moon to shut down a Missile Site and a nuclear complex if the United States had adopted "compliant measures."
He said Kim had explained to him that the "compliant measures" he wanted were security guarantees to which Trump had committed in Singapore and actions to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students follow a course on how to rest sufficiently
A new course at Harvard University this year urged all its students to sleep more in an attempt to counter the growing culture of learning for all nights fed by caffeine.
A university student noted that university students number one in the world often have no idea of the basic concepts of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed the course, which he considers to be the first such in the United States.
He had the idea of starting the course after a conference that had given rise to the impact of the lack of sleep on learning.
"At last a girl came from me and said to me, 'Why do you tell me this only now, when I'm last year?'
He said that no one had ever said anything about the importance of the dream, which I was very surprised," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, learned for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits can help academic and athletic performances, as well as improving general wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director General of the university's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were experiencing a severe sleep shortage during the week.
The course of an hour provides for a series of interactive activities.
In a section there is the image of a bedroom, where students can choose coffee, tea, ginnastic shoes and books to know the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performances are influenced by the lack of sleep, and the importance of a seral routine.
In another section, participants are explained how long-term sleep deficiency can increase the risk of heart attacks, ictus, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, therefore encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that students' behaviour will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the health effects of the choice to smoke cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride related to the "white night to study", there is still, he said, adding that modern technology and pressure on students make the lack of sleep a problem to continue to grow.
Sleeping enough and with a sound of good quality should be the "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, pussiness, anxiety, it explained and it should help to avoid growing because the lack of sleep leads the brain into an indigestion mode, making people constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student enrolled in the faculty of chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after following one of his lessons last year in Harvard during his first year.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course around the entire campus.
The next step, hopefully, will be to ask all students trained to follow a similar study program before enrolling in this competition institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set a watch for when they should go to bed, as well as for when they should wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can send the circadian rhythm in titt, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's gol under Gerrard's men
The Rangers had another attack of depression from outside the house with Dolly Menga's gol that belonged to the dissarticated team of Steven Gerarrd at a 1-0 battle in Livingston.
Ibrox's team was looking for the first victory outside the house from the triumph of 4-1 February in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team attacked Gerard's second defeat in 18 parties by trainer leaving his team at eight points from the leaders fleeing the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Hearts.
Menga has signed seven minutes before the interval and a short-smooth training of Rangers is never seem to be able to compare.
While Ranger now descends to sixth place, Livingston goes to third place, and only behind the Hibernian for a difference of gold.
And there may be further problems arriving for the Rangers after the Calum Spence guard was cured for a head injury due to an object apparently launched from outside the house.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which quickly exceeded Ayr in the semi-finals of Bethfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, has chosen the usual training that has cut a point to Hearts last week and would have been satisfied with the way his well-prepared team has focused its opponents on every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated for the possession of the ball, but Livingston used the balls better.
They could have signaled just two minutes later when Menga's first filter pass had sent Scott Pittman forward to Allan McGregor's door, but the central champion broke the opportunity.
A stone of punishment in the depths of Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only pull himself out on the second floor.
The Rangers took control, but it seems to be more hopeful than believing in their game in harsh areas.
Alfredo Morelos certainly considered it necessary to see a rise in the 15th after a meeting with Steven Lawless, but Archbishop Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian demands.
The Rangers managed to pull only twice in the door in the first time, but the former Ibrox Liam Kelly was not allowed to worry about Lassana Coulibaly's head attack and a white shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's opening hole at 34 minutes may have been unexpected, no one can deny that it was worth it for its commitment.
Once again the Rangers couldn't manage a flat foot in the depth of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher filtered the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm in choosing Menga for a clean conclusion.
Gerrard acted during the interval replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change had an almost immediate impact because the hall had a ball in Morelos, but the exceptional Kelly was hit by the door line to block it.
But Livingston has continued to traverse visitors exactly in the kind of game they love, with Lithgov and Halkett who collected a long ball after the other.
Holt's team may have increased the distance in the final stages, but McGregor was opposed to stopping Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
The replacement of Rangers Glenn Middleton has submitted a last request for strength after a confession with Jacobs but Thomson has rejected it again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Count Geiger
And now a page from our German "Sunday Morning": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today and the CONTEGGIO continues... the day the physical future of John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that made the device known as Geiger contactor.
A firm point of science since then, the Count Geiger has also become a pillar of pop culture, when in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," interpreted by these very credible cowlboy Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man, "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger contactor, used to identify radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these auriculars, you can really feel the effects of the atoms released from radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans says, "Yes, I'm getting out of here now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63th birthday.
But the invention that brings his name continues to live.
New anti-cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" evil cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" the evil cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the evil cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, and their alteration in laboratory
So they can "see" a common protein with many types of tumors and are then re-injected
An experimental test of this vaccine is giving promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize evil cells has seen her cancer to the eggs for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their modification to the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein with many types of cancer, called HER2, and so these cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute of the United States based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
The HER2 protein "increases the growth of various types of tumors", including that in the heart, the ovaries, the lungs and the colon, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure for the extraction of immune cells from patients to "instruct" them as to attack the tumour cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West runs into a pro-Trup diaphragm wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) after its appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was caught in the study during a Saturday Night Live score after a concluded performance during which US President Donald Trump said he would have applied in 2020.
After interpreting his third night song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a green MAGA, he began a campaign against the Democrats and resumed his support in Trump.
"I talk to white people many times and they say, "How do you like Trump, he's a racist!"
Well, if I'm worried about racism, I'd have gone from America a long time ago," he explained.
The SNL started the show with a scene that the protagonist was Matt Damon, in which Hollywood's star took over the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate's Justice Commission against the charges of sexual violence presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not transmitted, the registration of the Philippines in West was charged on social media by comic Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock himself is trying to get around West with the publication.
In addition, West lamented with the public that he had spent a bad time in the backstage because of his coat.
"They've bullied me in the backstage.
They said, "Don't go out with that brat. "
They've bulged me!
And then they told me I'm a marginal" he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the sleeping place?" and said "I'll wear the Superman handle because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go on?
Try love."
His comments have generated at least twice from the public, and the members of the SNL castle appear to be confused, said Variety, with a person who told the newspaper: "The only study is a deathly silence."
West was invited as a substitute for the last minute of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-fiant, rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West has won many concerts with a performance of the song I Love it, transpped by Perrier's bottle.
West has received support from the head of the TPUSA Conservatives Group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you FOR AVER TENUTO TESTING TO THE MASS."
But the director of the show Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "what is and this is simply wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his "art") that I think is covering up a malicious ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
And so are we," he added.
Before the show, rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the person previously known as Kanye West."
It is not about the first artist to change his name and is following Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The friend rapper, Snoop Dogg was called Snoop Lion and naturally the missing music legend Prince, who had changed his name in a symbol and so in the artist previously known as Prince.
Charge of attempted murder for reception in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after being arrested at a restaurant in Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The defendant will have to present himself to the press on Belfast Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Office of the Ministry of Public Affairs.
The Star of Spade Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Mascoline
Kit Harington is known for his role as fighter Jon Snow in the violent series of medieval Fantasy Throne of Spade.
But the 31st actor attacked the stereotype of the male hero, claiming that such soils on the screen often believe that boys must be hard to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something went wrong" and reflected on how to handle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married with the Co-star of Spade, 31 years old, has allowed herself to worry a lot about this problem.
'I personally worry, very much at the moment - what was our mistake with masculinity?' he said.
'What have we taught men as they grew up in terms of the problem we now see?'
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity thanks to its extremely male characters.
He continued: 'What is born, and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, what makes boys think they should be in this particular way of being a man?
I think this is one of the great dilemmas of our time - how can we change things?
'Cause of course something went wrong for young people.'
In the course of the interview he also admitted that he would not interpret any prequal or sequence of Spade Throne once the series ended the next state, saying that he had finished with battle camps and horses.
Starting from November, Kit will interpret the main role in the Revival of True West of Sam Shepard, the history of a cinematographic producer and his brother, who is a rapist.
The actor recently revealed that he considered the meeting with his wife Rose the best thing that happened with Tron di Spade.
"I met my wife during this series, so she gave me in this sense my future family, and my life from now on," he explained.
Rose interpreted Ygritte, the object of Jon Snow's love, the character of Kit, in the winning fantasy series to Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in the custody of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China refers to an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of people affected by HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by these pathology, according to sources of health authorities.
About 40,000 new cases have already been reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are due to sexual transmission, which marks a change in the past.
In some regions of China, HIV has spread as a result of infected blood transfusions in the past.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, according to the Chinese health authorities said during a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people affected by HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 units.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an urgent problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Self-sustainment was decapitated in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the country's traditional values, some studies estimate that 70-90% of men having sexual relations with other men eventually marry women.
Many transmissions of diseases are caused by inadequate protection during sexual relations within these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its commitment to the management of the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the staff has been able to trace the data of the GOP senators, and speaks of "hazardous bugs" and "cospiration theories".
On Saturday, the Member of the United States filed charges against a member of its staff concerning the publication of personal information from three United States senators in the pages of Wikipedia of the legislators.
The democratic member of Los Angeles said that the statements were promoted by opinionists and websites of the "alala on the right".
"Bugie, buggy, and even disgusting bugs" said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The information published would include the addresses and telephone numbers of Utah's US senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published online on Thursday, released by an anonymous member of the Campidoglio during a hearing of a committee of experts on sexual violence charges against the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The news escape occurred after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address identifying the source of posts has been associated with the Waters office and have provided information about a member of the Waters staff.
"This infodated accusation is completely false and an absolute fool," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been brought to mind as a result of these false and trendy accusations, has not been in any way responsible for avoiding such information.
This infodated accusation is completely false and absolutely stupid."
Waters' statement quickly generated online criticism from the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This silence is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"That means you don't have a character to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he should not get angry.
It doesn't have to be a provocation.
He must not question the reasons of the accused.
It must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters to the criticism of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during the hearing of Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a candidate who is currently publishing Waters in midterm elections, expressed his views on Twitter.
"Enorm is confirmed," she tweeted.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had warned "the competent authorities and the forces of the order of these trends.
"We will do so that the responsible ones are mistaken," he continued, "and they must respond to all their dangerous and harmful actions for all members of my staff."
Review of Johnny English yet hits the beach parody with a Rowan Atkinson subdimensional
It has now become used to look for references to Brexit in every new film with a British touch and this seems to apply to this revival of Johnny English's action media, started in 2003 and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English - The rebirth.
Will the ride of autoironia on how many ships we make will be the new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English from the rubber face and the eyes out of the orbits obtained his license to incriminate things for the second time - and his name indicates more than anything about a comical creation developed for countries of non-englophone film producers.
Obviously it is the secret agent who, despite his strange glamour claims, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pizza of that type that has contributed with a unique note to the theme of Gloria’s opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
It is an initial character based on a mysterious traveler and international man who once interpreted atkinson's forgotten television ads by Barclaycard, who left the chaos behind him.
There are one or two nice moments in this last issue of Johnny English.
I liked Johnny English who was approaching the helicopter wearing a medium-wave armor, and the wings quickly swirled against his helmet.
The gift of Atkinson for physical commedia is obvious, but the humor seems to be quite subtle and surprisingly superfluous, especially now that film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now offer the committee as an ingredient.
The humor seems direct to children rather than to adults and for me, Johnny English's pazish adventures are not as original and targeted as the gaggs of Atkinson's moved films when he interprets Mr. Bean.
The premise of real estate is now the fact that Great Britain is in serious danger.
An computer hacker has been infiltrated into the UK's supersecret web network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the field, with the agent being charged, a very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the gosh that makes the vase work for a prime minister who is suffering from political incompatibilities: Emma Thompson does his best with this similar character-Teresa May but there is not much to work on in the copy.
His intelligence consultants inform him that each active beach has been compromised and that he should call someone who has already retired.
And this means that poor Johnny English, who now works as school director in a chic settlement, but who also participates in official lessons on how to be an undercover agent: here you can appreciate some nice gag, when English offers a school of Rock type screening course.
English is rebuffed to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meets with his former sufferer partner Bugh, re-interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a role of the girl of the high society in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit disappointed.
So Batman and Robin of the disasters for His Majesty's secret services are again in action, to meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful dead woman, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the first minister is falling dangerously in the network of the charismatic billionaire of technology that claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Great Britain: the left Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their hate of ridiculous adventures: wired by cameras, they fire in a French restaurant; they fire the hell by sneaking in on Volta luxury yachts and English creates pure anarchy while trying to use a virtual reality mask to take a demestigrate with the house of Volta.
All the scenes are certainly ideal for the last sequence, but for the sake of dignity and excellence, there is a bit of TV for children throughout history.
Everything's pretty modest.
And how did it happen with Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help but think: the British cinema industry couldn't assign Rowan Atkinson a role that makes justice to his talent?
The Laburist Party refuses to be preparing a plan so that the British can work four days a week but be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's working party is considering a radical program that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, just being paid for five.
The party would like the main companies to transfer the savings obtained by the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to the workers by offering them an extra day of rest.
In this way employees could enjoy a three-day weekend, maintaining the same pay.
Some sources have stated that the idea would be compatible with the party's economic programme and with the plans to move the country in favour of workers.
The transition to a four-day day was delayed by the union convention as a way for workers to benefit from the economy in evolution.
An senior member of the laburist party said to The Sunday Times: "By the end of the year, the announcement of a revision of the political line is being made."
"It won't happen from day to day, but a working week of four days is an online appeal with the approach of the party to rebalance the economy for the workers, as well as its industrial strategy together."
The Laburist Party would not be the first to support a similar idea, since the Green Party promised a working week of four days in the general electoral campaign of 2017.
In any case, this ambition does not please the time of united support of the Laburist Party.
A spokesman from the Laburist Party said: "A working week of four days is not part of the political line of the party and is not currently the subject of discussion."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the labyrinth conference last week to give special attention to the vision of a socialist revolution in the economic field.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "directors without face" and "speculators" in public services companies.
The plans of the shadow Chancellor also imply that the current shareholders of water distribution companies may not recover their entire stock package, since the laborist government could implement "deductions" on the basis of alleged illegal behaviour.
It has also confirmed plans to include employees in business management councils and to create inclusive participation funds in order to transfer the 10 per cent net equity of private-sector enterprises to employees, which end up in annual dividends up to $500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could make them change their idea
The FBI's investigation in the field of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh sent the final vote for his appointment to the Supreme Court at least one week, and raised the question whether the findings of the government agency could influence or not any of the Republican senators in providing their support.
In an interview that will take place on Sunday afternoon, the representative of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it is possible for the FBI to bring something into the light to make them change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more openly than his colleague in South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said it while I was listening, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after he did it, who had come out of that charge, I said, 'Did you do it?'
It has been resolved, determined, irrevocable."
Graham's vote, however, seems to be locked in the rock.
"I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and they could resist a bomb test case," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has energyly denied it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And anyone named her couldn't have tried it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything else in change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This New York Saturday will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that sees the exhibition of a remarkable star carroller and has an equally exciting mission: to end poverty in the world.
At the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people reversing on Central Park's Great Law not only to enjoy performance like those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real purpose of the event, which will end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless it was willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the public of the concert had to carry out a series of tasks, or "actions" as volunteers, send email to a world leader, make a phone call or any other significant way to help raise awareness about their purpose of eliminating poverty.
But exactly how successful has the Global Citizen Festival now remained 12 years to achieve its intended goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is really a good way to persuade people to ask for an action call, or is it just another example of the so-called "clictivism"- people who feel they really make the difference simply by signing an online petition or by sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported that more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters have been operating for a variety of purposes.
He said that these actions have contributed to calling for world leaders to announce commitments and policies of more than $37 billion, aimed at influencing the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In the first year of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and ads withdrawn from their shares, which have already been discarded or used as at least $10 billion funds.
The group estimates that the funds for protected capital have so far had a direct impact on around 649 million people in the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives with headquarters in the United Kingdom, committed to "help children grow to the maximum of their potential", with a commitment to provide Rwanda with $35 million to contribute to eliminating malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and Global Citizen just like you, we can make social injustice or malnutrition a sign of page in history," said The Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions were implemented, it called on the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the elegation of funds for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through interventions in favour of nutrition.
In response to one of the FAQs present on his website, he asked: "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen answered: "It will be a long and dry journey - sometimes we will fall and fall.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartred movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monée are some of those who will be present this year in New York, which will be presented by Debora-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to implement "a block" and stop Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
Washington may, "if necessary", appeal to its Navy to prevent Russian energy sources from being available on the market, including the Middle East, revealed the Secretary of the Interior of the United States of America Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke noted that Russia's involvement in Syria - in particular, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a researcher to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East lies in the fact that they want to negotiate for energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern follicle of Europe," he said.
And, according to the officials, there are ways and means to make you face it.
"The United States has the opportunity, thanks to the Navy, to ensure that sea routes remain open and, if necessary, to implement a shiplock, so that their energy is not placed on the market," he said.
Zinke turned to the events hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that defines the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, the same thing.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to make financial burdens and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "low-floating", with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made because the Trump administration was involved in a mission to strengthen the export of its natural gas liquid in Europe, and to replace Russia, an option which is the most economic for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including the same president of the United States Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from North Stream 2, a "inappropriate" gas pipeline project that, according to Trump, has made Berlin "prigionary" in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that North Stream 2, with 11 billion dollars, designed to double the capacity of that existing up to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project of nature.
The Kremlin aims that Washington’s persistent opposition to the project is guided simply by economic reasons and is an example of slow competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure and that consumers should have the option of choosing suppliers," said the Minister of Energy Russian Aleksandr Novak, following a meeting held in September in Moscow with Rick Perry, Secretary of Energy of the United States.
The U.S. position has highlighted the negative reaction of Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's industrial point organization, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has asked the United States to remain outside the energy policies of the European Union and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I see it as a big problem that a third State interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempp, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take "in serious consideration" to apply to the Presidency in 2020, says the Senate of Massachusetts.
The Senate of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that he would take "very seriously" the position of president following the election of half-manded.
During a civil assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she had the opportunity to apply.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and put our government in danger, and that means having a woman at the top," he said, as The Hill reports.
"After 6 November, I will take seriously my request to be president."
During the public assembly, Warren said his address to President Donald Trump, saying he was " bringing this country into the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was explicitly criticised by Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, appointed by the Supreme Court.
Friday Warren wrote on a tweet: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
A survey published on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's voters do not think they should apply in 2020.
58 percent of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not compete, according to the survey of Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
The 32% supported such a candidate.
The survey has shown greater support for a candidate by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent supporting a potential candidate and 48 per cent against.
Other names of high-profile democracies discussed in 2020 include former vice president Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin speaks of post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin at Donald Trump's rad
Track Palin, 26 years old, has spent a year in Iraq after being recruited in September
He was arrested and charged for a case of domestic violence on Monday night
"What is going on, my son, what is going on after being returned, I can relate to other families who experience the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorders and some of the injuries our soldiers are returning," said a meeting to Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said, of his son and other veterans of war, "they return a little different, frustrated, asking whether there is respect for which their soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the army, have dedicated themselves to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic aggression and violence against a woman, who interferes with a relationship for domestic violence and possession of firearms under the fire, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the police department of Vasilla.
18 Colombia and the District Support the Challenge for New Asylum Policies
Eight states and the Columbia District are supporting a legal battle against a new policy of the United States that rejects asylum for victims fleeing from gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 States and the Columbia District of Friday presented a friendly memory in Washington to support an asylum applicant who was responsible for this policy, as reported by NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the name Grace v. Sessions that the American Union for Civil Liberties presented in August against federal policy was not revealed.
He stated that his partner "and his violent sons in the gang" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum request on 20 July.
He was put in a stand in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum candidates in the United States, as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has highlighted a decision taken in 2014 by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allows for a request for asylum for immigrants from domestic violence documents.
Friday, the Attorney-General of the Columbia District, Karl Racine, said that the new policy "includes decades of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law imposes that all asylum applications are judged on the basis of specific circumstances and circumstances of the request, and a similar prohibition violates that principle," says the memory of friends curiae.
In the memory, the prosecutors have also pointed out that the policy that limits immigrants' income is damaging the US economy, claiming the net probability that these become entrepreneurs and "give necessary labour".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judges not to guarantee asylum to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence.
"The asylum is accessible to those who leave the country of origin because of persecution or fear caused by racial, religious, nationality, belonging to certain social groups or for a political opinion," said Sessions on 11 June, in the context of the announcement of the political line.
The asylum was never meant to ease any problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people must face every day worldwide.
Explosive attempts to recover in Palu while the balance of the deaths in the race to find survivors
For the superstitions, the situation was becoming more and more desperate.
"There's a lot of tension," said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, while comforting her febrile little child at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"There's an ambulance that's carrying the bodies at all times.
The clean water is dissipating."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, breaking between their fragile personal effects, in an attempt to recover anything they have been able to find.
Hundreds of people and hospitals, damaged by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were injured.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who was the victim of a back and back fracture, were outside Palu's military hospital, where patients were treated abroad because of the continued persistent loss of care.
He was filled with tears as he related the feeling from the violent earthquake that wiped out the room he shared with his wife and daughter at the fifth floor of a hotel.
"There was no time to save us.
"I'm stuck in the walls, I think," said Haris to the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a marriage.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then quietly.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
United States Ambassador accused China of "prepotence" with "public propaganda"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a publication of four pages on an American daily, publishing the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to advertise.
The United States last Wednesday, President Donald Trump referred to the announcement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the newspaper with the highest sales in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US Congress elections on 6 November, a charge that China rejects.
With regard to the fact that Pechino was trying to implicate himself in the US elections, he noted that U.S. officials referred to Reuters as a new phase of a scalation campaign in Washington's work to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish to promote trade, Pechino and Washington are currently involved in a trade war in scalation that has seen them adapt their duties to their imports.
China's representation duties at the beginning of the trade war were intended to attack exporters in States such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, as the Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, Ambassador of the United States in China and former long-term governor of Iowa, major exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Pechino had damaged American workers, Canadians and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in an article of opinion in the Des Moines Register of Sunday, "it now increases those assumptions by publishing public propaganda on our free journals."
"In disseminating its propaganda, the Chinese government is serving the love American tradition of freedom of speech and of print, putting a publication to be paid in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"Viceversa, on the street in Pechino, you will find few dissident voices and you will not see any real reflection of the dissident opinions that the Chinese people might have on China's economic trajectory, as the media are under the firm pressure of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most daily signs of China has chosen the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say that journals are being dealt with.
The Republicans are joining the female electorate prior to the election of half of the candidates with the Kavanaugh case, the analysts warned
Since many Republicans of the point defend the name of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and are on their side in facing multiple allegations of sexual harassment, analysts have noted that there will be a negative reaction, especially by women, during the future elections of half-men.
The allegations in this regard have been extremely high, and many Republicans have already officially demonstrated that they want to continue with a vote.
"These things can't be taken back," said The Hill Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of the Syracuse University, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubts that the strength of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arison) for an FBI investigation would be sufficient to place angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it either tomorrow or November," he said on Friday, as reported in Washington, D.C., Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior and national spokesman of the progressive MoveOn group.
On Friday morning, the protesters repeated the slogan "November is coming!" during their protest in the Senate Chamber, when the Republicans who control the Judicial Commission decided to continue with Kavanaugh's application despite the testimony of Dr.sa Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats are going to the stars," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
"People say they were already high; it is true.
But they could be higher, especially among the young electors and the young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who often don't vote despite not thanking the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which provided details of his sexual harassment charges against the candidate to the Supreme Court, the analysts had assumed that a negative reaction could be verified if the Republicans continued with the confirmation.
"For the GOP has become a total confusion," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Committee of the Republican Republic, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"Not only is it about the vote for the committee, the final one, or whether Kavanaugh will be put in panic, it is also about how the Republicans have handled the situation and the way they have dealt with it," said the news channel Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect Democrats.
In any case, the Americans seem to be in some way divided between the person to whom they believe according to Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a smaller percentage in favor of this last one.
A new survey of YouGov shows that 41 percent of the interviewees have probably or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent claim to have certainly or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that Kavanaugh probably lied or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's claim, the FBI is currently conducting investigations into the charges brought forward by Ford, as well as at least one of the other accused, Deborah Ramirez, as reported by The Guardian.
The last week Ford witnessed under oath, before the Senate's Judicial Committee, that Kavanaugh had taken him into exile when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate to the Supreme Court has married his genitals during a party during the study in Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web inventor is planning to start a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company that brings its origins from the open source Solid platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people can have access to and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee pointed out that the attempt behind Inrupt is "dominating the world".
"We have to do it now," said the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their "personal data store" or a POD.
It can include lists of contacts, things to do, calendars, musical books and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available on one browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of the online personal data store is that it is entirely the choice of the user who can have access to any type of information.
The company calls it "personal power through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce, CEO of the company, is to provide adequate resources, processes and skills to make it accessible to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a safety platform purchased by IBM, some developers in the staff to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology programmers around the world will be able to give life to their decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not say "Facebook and Google if you enter or not a complete change where their business models are completely broken from one day to the other.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Wednesday published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to seek commercial energy and an ecosystem that contributes to protecting the integrity and quality of the new website built from Solid".
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has represented an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Remember the Ecclesiastical of the Great War with Victoria Cross
The only ecclesiastical church in England to be awarded with a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was celebrated in its birth city after 100 years.
The Lieutenant Colonel, Reverendo Bernard Vann, received recognition on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglis and Lehacourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a witch and he never knew that he had achieved the highest level of British military honor.
On Saturday in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two Nipots opened a memorial lamp.
One of his Nipots, Michael Vann, said that it was "magnificently symbolic" the fact that the stone would have been opened up for 100 years from the prestigious production of his grandmother.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, the nearby Colonel Van led his army beyond the Canal of Saint-Quentin "through a dense cloud, under the heavy fire of the field and war machines".
Then he leaned toward the fire line and with the "greatest gallantry" he made the line forward before running with a single hand cannon and landing three of the distance.
The nearby Colonel Vann was killed by a German monk on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know can never be taller and something that makes it more humble".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, have also set up a flower crown after the parade, conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he felt truly honored to find a role in the parade" and added "the value of a real hero is shown by the support that many people will give him."
The MMA fans stayed all night looking at Bellator 206, and instead they were kissed by Peppa Pig.
Just imagine, you've been awake all night to watch the famous Bellator 206 just to see you deny the view of the main event.
The program from San Jose included 13 battles, including the six on the hand card, and was to be transferred to the United Kingdom during the night, directly on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for departure, the TV viewers in the United Kingdom were shocked when Peppa Pig appeared on the screen.
Some are based after being awake until the first hours of the morning precisely for the fight.
On Twitter a fan described the transition to an animated cardboard for children as "a kind of cute little screen.
"The government regulation provides that at six o'clock in the morning the content was no longer appropriate, so it had to be passed on to the children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, vice-president of Bellator for marketing and communication, when he was asked for the transmission.
"Deep the monkey," "Yes."
"The president of the Bellator company, Scott Cooker, said that they will work on programming to include TV viewers from the United Kingdom in the future.
"I think that when I think about the answer, I think we can probably find a solution," said Coker.
"But there are six Sunday mornings and we will not be able to find a solution before Sunday of our time fus, Monday for them.
But we're working.
Believe me, when the program changed, a lot of messages arrived and nobody was friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen next time.
We will limit it to five battles rather than six - as we normally do - and we have tried to get so much for fans, and we have just discussed them.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" because of sexuality
The Olympic Nouveau Tom Daley says he has grown to feel lower than anyone because of his sexuality - but this has given him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't take into account until he got to secondary school, the fact that "not all are like me".
Speaking at the first point in Desert Island Discs of Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had heard his own voice about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that being a parent had made him less important than winning the Olympics.
The representative of the old date program, Kirsty Young, took a series of free months for disease.
Presenting as a marginalized in Laverne's first program, Daley said that he felt "less than" anyone else as he grew up because "it was socially unacceptable the fact that they liked both boys and girls."
He said, "Today, the feeling of feeling less than, and feeling different, were the things that really gave me the strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to try to be "something," he said, so that no one would be disappointed if they had, in case they had discovered his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medal at the Olympics has become an activist of the LGBT high profile and has used its own face in the Australian Commonwealth Games this year to appeal to more countries to criminalize homosexuality.
He said he had heard his voice because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that being in love with a man - U.S. director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013- "I was surprised."
Daley married Oscar's winner, who was 20 years older than he, last year, but said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When I was so young," he went to his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find any of the same age who had experienced similar high and low.
The two became parents in June, of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" was changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything was about the fact that I had to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know one thing, there's more important things about Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with a brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted the fact that he was dying and that one of the last things he asked was whether London tickets were already in 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him you won't be from these parts to be in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually died, I had not realized that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning the bronze.
"I knew only that it was what I had dreamed of all my life - swimming in front of a public house in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song - Heather Small's Proud - which had a special meaning for him in the preparation for the Olympics and still makes him the skin of the egg.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The outside shape of Mickelson put in panic in the Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will record on Sunday when he will play his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to get back in shape to avoid becoming an unhappy billionaire stone.
Mickelson, playing in the binary event for a twelve-time record, was put in panic by Captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and the foursomes of Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of action, as was often done for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day doing the cheerleader and working on his own game in the range, hoping to correct what tortures him.
Being never the strongest driver even at the edge of his career, 48 years is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the narrow path regularly punishs wrong crimes.
And if the journey of himself was not encouraging enough, Mickelson, in the ninth Sunday match, is facing the exact British Open Francesco Molinari champion, who has collaborated with novelty Tommy Fleetwood to win all and four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, of four points at the beginning of their 12 single matches, are born with a remarkable beginning, the Michaelson match could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his own man, not that he could say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a pack on my back, put a hand around me and said he'd be ready for tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It's a Hall of Famer and has added so much to the team last week.
I probably didn't imagine playing two games.
I had imagined more, but this is the way it went, and this is the way we thought it should go.
He wants to participate, just like anyone else."
Mikkelson Sunday will exceed Nick Faldo's record for the largest number of games played in Ryder Cup.
It could mark the end of a career in Ryder Cup that has never even long reflected the heights of its personal record.
Mickelson has 18 games, 20 scutts and seven pairs, although Furyk has said that his presence has brought in tangible goods to the team.
"It's fun, sarcastic, angry, people like to play games, and it's a fantastic boy to have in the meeting room," he explained.
"I also believe that the younger players have been having fun to compete against him this week, something that has been fun to see.
He did much more than play."
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a good advantage can soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the individual meetings of the last day of Ryder Cup can easily turn into a pleasant resort.
The Danish started in the 1997 meeting in Valderrama, where the team, headed by Seve Ballesteros, despite a distance of five points from the Americans, arrived at the track line with a minimum advantage, winning 141⁄2-131/2.
"Continued to repeat that we had a good advantage in Valderrama, we had it in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but little," said Bjorn (in the picture) after seeing the 2018 class win, on Friday for 5-3 and yesterday for 10-6.
"That's why it'll be the story to prove to me and my team that it's not over.
Tomorrow you have to give the maximum.
You need to go out there and do everything in the right way.
It is not finished until the points are not marked in the washing.
Our goal is to try to win the trophy, and that is what we need to focus on.
I always focus on the 12 players in my team, but I know who's on the other side: the world's best golfers."
Happy of the way his people have raced in that difficult golf field, Bjorn added: "I will never be overcome.
Tomorrow's a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the turn of individual performances, which is another thing.
It's nice to be there with a teammate when things go well, but when you're only your golfer's abilities are tested.
This is the message you have to send to the players: tomorrow, you have to pull out the best of you.
Then forget about your friend because he too must go there and take out the best of himself."
On the contrary of Bjorn, the opponent Jim Furyk will seek in his players the best individual performance more than a team, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who collected three points on four.
The same Furyk was found by both sides at those big meetings on the last day, having been part of the team winning in Brooklyn before losing against the European "Miracola di Medinah".
"I remember every word," he commented in response to the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, led his players in mind on the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important parties, but we want to start immediately with the right foot as we did in Brooklyn and Medinah.
When the game starts to take a certain piece, the pressure increases in the middle parties.
So we organize our training and classify the kids in a way that seems appropriate to us, because tomorrow we'll try to do a magic.
Thomas was assigned to lead the controversial and face Rory McIlroy in the top match with, in order, the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
"I chose this order because I think it covers the path to the end," Bjorn said about his selection for individual meetings.
The new German military ship was re-placed
According to the local media, the last frigate of the German military Navy would have to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old military ships of the cold war times, but it will not be until the next year because of defective systems and a cost commitment.
The Rhineland-Pfalz Commission, the admiral ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class, was posted until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which mentions a military carrier.
The ship should have joined the military Navy in 2014, but worrying questions that followed the delivery have tortured the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Military Marine in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class ships.
They will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of ancient and anti-navel missiles as well as some hidden technologies, such as low radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer periods of maintenance, in fact, it should be possible to use new frigates up to two years away from national ports.
However, the continued delay implies that the innovative warships, which are said to allow Germany to design its own extra power, will become obsolete when they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The lucky F-125 guy made news last year, when the German military Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Amburg.
It was the first time the military Navy restored a ship to the builder after delivery.
It was little known about the reasons for the return, but the German media noted a number of crucial "software and hardware" that made the ship useless if used in a fight mission.
The deficiencies in the software were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg class ships would be managed by a crew of about 120 marines, just half of the staff of the older Bremen class.
In addition, it is important that the ship weighs too much, and this reduces its performance and limits the possibility of the military Navy to add future updates.
It is believed that the Rhineland-Pfalz, of 7,000 tons, is twice the weight of ships of similar classes used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project (including equipment training) is becoming an important issue.
It seems that it reached EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion) from the beginning of EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems involving new frigates become of particular importance in the light of recent warnings regarding the reduction of German shipping power.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, admitted that the military Navy is actually "sharping ships capable of being used".
The official said that the issue was significantly worse over time, since the old disarmed ships were not replaced by new ships.
Its rammaric is that none of the bats of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the military Navy.
The National Trust saves the secret life of the Pipistrells
New research carried out in a container of the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how the Pipistres use the view to search for food.
It is believed that discoverers can shed light on the behavior of the only flying mammals and guide future protection activities.
The study of scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and suprano pipelines, in addition to the brown ears of Daubenton at Inverwe Gardens in West Ross.
Special recorders will be positioned in key locations around the property to track the activities of the pipelines during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile tests using portable detectors.
The analysis of the sounds recorded by a expert will determine the frequency of the calls of the pipettes and the manner in which each species behaves.
They will then produce a map of the apartment and a report to create a detailed picture on the scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, consultant for the conservation of nature for the NTS, hopes that the results can reveal what habitat areas are most important for the pipelines and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grasslands, and how to maintain forests for pipelines and other related species.
The population of Pipistres in Scotland and the United Kingdom has decreased significantly in the past century.
Pipistrells are at risk because of construction and development works that interest tropical and rob the habitat.
The eels turbines and lighting can also constitute a threat, as well as the mosquida paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as the attacks of domestic cats.
Pipistres aren't really blind.
However, because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they try to catch a prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to identify insects and obstacles on their trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the pillars very seriously.
Ten qualified experts regularly conduct investigations, inspect the crossings, and sometimes perform rescues.
The organisation even established the first reserve of Scotland for only the Pipistrells in Threave, in the Dumfries and Galloway region, which hosts eight of the ten species of Pipistrells in Scotland.
The holder's manager, David Thompson, says the property is the ideal territory.
"We have a large area for the Pipistrells in Threave," he said.
"We have old buildings, many secular trees and a good habitat.
But there's a lot on the pills we don't know yet, so the work we do here and in the other properties will help us understand more about their need for growth."
He underlines the importance of controlling pipistres before driving the maintenance inside the property as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single mother trap can kill up to 400 women and young people, perhaps by spreading through a whole local population.
Pipistres are protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, destroy them or destroy their trailers.
Elizabeth Ferrrell, the Scottish leader for Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said: "We still have much to learn about our pills, and for many of our species, we don't know how their people are going."
Ronaldo rejects the charges of torture while the legal cause of the German weekly
Christian Ronaldo has labeled the accusations of terror against him as "false news", claiming that people "want to make public" with his name.
His laws are prepared to cause the German weekly Der Spiegel who published the charges.
The young Portuguese attacker was accused of rapeing an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel also made a note on Friday about the payment of $375.000 to keep the silence on the occasion.
In a video on Instagram directed to its 142 million followers, in the hours following the charges, Ronaldo, 33 years old, has deleted the statements as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," says Palone d'Oro five times turning to the video camera.
"They want to make public through my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by making my name, but this is part of the game.
I'm happy and everything's fine," added the smiling climber.
According to the Reuters, Ronaldo's laws are prepared to prosecute Der Spiegel for the charges, defined as "an inadmissible notification of suspicions on the private sphere".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the legislator will ask for recovery for "moral damages in the measure corresponding to the severity of the violation of privacy, considered probably one of the most serious personal rights in recent years".
The fact would have taken place in June 2009 in a follow-up to the Palms Casino Resort of Las Vegas.
After meeting in a discotheque, Ronaldo and Maorga would be taken back to the Calcator's room, where he was subjected to analy violence, as reported in the statements filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo would have been put in a gyno after the accident saying to be for "99 percent" a "brown boy" broken by "one percent".
The documents indicate that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had a sexual relationship, but that this had been consensus.
Majorga also said that she was reported to the police and in hospitals, where her injuries were photographed, but then she agreed to a reconciliation agreement because she felt "terrorized by the retreats" and worried about the prospect of "publicly humiliated".
The 34th year is now seeking to redefine the agreement, claiming to be still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the event, and this state will join the Italian Youth with a contract of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: the United Kingdom will always reimburse car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "may always repeat the loss of its world leader status in the construction of cars after Brexit, Minister of Industry Greg Clark said.
It also added to be "interested" for the declarations made by Toyota UK to the BBC regarding the possible exit of Great Britain from the EU without an agreement and the resulting temporary block of production in the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Minister Clark.
The Japanese automotive house claims that the delays in the border, in the case of a Brexit without agreement, could affect jobs.
Burnaston's factory, in which Toyota Auris and Avenis are built, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which has been exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain comes out of the EU by the end of March, production in our factory will end," said Marvin Cooke, Director General of Toyota in Burnaston.
It increases the concern of other English car manufacturers for EU exit without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims that after Brexit will close its Mini installations in Oxford for a month.
The main concern concerns the risks in the supply chain faced by the builders in the case of Brexit without agreement.
The Toyota production line is managed on the basis of the concept of "just in time" with parts that come every 37 minutes from English and European suppliers for vehicles in order.
If the United Kingdom will leave the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be discrepancies at the borders that would cause delays and lack of parties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to have more than one day of inventory value in its Derbyshire establishment, the company said, so the production would be stopped.
Minister Clark argues that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely designed to avoid these barriers to borders".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow us not only to enjoy the current success but to take this opportunity," said the BBC Radio 4.
"The test, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we must be absolutely able to continue what has been a chain of distribution of great success."
Toyota was unable to tell how long the production could have stopped, but in the long term it warned that additional costs could reduce the competitiveness of the installations and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is responsible for the union delegates of the plant, says that the workers are very concerned: "In my experience, once jobs are reduced, they are no longer reintegrated."
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for future relations with the EU."
The meeting of Trump with Rosenstein could be forwarded yet, says the White House.
The high-risk meeting of Donald Trump with the Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be "reminiscent of a week", while the debate on Judge Brett Kavanaugh continued on Sunday, said the White House.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interferences with the elections, links between Trump and Russia's councillors, and any obstacle to the justice of the president.
The possibility that Trump could licensed the Deputy Minister of Justice, thus endangering Mueller's independence, has fed Washington's guest for months.
In the course of the month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a chemistry to record talks with Trump and trying to remove the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House and shouted that he was going to die.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Wednesday, which was then held at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that he "would not" license Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the hearing of the Senate Justice Commission in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual violence, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week of instruction on questions from the FBI against Kavanaugh, further delaying the final vote of the Senate.
Sunday, Trump's spokesman, Sarah Sanders, was quoted on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "There has been no date, it could be this week, an image that will remain for another week considering all that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I'll continue to update the press."
Some journalists might answer this statement: Sanders has no briefing with the press at the White House since September 10.
Driver Chris Wallace asked him why.
Sanders said that the shortage of briefings was not due to an advert for television journalists "which are shown", although he said, "I didn't spread out with the fact that they are shown".
So he thought the direct contact between Trump and the print could be more frequent.
"The president has more questions and answers than any president before him," he said, adding without citing the evidence: "We checked the figures."
The briefings will still be, said Sanders, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it is much better to talk to me.
We're trying to do this, like in the last few weeks, and this will replace the briefings with the press and you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or conferences with the visiting officials.
The press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown him the reason, making a speech on a free route, and at the same time a bit curious, in front of a group of journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to the Scottish NHS workers to express their concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff working at the Scotland NHS to express the country's gratitude and urge them to stay after Brexit.
Mr Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the EU's exit from the United Kingdom.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to addressing the costs of requests for seated status (a stable resident status) for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: "For all summer there have been ongoing negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on Brexit, which will lead to the decisions of the autumn.
But the British Government was also prepared for a scenario without agreement.
I know this is a period of great concern for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate my appreciation for the contribution made by all staff members, regardless of nationality.
Colleges from all over the EU, and not only provide valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, benefiting patients and the communities to which we offer a service.
Scotland is certainly your home and we would like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie was operated immediately after a head injury
The defense officer of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgical operation after reporting a head injury in the Sabbath fight against Vanderbilt Commodores in which the team lost 31-27, as reported by Mike Organ of The Tennessee newspaper.
Technical Officer Rod Reed told journalists that the incident that caused the injury occurred shortly before the interval.
"He's close to the bordo camp and he's awake," said Reed.
The first relief workers and medical personnel were given to Abercrombie of the oxygen in the bordo camp, before putting it in the barrel and carrying it for further clarifications.
A director of Tennessee State referred to Chris Harris of the WSMV of Nashville, Tennessee, which Abercrombie has performed surgery at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the type and the entity of damage" and that the Tennessee States are trying to understand when they were wounded.
Abercrombie, a student in the second year, is at his first stage with the Tennessee State after being transferred from the Illinois.
He had made a total of five posters before leaving the game, which brought his total season to 18 posters.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher fuel taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, according to the new labor plan.
The maneuver will neutralize the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters
The increase in the tax rate will apply to taxpayers who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of the Treasures plans to collect up to 120 million steroids per year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher bids for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, theresa May will be announced today.
The manoeuvre will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters with the promise to provide affordable accommodation and higher incomes.
The increase in inflation will apply to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional resources will be supported by the Government's initiative to combat the phenomenon of unemployment.
The ceiling, which is added to the current set of balls, including the high levels introduced two years ago on the second houses and on the properties of buy to lets (equipped for rent), could consist of more than 3%.
The Ministry of the Treasures provides that the manoeuvre can collect up to 120 million esters a year.
A 13% estimate of new buildings in London is purchased by non-resident citizens in the United Kingdom, increasing prices and making it difficult for purchasers to enter a first house in the real estate market.
Many of the richest areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "a fantastic city" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the state.
The new policy comes a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a cut on the ball tax to help the younger with the purchase of the first house.
He accused the large construction companies of maintaining high prices for the properties by catching up the land without using them and encouraged Prime Minister May to give up the quotas on affordable housing to set up the British real estate degradation.
Mr Corbyn has announced a series of exciting proposals for reform of the housing market, including controls on rentals and the elimination of impunity.
It also wants to give the Council greater powers to build new buildings.
First Minister May said: "I said last year that I would be committed to restoring the British dream, and that life should be better for the new generations.
And that means restoring the real estate market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be fair if the purchase of a house was equally easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and for foreign companies, as it is for British resident workers.
For so many people the dream of having a house has become too far and the dignity of the homeless remains a reality."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to lead Scotland"
The technical director of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "maximum ambition" is to become Scotland's manager before or after.
The Scottish, 42 years old, is attracted by the challenge of relieving the North-East team that is currently in third place in League One, at three points from the battle.
It is expected at the Stadium of Light this summer after being led by St. Mirren during the Scottish Premiership of the last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a hairdresser.
I've been in series B and that's all," Ross said to the Scottish BBC Sports Sound program.
I've grown up looking at Scotland at Hampden with my father as a child and it's something I'll always remember.
However, this will be possible only if I have succeeded as a team manager."
The presidents of Ross at the Sunderland leadership were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former technique of the Alloa Athletic maintains that there is no concern in following up on such important names, in a very important team, which had previously rejected the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me at this time is measured with the ability to report the team to Premier League."
Given the structure and facilities of the club, we can say that it belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I think I'll only succeed if I can get the team back."
The start of Ross's career by manager is three years ago, after a period as a trainer in Dumbarton and 15 months as a Hearts trainer.
He then helped the Lord to save from the retreat to the third level and brought St. Mirren from the clock of the retreat to the title of champions of the Championship, the next season.
Ross continues to feel much more at his action now than during his career as a football player in the Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It is probably a real point of action," recalls the Lord's direction.
"I really believe that the manager's role was made suitable for me, more than that of the player.
It seems strange because I worked well, I got a living, and I had some good results.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of things you have to face every week.
I still deal with them in terms of stress and pressure at work, but management seems good.
I always wanted to run and now I do, I feel much calmer than I've ever been."

According to a study, the right time for a painting is 17:30 a.m. Saturday
The summer summer heat wave has brought more ingested in English pubs in difficulty and more concern for restaurant services.
The data show that pub and bar have seen an increase in sales of 2.7% in July, while restaurants drop by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA commercial consultancy company, put together the data and commented: "The persistence of the sun and the long duration of England to the World has made it possible that the month of July followed a path similar to that of June, when the pubs were more than 2.8 percent, while the restaurants were hit harder.
The cloud of 1.8 percent in June's restaurant is worse in July.
The pubs and bars in which they drank were the most solid, with a homogenous increase above the level of restaurants.
Even the pubs in which they ate suffered the heat, though not as excessive as the restaurants.
Looks like people just want to go out and drink something.
In pubs and bar handles the sale of drinks is out of 6.6 per cent per month, while food consumption is low by 3 per cent".
Paul Newman, an analyst in the recreational and reception sector of RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The extent and impact of major social or sports events remains the main factor when it comes to selling in the retail market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to fight, despite a decline in sales of 4.8 per cent annually, will be particularly severe in addition to constant pressures on costs.
The long summer would not have arrived in a worse period for the restaurants and only time can say if the most moderate temperatures, from which we have benefited in August, give us a necessary price."
The overall increase in sales between pubs and restaurants, including the new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the fall of brand roll-outs.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitoring company for pubs, bars and British restaurants combines and analyzes performance data through 47 operating groups, with a combined factor of over 9 billion stars, and is the industry's reference company.
A child on five owns a secret account of social networks that covers parents
A survey reveals that a child over five, some of them only 11 years old, owns the secret accounts of social networks that cover parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the "fake on Instagram" pages.
The news has strengthened the fear that sexual content has been placed
The 20 percent of students said they had a "primary" account to show parents.
A child on five, some of them only 11 years old, creates an account of social networks that is hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in the "fake on Instagram" accounts, a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has strengthened the fear that sexual content has been placed.
Twenty percent of the students claimed to manage a "principal" account that was withdrawn to show parents, keeping them a private at the same time.
A mother who found out about her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a teenager who tried to "stir me".
The research, the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' Conference (HMC) of private schools has shown that 40 percent of the boys between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, and half of them have allowed private accounts to be kept.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It's alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be "voice for athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council
Elid Doyle was elected an executive member of the Scottish Athetics Council during the national General Assembly of the administrative body.
Doyle is the most beautiful Scottish athlete in the light athletics, and President Ian Beattie described the appointment as a great opportunity for those who manage sports to take advantage of their wide international experience in the past decade.
"Eilid is pleased with a profound respect for the Scottish, British and global athletic community and we are sure that in Scotland athletics can bring great benefit to the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I don't see the time to act as a voice of athletes and hope to be able to contribute and help lead sports in Scotland."
The American winner of 200 and 400 meters to the Games in Atlanta in 1996 and of four Olympic Gold Medaglie, as well as currently an opinionist of the BBC, was unable to walk after a transient  ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a ictus.
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time could tell me if I would be arrested and in what way.
It was a tremendous work, but I got it all back, he learned to walk again, and today I move with agility!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!".
The advertising of a Tiralette compares mothers and mice and divides the opinion online
A producer company of a Tiralette has divided the opinion into a network with a publication that compares the mothers who raise and the pigs who are raised.
To mark the launch of what is defined as "the world's first silent and indisputable Tiralette", Elvie's consumer technology company has launched a publication in the form of music videos which show freedom of speech as mothers from the new Tiralette.
Four real mothers dance in a bunch of fans on a track that includes songs like, "Yes, I take the milk but I don't have one thing" and "If I didn't notice, these are not mothers but my aunts."
The choir continues: "Throw him out, throw him out, feed the children, throw him out, throw him out, throw the milk to my lord."
However, the publication, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused complaints online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has generated different reactions among viewers, many of which have supported the "torries" of the dairy industry.
"An unhappy decision to use cookies to publish the product.
Like us, they must also remain strong and share in producing milk, except for the fact that their little ones have been stolen from birth for a few days," someone wrote.
The Elvie Tiralette is dressed with discretion under a queen for mother
Someone else commented: "Simply traumatic both for the mother and for the little one.
But why not use them to publish a mother-in-law who will continue to have their children?"
Someone else added, "It's really a meaningless advertising."
Others have defenses and a woman has even allowed to find the "extreme" arm.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I'm still waiting, I'd like to have one.
When I used the trigger, I felt like a doll.
Publicity is a little invulnerable, but it doesn't go far from reality.
This is a great product," someone wrote.
Another person commented: "It's a fun publicity dedicated to mothers who use the tirallette (especially on the job or in the bathroom) and feel like "much."
Its purpose is not to praise or judge the household industry."
In the end, video protagonists show that they've been dancing with the discreet tape inserted into the kingdom.
The concept to which the campaign is inspired is based on the idea that many women who use the tiralate feel like pigs.
The Elvie Tiralate is however completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be inserted into a kingdom of grace by giving women the freedom to move, holding the children in hand and even getting out while they take the milk.
Ana Balarin, Mother's partner and ECD commented: "The Elvie Tiralette is such a revolutionary product that deserved an audacity and provocation.
Comparing women who use breast-feeding, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice by demonstrating in a funny and easily recognisable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new breast-feeding is capable of ensuring."
This is not the first time the Elvie Tiralette made news.
During the week of London's fashion, the mother of two children presented herself on the walkway of the stylist Martha Jakubowski wearing this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been silently moved into a tentopolis at the Texas border
The number of migrant children has increased exponentially, although the monthly crossings of the borders have remained relatively invasive, partly because the backlog and political line of the Trump administration have made it more difficult to trust these children.
Most of those who took refuge in them were, in general, immigrant immigrants who are now afraid to reflect on the possibility of staying in the country offering to undertake such a gesture.
The risk is increased in June when federal authorities announced that reliable potentials and other adult members of their families would have been taken into account and that the data would have been transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking official at the Immigration and Customs Force, said before the Congress that the agency arrested tens of people who had offered to take care of children alone.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of the arrests had no prior penalties.
"As many as 80% of the people who are willing to trust children or belong to the families of these people are illegal in the country and most of them are criminals.
So we're still giving the hunt to these people," said Albence.
In order to try to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules for which some of them will have to appear in court within a month from the farm, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard period, as it says who works at the reception points.
Many will appear in videoconference rather than in person, in order to break their cause of legal status at a court of immigration.
Those who will be considered inadequate to receive aid will be removed quickly.
The longer children remain in trust, the more likely they are to suffer anxiety and depression that cause violent attacks of anger or refugee attempts, the more they claim those who work at reception points and the relationships that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Those who support this position claim that the probability of this is even higher in a large structure than that of Tornillo in which, because of its size, it is easier to ignore the signs of children's discomfort.
They add that moving children to the camp without giving them the time to prepare emotionally or to greet friends could aggravate the trauma that many are already facing.
Syria aims at the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In his speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also invited Syrian refugees to return to their homeland even though the war has now taken place in the eighth year.
Moualem, who also recovers the charge of vice Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are taking over the Syrian soil illegally with the claim to combat terrorism and "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately without any condition," he said in front of the assembly.
Moualem stressed that "war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where since 2011, more than 360,000 people have died and millions of people have had to leave their homes.
He reiterated that Damascus will continue to "fight this holy war until it has freed all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from "any foreign illegal presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and support the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces that support President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the field in this country destroyed by the war.
On the refugee problem, Moualem stated that the conditions are favourable to their return and accused "some Western countries" of "inclined fears" that force refugees to stay away from their homeland.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to intervene to facilitate their return," he said.
"What should be only a humanitarian problem is politicalized."
The United States and the European Union have warned that aid will not be granted in Syria for reconstruction until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition will be reached to end the war.
The United Nations diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of an area bordered with Idlib, the most important rocking of the rebels, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided an extensive attack by the Syrian forces supported by the Russians in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "precise deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action was aimed at the Jihadists, including the fighters from the Front al-Nusra connected to Al-Qaeda, who will "be defeated".
The United Nations Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to call on a new committee of government and opposition to support a draft constitution for post-war Syria and prepare the road for elections.
Moualem explained the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee by stating that the work of the group should be limited to "revision of the articles of the current constitution" without interference.
Because Trump will add the second mandate
Based on this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers may expect, his presidency must not conclude too early because of an impeachment or scandal.
In what will certainly be "the end of the most dramatic presidency of all time!"
At the moment, there are no flash signals from the viewers.
Since 2014, the percentages of the first night are more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on the first night, definitely increasing compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the program "The Rachel Maddow Show" of MSNBC has exceeded the percentages of the network reaching 3.5 million viewers in the fairs with the most important news.
"It's a fire towards which people are attracted because it's not something to explain," says Neal Baer, showrunner of ABC's television series "Designed Survival" that tells the story of a member of the office who suddenly becomes president after an attack that destroys the Campidoglio.
In Scovell, a brilliant comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi race in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The author told you he would vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
He said, "Why does he laugh at me?"
The chaos is therefore a source of fun.
Of course, unlike any other television program, Washington’s vice versa can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade judgment if immigrant families can meet or less and the health status of the global economy.
To stop following the news is, however, a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, it goes well beyond the duty of informed citizens to follow up for the sixth consecutive hour a group of experts discussing the deep research of Bob Woodward for his book "Paura", of Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather jacket ("a full of tracotance" commented The Washington Post) and the implications of the disturbing descriptions that Storm Daniels makes of the Anatomic parts of Trump.
I, for example, won't be able to watch Super Mario without thinking.
"Part of the reason why what it seems to be a real show is that every night there are news," says Brent Montgomery, managing director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of "Pawn Stars", regarding the advent of actors and daily developments in the direction of the Trump show (in contrast to N.F.L. that commends Kim Jong-un).
You can't lose an episode, otherwise stay back.
This week I went to find Mike Fleiss on the north coast of Kauai and although it was a day of sun with almost 30 degrees, it was closed at home to watch the MSNBC and nevertheless registered the CNN.
He could not get away from TV while Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate's judicial committee and in front of the Supreme Court's immediate future.
Fleiss commented: "I remember when we once made all those absurd programs and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization."
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

External cash flow in the course for the most closed half-manded elections
It is not surprising that in the 17th district there is a cash flow due to the re-establishment of a congressional district which has made it possible that two members are now in charge of the same place.
The recent redefinition of the Suburban District of Pittsburg allows the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his place in another district during a special election that took place last spring.
Lamb is on the run against another member in charge, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania that prevails in the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held in January that, in the old districts, the electoral colleges had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The 17th district course launched a campaign characterized by fierce opposition between the financial branches of the two major parties, namely the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a measure victory in the special elections in March for the 18th Congressal District of Pennsylvania.
This place was occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump added the district for 20 points.
Politicians have given Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States thought to punish El Salvador for supporting China, then changed the idea
The diplomats have observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017 a rather cordial meeting took place between the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela and the President Trump who also had a hotel in Panama until the partners did not force the Trip Organization's leadership group to gorasse.
The officials of the Department of State have decided to re-enter the heads of the American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following the "Recent decision not to recognize Taiwan anymore", said the spokesman of the department Heather Nauert in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
But the decision to apply sanctions was taken only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million from the Americans for the control of drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visa granting, would be concerned about the country of Central America with a high percentage of unemployed and murdered.
After a series of internal meetings, North American and Central American officials have held a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which has been seen as a step forward in attempting to prevent migrants from heading into the United States.
But in mid-September, high-ranking officials made it clear that they intended to continue with the conference, thereby giving up any sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence was charged to preside over the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, to demonstrate the importance the administration attaches to this meeting, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys returned peacefully in El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without receiving further reprobation or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman from Bolton to the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak in anonymous form of internal decisions.
As far as they were concerned, it was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who, however, wanted to maintain the anonymity.
Study History
In the report he will publish, Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller could accuse Trump of a violation of justice, as there seems to be sufficient evidence.
In view of what is said, Mueller's investigation intends to shed light on the possible collapse of Trump with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If the Congress were to pass on to the Democrats, Trump should answer these charges before the voters and perhaps a jury of his peers while preparing for a new candidate.
The unknowns are many and I do not intend to say that the fall of Trump is inevitable, as is not the case with its approvals in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic we have to make choices that will determine how long the fight may last.
In 1938, the German officials were ready to organize a coup against Hitler if the Western powers had stopped him and supported the Czechs in Monaco.
At that time, we failed to let us escape the opportunity to avoid the years of famine that have followed.
The course of history revolves around these points of action in which the irrevocable mark of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans at the moment have to face different ones.
What would happen if Trump decided to license the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's investigation?
The position of Rosenstein has been complicated since this newspaper has reported that last year it was secretly suggested that Trump be subject to interviews by questioning his ability to find out the role of President.
Rosenstein claims that the news on The Times is not true.
"How will we react if the new FBI investigation against Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or improbable or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite the expected accusations of an attempt to rape and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote for a Congress that will ask Trump to respond to his actions?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy must be prepared to face a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think we'll do it.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
He survived, he moved to America, and 60 years later, he sent me to enter the Sunday candles with the swastika.
With a legacy of nature, I can only be optimistic about the future."

Graham Dorrans dei Rangers is excellent at meeting with Rapid Vienna
On Thursday the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the convincing victory against the Villarreal in Spain, would give them the best opportunity to qualify for the G Group of Europe League.
Even if, due to an intrusion to the boy, the central champion Graham Dorrans has played his first part in the season just on the occasion of the 2-2 with the Villarreal, he believes that this result can allow Rangers to do great things.
"For us it was a positive result because Villarreal is a good team," said the player thirty-nine.
"We faced the convincing game of doing good and brought home a point.
Maybe we could have won in extremes, but, of course, the comparison is a good result.
They've been better in the first time, while the second time we played better.
As for Thursday, it will be another big European evening.
We hope to win the three points, but it will be a difficult meeting because our opponents have achieved a good outcome in the final game. But I am sure that, thanks to public support, we will be able not to give up.
The past year has certainly been difficult because of my inforows and changes to the club itself, but now the feelings are positive.
The team is in shape, the boys are having fun and the preparation goes well.
So we can forget the problems of the past season and think about the future."
Women are concerned about the costs of long-term assistance
Although those who have participated in the survey have clear ideas on the kind of assistance they would like to receive, few have faced the issue in the family.
About half of the nationwide interviewees claim to have talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term assistance.
Only 10% claim to have talked to their children.
According to Holly Snyder, vice-president of the Nationalwide life insurance sector, "people want to be a member of their family to take care of themselves, but do not face this conversation".
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to help you if you do not temporarily communicate what you want.
If you have a consultant, decide with him and your family where and how you want to receive assistance, because these factors can be determined for costs.
You will be involved in a financial consultant: you will be able to advise you how to pay the costs you have to face.
The choice of long-term assistance funding may include a traditional insurance policy or a hybrid life insurance policy to cover these expenses or continue to pay money for insurance until you are able to do so.
Prepare all the documents necessary to avoid legal battles at your death.
Appoint a health care prosecutor so that a person in whom you trust can monitor medical care and ensure that professionals satisfy your wishes if you have not been able to communicate.
You also appreciate the possibility of a search for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions in your place and ensure that your accounts are paid if you have not been able to do so.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your old parent is being rushed to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write this information in detail so that you can always be ready.
"It's not just a financial issue, but who are the doctors?" asks Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare for any event."
A man hit more than once with an air rifle attached to Ilfracombe
A man was hit more than once with a hard air gun while he ran on his feet after spending the night out.
The victim, a quarantine, was found in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was beaten to the chest, to the addom and to a hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "case action".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
It's not in danger of life, though, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Therems and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official sources, at least 384 people died after a severe earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. The budget of the victims is intended to be released.
The communications are interrupted and the relief officers are unable to have any information from Donghea's Regency, a region north of Palu located near the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some essential data on the Palu and Dodhea in the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Centrale, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi and with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
When it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dondrea is a kingdom that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of coast in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, a province-dependent administrative region, accounted for about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of support for the economy of the Central Sulawesi province, particularly the coastal region of Dodrea.
The extraction of nickel is also an important activity in the province, but it is concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dodhria have been hit several times by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to the Disaster Mitigation Agency of Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dodrya.
Another tsunami struck the western area of Dongrya in 1996 by killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the sysmic zone of the Pacific fire site and is often hit by terrorists.
Here are some of the most powerful earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: on 26 December a strong earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh north of Sumatra caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries killing, along the Indian Ocean coast, 226 000 people, of which over half of Aceh.
2005: a series of powerful earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: a magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern area of Java, Indonesia's most popular island, causing tsunamis that have emerged from the southern coast by killing nearly 700 people.
2009: a 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck close to the city of Padang, capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
The victims were over 1,100.
2010: a 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Isle of Mentawai, along Sumatra, causing a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed ten villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: a slight earthquake struck the kingdom of Pidie Jaya in Aceh causing destruction and panic in the people who remembered the destruction of the earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
In this case there were no tsunamis, but more than 100 people died under torture.
2018: a strong earthquake hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia killing more than 500 people, most of which are in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of Alaska's former governor and candidate to Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested with the charge of aggression.
On the basis of a signal issued on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, Palin, 29 years old, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, for arresting the complaint and resisting the arrest.
According to the report, when a acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged incident, he cut off his phone.
Palin was transferred to the Mat-Su Pretreal Facility centre and its custody was set at $500, as reported by KTUU.
According to the television network, it is shared in Saturday's trial and declared "surely innocent".
Palin is at risk of being charged with three first-grade offences, i.e. arrests up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
It has also been recorded a second-grade crime with a day of detention and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time Palin is accused of criminal acts.
In December 2017 he was accused of stealing his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to signal the alleged aggression.
The case is at the moment under examination by the Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic aggression, of stopping the charge of crime and possession of a weapon while he was drunk in relation to the incident.
His client accused him of hitting her with a bullet in her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for linking the child’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome due to the past period in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications network is not working and the victim's budget is intended to be released in the coming days.
The earthquake struck along Sulawesi Centrale which is located in the northeastern part of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On the social media, video shows the time of impact.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people were gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors ask for extraordinary capital punishment for suspected terrorist attacks in NYC
New York's federal prosecutors ask for capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the author of the terrorist attack that has caused the death of eight people: a rare punishment that has never been reported since 1953 for a federal crime.
Saipov, aged 30, has been accused of using a home Depot rental car to play on a bicycle track along the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan area by investing pedestrians and bikers in October.
On the basis of the conditions for the request for capital punishment in the Southern District of New York, in order to justify the death sentence, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intensely" and otherwise "intensionally" affected serious bodily injuries.
According to the Court's document, both of these charges may lead to the death sentence.
Seven weeks after the attack, a large federal juror issued to Saipov 22 imputation heads who included eight murder charges with a criminal association, used in kind by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of cars.
The attack called for "a true planning and premeditation", the prosecutors said describing how Saipov brought it to an end as "atrocious, cruel and abusive".
The preliminary notification states that "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused damage, injuries and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucco".
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
Ten years have passed since New York's southern district was the last case of capital punishment.
The man quoted in the trial, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but finally he was sentenced to war in September 2009.
The death sentence was executed for the last time in New York in 1953 for the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife accused of cospiration through spying and crimes for passing information to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The Rosenberg couple both died on the electric seat on June 19, 1953.
On the basis of the documents of the Tribunal, Saipov, native of Uzbekistan, did not show any signs of penance in the days and months following the attack.
The police claim that in front of the investigators, he was proud of what he did.
According to the accused, Saipov told the authorities that he had decided to end the attack after watching the ISIS video on his phone.
He also asked the police to add the ISIS flag to his hospital room.
As regards the 22 heads of taxation, it was declared innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, was called "of course delucidated" by the decision of the accused.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty rather than to accept a confession of guilt and to condemn the army without any possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all people involved," Patton said.
The Saipov defence group had previously asked the prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Member of Parliament Tory states that NIGEL FARGE must conduct Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today swore to "mobilising the People's Army" during a protest at the Tory Conference.
When one of the members of the parliament of the Party of Theresa May suggested that he should deal with negotiations with the European Union, the former leader of the United Kingdom Party for Independence said that politicians should "press the pressure" of the Eurosceptics.
In March, conservative Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "be already out of Europe" if Farage was the Secretary for Brexit.
But the challenges that May must face in trying to reconcile the positions of its deeply divided party have been underlined by the Torys who have participated in a separate protest against Brexit in London.
The first minister is trying to apply the Chequers Plan between the attacks of Brexit supporters, those who want to remain in Europe and the European Union.
The allies insist on continuing the attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the strong collective response, and restricting the Euroscetics and the workers to choose between what May proposes and the "caos".
At the board of Leave Means Leave held in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to leave the Chequers Plan.
He suggested that the task of conducting negotiations with Brussels should have been entrusted to Farage.
"At this moment we will be out of Europe," he said.
Parliament member Wellingborough added: "I am for Brexit, but we must abandon the Chequers Plan."
Explaining the reasons for his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We have not fought a world war to be servants.
We want to be able to apply our laws in our country."
Good rejected the views that the public opinion would be changed by the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to remain in Europe is completely false."
Parliamentary Tory Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of Brexit, also participated in the court and told journalists: "I just tell the prime minister to listen to people.
The Chequers Plan is not appreciated by the public opinion in general, the opposition will not vote and will not be pleased with the interests of our party and our activists who turn for the streets to hunt for votes in order to convince us to be elected.
Let's lose the Chequers Plan and start listening."
In an incisive message for May, he added: "The prime ministers can keep their place when they keep their promises."
In the Committee, Farage stated that politicians should be able to "press the pressure" if they intended to translate the decision taken with the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to convert Brexit, and we're here today to tell them we won't allow it."
In a message for the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to feel the pressure on our political class that is about to translate Brexit.
We intend to mobilize the people's army of this country that has voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, those who prefer to stay in Europe have marked the way to Birmingham before having a two-hour commission in the city centre.
A demanding number of activists urged Tory against Brexit's flags after the group's formation this weekend.
The laboratory has chosen the conservators for the safety problems they have had with an app of the party at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who claim to be able to install IT systems and all technology for Canada's agreement more, for unlimited borders and for trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's all a joke.
A good Brexit doesn't exist," he concluded.
Warren is seriously thinking of applying to the presidency.
Senator USA Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections he will think seriously if he can apply to the presidency.
According to Boston Globe, the democratic senator of Massachusetts Saturday spoke about his future during a civil assembly in the Western Massachusetts.
Warren, often critical of President Donald Trump, was asked to re-election in November against the Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired by the 2016 Tromp campaign in Massachusetts.
The hypothesis that it could challenge Trump in 2020 was in the air for a long time.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with the electors in the form of a civil assembly from the time Trump settled.
A participant asked him if he intended to apply for the presidency.
Warren replied that it is now that "women go to Washington to set up the government and this implies that a woman recovers the highest charge."
Arrest for the murder of the LSU Sims player
Baton Rouge's police, in Louisiana, made it known that he had arrested a suspect for the murder of the LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at 11:00 on ETNews.
Friday he had a video of the murder asking for help to identify a man visible in the sequences.
Sims, 20 years old, was beaten and killed near the campus of the Southern University soon.
"Wayde Sims reported a gun wound to his head that caused his death," said chief of police Murphy J. Paul on 247Sports.
Wade intervened to defend a friend and was hit by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was on the scene of the crime in possession of a gun and had hit Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and detained in standby at the Parish Police Department of East Baton Rouge.

Russia's Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after victory on Sebastian Vettel thanks to team orders
On Saturday Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of his partner Lewis Hamilton, it was clear immediately that the orders of the Mercedes team would have severely conditioned the race.
From the field, Bottas is a good part of letting Hamilton defend himself from Vettel's attacks in the first two days.
Vettel stops first to the boxes leaving Hamilton in the traffic of the group code, which may be decisive.
Mercedes makes the back of the next round by going back to the track behind Vettel. Hamilton, however, skips it after some routine actions in which the Ferrari pilot tries to prevent the passage inside by risking to finish out after a double move to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen is part of the last row of the grid but at the end of the first round is already seventh on the day of his 21st birthday.
So guide the course for most of the race without stopping to box for rubber change and try to quickly finish over Kimi Raikkonen winning the fourth place.
At the end, however, you have to put the stop to the 44th round and in the remaining 8 rounds it is not able to increase the pace and exceed Raikkonen, which reaches the room.
"It's a hard day because Valtteri worked very well for the whole weekend and it was really nice to make me go through.
The team has done an extraordinary job to win the first and second positions," said Hamilton.
A brutal example of body language
In a committee held on Saturday, President Donald Trump called on Senator Diane Feinstein for his insistent support that he did not reveal the contents of Christine Blasey Ford's letter, which accused him of attempting to surprise the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
During a committee in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about the testimony made by the Ford before the Court of Justice Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate proves that people are "mechanists, prisoners and budgets".
"What can happen and what's happening in the last days in the Senate where people are angry, mixed, trapped and budgeted" said.
"When there are clear signs that the news is published and the responsible say "Oh no, it wasn't me.
I could never do that."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you reveal the news?
Remember his answer... did you reveal the contents of the document?--"oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't."
Wait a minute.
We revealed it... No, we didn't do it" added imitating the senator.
The letter in which the Ford accused Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the content was published in early September, but Feinstein denied that the registration was withdrawn from his office.
"I didn't hide the charges of Professor Ford, but I didn't reveal his story," said Feinstein to the committee, as reported by The Hill.
"He asked me to keep the information hidden, and I did."
But his remarks are not credible to the president, who during the Saturday evening committee commented: "I say this, this is just a bad example of the body's language.
Maybe he didn't, but this is the worst example of the body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of attempted sexual act by three women, the president has suggested that democratics are using these charges for their own purposes.
"They are trying to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the machine, the capture. They don't care who damages, who have to pass over to regain power and control," said the president as reported by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer has signed two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars recovered after the weekend's failure in the game of Elite League against the Belfast Giants winning the return race for 5-3 Saturdays in Dundee.
The Giants were immediately passed in favour of two goals on the arrows of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the team home to the couple before Dwyer brought the Giants back in favor.
Francois Bouchard has signed the case for the Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen declared their victory.
It was the third squatt of Elite League for Adam Keefe's men that Friday evening in Belfast had set up and won the game with the Dundee for 2-1.
The two teams have already met four times in this season and the Giants have won the first three parties.
Dwyer signed the first round at 3:35 on Kendall McFaull's assistant, while Beauvilleer doubled after four minutes on David Rutherford's assistant.
In what was a very animated first time, Sullivan brought home team at 13:10 a minute before Matt Marquardt provided the assistant of the match at Cownie at 15:16 a.m.
Dwyer has declared the advantage for the Giants by marking the second round of the evening at the end of the first time.
The house team re-compensated and Bouchard restored the match after a strategic manoeuvre at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran have contributed to Nielsen's action that has brought the Dundee in favor for the first time in the meeting at the end of the second time and has ordered the victory of his team by marking the fifth round in the middle of the last time.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five meetings at this point, will play the next game at Milton Keynes on Friday.
Flight controllers to allow hundreds of passengers to land on the ground
In Indonesia a flight controller will be acclamationd as heroes after he was killed to allow a plane that carried hundreds of people to land them safely.
More than 800 people are dead and many are scattered because of a powerful earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday causing a tsunami.
Strong shelters continue to interest the area, and many are intertwined with the mackerel in the city of Palu.
But although his colleagues were fled to save their lives, the windscreen Antonius Gunawan Agung remained in his place in the control tower of the Mutiala Sis Al Jufri airport, which was suddenly oscillating.
He wanted to make sure that Batik Air 6321, which was on the track, managed to land safely.
So he was hit by the control tower when he thought he was going to roll.
He died later at the hospital.
The Indonesian air Navigation spokesman Johannes Sirait said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by the Australian issuer ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another town.
Fortunately he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"For us it's really sad news," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of victims can reach the thousands and the national disaster counter-attack agencies will make it clear that access to the cities of Dodrya, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"The death account is intended to increase because many bodies are still under the mackerel and it has been impossible to reach many others," explains Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Where up to 6 meters have destroyed Palu, where Sunday a mass burial will be performed.
Military and commercial flights are transporting aid and livelihoods.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance carries bodies.
The clean water is dissipating.
The minimum markets are stored everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to the CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is doing its best to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to Palu Sunday and said to the men of the country's army: "I invite you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation activities.
Are you ready?", as reported by CNN.
During the year Indonesia was already hit by terrorists in Lombok, where 550 people were killed.
Aerospace in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims there is a dispersion after the damage to the lake
The flight company that has fallen into the Gulf of the Pacific in Micronesia, after claiming that all 47 passengers and crew members were able to save, now claims there is a dispersion.
According to the news of Air Niugini, updated on Saturday afternoon, a passenger misses the call.
The airline confirmed that it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details on the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local ships allowed other passengers and crew to arrive after the accident while the aircraft was trying to land at the airport of Chuuk Island.
According to official sources, on Friday seven people were transported to the hospital.
The airline claims that six passengers have been recovered from the hospital on Saturday and are all in stable conditions.
What has caused the incident and the exact sequence of events are not yet clear.
The U.S. Air Company and Marine maintain that the plane is precipitated in the lake because it did not reach the track.
Some witnesses claim that the plane has crossed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane has reached a very low rate.
"And it was really a fortune," said Jaynes.
Jaynes then explained that he and others, walking in the water that came to life, were able to reach the airport emergency exits.
He added that the flight attendants were taken from the panic and screamed and that he was struck slightly at his head.
According to the U.S. Navy, even some mariners who were working in the vicinity to set up a bridge have provided assistance using a rubber to transport people on the river before the plane crashed about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicate that in the last two decades 111 people have died of plane accidents in the airlines registered with PNG but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analystist rebuilds the night of the burned alive woman
On Saturday, the trial was presented in the new trial against a man accused of burning a woman of Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used the cell phone data to rebuild the motions of the vintage accused Quinton Tellis and the victim of the dicyannovane Jessica Chambers, on the night he died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed that he recovered the location data of several cell phones that show that, contrary to what he said, Tellis was with the Chambers the night he was killed.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the period he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford presented himself in court on the Sabbath and testified that the day was not in town.
When the public minister asked him if Tellis told the truth by claiming that that night was in Sanford's truck, he confirmed that he was "thinking because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistencies is the fact that Tellis claimed to meet Chambers for two weeks when he died.
Cell data indicate that they were known only for a week.
Rowlett explained that after the death of Chambers, Tellis removed messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He cancelled her from her life," said Hale.
The defence will begin its final Sunday argument.
The Court of Justice provides that the judgment shall enter into force on the same day.
The High Breed: What is the hip-hop known?
A three hip-hop wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by inserting it into its brands of positive messages.
The High Breed group, of Bristol, claims that hip-hop has been away from its origins when it spread political messages and reported social problems.
Instead, they want to return to the origins and make a kind of conscious hip-hop.
Artists such as the Fugees and Common have recently returned to the UK thanks to characters such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another nigger?
New York's dad quotes a couple in court for licenseing her with a "racist" text
In New York, a father quoted a couple in court for having licensed her in a discriminatory way after receiving a text in which the mother regretted the fact that she was "another black".
The couple refuse to be racist by comparing the request to a real and own "storation".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed his disappointment when he discovered that his new father, Giselle Maurice, arrived for his first day of work in 2016, was black.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO A'ALRA", wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message for the husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after taking account of the error, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman "serious" licensed Mrs Maurice saying that she was not satisfied with their previous father, an afro-American, and that she was expecting a Filipino.
He paid Mrs Maurice's day of work and sent her home with a taxi.
Maurice quoted the couple in court and, in order to be licensed, asked for a refund for the beauty of $350 a day for the six months of full-time work for which she was initially employed, even without a contract.
"I want them to understand that they can't behave like this," he said on Friday at the Post adding, "I know it's a discrimination."
The couple responded to the racism charge saying that Maurice's license was the only thing to do because they were afraid they could not trust her after she had been infected.
"My wife sent you a message in which she said something she didn't mean to say.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist people," said husband Joel Plasco to Post.
"Would you trust your children to a person with whom you have been kidnapped, even if it was a mistake?
Your boyfriend?
I don't think so."
Comparing the request to a real and own "storation", Plasco said that the wife had been away for just two months and is in a "very difficult situation".
"You can't reach a person in this way.
It's not a very nice behavior," the financial consultant added.
While the legal case is still under way, the court of the public opinion has immediately accused the spouses of social media by criticising them for their behavior and for the following logic.
A letter reveals that Paddington's editor feared that readers would not appreciate a talking ear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, was born shortly after the book was accepted, comments the letter: “It is not easy to put into the hands of those who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's fun now that we know the great success achieved by Paddington."
Assuming that the father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before writing the book for children inspired by an orchestra, would not have responded well to the rejection of his work, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was a little " sad" after his death last year.
As for Paddington, which you describe as "a very important member of our family" adds that the father was modestly proud of his success.
"He was a pretty quiet man, not a decent person," he said.
"But Paddington was so real to him that he was acting like when he had a son who reached a trap: you're proud of him even if he didn't deserve you.
I think you'd interpret Paddington's success in this way.
Even though it was a creation of his imagination, he attributed the merit to Paddington himself."
I had to call my daughter who was dying.
On the landing, the daughter was transferred suddenly to Nizza Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad has called me several times to tell me that the situation was really serious and that our daughter wouldn't have done it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then he called me to tell me he would die in a few minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I want you so good.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of medications given by doctors to allow the heart to continue pumping was slowly increasing.
He died a while ago and it was over.
I had to stay sitting and wait knowing that all of this was happening.
I couldn't complain, scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to deal with it."
In the end, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, a teenager for the loss of the daughter, went on board the plane with the other ignorant passengers of what was happening to her.
"No one knew it," he said.
"For all the time I did nothing but cry in my head.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I felt an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought I needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Two adult women's tickets to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women whose hearts have been murdered commit themselves to prevent others from performing the same gesture.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have attacked a bridge in the Galles with motive messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he started to suffer from depression and died at 18.
"I don't want no parent to feel like I feel every day," she says.
Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, relates that his son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew about his smile.
They always said he was lighting every room in which he came in."
But before he died he left his job because depression had brought him "in a really empty place".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, found him after he took his life.
Davis says, "I'm still afraid you're checking for a chain effect."
He created the tickets "to let people know that there is someone they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
They don't have to isolate themselves, they have to talk."
Humphreys, who's a friend of Davies for years, lost Mark, his 15-year-old companion, not long after his mother died.
"You never said you'd feel better or depressed," she says.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed that her attitude had changed.
The day of Christmas touched the bottom. When the children opened the gifts, he refused to look at them in the eyes."
He says that his death was a huge trauma that they had to work on: "The family has fallen asleep.
He did us pieces.
But we had to go ahead and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain: the FBI has launched investigations
"I think if we can proceed as he has asked, i.e. with limited time and scope, we can reach an agreement," he said Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the Commission itself "lost peace" because of the blockade of radical supporters.
Why does Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to find out?
Their repudiation is due to the choice of time.
Only five weeks are left for the election of half-sent, on 6 November. If the Republicans as planned will achieve a negative outcome, they will be very weak in their attempt to make the choice of the man they have chosen for the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators under pressure to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and thanks to him he met Ashley's wife, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has completed its report?
He will vote in Senate, which is currently composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes to the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice-president, to break the charges and confirm them to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korea's political refugees "minimum" with Kim
A South Korean legislator claims that the number of North Koreans seeking political refuge in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un was released to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting the data from the Ministry of the South Korean Union, states that the refugees were 1.127 last year against 2.706 in 2011.
Mr. Park explains that the main reasons are a stricter control of the border between North Korea and China and the highest tariffs ask who makes these people out illegal.
Pyongyang has not issued public statements.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which borders with North Korea is longer and easier to cross than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) strongly protected between the two Koreas.
China considers them illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriate them with force.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still technically in war, have been significantly improved in recent months.
This month the two countries have already met in Pyongyang to discuss negotiations on denuclearization that are in a state of emergency.
After this historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which they agreed in general to cooperate to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized US sanctions for lack of development since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be certain of our national security, and under these circumstances there is no possibility that we will proceed to unilateral disarmament for the first time," said Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi defines Brett Kavanaugh "styrico" and claims that it is not suitable for the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority Nancy Pelosi defines the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "stirious" and claims that he is not naturally fit to recover this burden.
Pelosi expressed this opinion Saturday in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I think that if a woman had acted the same way, she would have been defined as strict," said the Pelosi about the statement made on Thursday by Kavanaugh before the Senate's judicial committee.
Apparently excited Kavanaugh denied the accusation of sexually harassed Professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was in the mood, so much to get near to scream and with the narrow throat from the plant while talking about his family and the years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Committee's democracies who have defined the charges against him as a "surprised and coordinated diffamatory campaign" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi believes that Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he cannot enter the Supreme Court because he has demonstrated that he has been prevented from being democratic.
"I think she has been self-exclusive with her statements and the way she talked about Clinton and Democrats," she said.
The Pelosi then raised an objection when they were asked whether Kavanaugh would try to make a case in case it was confirmed and whether the Democrats should reach the majority of the House of Representatives.
"I think that if it does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it is not only appropriate for the Supreme Court, but not even for the court that is now in charge," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Court of Appeal for the Circuit of the District of Colombia.
Pelosi added that, as a democracy, he is concerned about the potential decisions of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh raised questions about his intentions to violate certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
The Pelosi stated that "A Syrian and a party cannot be sent to the Supreme Court and wish this decision to be accepted in a positive way".
And women must use it.
It's a fair, month and year of attacks of anger that can't go out without crying.
"We pray when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do you?"
And he went on, "It helped me a lot of help to a woman who was a leader of some parts. She told me that she was crying too when she was angry, but she had developed a technique for which when she was angry and started crying she said to the person she was talking to "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then he went on.
I thought it was a brilliant idea."
The complaints are tolerated as a result of anger partly because they are basically not understood.
One of the nicest memories I have of a previous job in a male prevalence office is that one time I was sent to cry for an access to anger. A woman older than me, a glacial manager from whom I was always slightly terrorized by my arrest for the beating and dragged me across the stairs.
"Don't let me see you crying," he said.
"I don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're happy because they're in trouble with you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic member of the Colorado Congress, collaborated with Gary Hart on his way to the presidentials.
In 1987, when on a ship called Monkey Business, the extraordinary report of Hart that you had to give up on the course, Schroeder, very disappointed, thought there was no reason why he should not try to apply for the presidency.
"In fact, it wasn't a well-balanced decision," he said, laughing about 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates running and no one else was sure to serve them.
Someone defined them as "Biancanave and the seven noses."
Since the campaign was already in an advanced phase, Schroeder was late with the fund collection and I swear it would not have been applied if it had not collected $2 million.
It was a stupid cause to start.
He discovered that some of the supporters who had given the candidates $1,000 to her would have given her only 250.
"They think I can get a discount?" he asked.
When he had the speech to announce that he would not launch an official campaign, he was so overwhelmed by emotions (thanks to the people who had supported him, depression to the system that made it more difficult to find money and voters who represented and angry for the sexual discrimination he was a victim).
"It seemed like I was in the grip of a nervous breakdown," recalled Schroeder thinking about the printing reaction.
"Someone could have thought that Kleineex was my company sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my paper.
Maybe it's "too much."
How the U.S.-China Trade War could favour Pechino
The attacks on the opening of the US-China war have been fragile and, while the fight is all but over, experts say that a contrast between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, has already launched this year's first warning by taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation was made this week with the new taxes on articles for over 200 billion dollars (€175 billion) of value, which means they will be applied to half of Chinese goods.
Pechino has always responded with measures of the same type applying recent taxes from five to ten percent over 60 billion dollars of US dollars.
China has promised to respond to the US attack on the attack and it is unlikely that the second largest economic power of the world will soon go back.
Because Washington would have to give up his demands, but to join the United States publicly would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts believe, however, that if Pechino plays his cards well, the pressures of the U.S. trade war can have a positive impact on China in the long term, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision of Washington or Beijing can create the initial conditions of an economic collapse in both countries is far more dangerous than what has been recognized so far," says researcher Abigail Grace, who studies Asia at the Center for New American Security research center.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, supported by the Foreign Minister
Syria says to be ready for the return of refugees and is looking for help to rebuild the country destroyed by the last seven years of war.
In front of the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions of the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the territory is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to recover the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country which had to leave behind because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and their support.
According to the United Nations estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million others who still live in Syria need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would accept voluntary assistance to rebuild the damaged country.
But he stressed that he would not accept any assistance under conditions or by those countries that supported the resurrection.
Europe wins victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The Europe team won the Ryder Cup 2018 by beating the US team with a final score of 17.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six consecutive times on the European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe reconnaissanced the trophie when the Danish captain team Thomas Bjorn reached 14.5 points that served to defeat the United States.
The US champion Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, launched his tea shot in the water at the sixteenth floor of the par 3 and granted victory in Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer was distinguished in all his tournaments by becoming one of the four players who always made a 5-0-0 registration since the tournament with the current formula was discussed for the first time in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was confused with the 5&4 score from the lower Danish player in the Thorbjorn Olesen class of the European team.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, joined 2&1 in English Ian Poulter who might have discussed his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, Spanish Sergio Garcia who has discussed it eight, has become the European player who has won more in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry but today I can't do it.
It was a hard year.
I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm glad I bought the cup again.
It is a team victory and I am glad that I made my contribution," said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
Pass the witness to his cousin John Ram who beat the legend of the Gulf of USA Tiger Woods with the score of 2&1 in Sundays.
"If I think I've grown up looking at his encounters, I'm really proud of having hit Tiger Woods," said the twentieth-century Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his parties in France and now the record of his meetings in Ryder Cup amounts to 13 wins, 21 sconfittes and 3 pairs.
A statistical strange if you think it's one of the biggest players of all times who won 14 of the main titles, according to Jack Nicklaus alone.
The USA team has been looking for the entire weekend to find the Fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played a high-level golf all over the tournament.
Captain U.S. Jim Furyk said after a delinquent performance of his team: "They're proud of these guys because they've fought.
At some point this morning we put pressure on the team of Europe.
We've broken through this occasion.
You're doing Thomas.
He's a big captain.
All of his 12 players were very well behaved.
We'll reorganize it, I'll work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup committee, and we'll go ahead.
I'm in love with these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
That's all we've done.
But they've played better than us."
