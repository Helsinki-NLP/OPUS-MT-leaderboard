Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in a white chair
He's a charismatic.
The Holy Spirit on Freedom and Health is at work.
He was a few hundred years old when things went wrong in his life.
Today, through the French, they've experienced this.
On the right by O. Witko, the Holy St. about release and healing lead to the dust.
Sometimes his parents came to him with a 7-month-old child who had a 7.5 mm hole in his heart.
It should have been repaired.
Joseph’s father, Witko, prayed about it.
The same day the boy was taken to the hospital at the funeral.
The doctors thought, "The operation is not necessary, the stay is only 1.5 mm".
My parents cried happy.
After the next prayer, the French bridge disappeared completely.
The extraordinary spiritual activity of the Creator began to be experienced as a generation.
In dreams, pure souls came to him asking for help.
I was built in the night and devoted to prayer for the dead and those who died at this moment – she remembers.
He also experienced the presence of a wicked spirit.
And he had a vision of what's going on with a man who's gonna commit death.
“My body began to change.
I lost my human character and started to get the animal look," he says.
The invisible force pushed him up, couldn't get his voice out of him.
He felt he was lost.
Then God showed him a reason.
"Sacrificed in the waters of the river symbolizeing the baptism of the saints, I was released and returned to human form..." she says.
He didn't tell anyone about these strange experiences.
There was a call in him.
He was 16 when he entered France.
He did not just want to talk about Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Members of the Charismatic Community of the Holy Spirit
Many people who count themselves to be cured by their father, Witko, are involved in the treatment of the disease.
However, the spiritual emphasis is that their main goal is spiritual healing, not physical.
First battle of Kolpinga FRAC Jarosław
Today (September 26th) the Colpinga FRAC team earned its current master, Polski Dartom Bogorii Grodzisk Mazowecki in the 3rd wheel of the Lotto Superligi Tennis Table.
The promotion of such a personal setting, which they presented to the growers, has no chance of winning with the sovereign leagues.
He showed this to Dart Bogoria.
He's still missing the team, calling the team leader Chen Jingqi.
Maybe it'll be the third of the triumph row in the new season.
Young Asian Qiyao Han seems to have not yet grown up to win with such storms as Greek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Paul Sirucek.
Not even one of the most prospective Poles, that is, Mark Badowski.
He was the largest star in the Mosir Hall at the Sikorski ul in Jarosław.
At the age of Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei were the class for themselves.
After three units, Kolping FRAC drove 2:1.
What Lei must have conquered Mark Badowski, and Daniel Gorak after the emotional, five-year-old battle – Paul Sirucka.
Then it was worse.
Gionis didn't give Lee a chance.
There may have been more hope of winning than two points, but Qiyao Han didn't leave Badoski.
There will be no additional studies for seniors.
Why?
According to Rafal Trsakowski's instructions, free probational studies for seniors in the 70s and 80s were to be carried out in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be put into effect because it did not obtain the approval of the Ministry of Health and was subject to the Agency for the Protection of Health Technology and Customs.
The agency reasoned that the target group had been badly damaged.
‘Special actions may, therefore, affect the detection of individual diseases, which may contribute to increased difficulty in accessing NFZ evidence and negative effects on the patient due to anxiety and discomfort associated with the false positive outcome of the studies,’ it was said.
The decision of the resort does not make sense to the president of the capital.
"The money is ours, we've planned the money for it.
Only the government is afraid that if people are tested, they will later go to a doctor, which is absurd, because it is just about to lead to a situation in which prosthetics can be performed faster.
All experts know that this helps when it comes to stressing the health system, because it helps to detect diseases quickly and in a healthy way.
The court has a very strange position here that I don't understand," said Rafał Trsakowski.
“I find it hard to imagine that white specialists say, ‘Let’s not be afraid that the doctors will be longer on the road, and if such specialists advise the government, I’m not surprised that there is a health service in this condition’, the PO policy added.
Palestine corresponds to Israel: We will establish all existing agreements
Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas announced in the fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly that all agreements with Israel would be concluded if the next government of the country is trying to comply with Benjamin Netanjahu's order on the anaesthetics of the occupied Palestinian countries.
"If the government of Israel comes to come to the realization of this plan, we will implement all the agreements signed (with Israel) and we will withdraw from all the commitments made," he said.
"We will reject the whole and complete plan," he threatened with the pressure of Abbas.
"It is our duty to defend all our rights by any means possible – little important, which will follow – by fully engaging in the application of international law and in the fight against terrorism," said the President of the Palestinian Autonomy, who made similar statements in July.
Netanyah, the current Prime Minister of Israel, again received a government-building mission on 17 September following the elections.
A week before the elections, he announced that if they were won, he would announce the axiety of the Jordan Valley and intend to include all Jews in Israel throughout the West Bank.
At the beginning of the 1990 ’ s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by Jaser Arafat, signed a number of peace agreements that were sponsored by the United States.
At the 84th session of the United Nations General Assembly, Abbas also promised to conduct general Palestinian elections on the ground.
The last thing happened in 2006.
"After returning to the country to the West Bank, to the Gaza Strip and to East Jerusalem, and all who would oppose them, they will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community," the Palestinian President said warmly.
Abbas also defended the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer at the UN, for the benefit of the rights of “a full-time member of the United Nations and all its organs and institutions”.
The Palestinian leader concluded his speech by calling on the international community "to force Israel to comply with all the provisions of the United Nations".
Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas' speech, stating that the Palestinian leader "will join the UN in the efforts of the Palestinian Autonomy against Israel rather than fight against calls for terrorism in Autonomy under his leadership".
However, Danon, as the agencies refer to, did not link to what Netanyah ordered by the Palestinian country's occupied anaks.
The warlords want defibrillators in the Neural Points of Industry.
History from the border crossing shows that an AED automatic defibrillator can save human life.
The Defence Station of the Soviet Union in the industry wants such equipment to be found in the neural points of the city.
The officials received free diplomas from the Vojevodjejkajjka ready for the Ratunko Station in the industry for their appointment.
Applicant Daniel Cyrnek, senior applicant Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Vajcik are the staff of the Subcarpocky Office of the Customs Office in Industry.
On 28 August they completed the service at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medice. The function officer of the Celno-Scarbowe Service noticed a man lying in the direction of the flight.
The Chinese activist died in the arrest for the effects of torture.
He wanted to benefit from the rights guaranteed by the Constitution
To Cao Shuxia, an activist's wife, he called the Communist Party Secretary on 23 September from her family village to announce that the husband had just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
The cause of death, he did not reveal.
At Cao's bones, she saw the body of a masquerade man, not to be recognized.
"His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were all in the blood," said the woman.
"They didn't allow me to take the cellphones with them, and there were a lot of cops who didn't get close to Wang."
The police insisted that she sign a statement that the husband was seriously ill and died as a result of a “missing accident. ”
105 million zł for company from industry video game from the National Centre for Research and Development
Nearly 105 million have been financed by the company from the gambling industry, creating innovative solutions.
The National Research and Development Centre announced on Friday the results of the third edition of the GameINN programme.
Among the nearly 30 projects supported by the NCBR, there was the development of a platform for the creation of field games based on the AR game engine, which creates a real world map with an application that enables users to send data; a test-training platform for verifying practical skills in terms of work and professional performance using VR and AI technology; an innovative game that simulates the management of real production processes using a innovative world-based model based on the virtual world interaction with the real use of the industry's version of the NBR industry.
The goal of the GameINN sector programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish industry of the video industry in the global market by 2023.
According to the NCBR, the Polish sector is now playing video growing at 10% a year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish market video game in 2016 amounted to 1.85 billion evil, while the forecast for 2019 was 2.23 billion.
"A specially prepared GameINN research agenda with 300 million positive support for entrepreneurs under this sectoral programme is an important incentive for further dynamic growth of the Polish game", we read in the Communication.
The video game industry is a perfect example of the effective use of the potential we have in Poland.
"The government's incentives for innovative entrepreneurs such as B+R, competence upgrade programmes, IP box or support programmes carried out by NCBR will promote innovation activities and enable them to be more effective in the highly competitive market," the Vice-President, Minister of Science and Education of higher Jarosław Gowin quoted in the communication.
The Head of the Research Centre notes that innovation money not only deals with innovatives in terms of project funding, but also remains in their budgets – from the B+R in 2018, three-quarters of the entrepreneurs have benefited from it more than a year earlier.
‘The estimated cost of B+R activities was 1.7 billion, which resulted in more than 300 million savings for companies benefiting from this gap.
This is the balance of support provided by the NCBR in three GameINN editions," the vice-president stressed.
The director of the NCBR Dr. Wojciech Kaminieecki also recalls that in two previous competitions for funding of a total of more than 211.2 million dollars was awarded to 78 innovative projects.
The wide interest in competition III and the diversity of the applications made show that the video game industry has ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive ambitions.
“In particular, the fact that, as in previous editions, there are projects on solutions that serve not only for divorce but also for industry 4.0” adds.
In the third round of the GameINN competition on financing even 20 million injury could be attributed to entrepreneurs, corporate consortia and corporate consolidation with scientific entities.
The NCBR has been affected by 87 applications for a total amount of funding of approximately 317 million malt.
The tender budget at the time of the tendering was 100 million, but it was increased by almost 105 million for the 27 projects.
Detailed information on the results of the GameINN competition is available on page ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN sectoral programme is implemented under the Operational Intelligent Development Programme.
The NCBR launched a programme in 2016 in response to the initiative of the companies associated with the Polish Games Agreement, including companies such as CD Project, Techland, CI Games, Bloomer Team or 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga committed to stealing the castle Kasper Dolberg
It was September 16th.
Dolberg, who finally arrived from Aaksu Amsterdam to Nice at the end of August, focused on training that he had lost his temper.
It wasn't like that, because it's worth 70,000 euros.
The next day, the Grand Duchess did not appear on the stakes, explaining the problems of Christmas.
From the beginning, it was a matter of concern.
The pilots in the room have private safes, and the club field is monitored.
According to the AFP agency for theft, Diaby-Fadiga was finally granted.
18 years ago he asked Dolberg and other colleagues from the team and coach Patrick Vieir.
He also promised Duncy to return the money for the ransom.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most prospective drivers of a young generation in France.
He went to Nicei as a 30-year-old in order to be in charge of the first team three years later.
In this season, he got up in seven matches.
He recently signed a professional contract, but, as L'Equipe newspaper put it, the club is likely to develop it with immediate effect.
In the event of a disciplinary action against his employer.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on the matter.
Check if you're sure you're doing well.
We all know that they need to be washed (e.g. after coming home or before lunch).
But not everyone knows that to actually avoid injuries, you have to do it in the right way.
This is especially important now when serious infections occur.
It takes at least 30 to 40 seconds to remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our bones
And most of us are shorter!
It is not true that it has to be antibacterial (a lot of doctors are aware of it).
By eating, we can not only wash the feet and hands of the hands, but also: the ends of the fingers (connected or single) – beat them with cholesteral movements on the inside of the second arm, spread between the fingers (pay hands, hugging your fingers), the girls – each of us includes the other arm and in this way we cut them for a moment in the right and the left.
In an emergency situation (when you cannot wash your hands) you should wash your hands with a wet shower and then use your antibacterial gel (drugs, from 5 o’clock).
After use of the public toilet, do not touch the doors or doors (the recommendation of the General Inspectorate of Sanitary).
Open it with the paperman.
Iran's president says he rejected the US proposal, Donald Trump protests.
Tehran did not negotiate with the US during the United Nations General Assembly in New York, despite the US offer of sanctions, President Hassan Rowhani said on Friday.
U.S. President Donald Trump commented that the Iranian party asked for restrictions on what he did not agree with.
According to Iran President Hassan Rowhanie, the Americans proposed the abolition of all the sanctions imposed on Tehran in order to negotiate a new international agreement.
It should regulate both the Iranian nuclear programme and the ballistic pressure building program.
Rowhani: Iran will not talk in the atmosphere of maximum pressure
The President of Iran said he did not agree to take these talks on the "toxic atmosphere".
He said he met the American diplomats because he was in charge of France, Germany, and Great Britain.
However, he stressed that Iran would not engage in a "maximum pressure" atmosphere.
"And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in 5+1, no one is able to predict what the final outcome will be," Rowhan said.
Earlier, the Iranian leader said that he did not exclude talks with the US, and the European nuclear agreement was banned by the European side by the US sanctions on Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran after the U.S. entry into the nuclear agreement "are an initial condition which does not allow" dialogue.
If we can get rid of this condition first and if America suffers from sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America – he made a statement.
He added that he did not exclude the meeting with the President of the United States Donald Trumpe, although he did not agree to such a conversation in the mid-week session of the United Nations General Assembly.
Trip: "Ian asked, I said no"
Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that he rejected the Iranian page request.
"Iran wanted me to remove the sanctions imposed on them so we could meet.
Of course I said "no!" the president of the United States protested.
Pressure with an atomic agreement in the background
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to alleviate tensions between Washington and Tehran in some way to save the agreement with Iran from 2015, which were signalaries.
She suggested that, in order to remove the economic sanctions, Iran would withdraw from the nuclear-weapon-building programme and the nuclear sector would be under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the withdrawal of the US from the May 2015 agreement, its signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the agreement in force.
Well, it didn't work out.
Washington uses the tactic of eliminating the maximum pressure on Iran, and sanctions also include full embargo on Iran.
Teheran said that if he did not receive a raw material export permit, he would limit his obligations resulting from the agreement for 60 days.

The judge of the Wojevodska Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of Emilia, who, according to her words and screens from WhatsAppa, participated in the trial against the judges, was brought back to the ground by the NSA.
The reason: there was no early disciplinary action against him, and therefore there was no basis for supporting President W.A. Wojciech Mazur's delegation to withdraw it from the duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a judicial officer at the NSA, initiated an investigation in August explaining the case against Smed, but it was not translated into the proceedings against him until this time.
Despite the fact that the NSA, which acts as a disciplinary judge in such cases, must take the decision of the president of the WSA within a month of its issue.
In this case, a judge who publicly told his wife about the mental problems of his wife to persuade her, who was removed from the KRS office on behalf of the Polish Republic because of suspicions of participation in the Heiter Group.
Judge Smydt is against his involvement in the Heiter Group.
He claims that there is no evidence of this except the distorted screens and words of his wife, who is divorced.
That's exactly what other judges have to say about "The Castle": they're all innocent, there's no evidence.
And it's quite possible that they put it on their own.
Because the prosecutor didn't turn his finger off to protect evidence from their electronics, he's also quiet about the contents of the phone Emili Szmydt, who kept the phone in the red in another case.
The police did not pull the trigger to secure the equipment of persons who were escorted by Judge Waldemar Žurek.
There's no evidence - there's no Smith, there's no Kasty.
There is also no case for NIK Chief Mariana Banasia to hire a trucker and hide revenues.
The CBA will check his property statements.
And check when it's checked.
However, the Commission does not take action to banasim because the Sejm is suspended (but the State Control Commission has somehow gathered to take a decisive decision on the withdrawal of the representatives of Banasia and its lawyer, although the law does not provide for such an emergency combination).
The whole thing reminds me of a movie novel, an American mistake about how the wife goes home and stops a man with a boyfriend in bed.
He's so excited and excited that he can't recite the words.
She's standing in the door, and at this time, she's getting out of bed quickly, she's crying, and she's coming out.
And the husband went to bed.
When the wife withdraws her voice and cries: what is that?
Who's this woman?
The husband calmly asks: What woman, love?
It's just that either Kasty or Banasia is a family of state.
And that's not funny at all.

Cornel Morawiecki is in a hospital in a state of difficulty
He was found in the hospital, and his doctors found his condition difficult.
I need to add that he's smart and aware.
"We'll find out from this that next time it wins.
We all pray for him to come back to health," said an anonymous close friend of Cornell Morawiecki in a conversation with the "Super Express" reporters.
In the near elections, the father of the prime minister is applying for the Senate.
"In my life, I have the closest family and politics," said Colonel Morawiecki in a report he gave two weeks ago to the newspaper "Super Express".
In January, “Super Express” reported that 78-year-old Colonel Morawiecki was on trial at the Military Hospital in Wrocław.
“I was diagnosed with strange, disturbing symptoms, and I reported to the hospital.
It's been like I've got a ice cream.
But the worst was in front of me.
When a computer tomography study was conducted, it was found that I had a new drug...," said the father of the prime minister.
A few days later at the MSWiA hospital in Warsaw, Cornel Morawecki went through a serious operation.
As told by Morawicki, President Andrzej Duda sent to the hospital of his personal captain King Zbigniewa Krass.
The operation lasted about three hours and lasted mentally.
“I know that many people have prayed for me because I am very grateful.
Luckily, I don't have any more toilets.
I don't know if I'm gonna go through chemotherapy.
I'm giving myself to doctors of specialists who are better thought.
In case of this serious operation, I have to go back to some useful state.
I hope everything will be all right," said Colonel Morawiecki in January in a conversation with "SE".
"If I were to do a study later, it would be tragic and I would have fallen into this...," he added.
Cracows: 14th of May
The local police commanders in Krakow are looking for 14-year-old Nel Stollos.
Anyone who has any information about the missing person is asked to contact.
The missing 26 September evening came from the place of residence, and she did not return or contact her relatives until now.
Last time she was seen at Ul. Old Guest in Krakow.
Nel Stotlosa is 14 years old, measuring 167 cm, has blond hair and snoring eyes.
When she was last seen, she was wrapped in blue, shit and boots.
Anyone who has any information about the death shall be requested to contact the police under tel. 12 61-52-911, 12 61-53-616 or 112, 997.
It's a wave of wave jumps.
The title of the relationship from amateur sports events that took place on Sunday, September 15th, at the Oleandry Street in Oławi, may be for some of them.
To the real power of the road, I'm far away, but that's what I'm saying, it's one of the kind of horse rivalization...
The competition for jumppower is a major obstacle for drivers and horses, which in the most prestigious international professions exceed even two metres.
It is worth adding that the long-term and still deadly world record, established in 1949, by Chilean Albert Larraguibele, on the horse “huaso”, is 247 cm.
So high in Olava, of course, no one jumped, but the result of the best local amazone at 135 cm level is also not to be the worst...
The workshops organized by undisputed Jan Sienkieweichz and other JKS actors “In the Siodle”, were a visible part of the former "Technical Railways", which we will read in this issue on page 22.
There were eight amazones trained to drive in the Gulf of JKS.
Four competed on the horses, and four on the big horses.
In the first group, Nikola Szółdra was the best person ever to write, documenting the crazy "Sprinter".
This small, but as a dynamic space began to break the obstacles stretched at 40 cm and ended just when it was stationed with a top white distance of 125 cm from the ground.
However, it was not easy to do so and only after three further refusals it had been rejected by the competition jury since further filiation.
The second place in the jumps was Amelia Powlak, who had a "Fami", and a third of Lena Borunë on "Harmiderze".
She was always fighting the youngest tournament participant - Inga Aksman, a galloping and jumping by the obstacles on the little "Carmen" button.
More emotions have been accompanied by beginners and I see during the competition with large horses.
The dangerously visible fall involved Paulina Szewczyk, documenting the "Declaration" and Anastasia Abramenko, who went to the "Lotce".
Luckily, in addition to small clubs or Amazons, neither horses nor horses did anything wrong, so they continued to participate in the competition.
A number of problems with the introduction of the "Wineta" key to the park were affecting Veronica Luckiewicz.
There was a need for either coaches or other horses to the couple who were wearing a bit of "Wineta."
After the break with the park, she also walked in full swing, so for a few moments in the boxes and on the dilapidated floor was dangerous. "It's all under control!" Jan Seenkiewicz calmed down a bit of this frightened vision, especially those of the youngest.
From the start of the big horses' competition, Martha Masalska has been a great writer at the park, who has come to appreciate the beautiful "Whiskey".
This enough key, in pairs with experienced Amazon, followed the second approach in the final phase as first exceeded 135 cm and was the best result at the time.
However, the same height was also attributed to Paulina Szewczyk on "Declaration", Wernik Lückiewicz on "Wine" and Anastasia Abramenko on "Lotce".
Thus, all these crafts went out together to decoration and after prizes in the fashion of the bike, and finally, together with the Amazons in the kitchens in the course of the Radecki, they carried out an effective tour of honor, ending with these interesting and exciting professions.
Thank you.
The sports club "W Siodle" is deeply grateful to the competition sponsors for the power of jump during the XVI "Making Sports": the City Office in Olava, the Waterworks and Canalization plant in Olava, the Powiatwe Age and the company "Mustang".
Max Colonko withdraws from KWW Patriotic Revolution Maxa Colonko
KWW Patriotic Revolution Maxa Colonko is the name of the electoral committee under which political formation #R Revolution Mariusza Maxa Colonki had to go to parliamentary elections in October.
The revolution led its proposal, in particular, to young voters with a view to rights.
Before the elections, Colonko ordered cooperation with Mark Jakubiaki, or Paul Kukis, but did not reach any of these coalitions, and KWW Patriotic Revolution Maxa Colonko could not even collect enough signatures to display lists in any selection area in Poland.
Now Colonko has informed Twitter that he has completed cooperation with the KWW Patriotic Revolution Maxa Colonko.
"I'll wait for KWW to define my name.
Please accept my contact with the mentioned entity," he added, adding that more information will be brief.
In the meantime, we do not know whether the journalist will continue his work, whether it is the end of the #R Revolution.
On 4 July, in the U.S. Independence Day, U.S. journalist Mariusz Max Colonko reported on the establishment of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Colonko has listened to the lead in the YouTube channel Max TV, which comments on events in Poland and around the world.
“We have enough politicians, enough of your tough games, enough of your amateur governments.
It's time for the government to take over the nation and rule for the good of the people," Colonko said.
In the programme, the parties found, inter alia, issues relating to the judiciary (should be selected in general elections), tax changes (equivalent to free tax for all), military repairs (in the form of military assistance for NATO countries, with particular regard to Poland), referendum on the possession of weapons, the reduction of posts or the introduction of single electoral circuits.
A few days after the announcement of a new political formation, Mariusz Max Colonko joined the talks with Mark Jacubaiaki.
At the end of July, Colonko placed on his profile in social media information suggesting that #R will connect forces with Kukiz'15.
However, none of these coalitions finally succeeded.
GH: Gold near the point of balance
"The euro will be held in the next few months in the context of the 4.35-dollar disaster, which will result in a weak convergence on global markets," says Michael Bolliger of the GWW Wealth Management.
"Waiting for a stable pace of economic growth and stable monetary policy is talking about the stabilization of the notes of gold at the current stage," an expert assessment in the discussion with Bankier.pl.
Its view, despite the apparent pressure of the Inflation Policy Council, does not decide on the double-steps of the environment, in which the vast majority of central banks are in favour of politics.
"How much gold is properly valued – the notation of the euro should be maintained in the next few months around the apple 4,35 zł – so little attractive are the Polish bonds.
Much more profitable profitability than the Polish paper offers bonds from emerging markets," says Michael Bolliger, head of the allocation of assets to emerging markets in the GWW Wealth Management company.
According to a specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the connique in the world.
"The global reconciliation can still deepen, but it should not come to a severe recession but, most importantly, to the start of the PKB dynamics below zero," says Michael Bollinger.
"Innovators should not underestimate global actions that could damage the lack of prospects for a solution to the US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including the Donalda Trump and Brexit imputation procedure.
The most weak share markets should be maintained in Europe," the latest list of investors from the GWW Wealth Management Mark Haefele.
"The actions of the euro area countries should be higher than those of the US, as they are more sensitive to global trade insecurity and pre-deployment concerns," we read in the paper.
According to Michaela Bolliger, after the host market of the most dangerous countries' bonds, the 10-year-olds were even less than 0.74%, it is still possible to deepen the profitability gap.
In the longer term, however, the long-term profitability of long-term paper should not be limited to a short-term policy of money banks.
The largest field to reduce the foot has Fed, which should lead to a weakening of the American currency in the horizon for the next few years.
The long-term balance sheet for the euro notes is $1.29, which would mean 19 per cent of the potential for strengthening the common currency to the dollar.
We are looking forward to further reductions in Fedu's pace, which will result in a reduction in the world's monetary policy.
"In the long term, maintaining a dollar power may not allow deficits to be made on current and budgetary accounts," says Michael Bollier.
Bundeswehra loses his gun.
Third report of the German MON
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehra has reported the loss of 39 pieces of weapons, 39 parts of weapons and 19,445 pieces of ammunition – resulting from the secret installation of the RFN defence resource.
Information was provided by the dog belonging to the media group EditionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the State Parliamentary Office in MON Peter Taubera (CDU), two weapons, one part of the weapons and 3474 ammunition have been re-found.
Among the military equipment still missing are six universal carabins MG3, 11 automatic G3, four automatic carabins G36, six signal guns and two P8 pistols.
In addition, 30 lufs are missing for MG3 carabins.
The concern was expressed by the Vice-President of the Lewica Party, Martina Renner.
According to the RND journalist, the number of weapons and ammunition lost is "deterred".
Moreover, as a result of the investigations, only no part of the lost equipment was found.
Martina Renner summarized the effects of these actions as a "natural balance".
She also criticized the fact that the establishment did not result in the existence of the weapons found there during the investigation against Lieutenant Bundeswehry Franco A. In December 2017, the Federal Attorney General in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence against the security of the State and of violating the provisions of the law governing access to firearms.
Officials have decided to prepare for closures on German customs policies with a lack of legal and racist objections.
On his "black list" of targets that have fallen into the hands of prosecutors, the former Minister of Justice Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party and Annette Kahane, defended human rights and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung Foundation in Berlin.
Franco A. was illegally involved in the possession of four firearms, more than 1,000 ammunition and more than 50 explosives.
The crying children in the plane.
How to avoid them?
It's a solution.
The Japanese Airlines carrier has been using a function developed with the idea of persons for whom travel in the company of a crying child is a nightmare.
Through the Internet page, they allow you to check the location of the airport.
If the connection is to travel early in the second year of life, the child's icon shall appear on a particular reservation reserved by parents or guardians of the sitting.
The same person using the service of the carrier has the option of choosing a place away from that occupied by the small person.
The BBC indicates that the lines have already been informed of the imperfection of this solution.
"Children's icon" shall not appear when the ticket has been reserved by the third person or if the change of the aircraft has occurred at the latest.
As expected, the idea divided the internet.
Some Twitter users point out that travel with crying children can be solved through voice-reducing listeners.
They're kids, and we used to be with them.
"We must learn tolerance because soon we will need maps of seats for breathing lips or drinks," wrote user G Sundar.
Another interns noticed that he had been interrupted by crying children at the airport, but he changed his mind when he became a parent.
There is also a need for solutions introduced by Japan Airlines.
"Thank you for warning me before crying children during a 13-hour trip," wrote Rahat Ahmed.
Major's number of losses by the bank office of Thomas Cook
More than 25 thousand foreign tourists will not be arriving in October on a flight to Majorca as a result of the announcement made on Monday by Thomas Cook's travel agency.
As the independent representative of the Balearic Government Marc Pons announced on Friday, among the 25 thousand temporaryists who would not be able to use the late-war trip to Majorce, there are also those who had to travel with the companies directly related to Thomas Cook, such as Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80 per cent of the expected temporary residents who were forced to leave their residence in Majorce in the coming month were German citizens and Scandinavian states.
However, as Pons claims, because Thomas Cook did not guide tourists on the Balearic Islands during the November period, the losses to the local economy will be lower.
He stated that the Balearic government had already begun negotiations with international operators on the "Enterprise to the Majorki Market" after the British operator’s bank.
The newspaper Diario de Mallorca estimates that in October, due to the tourist crisis in Majorca, more than 1,000 people were lost.
About 800 are fired by Thomas Cook's office in Palmia.
The rest of the people are losing their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday along with the announcement of a fall by Thomas Cook in many major hotels, the owners of the property asked the guests to pay extra fees per night.
This situation has been experienced by several hundred tourists from Poland.
The Balearic Court estimates that by Thursday, several hundred hotels in Majorce have maintained activity at least by the end of October in connection with the announcement of fall by Thomas Cook and his cooperating company.
In addition to the fifth newspaper, Diario de Ibiza indicates that most of the hotels operating in Ibiza, which worked with the Thomas Cook group, are not intended to close the warehouse in the coming weeks.
The newspaper recalls that the British bankrupt co-operated with 42 hotels on this Balearic island.
In an autonomous environment, the Balearic authorities announced that they would return to the Government of Spain for the support of the region of EUR 100 million to cover the losses caused by the announcement by Thomas Cook's travel office.
It has been revealed that the biggest damage to this tourist archipelago, about 36 thousand people, is found in Majorce.
According to the Balearic government, Thomas Cook is a local tourist company, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of contracts relating to the season of June 2019, about EUR 5 million.

‘Rz’: The power of the government
"The effects of the Clean Air Programme are zero, and carbon particles will be cut off as if nothing had ever been done," we read on the first page of the Today's "Swift".
“To date, 82 thousand applications for the financing of a total of 2 billion malt have been submitted under the Clean Air Programme, from which 48 thousand decisions have been positive.
The applications accepted amount to more than 915 million zł", says "Rz", referring to data from the Minister of the Environment.
As the newspaper points out, the programme is only part of the costs incurred.
The results of the programme, which is strictly prohibited, shall be assessed as "low".
Self-governments, quoted by "Rz", are under the shadow of the "Clean Air" and, in particular, too much bureaucracy.
"The programme should be much simpler: electronic notification, sending invoices, possible performance control.
This would improve action," says the Burdzbark of Warmijski Jacek Wisniowski.
In the first year of action, activists from Poland have also noted that less than 1 per cent of the planned target of 3 million volleyballs has been achieved.
As Rz notes, although the programme budget is 103 billion bad for 10 years, that is 10 billion bad every year, this amount is virtual.
"In the budget of the National Environment and Water Economy Protection Fund for this year, it is reserved for a total of 1.4 billion evils," we read.

The US Congress agreed to sell Poland 32 of the latest F-35 aircraft.
"It's one of the last steps before the conclusion of the contract, but it doesn't end our work," Mariusz Blassek wrote on Twitter.

Barbie against stereotypes.

Manufacturer Barbie introduced a series of neutral sex toys to the market.
He wants to fight stereotypes in this way.
Manufacturer Barbie introduced a series of neutral sex jokes
In addition to Barbie with different skin color, figures or haircuts, Mattel's company has introduced neutral sex glasses to sell.
The "Creable World" series has a dog.
So children can decide whether Barbie has short hair or long hair.
Their garden consists of both the floor and the ceiling.
In the blink of the eye, white girls can become boys and turn around.
They are also available in different skin colors and with different colours.
It has also been rejected by emphasising the characteristics of the sexes – the gerogens that no longer have a full mouth, long hair and long neck or, in the case of Kena, a wide shoulder.
The company considers that children don't like when their girls have broken sex standards, and some parents and feminists are convinced that the games made with the idea of a particular sex are ambiguing girls' ambitions and strengthening traditional stereotypes.
"New girls will let all children feel free," says Mattel.
Lalka Barbie, who appeared on the market in 1959 in a high-speed sewing machine and boots, was repeatedly criticized for promoting “unhealthful stereotypes women, ” such as the unnatural proportion of the body.
The group has responded to criticism and has already introduced a chain of different skin colors to the market, as well as more round shapes.
There's also been clouds in the hidzabe.
Zandberg: circle or club Together can have a number of jobs
Zandberg, asked in ZET radio , his party's candidate lul can get to Seym from the list of left-wing groups (KW SLD whose list starts the candidates to the SLD, Wisny and Lewicy Sejm, starting with the joint logo “Lewica”), replied that this depends on the results of the committee.
"I believe the result will be very good because we feel that people are bound by the hope that Levica has not only the right, but also the power," he said.
According to Zandberg, the left can have 60-80 jobs.
“This may mean that a circle or a club will have a number of jobs together.
But it depends on Poles and Poles.
I'm not going to discuss and tell you how it's going to happen," he said.
Asked whether Lewica will have a separate circle, Zandberg said: “We are agreed that we are different, and we will not believe that there is no such diversity.
I think this diversity of Poland has been rewarded because we have shown that we have been able to agree on a common programme."
Asked whether the biggest beneficiaries of the common start were SLD leader Vladzimirz Czarzasty, Zandberg replied that his view was that the biggest beneficiaries are the Central and Left Elections.
In addition, given that the SLD will get a full subsidy, he said that "the political party's goal is to represent its voters."
Zandberg admitted that in the elections to Seym, he voted in favour of himself.
In the case of the elections to the Senate, he indicated that he would stop.
"The offer is diverse and in this offer there are candidates and candidates that are closer to my heart, but there are also those to which my heart continues," he said.
"I will, however, tell you very frankly and clearly that if I were in the district of No. 44, I would take a vote and vote in another round," he stressed.
"I should not have tried to vote in favour of the Minister of the Kazimier of the Vehicle (KO-PAP candidate)," he added.
In this area outside of the vehicle, the leader of RP Paulł Kasprazak and Marek Rudnikki from PiS are starting.
Dakar: Open the largest game in West Africa
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered on Friday in the capital for the opening of a large game, considered to be the largest in West Africa.
The Muslims arrived by bus, cars, and dog to the Bopp district, where a new game was formed that could accommodate 30 thousand believers.
The building was built by Brother Mouride, who belongs to a sufficiary of Islam that dominates Senegal.
Work on the game began ten years ago in the subterranean area of six hectares transmitted by the government.
The name of the game Massalikul Jinan ('The Road to Paradise') comes from the title of the version of the sword of Ahmado Bamba Mbakke, the 19th-century fraternal founder of the fraternal, celebrated by the saints.
The game is equipped with a career marble and has five minerals.
Most of them have 78 meters.
The game in the middle of the 15 thousand faithful, and the others can be on the outer space.
In the rich interiors, you can admire the well-being, the giant jewellery and the decorations made manually by workers from Morocco.
Constructionists claim that the game is the largest in West Africa, but the game is still not compared to the games in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassana II game in Casablance can be located 105 thousand faithful.
The building game, which cost more than 30 million euros, has been financed from private grants.
The Court, in addition to the land, has, on the other hand, founded lighting, sanitary equipment and financed road jobs of EUR 10.5 million.
Trainer Shyla: Our problem is not Słąsk, only we
An eight-legislative match pass without the victory of the Coronas pilots is attempting to stop at the fifth meeting with the Słóššššššščia extraclus.
"Our problem is not to redefine, only ourselves, we have to work on what we play," stressed the coach of Mirosław Smylah.
The Korona pilots last and until this time, the only victory in the people was in the first row, when they went out 1:0 binamin of the Raków Common.
They later forgot two remixes and six breaks, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 with the Deep Lubin in 1/32 Puchar Polski.
"I am impressed by the fact that in the last few seconds of the gunfighters were fighting on the brakes they wanted to fire.
Their fall on the wall after the last scene did not result in a fall, but it was a fall of wickedness, for they were so close," said Shyla.
As he pointed out, Slovakia has a very strong obstacle, so it will join the game in the side sectors of the forest.
"We have awareness of the quality of the opponent, but we also look at what we want to play," added the coach.
In the fifth game in Koron, there is no doubt about the overhauling of the yellow cards of Ognjen Gnjatic, which will also include Jacob Zubrovski and Michael Gardawski.
On the other hand, it's up to a couple of players who want to play.
"We've got headaches, it just seemed like it won't be, and it's now," said Shyla.
The Defence Forces of the Crown, Daniel Dewniel, pointed out that it will not be easy to defeat the eight-legislative matches of the race without victory, but everyone can win with everyone in the extraclass.
"We're a good team.
In the last few weeks, we may not show it to the bois, but this time will come that we will win and believe it will be Friday," said the driver.
After nine extraclusters of the Korona with a diameter of five points, it shall take point 15.
The crowd gathered 12 more and spread elsewhere.
The fifth game in Kielcach will begin at 20.30 p.m.
These trees can completely disappear from Europe
"42% of forest species in Europe are at risk," warns the International Protection of Nature (IUCN) in the fifth edition of the European Green Paper.
On the top of the list are cassava and marzabin.
IUCN, an organisation living in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered European trees for the first time.
It has been prepared by experts who, on the basis of studies, have proposed that 42% of the 454 species of trees in Europe (and in other parts of the world) are "high-risk".
Among the causes of the Red Paper is the rapid growth of urban agglomeration and global climate change.
The most dangerous, however, are the trees and plants that exist only or mainly on our continent.
In the case of a typical European tree, it is estimated that 58 per cent of IUCN species are at risk, and 15 per cent, 66 species of trees and plants, are at risk of extinction.
Among the main causes of the deterioration of the Red Paper is the exchange of errors in the exploitation of wood, rapid urbanization, too intense wood cuts, and further forest fires and changes in the European ecosystem.
According to the authors of the report, there is also a serious threat to the existence of a number of European alternatives to blood, muscle and tissue.
"The consequences of human activity lead to a gradual loss of European crops and create in Europe a risk of the loss of important and inadequate alternatives, which are the basis of European ecosystems and have an impact on our planet's health," the report by Luc Bas, which guides the European IUCN.
Grzegorz Schetyna: I do not promise 600+
"Today, PiS wants to buy Poland, offering them the freedom to extend credit to future generations," says Grzegorz Schetyn in a report for "The Respospolità".
In his opinion, "the whole P.S. policy is pizza."
At the same time, politics promises that "what is given will not be banned".
Shetina, in her conversation with Jack Nizinkiewick, guarantees that she has an idea of the rule of law and justice.
It's about the mobilisation of the electrification at election hours.
In his view, the opposition has a greater potential in this regard than the Kacinian party.
"Today, people who know that they want to live in a normal state are more than Pis, a party that is convinced of the values, such as humility, courage, transparency," says Schetyn.
The Leader of the Civil Coalition and the President of the Civil Platform also marked the fundamental setting of the KO's electoral programme.
"Firstly, nothing will be collected, but a guide to the future, because the Pis is only taking place here and now, there is no plan for Poland to see even after dramatic low investments," he said.
Secondly, it concerns "the energy consumption of Poland, aid and investment in those who work closely - and those who are entrepreneurs".
The scheme explains that in the KO programme, the project was included, which at least 614 gold on the hand of Poland, and several times on the back of it.
The policy also pointed out that he didn't want to get away with it.
As he said, do as much as he can, but don't promise 600+.
"I will never allow the Greek option where the rulers have applied with the opposition to the settlement until it finally has reached the fall of the financial country," he stressed.
The report for "Rz" also stated that Jarosław Kaczynski and Mateusz Morawycki were afraid to argue with him and Małgorzat Kidad-Blonski.
"We would abuse their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.
"The wind moves ahead of the fall.
Kachinski is a man like Banas is Christian," he added.
The PO leader also said that he had not yet decided whether he would take over the platform.
Argentina: Six Deaths of Great Condors · Global Voices
In the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, six dead large condors were found – reports TVN24.
Experts believe that human activity has contributed to their deaths.
Large condors are likely to be opened up by means of the killing of predators such as pumas, lions, or wild dogs.
Animals could eat a toxic drop.
In addition to one young person, the rest of the dead condors were adults.
"It is a great loss for the environment, because the condor must reach 10-15 years to become fertile and able to mix.
So we lose the protected species, the endangered species," says Luis Jacome, director of BioAndina Foundation, the Argentine environmental protection organization.
"I think that the use of toxic and toxic infections is not only dangerous to this species, but all other forms of life, including human health," he adds.
'Rz': I want a dress for the President
They've been working on the recognition of the head of the drug chain.
The idea was supported by the office of Andrzeja Dudy – we read in the "Respospolitàj".
As a translator of the newspaper, it is about the gold chain of the Order of the White Orella, the royal insignia officially known during the inter-military reign of the Red Cross.
Last time he was probably used by President Ignacy Móśícki.
"Rz" indicates that such chains can soon be found on the side of Andrey Dudy.
The Senate of the Commission on Human Rights, Rights and Petitions has announced in the medium term a proposal for a reform of the Orders and Appointments Act to restore it.
The newspaper says it's not the first attempt to return this chain of state heads.
The Senate has already proposed this amendment in 1992, but it has passed a single vote.
This time the work is blizzard.
At the beginning of August, the senators made a few minutes of commitment to the matter, acknowledging that they were taking the position of the President's Office.
This came in mid-September.
"I shall inform you that the Chancellor of the RP President does not take note of the position presented in the above-mentioned petition," then President Andrzej Dera wrote.
In the middle of the case, the Senate Commission continued the case and renewed the matter for a short time.
"The Chancellor of the President answered us briefly: it's enough to bring it back," said Commissioner Robert Mamatov of Pis, quoted by "Rz".
He made a proposal for legislative work supported by the Commission.
Police will teach drivers how to drive by crossing
The police action will be carried out during the siege of the Cieplinski al. Piłsudski.
Munduran activities are somewhat related to recent charges by city authorities to drivers who are not always able to keep themselves in check.
On Friday, 27 September, police began the preventive action “Transport crossings”.
It is about eliminating fatigue in the road: driving for crossing without the possibility of driving, not applying to light signals or road signs.
"We often think we're on our own, and we're really trying to live with other leaders," said Marek Ustrobinski, vice president of the city a few days ago.
His words drew attention to a press conference in which the city authorities presented examples of inappropriate movement of cars after crossings, which would create obstacles.
At the time, the president appealed to the passengers on the road for a more rapid movement of light or non-smokers during the journey.
The issue has been taken up by police officers who have been launching the “Transport Crossing” action since today.
What's going on?
The aim of the action is to eliminate the phenomenon of restrictions on crossings by drivers who travel on the road without the possibility of continuing.
This is often the cause of fatigue in the movement and the creation of legs.
It is threatened by a mandate of 300 evils and 2 military points.
In addition, global attention will be paid to non-compliance with light signals or road signs and incorrect parking in the area of crossings.
They will also observe a lack of speed, delay under signallings, free crossings and too much distance between vehicles.
What steps will be taken?
M.in on the ul. Lisa-Kuli of ul. Jagyillonska; al. Cieplinski of al. Piłsudski; ul. Targowe of hal. Piłsudski; Place of Sérenawit of ul. Döbrovski or ul. Hetmanski of ul.
This type of action will be carried out in the Subcarpathy chairs on the following Friday of October.
They checked the waste disposal company from "Czeyki"
"The members of the Department of the Protection of the Environment of the Elderly of the Volomińsk and the Civil Inspection of the Buildings checked on Friday the installation in the town of Zielonka, in which wastes from the clean walls of "Czejka" in Warsaw are used," told the root of the age of the Volomian Karol Szyszko.
The elderly inspectors of the Lulaminian village carried out the inspection at the warehouse in the lakes of Zielonka.
The Dar-Transport Private Trade Company, under a contract with a centuries-old cleaning of the "Czejka" walls, carries out services for the disposal of sand waste.
"The inspection of the installation has been completed and the company has also been requested to provide documentation relating to its activities," Szysko said.
He added that the audit report will be transmitted, inter alia, to the VOC in Warsaw.
The last control in Dar-Transie was carried out by Vojevodski Environmental Protection Inspectorate in Warsaw for the period 29 December 2015 – 11 February 2016.
It was found that the company did not carry out underground samples, measurements and tests, nor did it have the results of the studies of established municipal railways from the cleaning of the "Czejka" walls.
Following the control of WIOS, Darius Sobot was called to stop the breach of the terms of the decision.
Dariusz Sobotat is one of the company that collects wastes as a fixed municipal rail stock with a clean "Czejka".
According to the decision to carry out waste disposal on the production site, wastes of up to 60,000 tonnes per year are processed in the forest around Zielonki.
On Thursday, November and December 2018, the Warsaw Local Water and Sanitation Company reported that STUDS were excluded from operation, which was related to damage to one of the fuel equipment.
According to MPWik, their monthly export costs are 1.7 million gross (estimated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).

Very Important Words
Kidawa-Blonska thanked you for your support.
"Mr. President, this is very important to me, because no one like you can talk about freedom, the constitution and how important it is," she said.
"We show that we can make another wise policy, together, but in accordance with the Constitution, according to the law, according to respect for others.
You did so with your revolution, and we want to change Poland," Kidawa-Blönska stressed.
Birds and americans
Well, in his interview with the journalists, he said he's now "only a cat on the vegetarian market".
"Of course I'm looking at it.
I hope we'll get back to the event that what was good, checked, we'll get back to it.
The Trinity of power is the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are necessary.
And that's all we need to clean up, that's all we need to get back to normal action, and I believe we can do this together.
Because if not, it's waiting for us street criteria," Lech Wallus said.
"That is why it is so important for Poland to go to the elections, stand up and make a decision on its own.
And that's the most important thing," said Kidawa-Blonska.
"The last chance of a map to improve the situation of things in Poland," the president replied.
"We must build on a new foundation"
The question of the most important changes she should make in Poland, Kidawa-Blońska said: "The President said very well.
We have to build on a new foundation on which we can do all the other things.
If there is no third party of the government, since the constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and bring it to light and everyone knows that Poland will not move or step forward."
ME seats: Slovenia – Poland 3:1 in the semi-final.
In the hot ground in Lublania, Polish netizens grew up with the Slovenians in the southern half of Europe.

"White-Red" lost 1:3 and played on bronze medals.
The Senate decided on key laws
The Senate adopted without amendment the legislation on the disclosure of family members of the most important public officials and the flights of the most important persons in the country.
Following the renewal of the law on the property of state officials, 52 senators were voting without amendment, 14 were against, and three abstained from voting.
The senators also decided to reject 12 amendments, which were reported during the environmental debate by Senator Po Sławmir Rybicki.
According to the amendment, the Act was to "increase" and limit the scope of the information provided in the declaration of the situation of own children, married children and children eligible for the cases in which children remain in the common household with the person obliged to submit the declaration.
The Act on the Publicity of the Family of the Most Important State Officials, which was established in the Prime Minister's office, was adopted by Seim on 11 September.
The provisions stipulate that, inter alia, the Prime Minister, the Ministers, the Affairs, the Senate, the President: the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as those in favour of other state institutions will be obliged to provide information on the property of persons, children and persons who remain in common service.
The Senate also did not propose an amendment to the laws on the flights of the most important persons in the country.
It controls which flights have HEAD status and who can be on board government aircraft, along with the most important persons in the country.
The Constitution also specifies who is responsible for conducting the Central Flights Registry.
By law, without correction, 55 senators were declared against, and 12 were against four of them being held by the vote.
According to the law, every flight of the president will be a flight "in the official mission".
The President will be able to join the family members and other members invited by the President.
Instead, the flight to the official Prime Minister's mission and to the Sea and the Senate's passengers will only be "a flight to carry out the tasks directly related to the performance".
The Constitution also specifies the list of persons who may accompany the most important persons in the country during the flight.
Members of the delegation may be invited to work, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organizational services; and journalists.
According to the law, in the event of doubts about the fleets of the Sea and the Senate, the Chief of KPRM will be able to explain them.
If such doubts are not clarified at the specified time, the Chief of KPRM will be obliged to inform the Chiefs of the Seym or the Senate of the lack of the possibility of such a flight.

This time, without such problems, they met with the Slovenians in Paris on Friday morning, and hours later they received training in the hearing hall of Bertie.
According to the relationship of people at work, the master of the world has been submerged.
As Assistant Minister Heynna Michał Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not the same as the training of the Sietkar elements.
"We went to the forest, but in most cases it was time for the team.
It was about spending more time with him than training him.
Talk, imagine how it's all going to build as a team," he said.
He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both professionals and the training staff.
"We've been brutally brought to the ground.
Without two thoughts, we're disappointed.
We still believed we'd get back to this game.
We discussed this game between us in the room, and the coach talked to the coach.
As two main reasons for the defeat, I would show ineffectiveness in the attack and much worse than usual encounter with the situational bullets.
In this respect, the words were much better than us," he analyzed.
In his view, the "White-Red" did not stand in the way of stress related to the rise in opposition to a voice-supported and numerous advertising by the co-economic tournament.
He admitted that the masters of the world could do something to calm the cold road to the semi-final.
"Maybe if we had a match in the group phase in a similar style, it would be faster to analyze this lesson and later we would play in the next stage of the tournament.
But it's just a joke," he warned.
Gogol hopes that the violence associated with the fourth battle of Poland will be overcome by aggression in the game of the bridge.
“I hope we will show our true faces at the moment.
It's about what to do.
The last ME medal we fought in 2011," he recalled.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is the third country visited by Poland during these holidays.
During the group phase, they re-railed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, and at the first two meetings of the group phase they hit the Appeldorn, and at the semi-final they moved to Lublan.
Nick Kyrigios: a serious war, but in the meantime
The Australian tennisist received a 16-hour start-up ban and a fine of $25,000, in a half-year suspension, for harsh words, gestures and actions during the last ATP tournaments.
The ATP World Tour operators are losing their patience with Kyrgyzstan, but they still give him a chance to improve.
The summary of the most uninterrupted professional tennisist in recent years seems to be dangerous – 16 weeks plus a rough fight, but the two of them are stopped for half a year – a test period in which the runner will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he's been arguing for a long time and he's been doing his tennis record of the world – he had to pay the highest in the history of discipline a single financial penalty for breaking the rules of behavior on and around him.
The famous curses, strange gestures, non-portable behavior, trial and sights, defeating two rockets during a lost game with Karen Chaczanowe – for all of this after the Syrian ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati paid 113 thousand dollars.
In the US Open 2019 he did not play long, but he was able to publicly say that ATP activists were "simply corrupt", which hurt the organisation's authorities so much that they carried out a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgyzstan and, after a few weeks, gave the above-mentioned verdict to stop the beginnings and the next crime.
However, he was forgiven after hearing the accused and knowing the context of the statement.
However, it was argued that the investigation showed that Kyrgyzstan’s behaviour over the entire 12-month period has in many cases been marked by serious prejudices and that it has been a rather persistent violation of the principle that without delay it has dealt with in the way of the Bulgarians of tournaments and visas, from this point of view.
However, the ATP has given him five days to make a call and has, from time to time, announced the execution of the sentence, ordering him to fulfil within the next six months the conditions: in the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgyos tournaments, he can no longer break the rules of the Code of Procedure of the current professional tennisists, in particular, he can no longer pass through, destroy the rocket, interfere with the courts and the public, nor any other way of acting irrevocably and wulgarly.
He was also advised to seek "sustainable support" from mental trainers during the tournaments and to consult with people who specialize in resolving the problems of sportsmen who do not deal with their own behavior.
The first comment (in social media) was this: “Hey, everybody, I can still play.
I just have to control my behavior, that's all."
In practice, Australia will have at least two-year break since the ship's consul in Pucharé Lavera had to be abandoned from the nearest beginnings in Beijing (30 September – 6 October) and Shanghai (6–13 October).
ATP Kyrgyos takes 27th place in the ranking.
In this year, he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, he made over $1.3 million, so even after the races, he will stay.
GUS: More and more lives in Poland
From the GUS's report on domestic budgets published on Friday, it was found that their material situation was estimated at up to 44 per cent of them as good or better.
In the previous year, this percentage was 37.2 per cent, 33.5 per cent in 2016, and since 2009, when the statistical authority first examined the subjective assessment of the domestic economy, it has never exceeded 30 per cent.
It considered its material situation to be worse or worse in terms of 8.1 per cent of households, compared to 11.2 per cent of the previous year and more than 20 per cent in 2009.
The best is the material economy of domestic workers working on their own account.
In this group, 70 per cent of respondents are considered to be either good or bad.
On the other hand, households are reciprocity, where the percentage of these responses was rather 18%.
There is also a significant impact on the subjective assessment of the situation of the domestic material economy.
Most importantly, it is known to the parents themselves who are producing offspring, among whom 32% declare a good or better material situation.
The percentage of children is between 55% and 60%, and 48.8% are among the homeless.
In these statistics, the effect of the 500+ programme is clearly visible.
Before he was launched (in 2016), his worst material situation was evaluated by his own generation and many families (with at least three children).
The improvement of the substantive assessment of the material situation in Poland is a reflection of rapid income growth, above all from work.
This is not all, however, because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be a good one increases faster than actual income.
Moreover, at the level of leadership, there is no apparent dependence between income levels and the assessment of the material conditions of the households.
The best evaluations are made by the inhabitants of the village leader, where they consider their situation better or better to be 48.9% of the researchers.
There are further voyeurism (47.7%), Islam (47.6%), Masoweck (47.3%) and Western European (47.1%).
At the same time, in Opolski, the regulatory income (e.g. after payment of taxes and contributions) amounted to 94 per cent of the national average and 98 per cent in Lubuski.
The highest income of the inhabitants of Mazowiski (120 per cent of the national average) and the Dutch (104 per cent).
In 2018, the average income per person in Poland amounted to 1693 tonnes.
In real terms, the price change rate increased by 4.3% by 2017.
In the last few years, it's pretty low.
In 2016, income per person rose by 7% and by 6.3% later.
While income growth decreases, it also decreases expenditure.
These figures for the person were found in footnote 1187, which means that the actual figure decreased by 0.7%.
This is the first such event since 2013.
In 2017, personal expenditure actually increased by 1.9 per cent and 4.3 per cent by 2016.
Domestic budget surveys suggest that the household’s statistical economy currently accounts for 70.1% of its regular income, while this share is still over 80% in 2014 and over 90% by 2006.

USA: Three suicides in the airport
Three mariners filled up suicide on the ground floor of USS George H. W. Bush last week – reported to the U.S. Navy.
In the last two years, five members of the crew of this ship have been killed in the sum.
The previous suicide took place in July this year, and earlier in November 2017.
According to the CNN, all three of them were shot last week.
Each of the events came to the ground when the USS George H. W. Bush moved to the coast of Virginia.
As far as this is concerned, the participation of third parties was excluded.
In addition, deaths should not be connected to each other.
"We need everyone involved in presenting suggestions and ideas to prevent further suicide.
I would like to stress that there is no stigmatization or other implications related to the search for help," wrote Captain Sean Bailey, ship leader Facebook.
The non-violent criticism of the paper.
John Paul II did nothing
In an interview with Peter Lekšek, Stefan Niesiołski stressed that in 1981, John Paul II was a great author.
"In fact, every opinion was accepted."
Later, some of his actions were criticized.
"For me, John Paul II has not been able to eliminate the harmful activity of Rydzyk, he is very grateful for his pontification.
However, the redemptorist – the traitor of the Church and Poland – developed his media in the best way for the life of Pope Polaka," he explained.
PO’s former politician admitted: “There have been some setbacks, because the pope said something when Rydzyka refused, but he had power and could simply leave the church or send him to a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor.
However, John Paul II did not do so, like his successor,” explained Nessiołski.
"In addition, this fatal case of the pedophile and the actions of the Church has been brought to an end, and indeed their lack of it.
I've got a little bit of a runaway thinking ahead, but I wanted to pay attention to the whole of his life.
We know about the pedophile scale in the Church from relatively recent times.
The question arises how it is possible that John Paul II, as head of the church, did not know about these disgusting things," says the newspaper Niesilovski.
In the evaluation of the previous PO policy, the Polish Church is a P.S. associate.
"It must be acknowledged that the Church was our most important associate during the period of solidarity.
All the beauty began from the sacred bridge, the vast crossings everywhere.
Now these cross are written, they become a symbol of the dictatorship – a sign of the writing regime.
I repeat: one of the greatest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk are the third Polish Church that John Paul II did nothing in this matter and that today the Church is the successor of the Pis.
It's a black division of the Polish Church that will come to pay for it," Niesiolski said.
"I hope that the Pope of France will kill the German, Rydzyk and a few others of that kind," he said.
HROBIESSAGE: Business in the morning 590
It's gonna be a lot of concerts and licenses.

The official opening of the ceremony will take place at 11.30 a.m. in HDK.
There will be a Party of Songs and Dances of Croatia's Land.

PZPN sleeps for burdy cars at the stadiums.
Disqualified flock
The start of Puchar Poland between Griffem Wejherovo and Lechi Gdańsk on the small hair did not end tragically when the calfs of Wejher's race passed the millimetres of the opposite team, Zlatana Alomerovicia.
After the accident, the match was suspended for 20 minutes.
This case was examined by the PZPN Commission, excluding Gryff's serious punishment from future events.
The club will not be able to start in Pucharze Polski in the 2020/2021 season.
Additional chips will not be placed in the nearest game at their own stadium.
They will also not be able to go out on the league until 31 December.
The Burdys at the Stadium of the Vision of the Lóds also brought out the scissors of the Wrocław.
However, it was easier here for the PZPN to say that it could come to similar events and have trained the competent authorities on this issue.
Nevertheless, the services have allowed the sector to be rejected by the shipbuilding sector by the racers, the fire and the strengthening of the sector of the economy.
The game was suspended for eight minutes, and the interpolation had to use the water weapons.
The PZPN imposed a once-in-a-day ban on stadiums in the nearest match in Pucharze Polski and prohibited the organisation of exits to the match in this and the subsequent release of the PP.
The ban on exits also included the League of Extraclassic Games, but it expired until 31 December.
Name of bordered cities on road signs also after Poland
GDDKIA plans to exchange the marking on the fully managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDKiA Rass
In the Subcarpathian, a new regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on the registration of foreign cities on road signs also began to be implemented in Poland.
For example, "Lwow" appears near "L'viv".
Our guidance will include 94 road signs set at A4 and national roads: DK19, DK94.
The way we hear it, it's gonna be easier, easier, easier, and tighter.
The new guidelines result from the renewal of the Minister of Infrastructure Regulation on specific technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
"We should remember that local names in neighbouring countries often also have Polish accents.
Thanks to the changes we have made, they will soon appear on our roads.
The introduction of a new marking starts from the undercarp of the A4 highway," Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk informed.
The amendments will be introduced to 94 road signs set at A4 and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total investment costs?
200 grand.
In the first instance, a new marking will be implemented on the A4 highway, which is scheduled for 1 November 2019.
How is the realization of the mind to look?
It'll be eaten without changing the tablet, in principle.
They will now replace the names of new localities written in Polish on existing characters.
Both names will be written in one version – in the first sequence after Polish, and then in the original, in the Nahuatl.
This will make it much easier for people who do not know the names of foreign cities in the country in which they are located.
Feel the game together with Razer Nari Ultimate for Xbox One
Razer company announced Razer Nari Ultimate for Xbox One – first in the world headset to Xbox One inspired by eptic technology.
HyperSense ensures pollution in games and better control of the environment.
Razer HyperSense uses the eptic solutions developed by Loft, a German company specialized in the creation of advanced eptic technologies that provide realistic impact on the subject.
HyperSense uses special hackers and smart digital processing signals to generate a relatively high-divisibility feedback in real time, allowing full confusion in each Xbox One game.
Technology recognises sound signals and transforms them into dynamic vibrations, so players can get involved in the game without the need to install additional software.
By using the concept of touch, sound signals can be closely followed by action in the game.
Razer HyperSense plays an event – from quiet steps after powerful explosions, precisely all the activities around the player.
“Nari Ultimate for Xbox One has been designed to ensure an additional level of play for all players.
Thanks to HyperSense, we will allow them to be completely disappointed in their favorite titles," said Alvin Cheung Senior Vice President of the Razer peripheral devices.
In order to reduce the heat generated during long-term use, it is equipped with pre-filled pens with a memory of the shape and strength of the cooling gel.
For even easier hearing service, a fast-pression pressure was placed on the raised microphone and a sound regulator for HyperSense activity and a balance sheet between the game and the cat.
The self-adhesive shape of the head of the ball ensures no problem and correct adjustment.
In addition, Razer Nari Ultimate for Xbox One has the Xbox Wireless function, which allows direct connection to the console without needing to use the wireless transmission device, which allows for easy and fast configuration.
Listeners also provide Windows Sonic system, providing more realistic sound.
Razer Nari Ultimate, originally designed for PC computers, was marketed in September 2018.
Thanks to Nari Ultimate for Xbox One, Razer can now offer this rewarded Xbox One phony technology.
The set was estimated at EUR 219.99.
Someone shot the windshield.
At the foot of the village in the Netherlands, residents noticed a lack of problems with shrubs.
After the discovery and the visit to the veterinarian, it was shown that someone made himself out of an animal’s target — a cure found in his body.
"The information about the early birds has been received from all residents of the Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Dead Animals in New Soli.
It was reported that the animal had broken ribs.
We got married.
It's been a while since he's seen something very wrong with him.
We acted quickly and accurately so as not to hurt him or to cause additional stress.
The lion was fired and detained in the vet.
After the first photo of the RTG, it was already known that someone made himself out of it by shooting.
In his body were scraps of dirt," says Marcin Dalaisek, president of Malpol, managing the rehabilitation centre.
It takes the centre
"The wounds have been cleaned, the bird has been given antibiotics, provided access to water, a safe place in the center where it costs the whole winter.
We're trying to strengthen him.
He can't fly anyway.
The release of him now would be related to the fact that he would probably not survive winter," he adds.
The staff shall, after the lack of rehabilitation, intend to release him to the same station.
After receiving information on the cause of poor animal health, the Zukowice authorities intend to inform the prosecutor.
I'm going to the event. I'm going to go to the castle.
Gowin: "We must wake up Polish, small trade"
"The effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will have to be wondered whether the country has any instruments to encourage Polish trade," said the fifth vice president, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Jarosław Gowin Agreement.
Gowin, during his talk at the "Signals Day" on the radio Unit, said that the trade is perceived by international networks that are so low on the market for Polish producers that the Polish companies can't develop.
In view of the very difficult problem to deal with, the Vice-President recalled that the PIS government was trying to reach its goal at the very beginning of the term, but he received "the opposition from the EC".
"We have won before the trial of justice, and I hope that if the United Nations wins the closest elections and forms a government, we will return to that," he said.
At the same time, he pointed out that "the effective taxation of the hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Poland and therefore a small trade".
"It will have to be asked whether the government has any instruments to encourage Polish trade," Gowin said.
In May the EU court found that the European Commission made a mistake in acknowledging that the Polish tax on retail is not authorised by public aid.
The tax law on retail sales introduced two rates of trade: 0.8 per cent of the income between 17 million and 170 million per month and 1.4 per cent of the income above 170 million per month.
The tax was to be applied since September 2016.
In September 2016 the EC initiated an infringement of Union law by Poland.
Brussels then argued that the construction of the tax could make smaller decisions, which could be considered to be public aid.
She then claimed that the data had been put into practice in a way that was incompatible with the law.
It also issued an order to suspend the application of the tax until it was completed by officials in Brussels.
Poland did not agree with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
The EU Court's decision opened the way for the re-entry of taxes, but did not end the case.
On 24 July, the Commission lodged an appeal in the Court of Justice.
In the fourth quarter of the TEU's Press Service, the PAP reported that the case is now in writing, in which both the European Commission and the Polish Government have presented their arguments in writing.
In the event of an error, it is not known whether or not the procedure is being initiated, that is, listening to the party and any report.
It takes a few good months to make a call to announce the case.
"This procedure lasts a year," said the PAP source of the Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
How to take the baby to baptism?
Let's look at a few practical solutions.
Baptism is an especially important step in the life of a child and his parents.
It is often the first occasion when the whole family gathers around the child, sharing in the celebration of his appearance in the world.
It's not surprising, then, that the freshly secured moms and dads want their rest to look like the best that day.
Before you make a final decision about the child's machine, however, ask yourself whether it will be okay too.
In the conclusions, I can find many machines that do not provide adequate comfort.
So, what should we pay attention to?
The primary criterion for selecting an infant for baptism is age
Up until recently, a few hours of small ones were baptized, equipped with a white set and put into the same beaks or large air.
Today, children who attend a funeral are often older: monthly, year-old, and even older.
It's not easy to think that such a great relief is already needed by someone else to get baptized.
So if your child on the day of baptism is 3-4 months old, a certain amount of dignity will be spent in a car or on the hands of parents or Christian children.
The best way out is to show it in a comfortable, colorful or complete suit.
Although this guard structure element is considered to be a star every day, it is sufficient to look for its excellent options, such as a falbank or crown.
For a boy, it's perfect to see points with the pressure of the mouse and the tail.
In the case of older children, you can allow yourself to have a bigger fantasy in your neck.
A girl will look beautiful in a simple, fat succulent
Many of the parents of a girl with a lack of attention look at the rich, falsified kisses on her face in complete with plates, plates and caps.
Unfortunately, a large number of producers use artificial, non-smoothing materials in which the child is simply inappropriate.
The search for the appropriate packaging will better look at the Asanti for Kids Decision, which provides elegant machines on the cotton trails.
Delicate, fat, satin, korongs, applications and sweetness will make your girl look beautiful and feel comfortable.
Ideal mirror for a small gentleman: cotton yarn
Up until recently, among the parents of boys, she has been wearing fashions on the garages that will be a copy of the "increasing" model.
Polyester marinaries and subs, studs or caskets often made young elegances express their discontent.
Today, luckily, they've been spent by fine, colorful completes.
Just look at the set available in Asanti for Kids, that is, soft, beautiful shoes, and to this blouse comes from the front of the truck.
These machines look very impressive, and they do not corrupt the movement of the world that recognizes the little world.
Kristina Pavlovic published an own statement
The Christian Paulovic made a property statement at the end of the term.
It turns out that the P.S. messenger gathered 110 thousand lives.
Let's remember that Pavlovic told us to get out of politics.
At the end of the term, the amount is 110 thousand zł
As a result of the statement made by the consignee, she receives a monthly pension of 4.7 thousand dollars.
The Pavlovnik has a living value of 570 thousand zł and a few less that he rents, collecting 880 zł per month.
It also invests in industrial metals, estimating investment to 150 thousand zł.
Earlier the property statement was also published by Jarosław Kaczinski.
Voting over breaks at the Conference of the Conservative Party
The British parliamentarians voted against the third round of the Gmin elections at the annual programme conference of the Conservative Party, which the government has called on.
He reported 289 cases, against 306.
Ezba Gmin does not normally speak during the party conferences, so that the staff do not have to give up their participation in them, nor at Parliament meetings.
However, the opposition parties felt that in such a crucial time as they were scheduled to leave Great Britain on 31 October, Parliament should not interrupt the proceedings.
At the request of the Government, 289 cases were reported against 306.
Two opposition parties already after conventions
The lack of agreement may be accepted as a political objection to Prime Minister Borisie Johnson for his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks (the second decision was recognized by the Supreme Court as contrary to the law and by the non-conformity) and for the fact that the judges did not want to ask for it.
After this decision, Izba Gmin resumed the session in the middle, and the most important event of the day was the presence of Johnson and the next round of debate.
Johnson ordered the blockade of Brexit and the avoidance of prior elections.
"The time has come to realize brexite.
It needs to be realized in order to achieve the outcome of the referendum.
Brexit needs to be able to deal with citizens' priorities, health services, the cost of living.
Brexit must be realized so that we can unite the country," Johnson said.
The Conference of the Conservative Party should begin in Manchester next Sunday and be held on Wednesday 2 October.
The two main opposition groups – the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats – have already held.
One of the reasons which Johnson gave to explain such a long delay in Parliament was just a party conference.
Media: Andrzej Duda accuses Israel of anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
"President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-political retort of Israeli leaders," the foreign media wrote.
The President's spokesman has made this statement very clear.
"It's just not true," he wrote on Twitter by Blažej Spychalski.
Israel's media, including Haaretz and Jerusalem Post, refer to the Jewish Insider, writing that Andrzej Duda, during a meeting with the representatives of the Jewish diaspora in the RP Consulate in New York, said that Israel is suffering from the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The president said that the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland was a reaction to the anti-political retort of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the Israeli Minister for Foreign Affairs of Israel Katza, who stated in a letter that “Police have sent anti-Semitism with milk mothers”.
Andrzej Duda said he regrets that Israel did not ask for a rebuttal of his policies.
He also mentioned the act of aggression against Ambassador Polski in Israel by Mark Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an attacker who shouted, "Polak, Polak".
"The term is not only incorrect.
It's just not true," he wrote on Twitter by the White Spychalski.
He stressed that Duda “never said that Israel was responsible for the latest anti-Semitic attacks in Poland”.
I think Spychalski's portal "has invented it."
According to the speakers "I" at the meeting, the dispute was also reached between the Holocaust survivors, marked by the RP Command Order, Edward Mosberg, and the Shimuley Boteach.
Mosberg had to agree with President Dudy's words and to say that the Jews of Israel "like Israel Kac" are responsible for the growth of anti-Semitism.
According to the source of the Botech portal, he had to stop Mosberg's speech.
Who's Banas and what's wrong?
The tenants hired by the stone manager led the journalist to find out about the events in Mariana Banasia's own statements.
We're going to sum up the next case that hit the governing body.
The "Supervisor" TV reported that Marian Banás, President of the Supreme Court of Control, has not written in recent years the declaration of a 400-metre possession truck located in the Krakow Podgorz.
More than that, his employer had to drive in the mentioned sex business (and therefore rent rooms per hour).
On the other hand, the building has been in charge since 2016 for the payment of credit.
Bertold Kittel drew attention to the injustice in the Superviser program.
The newspaper stated that from Banasian, they hired people associated with the world to use it as a place of “aerial meetings”.
Customers were supposed to be men using prostitution services.
Banasz replied in a vague and foolish way.
Interestingly, hired by stone containers led the journalist to discover the missing items in the real estate statements of Banasia.
The stone itself was described in them as unclear, and the income from her rent had to be reduced.
"The property of Mariana Banasia and his wife can be from 6 to 8 million evil.
In fact, couples can honor two homes, three apartments, savings[...]", notes Money.pl.
And as a result of the portal analysis, Banasia's own stone value was already about 3 million bad.
The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau is currently conducting control of the property declarations of Mariana Banasia for the years 2015-2019.
Banasz said that it would stop its activities in the NIK by the time of its end. "I'm going to get you a ticket on a free flight," he assured.
The opposition will have an explanation.
"We do not hear that the CBA has expanded its investigation or speeded up the examination of the statement of ownership by Marian Banasia.
Therefore, we are also forced to expel the authorities of the state and to inform them of the possibility of committing the crime [...]," said Po-KO Mariusz Witczak.
"If normal Poland had so low the rent of its properties, it would already have 10 controls, tax purposes and customs procedures," he added.
He went high, fell low.
Marian Banasz is the new president of the Supreme Court of Control.
The position was adopted on 30 August 2019 for a six-year term.
His candidate was notified by the Law and Justice and the votes of the politicians of this party.
Banas was previously associated with NIK in 1992-2005 and worked in this institution as a co-operative of Lecha Kaczynski.
During the first PIS governments (2005-2008), Banás served as President of the Customs Service and also as Deputy Secretary of State of the Ministry of Finance.
Since 2015, he has again served as head of the Customs Service and has managed the National Customs Administration since 2017.
Banás has completed the financial administration of the Ministry of Finance under the leadership of Mateusz Morawecki.

"Dispossible": Ignoring police will be punished
According to the newspaper, the simplification of the order for certain behaviour issued by the police should be a new type of move, a criminal offence, arrest or restriction of freedom.
That's what police officers want to do.
The idea came to the Commission's attention on Petitions.
"The matter is serious because now, every year, more than half a million cases have been brought before the Polish courts," we read.
The "Special Police" stated that the petition, which the Independent Police Service wrote to the press on the amendment of the Code of Conduct, is likely to be successful.
The applicants propose a new amendment to Article 54a of the Code of Conduct.
He should say: “Whoever does not submit to the request or order of a public official issued within the limits and on the basis of the provisions of the law, shall be liable to arrest, criminal or deprivation of liberty.”
“Paragraph 3 of this provision speaks of a identical penalty for those who do not comply with the recommendations, are impossible or difficult to carry out the service’s activities,” the report states.
Sojólog Andrzej Kowalski said "Speechpolitaj" that although it agrees with the main transmission of the draft regulation, he fears that if it is implemented, it may be used in political events.
"In situations of free demonstration, it would be useless and instead of remedying the situation, so they would shoot it," he adds.
The statistics reported by the newspaper show that 86% of citizens were positively assessing police interventions in 2018 and that 1.5 million city-based services were taken every month.
Buras is concerned about Europe
I love Topol's writing is in blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
The father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important victorious Czech dramatours, today exchanged in one section with Václav Havl.
So over Jachym, from the beginning, she's got a lot of talent she's been trying to use.
Eight years later, he came back with a "Deceptive Man."
The Bohaters are Buras and Soná together with two sons who, however, do not create a typical Czech family.
They're nuclear actors traveling around Europe.
He's a lover of Shakespeare and a thief, she's a single translator who doesn't break up with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys didn't sound from birth, and for the other, he stayed in silence.
But it's not the rich people who are the most important in this story.
All are the only ground to observe the world where there is no place for artistic cooks anymore.
It's a world of crowded provinces, old societies, suspicious people, and young people.
"Deceptive people" places are replaced by absurd theaters.
Narrasia follows the digascal, and the conversation of the rich is about to take place in this world.
The scene is a Europe full of concerns about its future, but also persistent questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancelled 105 flights due to Thomas Cook Bankruptcy
Although British travel office Thomas Cook has fallen, his Belgian branch of Neckermann works.
But the company has problems.
According to VRT TV, Brussels Airlines announced that they were calling 105 flights in October due to problems related to Thomas Cook's bank robbery.
Neckermann also released 75 employees.
All exits from the office that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but they will be able to receive money back in time.
The trial in Gandawi also announced the fall of three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently about 12 thousand Belgians are outside the border on the exits purchased by Thomas Cook.
The next 40 thousand people had to leave the office by the end of the year.
On Monday, journalist Thomas Cook Belgium Leen Segers said that the company is currently "full of operations" despite the announcement of a fall by British parent company, which caused a disturbance between employees and customers.
The Bureau then relieved the customers who bought the trip to it to go on vacation.
Thomas Cook – one of the oldest and one of the world's largest travel offices – announced a fall in the night from Sunday to Monday.
The direct cause of bankruptcy was a decrease in the last week of conversations with creditors and potential investors.
In addition to the agreed settlement plan of 900 million dollars, the company received additional 200 million as a winter insurance when the travel offices usually have lower turnovers.
However, the company's problems have been growing for a few years, with a long-term impact of 1.6 billion pounds.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for your opinion
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an unusual offer was prepared for the future German Görlitz.
Action will help to combat the growing drop in the number of urban residents.
Görlitz is the most isolated one on the east side of Germany.
A beautiful pastel old mansion attracts 140 thousand tourists a year.
However, as The Guardian writes, the city is faced with significant problems.
There are the lowest payments in Germany in Görlitz.
The city also meets with a permanent residence of the population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the majority of them went to the west, resulting in 25 per cent of the city’s population’s fall.
In 2013, it was made up of 54 thousand people.
In order to combat the population, officials came to the idea of starting to offer free monthly accommodation in the city.
150 applications have been made since the programme.
Two thirds of them lived in large cities.
The program was also of interest to people from Hungary, Czech Republic, the United States and Great Britain.
"When we applied, we thought the program should convince people to drive to Görlitz," said one of the project participants.
"We now feel that it doesn't matter whether we stay here after four weeks or not," he added.
The city has seven thousand volunteers, and unemployment is three times higher than average in the whole country.
While city authorities hope that some will be held on a regular basis, the main objective of the programme is to obtain the opinion of the participants.
The information collected from the reports and questionnaires will help to rehabilitate smaller German cities.
"We want to find out more about what people need, and if they decide to do it, what their motivation was," said Robert Knippschild, responsible for the program.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas to attract new residents, offering them incentives as accommodation.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a programme of payment to promising young life and work in the city for a year.
Today such solutions are applied in many places, from the Greek island of Antiquities, to the Candel in Italy, or in the U.S. Tulsey in Oklahoma.
