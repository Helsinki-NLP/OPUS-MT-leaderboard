Prof. 911 Said She Killed Her Friend by Calling Professor 911
Professor Shannon Lamb, who called 911, said that the police had shot his girlfriend and the police had to come home.
Lamb said that "the beloved dog" was alive and probably sad and that the dead woman's family's phone calls could be found on the cell phone.
The police found a note on Amy Prentiss' dead body and a white note written in his hand: "I'm sorry if I could bring everything back, I loved Amy and she was the only woman I love until today."
There was no clue that Lamb, who was trained by two translators for the University of Delta in Cleveland, had been shot and killed in front of his office by his school camp 300 miles away.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said the authorities were on fire at 10:18 a.m.
He also indicated that Lamb's important 911 calls had been made shortly thereafter.
One more death happened at the end of the day: Lamb, the police attacked him as he approached.
One day, school shooting students and professors were wondering what Lamb was still doing.
Along both sides of the situation, the investigation tasks were designed by a teacher who was capable of drawing up the details of the students and the staff.
The students said they were waiting for him to go to school.
A police officer in Gautier, Prentiss, who died, said there was no criminal and reputation record.
Even Schmidt, in a book he wrote, spoke of Lamb's academic life as one of the "man-of-the-art" who shared his life with him.
They were both educated in the Social Sciences and History Department, which was listed by 17 college members, and they were taught by a lot of students.
There were also signs of spiritual problems.
According to students from Lamb's reputation, Brandon Beavers, at the same time seemed to be a very worried and nervous person and "like he had a problem."
Another student, Michael Sykes, said that Lamb himself said he had been stressed by the end of the 2014-15 year.
Lamb had previously indicated that he had some health problems, and asked for permission from the Delta State University.
This year, she was only giving two lessons from the Internet.
The recent changes in university employment policies did not ensure that Lamb was automatically a member of the framework teaching team, despite his many efforts to win Lamb.
Professor William LaForge of the University said he didn't know that there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but he said, "There's something in Lamb's mind."
These are questions that Lamb can't answer anymore.
After the campaign was canceled, the police took note of the journey of Lamb from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Washington County Adli explains that his family, Methel Johnson, had only 38 calibrated guns in the backyard of a house about 1.5 km away from his home in Mississippi, Greenville.
Lamb's car was in the car.
Although Lamb's not immediately identified why he went to this house, Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew those who lived in this house.
Lamb grew up in this area.
In 2009, Lamb started working at the 3,500 student universities in the city of about 12,000 students, providing education and education.
He first took his doctorate in the field of education.
One of Lamb's old friends identified him as smart, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston said she had 15 Lambs at the age of 20.
Carla and her friends were in high school, and Lamb was a nicer person who tried to learn to play guitar for a few years.
At that time he was a fast-pained man.
He, who is now 40 years old, and who lives in Jackson's neighborhood in Brandon, said to Lamb, "When he came, all the girls were hurt."
Lamb and Prentiss must have been together for a while.
There's no record of their marriage if Lamb said "I killed my wife" at 911.
In Gautier, they had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them.
The police said the dog's condition was good.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen said they were divorced 15 years ago, but they're always friends with Prentiss and now she's a 19-year-old girl.
And O'Steen said her daughter was in a completely broken state.
He and his mother were wonderful friends.
She said she never met O'Steen Lamb, but she told her daughter that she was interested in the music and that she was playing blues.
They met Prentiss at a written festival with Lamb three years ago when they met Abigail.
Then Lamb and Abigail were played together in public shows.
O'Steen said she wrote her daughter's music herself and said it.
Prentiss was a surgeon who worked in various translation companies.
The Julep Room, who had a bad presence near Gautier, said that he saw Mike Shaffer and Prentiss at least five months after Lamb had finished playing music.
There was no sign of trouble.
He said they were a very happy couple.
Sometimes we cut and we sold one another.
They both had a great sense of humor.
Professor Don Allan Mitchell, of the same University of England, said that Professor Schmidt, who was killed, conducted his first-class seminar program and was an expert in American locals and colonial history.
He was married and had three young children.
He graduated from Emporia State University in Kansas and was also the head of a student's team of resistance.
On Saturday night, nearly 900 people, including academics, students, and visitors from the local population, attended the Delta State University campus in Cleveland.
Schmidt's wife, Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt, also participated in the memory of the "Parlak Morning Star" and "Muchish Zarafet" songs at the university.
Classes continue Thursday.
LaForge said, "We're trying to bring our students back again."
The crisis is cold.
It's time for the wounds to heal.
Amy and Rogelio Solis from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus (Greenville, Mississippi) and Rebecca Santana (New Orleans) shared this news.
This information was corrected in the form of a statement by the police that Lamb was calling 911 after he killed Schmidt and that Lamb referred to him as a "wife" from Prentiss, although there was no official evidence that the couple were married.
Toys R Uss Plans to Take the Smaller Tatil Season
Toys R Us explained that he would not take over the holiday season this year, but only playwrights and baby products would know more about the potential for work for workers and seasonal workers.
The company reported that 40,000 people were planning to work in the state-run store and distribution centres, and this figure was 45,000 in the 2014 tabling season.
Most of the work will be half-time.
The company has indicated that malaria will begin in this month, and that the number of people will increase from October to Wednesday.
Although there are more months in the holiday season, the holiday shopping season is nearing and companies are ready to hire temporary workers who will help them to sell, send, and distribute their stores.
Michael J. Fox, Princes Diana, created the Esprites in the "Religion"
It's a very important time for Michael J. Fox, the last of the "Return to Earth" film.
It was also important for personal reasons.
He says in his documentary Back in Time's fragment, which will enter the new vision: "We were waiting for the members of the Kingdom family sitting in the theater to come and I realized that the chair next to me was empty, and I realized that Princess Diana would be sitting next to me.
The film started, and I realized that going out with the Galler Princess was a fake practice and a long time ago.
Back in Time, Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, a documentary on the "Resurrection" film, contains reports by Robert Zemeckis and application maker Steven Spielberg.
He came back for the first time 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It's the most exciting time of travel for me so far."
Back in Time VOD and DVD formats will also be displayed in some selected movies.
UN Chief Says There Is No Military Solution in Syria
As Russia went to Syria for further military support, General Secretary Ban Ki-moon said that the problem of Syria, which was about five years old, would not be solved "with military protection", and that more and more weapons would be only more violent and painful for millions of people.
The BM Secretary-General also invited the BM Security Council, which was divided, to bring together political solutions to meet together.
Ban indicated that five permanent council members were planning to meet Syria with outsiders from the United States, China, Russia, England and France at a press conference scheduled for the end of the month.
The members of the Council and the people of Syria expressed great regret that the regional powers of the division between the people of Syria had become “unsolved.”
Ban invited five permanent members to join in the Syrian crisis as it was in the Iran nuclear agreement.
8 Point Puzzle showing the serious nature of Donald Trump
Some tried to label him as a fireman.
The others seemed to be laughing at him.
And he's supporting some of them for internal explosions.
Some community members tried to get Donald Trump down in the polls, but that didn't work.
The last 11 national polls showed him the superiority of Donald Trump in double numbers, and some began to question him seriously about the chance of becoming the owner of the property.
Of course you're still early on the election tour.
None of this means that Trump can win the civil war.
In 2011, the planes said why Rick Perry's height was also rising for Herman Cain, and they didn't both win the turnout in the same scenario.
And there's a lot of reason to live in my general choice.
But there are foreign groups like Jeb Bush, the Super PAC Group and the Economic Conservatives Group of the Biggest Club, who recognize the remaining power of Trump and start spending their dollars to reverse it.
Here are some short-term findings that show that the real estate emperor is not only late:
Trump's preference has changed 180 degrees.
A survey conducted in Monmouth University immediately before the mid-month period, showed that both of the citizens had a reasonable meeting for the property emperor.
It was 40 percent in the middle of the month of December.
It was 52 percent at the beginning of August.
He now has a meaningful discussion about Donald Trump, the sixth of the community.
It means we've met three of the bosses.
And these numbers look high in early universes.
Last week, Iowa, a survey in Quinnipiac showed that 60 percent of the people in the community preferred Donald Trump.
The three GOP voters may be pleased with the name Trump.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, the community said that 67 percent of the population would be "crowd" or "tatmin".
Only two of the 10 people said "they're going to die" if that's what they call it.
It's just that Ben Carson Trump creates a match at the same level (43 percent of this time for Trump when they say they're going to be "coskula").
Who's the closest person to the coshku?
Only 21 percent with Marco Rubio.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the community's voters, if the group's favorite name is Jeb Bush, means "I'm not going" or "I'm going to die."
Most of the community doesn't see Trump's table as a problem.
Donald Trump thinks that the market has the right table for 52 percent of the citizens who are questioned by the U.S. News/Washington Post polls in order to be the president of the real estate empire, while being accused of language and subversives.
According to Quinnipac last week, the country's first party is going to be held in Iowa, and 52 percent of the citizens think they have a leader.
Still, 44 percent think that he does not have the person to serve as active, and according to the ABC/Post, he says he doesn't have 10 or more independent people who don't fit in with the White Sarah.
Community voters are starting to deal with this idea.
In the course of their policy experts' polls, the community's voters think that Trump is serious.
According to a CNN/ORC survey conducted last week, when asked who's the best name to win the GOP, he said it was the best of every 10 people.
I've had another change since the end of the month of Tammuz that four people spent their money on Jeb Bush.
Complete statement: in the past, GOP voters did not have a very clear crystal system.
During the last election period, he thought that there would be 10 out of 10 people in the community who thought Rick Perry would be named, and that's only 28 percent chose Mitt Romney, the last one.
Most GOP voters still seem to have found that Trump's election campaign was caught by lightning.
Even if community members meet around another hellhole, Trump's almost everyone's gone.
Some experts suggest that the remote area can also be found on the ground for the advancement of Trump, and that it is a fact that it is divided into more than one level of support for the storm.
However, a Monmouth University survey conducted early in the month of July shows that in the case of a conflict between Trump and many community councils, Trump received majority support at every stage.
Carly Fiorina's 13 points, Marco Rubio's 14 points, Walker's 15 points, Jeb Bush's 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie's 33 points.
With Ted Cruz.
Is he the only one who can trust him?
Ben Carson's working with 19 bucks in the case of a headmaster.
Donald Trump says most supporters have made decisions.
A new CBS/NYT poll published on Tuesday shows that more than half of the voters supported the Trump.
Clearly, many things can come to mind to change this, and no one can really change his mind.
He said they left the door open to change 46 degrees.
The biggest brain surgeon in Trump is Ben Carson, but the voters who say they have made their decisions are twice as close to using the voice for Trump.
He says he's the same idea as Trump about six of the community's immigration.
Two months before the campaign, Donald Trump spoke to immigrants from Mexico in the beginning of the 2016 conversation and the middle of the conversation.
Some think that the important Spanish electors have spoken too much of Trump's speech and that they have distanced themselves from the Communist Party and are going to ruin their re-marketing efforts.
However, according to a new ABC/Post survey on Friday, it is said that it is the same as Trump in matters related to six movements from the Community.
So it looks like Trump's gonna stay in the day as long as it's on the move.
The government's campaign is on the rise to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are taking half of the community's games because of the situation outside large areas.
In a new ABC/Post report on the day of the marketing day, he says he wants someone out of the country who has a government experience.
And they're mad at Washington.
Two weeks ago, a Des Moines Register/Blomberg poll in Iowa showed that every three thirds of the Republicans in Iowa were angry with the Republicans in the Congress, and 54 percent said that the 21st was "slowly angry" and 21 percent.
Jeremy Corby's gonna go out for the first time on the president's questions.
Mr. Corbyn has been looking forward to appearing on the agenda of questions from the day he was selected.
The new Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn will go to the summit after David Cameron.
Mr. Corbyn will ask six questions shortly after Monday, and his performance looks like he's getting closer to the media and the Labour Party.
She called for "a little less theatre and more real" for the weekend.
He also said he could leave some sittings and leave them with his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn's leadership, the name of the shadow captain and the speech of the TUC annual conference on Saturday.
In the meantime, during the observance of the 75th anniversary of the British War, the leader of the Labour Party was also silenced by some Tory Milleteveveves and in front of the press.
Mr. Corbyn has taken note of the decision to co-operate with the militia.
A speaker speaking on behalf of Mr. Corby said that he was standing in a "sudden silence" and that he appreciated "the glory of the King's Air Force in the War of England."
However, Mr. Corbyn, a member of the shadow headquarters of Mr. Corbyn, said in his statement to the news night program, Owen Smith BBC, he would advise the Labour Party's leader to say "independence" as "individual" by his belief in the removal of the monastery.
Mr. Corbyn, who refused to serve on top of the top team, refused to serve in the shadow of economic, defence and external relations, supported him as a leader in at least one of the parliamentarians.
BBC political leader Robin Brant also indicated that political differences in the Labour Party had begun to "collecte" and that Mr. Corbyn's position in the European Union and the government's administration of aid had been limited.
Mr. Corbyn said there were new changes in the overall elimination of the upper limit of the Labour Party at the TUC conference.
Hours later, Mr. Smith said that the party opposed the transfer of only $26,000 to the government's upper limit of $23,000 and that it was "very clear" in this regard.
Mr. Corbyn, David Cameron will be the fifth Labour Party leader who will meet in the field of his late partner from the history of the leader of the Muhafazar Party.
The Labour Party's leader gave a different statement on politics, and said he took more than 30,000 advice to ask Mr. Cameron.
Islington North Milletve, said that the question programme is very exciting and will focus on the difficulties faced by young people, instead of changing words with "adversity".
Mr. Corbyn, when he wasn't his own, for example when he went to Mr. Cameron's place, told the Chief of Staff that Angela Eagle would represent himself in the question-trafficking program.
Even when other colleagues thought they were going to this world, Avám Kamara said John Bercow was referring to taking this matter into consideration.
When Mr. Cameron was leader in 2005, he often admitted that he wanted to get away from politics, which had been linked to the Question Programme, but only a few years later, he admitted that he could not succeed.
Since its first publication in 1990, the President-in-Office of the Council has also used the decision-making skills of the leaders of the Question Programme as a basic measuring point to measure their positions between the administrations of the Avam Kamara and the Nationals; this has led to the request that some advocates have been characterised and that there is a need for very comprehensive reforms.
Journeyd in Joburg: Young People Without a Home · Global Voices

Sterlin is rising at the rate of price increases in the United Kingdom
Following data showing the increase in prices in the United Kingdom, a rapid increase in the price was observed, and FTSE 100 indexed the purchase bid for SABMiller.
In the United Kingdom, non-primary fees increased by %2.9 over the same period during the previous year between May and December.
This event, which has been described as the fastest increase since 2009, is also considered to be one of the main indicators for current phase increases.
Sterlin won more than $1.5505 against US dollars, while against the euro, he won $1.84 by winning $1.3730.
The FTSE 100 Index increased by 6,229.21 to 1,49.
If the most attractive company at this level was, it became SABMiller, a 20% increase in sales bid from the EU InBev.
This offer will bring together the world's largest two beer company, and brands known as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch will be found under the same roof.
The impact of the high-performance group on the Bumbery's feelings increased by 0.9 percent of the actual cold news from Richemont.
Richemont also showed that sales in China, one of the key markets for Burberry, which is one of the biggest markets in the world, began to rise again.
The share of Glencore's financial debt increased by 2.5 billion dollars after explaining that he had made the company's own share of the company's debt reduction strategy.
The members of the Ambba and the paper group Mondi took their lead in Goldman Sachs' company to "Sat" and spent the most valuable amount of money on the loss of 4.3 percent.
JD Sports's sense of feeling has increased by 46.6 million esters by an increase of 83%, six months before the company's tax rate.
JD Sports said it could damage the pattern of higher loans.
JD Sports Management Board President Peter Cowgill England said that military compensation for workers could mean "more costing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But he said that this spending power wouldn't work on his own company's senior employees.
The officers also added that JD Sports's expansion plans would affect and that this could mean less extra work.
Metcash launched a public campaign to combat Aldi's will
Metcash, South Australia and Western Australia are trying to protect IGA stores from an Aldi attack.
A national campaign to defend their stores in Metcash, South Australia, and Western Australia began to be launched against Aldi's will for 700 million dollars.
Aldi, in South Australia and Western Australia early in the last year, while preparing to open two distribution centers and the first of their stores to 120 stores, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local cave dealers and try to create the IGA market with the main oil and social media markets and activities, such as the Adelaide River.
IGA dealers and contractors are also involved with the brands of Dunsborough, the central ice cream producer, who is tested at IGA stores, and with customers who sell their tickets to South Australia football league.
The Guda, drinking and heavy drinking group expects more details about the defence strategy when Metcash's annual investment strategy was adjusted on 29 July.
The risk represents almost 30 % of the IGA store's large, remote South Australia and Western Australia's Metcash stock market and produces higher black margins than the IGA network in the eastern countries of Metcash.
South Australia and Western Australia are more popular and IGA players are more powerful than they are in NSW, Victoria and Queensland; more than 30% are in the East countries, and more than 24% are in the BA.
But analysts, like Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi will buy about 5% of the market market market in the next 12 months after opening the first store in these two institutions, but that sales will usually be made by the unbending players.
In a report published this week, analyst Morgan Stanley suggested that Tom Kierath, the IGA contractors, would lose $360 million in one year and that Metcash would lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This suggests that Aldi will open up 30 stores in Ga 25 and BA in the next year, and in each market he's going to buy $500 million and $600 million in sales.
Mr. Kierath indicated that the loss of gas and market sales and the loss of Metcash's high-pressure capital banks would be worth about $13 million in advance of the tax rate and tax to Metcash.
At the same time, Metcash lost its market share in the countries of the birth of Aldi and Coles, despite Roy Morgan's recent investigation that IGA clients are the most loyal customers.
According to Morgan Stanley, Metcash's gambling and market sales in 2016 will decrease by %4,1 in 2017 and by %2.1 in 2018, which will increase market share from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, Magellan Financial Group founder Hamish Douglass, leader of the fund manager, said that Metcash's "may be very likely in that year" at a business meal in Melbourne.
Metcash refused to give an answer to Mr. Douglas.
But it's clear that we've been in contact with Mr. Douglas last week with a Metcash team.
Since 2010, IGA's market share has risen from 18% to 14%, and a demonstration of the decline in sales and margins since 2012 has been shown that the market earnings resulting from almost 1200 IGA dealers in Metcash have decreased by 43%.
But it turns out that in Coles and Woolworths, each week, I spend more than 150 million dollars a year on retail prices, helping IGA customers to upgrade their stores, adding fast-growing fresheners, and opening up a better brand-new market effect.
Metcash executive director Ian Morrice says that the price comparison and store renewal programs are beginning to produce results and that the harvester is expected to return to basic grain growth in the first four years of 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis, supported by Prime Minister Steve Healy, Tennis Australia
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves a lot of honor.
Tennis, Australia's president, Steve Healy, said Thanasi Kokkinakis, was on the side of the last storm that struck the area around Nick Kyrgios, and deserved a lot of honor.
Kokkinakis, a young member of the expert two, usually called "Special K's", found himself under the unfathomable spores that made Stan Wawrinka's assailant at the Montreal Masters.
In a game of violence played after lunch at Cincinnati, while Ryan Harrison was separated from the court of law twice, Harrison said, "Weringa, Kyrgyos, I have to go over that kid."
At the last US Open, the Kokkinakis, who saw the rocket crashing in a way that would break down Richard Gasquet's character, was protected by Healy.
A young player now competes with Sam Groth in Glasgow, with Davis Cup at the end of the second round against Brittany, behind Bernard Tomic.
Healy spoke in the way, "I don't think what I've felt like before, is that Thanasi's going to argue."
He broke his rocket when he closed and lost his face in the U.S., but he wasn't the first player who stole the rocket because he felt he was disappointed, and I know that Thanasi knows enough that he should not be proud of it.
But in fact, Harrison and others in the U.S., he managed very well under very promising conditions and I think he deserves a lot of honor.
There's a great team on the network, a great family, and I think it went too far.
Despite being 19 years old, he's very busy, and he's working hard, and the team's keeping track of the other players, he's got no problem with the other players, he's got a lot of respect in the bedroom, he's having hard coaches, he's got the last-class, and he's got the right to be punished on his own expenses.
Healy also supported the decision to welcome Kyrkios for important co-operation; from Cuma, he began to explain that he would support Canberran as a long-distance sailor in order to return to what was right for everyone.
Healy said, "We want the team to focus, not on the attacks around [Kyrgios] first of all, but on all."
And I think that the child, like Nick, Federerer and Murray, has grown up very fast, has grown up in front of the people, has made some terrible mistakes, and deserves all the things he's getting, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and sometimes when he's not under the lights, he thinks that my mind is right, and he's the best for himself.
Europe's Migration Crisis: Make the situation urgent, close the borders and take the immigrants into account
In order to cut the flow of migrants, Macaristan closed the solar line with Serbia on Saturday, and took into account those who were trying to enter the country's illegal routes.
Hundreds of migrants have been able to meet in a remote area, and Serbian authorities have been able to move around.
Travellers who escaped from violence in their own countries have spent an unlimited period of time on the road between the control points of the two countries and have settled in these camps.
But it was growing as the waves went.
When a police helicopter crossed the top of the bridge, the drivers shouted, "Open the bridge!" and sent a fire to the police in Macaristan.
Some of them refused to receive water and food as protestors.
As Serbia's Foreign Bank, Macedonia and Greece continue to move from Greece, it was explained that it "cannot be accepted" to send the migrants back to Macedonia.
(Serbian) She wants to be a part of the solution, not to see the damage from this period.
In the days ahead, Brussels and other countries will have to meet," Ivica Dacic Pragda said.
This enthusiasm at the Macaristan-Serbian border, which was soon to come to an agreement on a joint migration policy at a meeting in Brussels, 28 countries.
The farmers agreed to share the responsibility of 40,000 migrants who attacked Greece and Italy, and expressed their hope that it would be possible to reach more than 120,000 more EU countries by the end of the month or by the end of the year.
German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and Austria, on Saturday, called for a week's EU visit to see this migration crisis that had been faced by Ketana.
If Macaristan is, it is not likely that he will take any action on the matter of Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency call made on Saturday in the two-day districts gives the authorities broad powers to combat the crisis, to close the roads they need, and to speed up the case with refugees.
On the other hand, Foreign Minister Peter Szijarto, on the other hand, told him that he was planning to withdraw from the country to stop the flow of immigrants from the country.
CBS News, president Charlie D'Agata, heard that even prisoners in prisons had been held responsible for their efforts to communicate between Serbia and Serbia.
In the last few months, Macedonia has become an important bridge and crossing point for the European Union, and a large part of these migrants have escaped from wars in Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
President Viktor Orban is surprised to see that a large part of the immigrants who have come to escape the war are "economically targeted immigrants" who have come to Europe for a better life, despite the fact that a large number of innocent people have come to escape the war - this idea is completely out of touch with the experiences of other EU countries, including Germany.
Laws that enter into the night of midnight in Macaristan also inflict more severe punishment on human refugees than to bring them into a state of crime, which is 4 metres (13 feet) long, bound to the Serbia-Montenegro.
In a statement made to journalists in the city of Szeged in the south, government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said: "The whole move is in order to bring the government to an immediate state."
In one case, we're very clear: it's wrong to go through illegal ways.
Although it still needs to be approved by the Department of Military Affairs, the Associated Press leaders in the region say that they have seen dogs and warheads here today, armed with heavy weapons.
Orban's high-security speech, Gyorgy Bacondi, indicated that he had arrested 15 people who had tried to cross the border with 45 people who were trying to break the limits.
They've gone through all kinds of damages, and now they're accused of committing crimes in police custody and in the new laws.
The authorities are quick to repair the teeth.
The Macar authorities also used a train van with two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Friday mornings to close one of the crossings.
With a small metal container filled with pressure to make macars processes, Kaos also came to his main crossing point near Roszke.
If 20 people could come in, thousands of people were out there.
And another group, they said that they would not accept their help until they were allowed to enter Makaristan by the car connecting Serbia and Macaristan.
Election 2016: Hillary lost half of his national election to Bernie Sanders
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to lead the two sides of the democratic struggle for national sovereignty, but you're reached by Bernie Sanders.
Clinton is now taking 47% of the Democratic Games (out of 58) with Sanders 27% (up from 17) in the second place.
President Joe Biden, who has not yet explained that he is in the presidency, takes 15% of democratic games.
He said it was still too early to decide which island most of the Democrats would have chosen to support.
But Clinton's supporters have more sound ideas about their own choices than others.
The last month since CBS News, Clinton has lost its land between a number of demographic groups, and on the other hand, there are some gains from Sanders.
Clinton has a big difference between women and men, but that's all.
The support between the men fell big, and Sanders was only following himself for five minutes.
Clinton's 50-year-old Democrats have had an advantage, and he and Sanders are now in the same place.
But it's a big difference in the way Clinton's older voters are.
Last month, Clinton was moving forward in front of Sander with two lines between the liberals, but now Sanders is five points ahead of this group.
At the international level, democratic voters will support Clinton while nearly half the party is on the island.
When supported by a few conditions, 15 percent of each other's body will only support it if it's called.
Half a hundred people don't support Clinton.
Maybe in a non-terrestrial form, in the process of supporting Clinton's existing supporters, especially by holding him.
The encounters between those who don't support Clinton right now are even more confusing - only the flowers can support him.
Fewer members of the community are talking about Donald Trump when it says that 48 percent of the Democrats will support Clinton with 48 percent. (35 percent).
When questions were asked about why Clinton's supporters wanted to be named, the results in the first case were correct (in percent 16), and now the idea of a woman's time of election (in percent 13) and the best way to work (in percent 10).
Clinton's supporters are also making fun of his relationship with Bill Clinton (in the 9th century).
It's one of the criteria that we're dealing with.
As a presidential assistant with the potential for the presidency, 57 percent of democratic voters may want to see that he is at war, but three-thirds of the group doesn't think so.
When Democrats are asked what their second election for the party is, it's over.
According to more than half of Clinton's supporters, Biden's can have a second choice, in contrast to Sander's.
Biden, if he doesn't go to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Hillary's superiority over Clinton's Sanders, and Biden's 20-pound level, which is not Biden's.
Five percent of democratic voters view Clinton as the best option to win the general election, but this number has grown from 78 in the last century.
And even though it's a wonderful turn of events when I'm looking at it, the percentage of people who see it as the most selectable habit has increased.
When asked what is the most important thing in a situation, the democratic electorate is in front of the choice of matters.
No democracy can seem to be accepted as the norm for these first elections in the past month.
Democratic or audacious traditions have good performance in some of the main characteristics of their own parties.
Most people view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy, and they also see themselves as people with strong leadership responsibilities.
From the point of view of honesty, Clinton was strong in leadership when he was the first of three.
According to the hundreds of democratic voters, Clinton is not honest and reliable, but half of it says the same for Sanders (15 percent) there's no idea of 27 of this.
Democrats also generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden in their own ideology.
There's no idea about Sanders' reputation for democratic elections in all dimensions.
While issues regarding the use of personal e-mail and the use of the server continue during the Foreign Office, most people find it satisfactory to discuss the issue of democracy's election and indicate that their views on it are not affected.
But it's a different story in the general American village.
Half of the Americans are no longer satisfied with his explanations. Only three people have found them.
The people's meetings on this matter were divided in March shortly after the issue was settled.
Most American e-mails say they don't affect their general discussions about Clinton, and we're on the other hand 36 percent of the way we're on the other side.
They say that the community is generally, and more than a dozen people say, that they're breaking up their views on Clinton.
Although Clinton is considered to be honest and reliable by his own party voters, it is still a general issue among the registered voters: when only 32% of him is honest and trusted, this number has fallen eight pounds since May, and 15 points have fallen.
Six percent of the registered voters find him honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of the country's registered voters do not find Trump honest and reliable.
Along with this, Clinton and Trump take a good note of leadership.
Between the six times that the test involved, Biden, Carson and Bush took the best points about honesty.
More and more Sanders are always honest, but most people don't have any idea about him as they are in Carson.
The error margin in the sample sample from 351 Democrats is %6 points.
I'm Carson in the national polls behind Donald Trump.
According to the latest CBS News/New York Times report, Ben Carson Donald Trump is running behind
The new report shows that two-and-a-half of the candidates have won the game and that the others have no chance.
Community voters across the country continue to support Trump in large numbers, with the support of %23 in the CBS report, which was released on Saturday to %27 before the conflict in Fox News last month.
However, Carson's support rose from %6 to %23 at the same time.
The poll also found Carson's well-being in demographic groups, and he found that his message was much higher than that of Trump among the community voters.
The others, Carly Fiorina and Ohio Valisi John Kasich, have now fallen to %2 from the 10th-month support with Wisconsin Valisi Scott Walker.
Former Florida Valisie Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Valis Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are the third with 6%.
This latest investigation error margin, made by 376 people selected from the community elections, was %6 and reported on July.
The latest CNN/ORC report published last week showed the support of Carson's community to 19% and the support of Trump's 32% immediately.
The last report made by ABC News/Washington Post showed Trump in a serious way.
We've been fighting Carson's height for the past week, and if you're sorry, Carson Trump's faith has been questioned, he's still stuck to the brain surgeon.
At a campaign in Iowa, Trump said on Saturday, "We need energy."
Five members of the five Brothers accused Baruch College of being the first class student to die
About two years after the death of a college student in the Pocony Mountains of Pennsylvania, murder was committed against five people.
The New York City Baruch College Pi Delta Psi was severely attacked by Chun "Michael" Deng at a launch in July 2013 and was killed by the police in order to take him to the hospital.
The authorities told him that his eyes were bound, that his 30-liberal bag was locked in the darkness of a series of bags full of furniture, and that he was constantly undercover while he was trying to reach the target in a brown field.
Mr. Deng found out that his head had been hurt in time and that he had lost his consciousness later.
The Pi Delta Psi brothers didn't call 911 after they fell in love with Dang, and they waited an hour before the police took him to the hospital.
However, according to police Commissioner Chris Wagner, who spoke at the press conference, they changed Deng's clothes, called his symptoms in Google, and asked for advice from the national leader Andy Meng.
Commissioner Wagner, members at this point began to store personal belongings and stressed the welfare of the brotherhood from Michael Deng.
He couldn't breathe, and he lost his life the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, deng, head, neck, and neck were made of wired wires that were re-produced from non-smokers.
Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer who represented Deng's family, said that many families lost their lives every year since 1970 as a result of the so-called Brethren.
Brothers and sisters should be held accountable for this, and this is a very important step that they are being trained.
Monroe City's major jury recommended that he be prosecuted for the third grade of murder for the first five members.
Mr. Meng, including the thirty-two members of the brothers, will also be charged with the acceptance and punishment of the attack.
Wagner said at a press conference on Saturday, not only people involved in the work, but also organizations that have officially or in the garage, we'll be responsible for them too.
Baruch College legalized the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood ended that relationship with the local community.
What's going to happen when Fed's gonna increase his fascism?
With the rise of fascism, the market will be high and the economy will be able to save back.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long all of this will take place and how long it will continue.
History, especially in the economy, provides very little information about timing.
The recurrence was, as was done in the short period of 11 months after the first phase of growth, and was 86 months long.
The aggressiveness of the U.S. Central Bank in increasing the fiscal situation of Fed has generally been a factor in economic and financial assets.
That's why the U.S. Central Bank authorities insist that the rate of investors begins to increase, not the rate of normalization, but the extent to which the normalization process should be concentrated.
It's a fact that there's different changes.
But as a matter of fact, the market participants may think that the tax increase has been interrupted.
In a note to global economy economist Julian Jessop told customers, "This financial crisis is still not surprising, as some of Fed's first phase increase indicates that the 'low money' cycle is coming to an end."
On the other hand, we don't expect U.S. phase events to return slowly to normal, but it's seen that most of the levels that are still low are in the blackout.
We don't say they won't be affected yet.
Based on past trends, the attitude that some areas of the economy can give is:
Just as it has been observed in the past months in the market, waiting for more fashions can slow down for a period of time.
And it doesn't have that much effect when it's increased.
In a new study on what's going to happen after Fed's increase, Deutsche Bank analysts said, "Seeing that 12-24 months after the first increase in the price of the product, it might be a trend to stop money policy."
According to a daily analysis shared by Bob Doll of the Nuveen State Government analysts at Barrons, the market has generally recorded cuts in the last 35 weeks, and 14 times 250 days later, it's going on a straight line (between 2.6 and 500 days) and it's normally returned to the last six times by 14.4 percent.
Deutsche said the effect on emotions was more marked in the next stages of the phase increase.
Returns are a fact of economic life, but they will also be helped by increased interest.
Fed, in the modern situation, is facing some situations that have not yet existed and will speed up recovery.
The most important thing is that you're still at the lowest level to date for Fed's tax increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, when it was more than 118 percent of it has occurred since 1950, it fell under only two hundred and a half times 4.5 a year.
Although the second quarter of 2015 has been achieved at 3.6 levels, it is expected that the situation will remain very low and that the third rate will be 1.5 percent.
According to Deutsche, it could be a risk to increase the rates of fashions in a more sensitive economic environment, and it could lead to the question "will be different this time."
A year later, the attention of the market participants, who were waiting for Fed's fair increase, was paid to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which was due to end on Friday.
Although most strategic experts believe that economicist FOMC can approve an increase in this meeting, the usual trade is only about 25 percent.
The report stated, "In the research we've been doing this since 1950, all the increases that have taken place up to our day are within a super-higher education cycle and are rapidly reaching back to the peaks after the start of the collection,"
On the contrary, this has been a gathering in an unprecedented sense of the worst return in a period of time.
The latest return, the longest return that Fed expected since his last return -- the longest return in the list was 35 months, and we're still in the 74th month.
The market is stable and stable, and it looks like a well-designed asset.
The fact is, when Fed's policy changes, it's more rapid than it's in the moods.
When the first increase/warming of the storm doesn't change immediately.
At the end of the turn of the tax increase, there are doubts about it," Deutsche said.
According to Charles Schwab's strategy experts, the increases in the rate will be closer and closer between longer and shorter assumptions.
We're looking at high-level thinkers, who say they're generally better performances in this environment like this, say Kathy Jones, but "we're very careful about reaching out."
First of all, Jones thinks that Fed's political expectations are now in place.
"In addition to the decline in the energy and inflation expectations, there are various signals that the market has been set up in accordance with its most frequent monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term rates increase, data generation has increased correctly, credit spreads have increased, and inflation has increased - all features will be seen on the market when the FED policy is complicated.
In view of the wide range, companies doing most of the work in the United States will win more and more local products.
The situation of many international companies that are heavily indebted will be worse, and the increasing production of dollars will make the world market even worse, and the debt will be worse.
In a report prepared by Goldman Sachs for customers, he said, "The history shows that a performance deficit can be lived at the top of such a growth."
Companies with strong balance sheet values in 1994, 1999 and 2004 were over 5 percent of those with weak balance.
Companies with low-sounded and low-skilled feelings have also passed their low-quality ratios (in percent) to 3 (in percent).
Borsch is going to be a big problem.
Goldman says that companies with high-end gambling debts are the worst to see.
In addition to the Safi puzzle game, customers are expected to use more dollars.
Although experts have different meetings on how fast they are to keep, designers can also be proud of high performances.
Andrew Bingham BBC said a copy of 3 Classic FM Radio
Nationalist Andrew Bingham's "extreme" show.
It's been observed that the radio has become more and more unique from commercial tracks on the way.
Also, BBC showed the Music Awards and accused him of putting the British Awards on tape.
His official friend Damien Collins accused him of being free of The Voice.
A further official, telling the Classic FM that BBC Radio 3 was "distributed" to the publisher to put his difference between other commercial stations.
Nationalist Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the radio channel, which provides public service to the public, is "in exchange" and that it is different from the sales records.
"I don't like to use this tape, but Radio 3 "is gone," he goes back to Classic FM."
And that's the goal of the BBC Music Awards, which we've been setting up in the Middle Ages.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, is a different version of the British Awards.
Bingham said, "If you're going to do something very different, these are the first two examples that come to my mind, then you're gonna copy the same thing that's on the market."
BBC's general manager's rejection of BBC Radio 3's necessary live music is clearly ahead of commercial performances in the field of public education.
If I learn from Radio 3, I can't go and learn something about classical music from somewhere else.
And that's the connection between live music and music can't be made with anything else.
He also talked about the importance of Radio 3's new music detection and work.
BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey said that in order to reach more audiences this year, the radio needed to work more in the past, because the British were less educated in classical music.
But Radio 3, the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport was not the only group that was held to mark the BBC's commercial records.
The National Tory Damien Collins de O Ses - the BBC, the Netherlands, has sold it to compete with the 22 million-star music technology offered by Talpa Media from the Netherlands.
Don't you see why the program is so loud, because it's not personal, and there's no special difference?
Lord Hall, Paloma Faith, and Boy George's party, he questioned whether BBC1 Show was made a better way to BBC.
She said she wanted to "find a hit out of her blood" before she had another fun program.
What is more, he did not accept the idea that in the future more than one voice programme would be banned or spent on other formats by the holder of the licence.
Is Kara Cuma the reason why Internet sales in August have been the lowest in the history of the world?
In the first three months of 2015, there was an increase in sales of the Internet
It's been registered as the lowest in the year 2000 when the record began to break.
There were explosions in Internet sales three years ago when mobile devices were being sold
The researchers explain why Kara Cuma's spending in November could be reduced.
Internet buying has been a long time since the age of prostitution and has turned England's life-threatening business history into a ghost town.
In the first three months of 2015, researchers indicate that there was only one percent increase in Internet sales, but after the number of numbers showed that Internet sales had increased significantly as they went.
In August last year, the total cost was only five percent higher, and this was the lowest increase since the year 2000, when records began to be broken.
In the first three months of 2015, experts indicate that there has been only one percent increase in Internet sales after the number has shown that Internet sales have given more signs of weakness
Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, said to the Guardian, "If you look at the levels of growth in the previous years and in particular the 2000s, you will see that everything is going back to normal."
She added that the Internet sales of mobile phones began three years ago in order to buy products.
This meant that even more people could buy it while they're out of their pockets.
But now he's going to bed, you can see his face.
The Kara Cuma phenomenon, which was taken from America, is shown as one of the reasons why sales slow down.
The experts suggest that to buy something, customers may expect this activity on Friday's last Friday.
In the last year's activity, many companies' websites have broken down when they attacked companies to obtain more than five times as many cheap products as they could last year.
The authorities suggest that Kara Cuma's buyers, who showed that the buyers fought for download, may be registered as "now"
Each 5 stars that spent an investigation on a purchase published by the United Kingdom claimed that each of the 5 stars consumed the product from the Internet for the product.
Some of the products, like TV and shopping machines, are now sold from online stores.
He also buys more than one in four people's clothes and shoes instead of lifting and shopping on the Internet.
Because Bin Ladin's family is guilty, Muslims succeed in their final journey to the death of those who have lost their lives in the tragic event in Mecca.
Following the first funeral held in Mekke, 29 people who lost their lives were taken to the streets by Muslims
Suudi Binladin was responsible for building the Suudi Binladin group, as a result of the tragic accident in Saudi Arabia.
Health care has shown that 394 people have been injured since the fall of the virus.
An army of 29 people who had lost their lives in the fall of a Vincid into the Haram came to the point where hundreds of Muslims met to take their wives.
The majority of the whites, the first funerals in the Mekké, have lost their way into their final journeys to the Museum of Faysim.
A few days ago, a widow came across a sacred place where a stranger was living on the roof of her house.
At the same time, 394 injuries were caused after the owner of the building of the Kingdom of the South was responsible for Binladin's family and the death penalty was imposed.
A widow who lost her life by falling down on the road to Haram was moved across the streets by 29 of her cousins.
Among the dead were four children from the Bolton region of Manchester, which was the first party to fall.
Mr. Akram, at the beginning of Hac's worship, he and his mother and his father came to Haram.
The Soviet leaders announced that thousands of people who were on their way to Mecca would continue to join the party.
In his statement today, King Salman, the Binladin Holding Group, stated that he should not leave his arm of wine open when I use it.
In the Arabic version of the farm that the Suudi Press Agency is working on by the State, the only party to be accused of the incident was Binladin Group.
The news agency's English service didn't pass this detail, but the company's owners were brought out of custody.
At the beginning of the week, Salman, Vinci, swore to them that they would find that the hundreds of thousands who had come to Hacah at the end of the month of Ham, were to be taken over to the tribe of Ram.
There was no statement on the wines held by the Binlain group and no representations were allowed to be made.
He accused the government of not taking the day-to-day security advances and of cooperating with the authorities of meteorology.
The Mescid, located in Mekke, has been turned into a fortress around the Haram, which is dominated by the Binladin group.
The Binladin family has been in close contact with the governing family of Saudi Arabia for many years and is the first name of the construction project.
Al-Qaide's last senior leader, Osama Bin Ladin, was a son of the fool I've been doing since my family's childhood.
In an era of severe wind and rain, disaster struck just a few days before millions were willing to visit the country of Haqq, where every adult Muslim would be willing to visit in their lives.
The authorities reported that 158 people were still in the hospital.
The authorities advised the families of the dead and the families of the survivors to pay 1 million Riyal (174,000 sterlins).
The other wounded will get half of this.
B&Q says the boss behind this trend is the Western European experts who work in the rear of the trend.
Veronice Laurie says the British took more jobs
Behind this increase, the number of Western Westerners is falling.
At the end of this, 200 new Screwfix store is still open
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q sales points in the country.
Written by Rupert Steiner, Daily Mail Chief of the City
It's said that the British have begun to hire British Western specialists to do their homework instead of leaving their drawers and flowers.
If you're stuck on a ladder or a wall, it means you're going to fall down today.
Because according to the company's boss behind B&Q, the British are running more and more support to do DIY at home.
Veronique Laurie, the new general manager of the house repair clinic, said that there was a large increase in the number of Western European retailers serving low prices behind this trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open more 200 new Screwfix store for customers when he closes the 60 B&Q sales point.
Ms. Lauri B&Q wanted more women to be employed in stores because she said eight women were given the ten sale orders in the store.
Most of the staff are now men.
She said that a woman who made more house repair with a girl in the past needed guidance to cope with the growing demographic trends seen in her house.
Ms. Laurie said, "There's still a lot of men working in our stores.
We need to get more water.
In principle, half of our clients are taken by 80 percent of the decisions on the products they have made and the products they have sold are taken by women.
Women play a major role in making decisions.
Ms. Lauriy, one of the five women of the UK's leading companies, who was one of the five women in the beginning of FTSE100, redesigned the upper team to become the same number of men and women as the manager.
The Kingfisher, the general manager and the financial manager, including 50 percent of the team's staff, is almost the only one in this area.
Ms. Lauri said to them: "This is a familiar decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It wasn't hard to find good women to get our administration.
After loading the warehouses, the group learned that the Kingfisher had fallen in both the sixth and the ninth months of the sale.
At the end of the trend, Kingfisher will open 200 new store owned by Screwfix and B&Q.
Time of decision to increase the rate for the U.S. Central Bank for the FED
The United States Central Bank monitors the two-day meetings that continue on Thursdays and Fridays around the world; ten years later the decision is expected to be made to avoid further increases in fashion.
In a survey conducted by Reuters, 80 economists say that we're going to apply this decision a little more than a week now, and they think it's going to be between 0 and 0.25.
It's a story of seven years ago that the FED sent down all these things.
A leading researcher from the Peterson International Economic Institute said in the Angel Ubide, "We will first prove that a major central bank has begun to normalize the fashion events."
The U.S. economy is responsible for creating a good performance and re-viving the economy, adding billions of dollars to the balance and creating less inflation.
But the global table, which is less promising than the FED, can't go further.
He warned the merchants against an increase, but they were convinced that the situation would not allow such an increase.
The decision will be announced on Friday at 20 a.m.
He left a letter of apology for his murder at Delta State University.
According to experts on Tuesday, Shannon Lamb left a note saying that it was "good" for the first murder and "if I can get it back" after killing a friend of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning and at the same time.
The Mississippi Gautier Police, at Delta State University, called for 911 at 10 a.m. Lamb, who was trained in photography and social sciences.
He said he said he killed someone by gun.
Lamb said he should send the police to the duty on the phone.
Lamb, who said, "I killed my wife last night," also said that he had found "a sweet dog that didn't hurt anybody" at home and was probably sad.
He didn't mention that name even if the police asked him about it.
There's no explanation for Lamb's murder.
When the police took over the case, Amy Prentiss, 41, met with a note written by Lamb, 45, "I'm sorry if I could take the time back.
I loved Amy so much, and she was the only person to love me until today.
Lamb, after writing this note, went to Delta Island, 300 miles away, and killed historian Professor Ethan Schmidt, and then the police chased him away.
Professor William LaForge of the University said he didn't know that there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but "there's something about Lamb's mind."
On the day of the market, Lamb, despite reports that his girlfriend Prentiss had a sensitive relationship with Schmidt, indicated that on Sunday the authorities did not find "no information or evidence" in his hand that he was a "love triangle".
The remaining seven-year-old with Prentiss is known as Shawn O'Steen, who lives with Prentiss.
Two were divorced 15 years ago, but they're friends.
O'Stepen said that a 19-year-old girl was found with Prentiss and that she was "in a state of disintegration."
O'Stepen also indicated that his daughter and Prentiss were "the best friend of each other."
According to Sun Herald, he worked on the Internet from Prentiss' home, which he identified as a close friend of parentings.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owns a dog's dog named Lightning, had been with Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "He always loved helping others."
He said, "I'm not going in yet," calling the police Lamb on Tuesday.
At 1 Highway near Greenville the same night, the police took him close to the Lamb, shot him, ran straight into the forest area, and shot himself in the arm.
According to the CV published on the University's website, Lamb took his degree in education at Delta State University in early 2015.
The stars that lost their old destiny
His son, Redmond, who was seen with his right hand, had been in a very stressful situation for several years.
In 2001, he fought for revenge, and in 2009, his friend Farrah Fawcett was killed by cancer.
The actor, who said he was fighting drugs, was also arrested in 2008.
All of this certainly hurt him very much.
Luke Shaw's two-month breakout from Manchester United.
Luke Shaw's right leg suffered two injuries at the PSV Endhoven in the Manchester United Championships League.
When this incident hits the defense player's eyes, Louis van Gaal Shaw will leave him at least six months away from the streets.
Unfortunately, at 15 minutes of the machine that hit Shaw's 20-year-old gym like a bomb, it caused Héctor Moreno to come in unattended.
He's been in the hospital for nine minutes and then he needs to be given oxygen before he's in the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "Drive out of two at the end of the day, and now in the hospital."
Today or someday, maybe she'll be loved and taken to Manchester.
A bad situation - 18 years old, a young man who moved to Manchester, first spends hard times, then plays a great game and then comes back to you.
He had an oxygen mask on his face when he was in my bedroom.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you're two, it means at least six months and it means you can't play in the group environment.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno had the chance to save his ass from a red card and a pen.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish Mexico.
Van Gaal was suggesting that the Italian authorities made a mistake.
When I say it's a pen and red card, you can judge yourself.
He was a very bad fighter with two eyes.
The tweet from Shaw's account said, "I thank you all for your messages. I don't have enough words to tell you how much I'm feeling. I'm getting better now, and I'm going to be stronger."
Middle: Luke Shaw, who lives at the University of Manchester, PSV, lives in peace
The champions who will be organized in Tammuz, France, will be morally responsible for the improvement of the League of England defence.
PSV Technical Director Phillip Cocu said, "It's a bad move."
If it's such a mess, it's everyone's sorry for any player.
Our players don't want to ruin their reputation.
Moreno, 2014 in the World Cup, has also lived to break his legs while playing in the Mexican team against Van Gaal.
Cocu, it's very difficult to find this condition because his intention was never to clean up his reputation, and it wasn't good after he heard it was a very bad break, he said.
I couldn't see that memory in my mouth.
The only thing I could see was that she was headed differently, like Moreno touched her, but I didn't see Luke stealing.
Moreno said, "I know how it feels, I know how hard something can be.
I feel so bad about this, and I'm so sorry.
From the PSV, Andrés Guardado was transferred to the final hospital for his encounter with Chris Smalling.
Of course David Cameron The Lorax knows better than that?
That's what every husband knows for a short time: when your child loves a book, you know that you're not going to have more time to learn it.
Looks like if you're not David Cameron.
When asked what was the most popular child book by a satellite programmer in charge of child care, President The Lorax chose a 1971 environmental issue by Dr. Seuss.
Cameron, who wrote that this was a difficult decision on the SuperCamps website, will continue: "I like to read this book, which is a comical, moving, creative and powerful message, because it contains a sign or message that we always have."
Everything went so well up here that Cameron wrote something about the contents of the powerful book, but in fact, the book adds new characters and details to cover the content of the real story until the 2012 film version changed the paragraph.
There's a boy named Ted in Thneed-Ville, whose entire nature is missing, with walls that even the air is meta-metal, who wants to make sure that Audrey's daughter wants to see a real tree to win her heart, says the real name Theodor Seuss Geisel, and a love story that Dr. Seuss didn't know about in 1991.
If it's not enough for you to be convinced that Cameron's text is very similar to that of The Lora's short own text in the Internet Film Archive, which begins: "It's in Thneed-Ville City, a girl in a child's imagination who wants to win over Audrey's heart."
In view of all the claims that the work is a whole head of the work, it seems that Cameron, who heard about the destruction of an unnamed young child, is also called the book Lorax, who created a complex and "proclaimer on the Name of the Trees" despite the fact that the book he heard was destroyed by the forgiving Ones.
It's quite likely that this weak, weak nation has been inspired by an order servant, who has not read The Lorax to a child 20 times more.
One of the presidential speakers said that the text was thought to have come from Cameroon's election office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by Cameron's staff, but there was no way out.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk for England's release, but I still don't know.
It's a difficult task to play with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, but after seeing the English team selected for the tour, the 3-0 series of tests, which last appeared, does not appear on the cards.
I still don't leave a deposit box out of the picture.
Alastair Cook's team may be more inexperienced than three years ago, but there are good players on the battle line and a strong collective understanding of the game, which does not improve the wounds of 2012 but only provides a few young people with a source of prosperity.
In the collective game, Moeen Ali is growing as a player, and Judge Rashid, even if he does not know the quality of the test level, represents an attack option.
Original: Adam Lyth from the English Test team and Alex Hales was taken instead
Adam Lyth's decision to go out, it's hard for me to analyze as a major coach in Yorkshire.
The seven tests faced two good fathers in difficult times, and the truth is that the cricketers are being judged as a result.
For example, there was no question about Joe Root, there was no warning, because, as I said before, the players were their best choices.
After a few decades, Lyth could see that his career was extended, but he identified his own career.
I hope he'll get another chance if he's working more for Yorkshire.
The English coach Trevor Bayliss, although he didn't show the best performance, didn't surprise me; he was a team man first.
It's hard to figure out how much it's going to take a test shooter's note.
Lyth, like Sam Robson before him, had seven times, and Nick Compton had nine.
Compton's only got the chance of a giant game.
The only thing you can feel for Jonathan Trott is that he first went to the Caribbean - while Lyth's form was on the horizon - but this empty opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming and I think he's a high-level shooter.
A cricket at the X-factor's target, and this at the beginning of this season, when Trent Bridge made 236 numbers against us, we saw it in Yorkshire.
At least he should be able to take the same opportunity before him, but of course it's about the membership of the United Arab Emirates team.
Moen made an open fight with Cook so that he could get back to the game while he held four quicksands, and I'm not against it.
I don't understand why a shooter didn't shoot here, but above all, this left-handed guy showed how good it is as a cracker.
Moen, he couldn't do his job for Worcestershire, but he saw three numbers for them, and there's not much difference.
My old team friend Justin Langer played his first 38 exams before he started out in 2001.
He's got the three-face series right away, and he's not looking behind him.
The Zafar Ansari team is coming back as a seven-player player, and I was surprised to be a young man at my limited meeting with him.
People can also see their statistics -- 31 averages in the war and 35 averages in the war -- and they may think it's a draw, but there's not a lot of players who pull their hands out, and the players' choices are made even more than they're young.
He'll learn a lot of things in this class.
From Egypt, England seems to have made its own team of coaches a couple of pounds.
Sri Lanka's shooter Mahela Jayawaardene may be an excellent example of being assigned as a pilot to the experimental game.
He's one of the most popular people in the game. He's going to bring with him a full experience against all the trains.
Paul Collingwood is coming for the white ball foot, and the energy and the game are winning a series without pain.
I always think he's born for the international cricket world, and there's an understanding that can be taken over like Mahela.
Sometimes new voices in the bedroom, even the messages that were said before, can bring news to the team.
Colly's teammate Ben Stokes is listening to a day-to-day game, giving Root a model against Australia, and I don't have a question about it.
Not everyone is made by planners, coaches, and players, but not by the same opinion.
And don't forget that their work is related to the results, like players.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
The Brexit camp can be won while the economy is stable until 2017
David Cameron's strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting worse every day, and this is Jeremy "Yes?" despite the fact that Corbyn was elected as the leader of the Labour Party or that the TUC was expelled from Europe on Saturday.
The aliens have Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
In the past, a European diplomat, a friend of mine, said that some member states, in the EU, who had not wanted much of the sort of crisis that they had to do with themselves, had been able to overcome by day-to-day changes in their business and business agreements.
TUC decided he didn't want to do this while harming social security at the annual meeting in Brighton.
We can even call this Dave and George my own day.
The president and Chancellor, the presidents of foreign countries, are taking pictures of their own pictures, whether they go to parties or to bilateral meetings, and they say that they have gathered for reform to return to their countries.
It's all about me.
When Berlin said, "Don't leave us alone with France," my friend in the United States, who wanted to return to Britain, said that my friend, who wanted to go to some of the presidents, had come to a point where we no longer wanted to stay.
Angela Merkel, a potential and mental-sighted woman of Germany, has been in custody for 10 years, and wants to leave without reporting the situation as it was in the examples of Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Holland, in 2017, is one of the hundreds of changes that have been made to re-election or re-election in France.
It's a force that's asking.
Soon there will be a national government on the right in Poland, and in Spain on the left there will be a government on the left.
It is very unlikely that these countries would be able to show a range of countries that must be used to prevent Iceland from being separated from the United Kingdom because most of them have different teachers.
I mean, some of these lookers may have been planning to speed up the Brexit process during the 2017 United Kingdom referendum campaign, and my friend says so.
"There wasn't a conversation again," and "Brittania didn't get anything to benefit from talking again."
The Europeans knew how popular Fleet Street was from previous experiences, how promising the U.S. press barons were, and it wasn't in Tony Ben's time, and they were inspired to refer to 1975, which approved our entry into 1973 at a 1st time.
At the beginning of the 1990s, the British President named Boris Johnson, who heard the name "EU straight lines" in the name of the main Euro-opportunityist Boris Johnson.
Once again, Ed Miliband knew who the enemies were.
Among them were tax collectors, foreigners who listened to the phone calls without the law, and foreign experts who spoke to most of our large newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair was thinking the same things about them, but he also realized that he needed to focus his attention on the food he had eaten and then on the food he had to eat.
In fact, Miliband, a prominent reference to Cameron's opinion on the issue of exit was Blair, Blair, who was taught the principle on the EU motherhood by French and Dutch monthly users who gave him a certificate of exit in 2005.
The press never forgave him for that.
But on the day of the sale in Westminster, I told myself that it was no longer time to lose myself -- Jeremy Corbyn, Neil Kinnock, and now it seems that Murdoch, who is now in his 80s, is again at risk of resuscitating his strategy.
It's gonna take time, not with me, but with the media, to develop a sustainable strategy to keep in touch with Andrew Marr, who left the BBC on Sunday.
I'm saying Corbyn's official position in Europe is in progress.
He says he wants us to stay in a past EU.
Most of the people who are left out of Ukip's hostility say yes to that, and the supporters of the Little Church of the Fascists.
In fact, Hilary Benn said, "It's Benn, but not Bennite," and this week on radio and television, he forced himself to accept Corbyn as John McDonnell's son-in-law a bad idea.
It reminded me of his friends at his office of employment on television in the '70s, and he's not making any progress, and he's losing his job in the office.
Hillary's fight was more exciting.
But "Benn's expression" was the same as saying to the Lord's people at a special meeting on the night of the JC's trade.
In view of what happened to me, it continues to protect the importance of the message's discipline, regardless of the details Corbyn's attempt to convey, regardless of his age, at the 7/24 TV call and at the well-known social media in the paranoia and betrayal bed.
As McDonnell said, when I refer to Cameron, it's important to put pressure on Europe in order to ensure that the Labour Party supports it.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But it is no longer a private dispute between the left-wing leaders of the Bennite anti-capitalist economy on the EU membership of McDonnell and Corbyn, who are now in line with the history of anti-capitalists.
As in the transfer of Nato, Tom Watson will have to force foreign diplomats to take out one of these for the heads of the country.
Why should Paris or Berlin lose political power when they have their own suspects?
As I was told at the opening of the British Security Forum on Monday, although the United States, despite the Government of the UK's weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, is already experiencing a great deal of disappointment.
Officials in England are doing an e-mail research on the Health of the People's Republic of England
Researchers have found that at a 12-person meeting of a government-funded agency, which is connected to the entire industry, e-signatures are less than 95 per cent more harmful than smoking.
Experts writing in the British Type of South (BMJ) have joined Lancet in supplementing the evidence used in the report of the British People's Health (PHE) e-sigara.
The PHE published last month the report on the "second point" that was identified as "intention in a separate format".
But some researchers questioned the health of data and took note of the connections between scientists and the entire industry.
Lancet's last month's report's prime target was the "study of detachment" based on the end of PHE's mother.
Two other researchers who wrote in BMJ asked whether the claims were "sun or whether it was built on the rock."
In London Hygyen and Tropical School, European public health professor Martin McKee and professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University said: "The impact of basic health policies on public health is inconsistencies."
The people said that "the best estimate of the population is that nearly 95% is more harmful than e-sigrant smoking" is expected to stop evidence and modelling into a detailed inconsistencies.
In fact, 12 persons from a meeting gathered to develop a multi-critic decision analysis (MCDA) to create a synthesis of the findings of the meetings on various products involving nicotine; the results of the meeting have been presented in a research article.
McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company known as EuroSwiss Health, which had previously received funds from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
They also told him that the Bat's public health certificate was approved in a possible trial report.
They added that one of the 12 persons at the meeting said they had received money from an e-mail producer, but that there was no previously received funds from Philip Morris International.
There was no information on how the panel members were selected, but some of these include some of the countries known as the e-sigrant that the article mentioned in the article.
Some of the others who are present at the meeting are not aware of their full powers of control.
The PHE meeting was attended by all the responsible men.
McKee and Capewell wrote that the research article that the group wrote "in an integrated way" admitted that "the majority of the causes of damage are evidence of a lack of evidence."
But none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that "there is no evidence that e-sigara has a drug transition for children or non-smokers."
The Health and Reef Director at PHE said Professor Kevin Fenton, BMJ, had been given answers before.
He said, "E-signatures are less harmful in the way of smoking."
One of the two people who have cancer for the rest of their life dies because of this addiction.
All the evidence indicates that the health risks caused by e-signatures are very small, but we need to continue to examine their long-term effects.
PHE has a clean role: to be informed about damages at a time when evidence is shown and not shown.
About 80,000 people die of a smoking-related disease each year, and smoking is costing NHS $2 billion a year.
There is evidence -- even if e-sigara is not safe, that smoking causes only a small part of the damage -- and we are openly referring to our national responsibility.
The previous channel said the BBC chief should leave EastEnders.
The former Channel 4 president Luke Johnson BBC said he should stop publishing programs like EastEnders and The Voice, and the advertising records indicate that they can "give their right hands for hot programs such as Albert Square's.
Johnson said the license fee should be used only for programs of kind not made by other English publishers.
BBC has been added to its public service programmes, which are likely to be monitored by a smaller monitoring group, against the most retreading programmes of its opponents in valuable intervals, such as BBC4.
After saying that the BBC Director General Tony Hall wanted to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson said it was a six-year failure in his own time to establish a link with BBC.
Johnson said to the Lords Chamber Communication Committee during a question about the future of the BBC, "I oppose the idea of producing and publishing programs that can be clearly presented by the BBC without prejudice."
If you insist on applying the license fee that I'm not sure it's a good idea in the medium or long term, you have to send it to programs that others have not done or have not done.
The Voice is being published in the middle of the primary school because they want to provide a wide range of support as soon as it can be in the future.
It's based on the idea that someone else can't publish the idea that it's ridiculous and clearly stupid.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why programs that can be found without help should be based on a reduced tax rate.
The Voice is one of the East Enders, and the other is actually in the company.
If you have to be honest, other channels will give you your right hands for that.
I'm trying to see how public service is spreading.
I don't think that's gonna make BBC.
Johnson, a series of participants who conducted Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of being the best way to ensure long-term support for this approach, "because of the people working here and the people working here."
The BBC's most popular program volumes are re-examined by Sky Manager Tony Ball, who used MacTaggart in Edinburgh in 2003 to offer BBC programs like East Enders.
Johnson BBC said that the most appropriate public service programmes are going to BBC4 and will not make the monitoring measure here, but that they are faced with the tax burden and will be able to continue their religious duties on the supply of $4 billion of the license fee, and he added, "We're doing all these civil programs that no one's watching."
They put these in the blanks that no one can ever watch.
Regarding the reward, Johnson told the Committee: "I invite you people to find a more regressive system than those who provide the best.
Of course, you all think, we all think, 150 stars a year, but I wonder why 150 stars are not watching too many BBCs for people who are too much money.
In the meantime, Sky and Channel 5, director David Elstein, who had given evidence to the Committee on Saturday, said that the BBC should audit Reithian's mission "information, training and entertainment".
The BBC said that some of the outputs were now classified as image education - it said that the TV output was %1 and the radio %0.1 - and that public services in Australia and Canada should be promoted and that this should be changed as "information, explanation and training".
As for the partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should only do something about a lawyer on TV about Proms, and cooperate with advertising publishers to ensure that the whole translation is monitored.
Sonogenetic enables the brain to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how they've changed their way when they've been hit by noise vibrations.
Scientists have developed tumors in genetically modified brain systems that can be controlled by sound waves.
The mini-impact curves are changing the way they've been hit with noise vibrations that people can't hear.
The vibrations are carried out by genetically modified motor neuron cells around the environment in a way that will move the harmful channels that lead to the waves.
Priority: Researchers lightly read and write brain activity
Researchers have said that insects have demonstrated the power of a new process called Sonogenetic; so ultrasonic can be used to activate a series of brains, heart and bone cells outside the body.
A researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla told Sreekanth Chalasani Guardian, California, that this process could take place one day in order to cure the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
They don't usually raise their voice to their ears, but they found that when they were surrounded by a fluid containing Chalasian microscopic acids, they found that they had a vein.
The earrings found strengthen the earphones and thus enable them to pass through the eardrums.
The reinforced third sound waves, which have been found in some of the corrugated cells, affect the structures called TRP-4 ion channels.
According to a report published in Nature Communications, sound waves allow these ion channels to be opened and activated by the cells they are connected.
In order to create control over noise curves, Chalasin has genetically changed the curves so that some motor neurons can move TRP-4 ions channels.
When applied to modified creatures, the sound waves were powered by micro-squares and flowed into the curves, and here they also operated modified motor neurons.
It's a process, it's a process where scientists find similarities to an external open-source device that enables people to operate and shut down their neurons with light titrations.
But Chalasani says there might be some advantages to this technology.
In addition to the light that should be sent to the point in the brain, the low-frequency sound surfaces can pass through the dot safely and thus be sent into the brain through the head.
Chalasani said, "We believe that the human neurons that have been targeted in the clinical environment for certain neurological treatments can be transmitted through a signaling signal using a gene therapy and a treatment virus."
He also added that other applications may be able to interfere with bone cells and insulin cells.
Or the outside torture team-- the full door of yours!
Advertising undermines England's arms trade
Watch the International Anti-Fraud Firearms video.
Terrible killer drones!
The pears that cut your foot!
A piece of heavy bombs!
And why the terrible pain, but unsatisfied electric shocks!
Inconsistencies and graphic films designed for the International Anti-Fraud, the Government of England is convinced that the world's largest arms race is a short deception by means of the International Anti-Fraud Defence and Security Group.
Front row: DSEI gun color: authority regimes attack London
But a different campaign continues with bus stops and posters on the subway trains and needs to look twice.
He says, using London Metro's fonts and brands to turn the DLR line into tank, "Are you going to travel to DLR between 15 and 18 calendars?"
This Sunday, a group of arms dealers will attack the DLR... and they want to help the customers stop this gunfire.
300 posters, one of the most famous artists at the Museum of Criminal Designs in Dismalland, Bansky.
It helped to distribute a collection of 6 £ and "the world's bus station has gained access to about three areas" which claimed "the Advertisement Region's Work Packages" to the Advertisement Region.
I wasn't happy with this part of the vandalism for London.
One of the ads was created by a collection of the Special Committees.
According to Gavin Grindon, a member of the University of Essex University of Designs, manufacturers become increasingly suspicious every day and they look for ways of moving political affairs outside the gates.
A lot of creative protest movements are moving with activists, and they begin to realize that they have to go to the real world to make their works impact on the community.
Another gun race against the posters is against those who travel on the subway.
The International Af Image video was watched over 100,000 on Facebook within 24 hours and was created by a free-of-charge VCCP advertising agency, and the soundwriter was also prepared with graphic designers.
VCCP Creator Manager Matt Lever was so surprised by the silence against the advertising of gun fairs -- taking away my ExCel calendar -- and he thought, "Let's see a campaign they've been trying to escape."
They've been playing with a more real, creative corporate advertising idea, but they've been hit by bright colors and animation, and they've been more attentive.
Tom Davies, from Af Örgüttütt, said: "We have been very helpful in creating concerns about the sale of extra-legal torture teams."
Now, we need the Government of England to stop the illegal sale of torture teams in front of our door.
Maybe it comes from ExCeL, the most creative station in the arms race, and it's here that designers sell fantastically rich products.
In a press release, Saab showed the U.S. Army's "AT4CS RS" driver.
This includes "a warhead that hits a big deal by an uneven form and target."
Whatever he's doing, that's not gonna be nice.
Eight-six rules of living in student places
It took 11 years when I was an unwed 19-year-old, and I still believe in male and female dignity, but now I remember the ridiculous smiles I've made about my frustrations -- and how many long-term complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be covered by eight rules.
Moving on to the earth can be viewed as a complete waste of raw materials.
From the beginning of the journey: where it is to people, where it's not missing a year, where it's going to take Corbyn, and why you're saying, "Don't even love Marmite, or hate it, because really gentlemen, it's only May I'm going to be in the room."
Take a breath.
And let the others take one, and ask questions and show you the light.
This will lead to conversation and help you to separate what you like from the people you do not talk to.
Leave the people a little space.
People's rooms are often turned into drinking receptions, cinemas, and mass reception points, but these are the same places where people dress and set up their internal rooms.
Secondary: Don't even think about starting a relationship with a university
Back in there, they're seeing bad guys at the university.
Your room may be a place of comfort, but it's a culture that develops between many local corridors, and it's open to friends, both animal, social and life.
It could be hell for someone who works for this energy storage.
There's nothing in culture that's gonna let you say, "I like you and I want our friendship to go on, but I need you to go a little bit, so I can take the energy I spend with you when I get in touch with you."
Try to tell your friend that you're tired of socializing and that maybe you're going to text instead of playing the door.
When he said to play the door, do it.
A friend in the student's home had made a policy as if the door wasn't locked.
He's seen a lot of things.
Don't make friends with the magic.
Since you've started to go to college in the midst of the mess of the food competition, it's less weird to get to know yourself by playing people's doors with a bag of brownie and less in the 1950s, "You're welcome to our meal, I've got something for you, and now I'll laugh when you ask personal questions."
It's a great way for people to make friends with the house-making screens.
Your friends will feel compelled to talk and may be able to contact your face with a lovely surprise.
It's obviously about being your last target.
The uncomplicated ball will be a cold, sugar and rain when you knock the door, it'll be the reason people sleep and dance.
It's a crime that's been found in the places where the food is being played.
I mean, it's an act of theft to raise someone's ass up, but do you want to take a couple of drinks for your tea?
Check the owner twice.
Even if she's face-to-face with a big deal, she'll tell you to look at her head.
It's very uncomfortable to play someone's stuff, and I understand you, but try to do this more in a way that's better than my friend.
She's shutting her down now.
Don't make people cry so they won't sleep or work.
It's not just being a right person, but because you're an English man in the gyms.
A girl in my corridor knocked on her neighbor's side of the street and said she had a few pieces of paper because she said the night was 3:00 and she was testing herself in the morning.
The response was even more open.
When they finally closed at 5:00 a.m., she opened her own music and closed the door and gave them a chance to follow for two hours before she went to her own three-hour test.
Isn't it romantic that your future wife moved to the same corridor with you?
On the other hand, would it not be strange to think that a corridor friend is a future wife, that you have to stick, separate and see her every day, and that you have to watch your partner be taken away?
Of course, that's true, but if it's not your neighbor's fire corridor, at least talk to him in the right direction.
When you realize that someone has left keys behind to lock the door, know that the line between the gossip and the abuse is lower than the line between the rape.
A good joke is fun, but it'll take time to get back.
You can give a valuable and fun lesson about keeping someone's stuff safe, but don't touch anyone's room with your teeth.
Lock your doors and lock your keys in a glass of water, but don't double-check your stuff.
Native meclis president for moving to the Netherlands
Arib, who played the highest in the fourth round of the election held yesterday in the Meclist, became the first president of the Dutch movement.
This will be done until 2017, with Fascism and Arib.
Arib, who has been appointed nationally since 1998, has also been the presidential head since 2012 but has not been elected.

The last offer came from Eskišehirspor to hope that the protests of the tribes, which did not conflict with G.SARAY's side of the game, would be the result of the immoral conduct of the tribes.
He missed this position. He wanted to get out of the game!
During Ryan Donk's transfer period, he also made the last name of Eskišehirsport for the military gorillas who wanted to join Kashimbasah.
But the red lists were answered by G.Saray's administration.
He's got his heart stopped when he's getting better.

Petrol companies have collapsed
From the year 2014, when oil prices began to fall, the most deep-water oil projects were cut off when we reached the end of the last year, with some 400 billion investments.
According to Wood Mackenzie's research, while low oil prices, oil and gas call/referencing/increasing production of $380 billion have been reduced from the Mexican Corps to Africa, and the production of electricity has been reduced to millions of dollars in a wide range.
As a major reason of the capital crisis, in 2014 it took place at a $115 level in 1.5 years, showing oil prices falling at the lowest level of 12 years and losing 70 percent in the year, showing the lowest level of oil prices.
$400 billion (U.S.)
Well, the oil prices went down 30 dollars every day when they made new surprises, and we finally saw the lowest level of the 12 years we spent.
The research published by Wood Mackenzie in the field of energy communication, which is being conducted by the "Peter's Now Empty Water" negotiations, suggests how the sector is affected by falling prices.
Finally, in a report published in Tammuz, the drop in oil prices of 200 billion dollars reveals where this figure has been reached by 2015 when Wood Mackenzie put it.
Therefore, since 2014 the total of 68 major projects has been completed in the last six months of 2015, 22 major projects have been completed.
The value of these projects is about $400 billion.
PAGE 2.9 MILLION
In a study of the alleged "no" impact of small oil prices on the company's plans, the most influential projects are deep sea development projects.
The projects that have been undertaken have been refurbished by a total of 27 billion barrels of oil, and by 2025, the daily production of 2.9 million barrels of oil has been restored.
According to the study, when most of the project's investment decisions were reached in 2017 and thereafter, the first production targets were recorded between 2020 and 2023 years.
Among the 68 projects in the past year, the estimated cost of $170 billion is estimated to have taken place in the next five years, "the majority of $170 billion is deep sea projects."
And that's why the investment is so high.
It is said that 70 percent of the deep sea costs create heavy oil projects in Nigeria, Angola and the United States of America.
According to the study, the most advanced oil projects are developed by countries in Canada, Angola, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Norway and the United States.
These six countries have almost 90 percent of their oil reserves.
Mozambique, Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia, with countries with the largest greenhouse gas reserves, together with 85 percent of the total.
While most of the species waiting to go out here are located in the deep sea, they need solutions such as complex and complex development, such as the formation of vertebrate (LNG) strains.
It is also stated that the companies that are at risk, the deep sea, the Canadian oil pipelines and the gas pipelines that are monitoring each other in the Hazard Region, have been trying to adapt to the "lower" oil prices scenario.
Gözler in Iran
Not long ago there was a table like this: the United States and Europe brought oil to Iran to stop Tahran's nuclear programme, the oil price was about $110, and Iran's oil supply was about to be questioned how to be forced to break into the prices without any delay.
When we get back this week, we're seeing a senate on the beach.
Petrol's prices have been under 30 dollars since 2004, and this is the main reason why production in the U.S. is spreading, and barriers to Iran are rising.
That's why the eyes are on Iran.
As Iran's oil supply increases, the oil market, which has already been claimed to be quite adequate, will be more oil.
This may be the reason why the prices are so surprising to us today.
Some analysts say that Saudi Arabia, who doesn't want to buy the market for Iran, will pump more oil and send a price war between Iran-S. Arabia.
I'm not sure what I'm doing is going on. Iran's main target is the rapidly growing oil market in India and Europe.
The Iranian authorities said in their previous statements that the first stage of the campaign was to increase 500 billion dollars a day and then spend as much time as possible on the market.
According to Reuters's map information, 22 large-scale oil carriers (VLCCs) are expected to have at least 13" full or large amounts of these are expected in Iran.
Iran has the largest oil reserves in the world.
As far as I'm concerned with the exception, Iran is carrying out approximately 1 million barrels of oil in some countries in Turkey.
Before I did it, Iran's daily oil supply went up to three million barrels a day.
The support for the Monetary Fund for Research, in the Moon Sky, raises a 20-dollar question: "Why is the loss of oil prices compounded by central global concern for growth in the economy's prices increases the decline in oil prices?"
In China, China, the world's largest oil producer, the world's largest oil producer, we see that this is still 20 percent of the oil's losses from the beginning of the year.
We can also be witness to purchases below 30 dollars in today's oil with the impact of the global pressure and the effects of the global gas problem.
As long as we don't see permanent bids on $32-33 levels, the oil may be limited in the rise movement and the downside pressure may increase.
At this point, it can be said that a key role is to keep the gap under control of the $30 level of criticism.
In such a situation, it should not be surprising that there are cuts of 23.30-25.60 in the area of support below.
Isham Sardouk says, "The angel has finished!"
When Victoria's Secret and the world's fashions were overestimating the trend of creativity at WGSN, why did you turn the route to Turkey?
- I'll always look at the change.
I was born in Paris, I lived in London, and I went to New York.
And there I've raised important positions.
In the meantime, I've been talking to Coton for the last two years.
And then I saw the potential in this photograph and in the Coton brand.
I realized that everything needed to be a store-in-the-world.
Now I'm here to make this happen.
Will you be able to do it in a short time?
- Absolutely.
Although it's already a brand, it's currently sold in 50 countries.
We're going out 50 collections a year, 15 separate sections.
I mean, there's everything you need to have in a store.
From Dubai, we can meet the needs of our customers in various photographs in Moscow.
Now, in March, we're opening a store in Paris, and it's the beginning of a new and exciting cycle...
Would you like to open a store in Paris?
- Yeah.
It's not because Europe's economic situation is a mess.
But you're opening some stores for pictures.
Paris, you'll have a store in fashion, like London, and you'll win the money from the Middle East.
One brand is needed for a brand that plays a prominent role.
So let's talk about trends...
- There's a very romantic, bright season in front of us.
They're flying phone clothes, soft tones, peppers, whites, reds.
Draw...
We're going through very difficult and painful times, and in these difficult times, the fashion world is always trying to maintain a healthy sense of happiness in life by carrying light and inner opening designs into its podium.
That's what we did.
That's why it's coming back in the new season.
Let's go back to Victoria's Secret years.
Who was the worst angel ever?
I'm not just talking about amazing physics: it's so positive, it's such a good girl!
As I was working, he sat next to me and said, "My dear, you're hungry."
He was so cute.
You know why I'm talking about it, and I've investigated it, and you've reported all Victoria's Secret Models.
How beautiful Caroline is, isn't she?
But Adriana Lima had a great influence on me with her beauty.
- Yes, yes, the sound!
That speech, that tone...
After a while, you say, "Sit down and be nice, and don't do anything else."
It's a brain.
That's right. Such shoes are living.
I've been reporting to Candice Swanpoel.
She was the best girl I've ever seen in my life, but I fell in love with her.
- Much like that now.
Not like the new angels.
I remember Giselle's turn, and...
It was hard to work with him anyway.
The bullet came, and he smoked like a snake.
Not because he's Tyrian.
No one's going to drink or one can drink!
It's meant to be 'diva'.
Victoria's Secret Prize, published two months ago, took the lowest rating in history.
Why are you?
- Like I said, it's over with that beautiful angel.
Who's gonna do Gigi Hadid?
What's nice?
Kendall Jenner, for example.
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Kate Moss's turn is zero, but it's the biggest name of fashion industry.
- Yeah, but how beautiful was his face.
I want to use my right of appeal here.
I've been reporting last year.
- The smoke, the drink, of course.
But there was such a beautiful face in the shower.
It was like Brigitte Bardot.
That supermodel reached the end of the cycle.
Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington...
Christy was next to me, and every morning I saw nothing bad.
Such a state of beauty can't be an advantage.
What about Cara Delevignne?
- He's losing himself.
Not even in every campaign.
People are dying.
There's no hunger for 'good models', no celebrity.
People want to see real faces like themselves in the campaigns.
We're gonna go over it, too.
Because that's the trend.
Letter from 25 author Turkey
According to BBC Turkey, the International Writers Unit (PEN) of England, Galleries and the Heads of Scotland also stated that the threat to their colleagues, journalists and publishers in Turkey has become part of the life that has become a reality.
In the letter, two attacks aimed at Turkey's Hurriet newspaper, led by the Koza Group's press, were handled by Vice News officials, and the arrests were among disturbing developments.
My mother had an argument about the right to work.
Turkey-Work "We think that mothers are given half a right to work so that breast-feeding can be restored."
When he said, "This trick may be a trap," the TSK said, "We're not worried about the women's work."
The new rights planned to bring forth to the workers of the membership and the female worker were passed from the Commission through the day-to-day discussions.
In the following six months, working time or free leave was the most common issue in the Commission's meeting of the arrangements that led to the first child's entry into employment until the first child was born, and the most frequent part of the day was "individual work".
The CHP Müzmir Mülltevek said, "If you bring a rental plan after this, we will be against the end."
While the Commission's meeting on the behalf of Turkey-Working Ennis Badajdajul, expressing similar concerns, said, "We have doubts about how the work of women will be completed in the mid-term."
According to the fact that the government's business will face new challenges when it comes to this issue again in the day, "We will therefore be concerned about the progress made with the private will offices."
If TSK Secretary General Bülent Pirler says that part-time work has been carried out for a period of 5 years, "there is no longer long-term part-time work in other countries."
And look at it like that.
He said, "In places where 1 or 2 employees have to think about the consequences of this application."
TOBB told President Ahmet Chağar that while the application was going through life, the worker found it difficult to survive.
Chağar, who said that there was no subject to the rules to be applied in the afternoon work, said, "If there is a special-skilled arrangement, there must be a gap between the employee and the manager."
Text Feejoule: We don't support it
Feezioglu's explanation is, "We don't participate in this announcement, we don't get involved and we can't support it."
Because there's no connection to the PKK.
You couldn't tell the PKK if we didn't have a set of terrorist attacks. You didn't put dust on it.
It's just the heavy statements that have been made in the government, and we don't see them seriously, and we don't find them.
We're lawyers, we're lawyers.
If there is a legal difference between those who represent the State, those who are responsible for it, and those who are responsible for it, and their security, we will follow it.
When we say, "Don't break the government," they attack us as "Partner, fascist".
When we say, "This government must act in accordance with the law, and the law must always prevail," they say, "You make divisions."
We're growing up.
We're always responsible for telling the truth.
A bomb bomb attack on Van
The event took place near Akkupru First and Middle School, which was located in the centre of Tishba at the Akkuprü Hall of the Centre at 20.45 p.m.

Who's the mountain?
The original name of Belgin was Bergen, born on 16 November 1960 in Mersin.
With the divorce of his mother and father, his mother moved to Ankara with Sebahat Cakr in 1966.
After the new Yunus Emre Ilkokulu, the Ankara State Conservatory entered the Piano section, but because of financial difficulties, he worked in PTT for a time.
In 1979, he accepted the offer he took to work at Feyman Night Club to have fun with his friends.
At Feyman Night Club, the Group Lokomotif orchestra also met with concerts of the Turkish Sanat Music, the Turkish Hafif Music and the mode of the cycle.
Bergen, who went to Adana after Ankara for work, met Halis Serbes here and married him a year later.
In 1982 he released the first "Var" from Atlas Plak.
Bergen, who did not rely on her husband’s violence as he got out of his life, often ran away from his wife.
When he was working in Izmir in October 1982, he was beaten and thrown in his face by his husband.
In this attack, the other song of Kengiz was confirmed by Özszeker, who lost his only eye and lost a large part of his body, Bergen, who later praised Kibariye after treatment.

They're going to be cut off with a bicycle
But because there is no agreement between two countries, the majority of Syrian migrants will have to return to Russia, this time in negative 20 degrees.
In the months of writing, a group of passengers, with a need to be safer and more flexible, flew to Russia and crossed north of the country from Murmansk to Norway.
Since the agreement between the two countries did not allow restrictions to be imposed, the exchange rate was exceeded by bicycles.
Norway has now decided to send these volunteers back.
As a result, Norway's security has been suggested that the bicycles that have been transferred to the limit should be fixed.
The "Turkey 3 billion" crisis in the EU
TURKYE is running a crisis of EUR 3 billion for migrants.
President Jean Claude Juncker, President of the European Union, led the European Commission to block the fund to be transferred to Turkey by Italian President Matteo Renzi.
Juncker pointed out that the EU has to find 3 billion euros, indicating that the spirit of Europe is not good between Italy and the rest of Europe.
Juncker, "It's not for Turkey's money for the Syrian militias in Turkey."
We haven't reached three million yet.
"It's a matter of the EU's reliability, and that's why it's important."
Juncker said he was expecting the money to be completed until 26 Ocak, the date that was given earlier.
Italy, when it comes to Turkey, is taking place among countries that take due care of the right course.
Diplomatic sources, when they see that the situation in the financial package of Rome is not really a threat to Turkey and that the EU Commission and some of the countries of the Union are involved in problems between Italy and Italy.
I've been living between Italy and the EU for a while.
During and after the last EU visit to Renzi, energy, banking and migrants, Germany's President Angela Merkel and the EU were forced to make it into a hard language.
Juncker, who added Renzi's comment at the press conference today, "You must stop accusing Renzi of the EU."
"Renzi, who I love very much, is wrong to lower the EU Commission on every occasion."
Juncker found Renzi playing in town.
The 3 billion euros promised to Turkey will be received from the US budget.
2 billion euros will be spent on the coins of the Member States.
Germany will provide at least EUR 427 million.
For political reasons, the Romanian Government, which has announced that it will not transfer money to Turkey, decided to transfer to the EU for the purpose of using the EUR 2.3 million that has been allocated to support the Map and Lübnan.
The source is expected to be used in the period 2016-2017.
I cried when I saw Chalie Hebdo cartoon
Father Abdullah Kurdi, who spoke to Agent Sputnik, the Russian official news agency, and said, "If you want the truth, I'm crying for this caricature."
He said, "I felt so bad."
After the armed attack, the French hicivist, Charlie Heddo, who was a symbol of freedom of expression, said:
Unfortunately, they've made a bad cartoon.
Everyone was so sad about this monster.
He's a 2-year-old boy and he's dead.
I was supposed to respect Aylan and my family, Charlie Hebdo, but it was different.
This report should show respect for the dead children.
The Prophet has been published with disrespect for our master.
And they spread abroad lies against Allah.
It is a small thing for God and His Messenger to have a son.
Kurdi, who lives in Erbil, made this call: "I will call all the world and the world, and all the children who die must be honored."
They should not be grieved by the pain of their families.
She was one of those who were still living in Kurdi, Canada, and Tima Kurdi, who showed a karachi attitude.
Laurent 'Riss' Sourisseau is one of the poets in Germany when the three-year-old Syrian Islan Kurdi, who shot the dead body in a signed cartoon, was raised.
Last year, when Mr. Muhammad published the cartoons, the French museum historian Charlie Heddo, who was the victim of an attack by 12 radicals, was still a member of the debate room because of the cartoon he had about the Islan Kurdi.
In Karikatür, Germany's capital city, Koln, was described as being in the women's tacits during the year of the celebration, as well as in the women's tacits, who were calling the women's dolls and the immigrants.
It's actually part of a 4-carica column, which is caused by different levels of social media.
It's written on the column "it's not French" and, according to a lot of reading, it's becoming increasingly hostile with other values that have been attributed to France.
On the other hand, the caricature still caused a lot of people to blame Charlie Hebdo for stealing.
The story of Charlie Hebdo, also known as Germany, who accepted 800,000 diplomats last year, has added to the demand for the doors open to French immigrants.
When it was said that "He was very close to the Agency," he wrote "Two children's menu at a price" in the advertising section.
The Germans who died in Sultanahmet in Germany
According to news published on the website of Der Spiegel's weekly report, the German Federal Guard decided that 10 people who had died in the attack would be brought to Germany.
The funerals of the dead will be carried out by a plane belonging to the German Air Force today or tomorrow in the country and in the air.
In Germany, experts from the Commission for the Identification of the Federal Criminal Authority (BKA), which is responsible for criminal proceedings, are going to countries where they are responsible for the deaths or attacks of German citizens.
But Der Spiegel wrote that this time the situation would be different.
According to the report, officials from the Federal Criminal Administration have applied to the Turkish authorities for identification of the dead and for the occupation of the victims in Istanbul, but the Turkish authorities have not accepted this proposal.
The Federal Criminal Service has sent four experts to Istanbul following the Istanbul attack.
The seven wounded in the attack are in the German tourist hospital.
Ellen Meiksins Wood lost his life
Meiksins Wood, a well-known political theologian and socialist historian, took into account their important work on the roots of capitalism.
In 1942, Latvia's native Meiksins Wood published in Turkey, which was born in New York: Escape from class -- Capitalism Background Culture -- Capitalism Against Democracy -- Capitalism Coke -- The Empire -- Back to March
The law of gravity's move to the ground
According to the German press report, social workers in the country will be reporting that the message is understood by asylum seekers.
Markus Schnapka, a social security officer who reported that a number of people who were involved in WDR's statement did not want to punish innocents for their conduct, said they were informed in three languages about the values that were important to the population in Germany.
Schnapka also added that Germany's values of gender equality are not being debated, and that every kind of attack and punishment will be punished.
On the other hand, the Carnival crossings in Cologne are likely to cause carnival crossings in Rheinberg.
Second, he was told that the carnival transition was canceled because there was no guarantee of survival.
What are the benefits of getting drunk?
It's becoming popular in the field of air pollution technology, which is a technique that does not kill vitamins and minerals.
It's been hundreds of years since the most highly preferred drying techniques in the Far East have made drying, metabolism strong, and facilitating concentration.
The bacteria and microps that are found inside the bones, which are completely removed from the environment, are also completely dead.
The protein inside the skin, such as cellulose and nitrogen, is completely absorbed by this technique, and this makes food easier to eat.
Do not sink into a storm which happens in minute press; it is carried out inside the core by means of a windmill or a windmill.
The amount of water and drying used in high pressure is less than the amount of water used.
This can be shown as the best example of a wet tire.
In particular, it is important to wait for well-stamps to be carefully cleaned and then put into the filter.
A deep glass is filled with water in a three-room area and is placed in the windscreen window.
Tenseren's mouth is left shut.
So the wind gets out of the window with ease.
The light fire is first brought to the highest level by bringing water to the water source and then by bringing it to a lower level.
For about 10 to 15 minutes, the eggs and the fats are controlled by means of a catheter after they are well fed.
What's wrong is that you're getting a lot of chocolate and you're doing a lot of work on tobacco.
The appearance, color, and taste of the skin in the wind is not changing, and this approach is healthy.
You're going to have the same taste of your own food.
So the quality and pleasure of your food will not be compromised.
At the same time, one of the most economic methods of cooking is in coal, and the loss is at least at the lowest level.
And there will be a welcome welcome visit to them, for the sake of living and living things in the garden.
In particular, this method is often preferred because it is often used in diets.
David Bowie - Blackstar: The "son" album
We know you're going to die; to do that last album before you tell anyone about it, to make your bed of death, to make you a artistic expression in the clip...
It's like this; we can look more like flying for worldly fans.
I'm calling worldly fans because I'm among those who believe that the man who does this is immortal and distant.
From the other side of the universe came the Earth; now back to its own anathema, which is the same thing.
It came because only Kiss, Marilyn Manson or Lady Gaga had a spirit that needed to be given to all the world's artists.
He's done his job properly.
David Bowie, Blackstar, iTunes price: 9.99 TL 5/5
He probably got rid of Warhol, Kubrick, from the same planet.
When Apollo 11, Ay, he decided to say, "It's something I'm supposed to do," and he met us by saying, "Space Oddity."
Actually, he didn't disagree; he's always taken a few steps ahead.
A lot of people have found ways to lose him.
And listen to the music...
It would be wrong to say "only music" for music if we leave it to plastic works.
The characters that come from the music and create the impressions, their sending, their novelty, their imagination, and their imaginations are a universal expression for me.
I can't think of myself as the father of glam rock or the cousin of punk...
So, what happens to that adventure electronic movement that has been in love since she was a child?
David Bowie reminded us of what the word means to the years we've been avoiding the "icon" barrier.
He wasn't a man, he wasn't a woman, he wasn't a man.
It was a body.
He's been looking at us for a while for a mission.
That's the body; the 26th studio album was released "Blackstar" two days after it was released.
Before my album was published, we heard "Blackstar" and "Lazarus" trying to get us to go.
We thought, "He's dead now and he's talking about death," and he understood everything.
One more game...
The message and the feeling of my album was published much earlier than "Blackstar" and "Lazarus", but it was re-registered for this album, "Sue in A Season Of Crime", "'Tis A Pity She Was Was A Whore" when the album was released.
The rest, I mean, "Girl Loves Me", "I Can't Give Everything Away" and "Dollar Days" are very good songs.
When we look at it all, it's built on a very powerful musical structure, but it's just like "Blackstar" made of such an inner, mental feeling...
Neither death nor a history-counting album...
It's just a real "son" album.
"The End" is the writer of a music life that has reached the end from the beginning.
Turkey was targeted at Sultanahmet attack
In a program attended by President Holger Münch German for the first time at the ARD, Germany's Federal Security Council, on Saturday in Sultanahmet, Germany, he was told that he had lost 10 German citizens' lives.
Münch said the target of the attack was not German soldiers, but Turkey.
"400 KIDS TO ME"
But Münch pointed out that Sultanahmet's attack did not change the threat of terrorism in Germany, he said, "We are still under a serious threat."
Münch pointed out that the number of people who went to Syria to participate in the ISIS from Germany was a decrease in the number of people who returned from war zones.
Münch, who said that this was a major breach of security teams, said, "There are almost 400 dangerous people we should not keep in my custody right now."
Münch called for better coordination between police organisations in Europe and for closer communication.
The Turkish authorities indicated that the live bomb, which was responsible for the Sultanahmet attack on Syria and the ISIS, had not yet been identified by the attacker's identity.
He salutes you at Aksu's stage.
The 40th year of the series of concerts, Sezen Aksu, grew in love with the "Sezen Years" concert that he gave in the evening at Volkswagen Arena.
The first section of the concert series, which was organized in the month of Tammuz, was held in the Volkswagen Arena from 15 to 16 October.
At the Aksu concert, all the audiences have been on a 40-year journey from today to today.

In Ankara and Istanbul, 25 rounds came
In Ankara, at today's rate, 250 grams of milk was sold from 1 TL.
A new year ago, especially in the middle of the month, the words "the end will come" were in the form of the phrase "no time" in the form of the golden, gold, and silver, and the Ticaret Buffin.
However, in Ankara, 250 grams of milk was sold from 1 TL yesterday.
President Halil Ibrahim Balczy, of Turkey's 25-year-old association, said: "The deadline has not been set, the tariff decision has been applied two years ago," and added:
"This was a tariff decision taken two years ago."
The Esnaf Chambers Unit set this rate two years ago.
A prize in Turkey.
I mean, there was a new interview and it wasn't going to be a price increase.
But it's because of recapitalism that in some regions of Ankara, he's been selling 75 trolls.
In some areas it was already sold to 1 TL.
On the contrary, he didn't have to pay for his dinner. They're gonna have to apply 1 TL now.
No more or no more.
They're meeting an unapproached price.
"In the first half of 2016, the price of the egg will certainly not exceed 5 TL and we will complete this year's price if we don't live in a lot of trouble."
In some areas, Istanbul has begun to sell to 1.25 TL.
That's when the terror hit Burkina Faso.
In the West African country of Burkina Faso, 23 people from 18 different countries lost their lives in the attack of a single hotel, known to be preferred by foreign and United Nations officials.
The attack was carried out by El Qaide's North African arm.
The attack in Burkina Faso occurred four days after the terrorist operation of the ISIS, with 250 million troops, most of the world's Muslim country of the world, organized by the Prime Minister of Indonesia in Cakarta.
Foreign embassies, luxury hotels, and stores were in a labor camp at Starbucks headquarters and at the police point of day-to-day bombings and armed assaults; a Canadian and Indonesian lives were lost.
The Indonesian authorities explained that the attackers had been inspired by the Paris Catholic Church on 13 November.
The British BBC television's security director Frank Garner noticed that this action was part of a scary training that has been shown in many parts of the world in recent times.
The U.S. has recently burned his blood.
Early in the Middle Ages, 14 people were killed in a gun attack designed by the ISIS in San Bernardino, California, U.S.A.
Attack on the United States' San Bernardino
In Sultanahmet, 10 German tourists died following a live bomb attack by German Indians Thomas and Maizere, and many places around the world, "We have lived in Paris two major attacks."
If we say that, then the terror will be won...
We used the word "not to step back."
Whatsapp talking about the abandoned Alawi application
According to a new report, terrorism is using its own means of communication to establish free of charge such as ISIS, WhatsApp and Telegram.
Defende One's report suggests that he's using a new message to communicate with each other.
This "Arawi" Android application is distributed and loaded in the form of a APC file.
The application is aware of the encrypted message and media sharing.
Download a flash from the ISIS in Iraq
The application's activity is "slow" against popular applications, such as WhatsApp and Telegram, according to the Ghost Security Group.
The power of the encryption is now unknown.
IT WAS the first time that I was able to deliver all my messages to a Telegram that allows me to send messages over encrypted connections.
However, the Telegram was able to produce the channels that the members of the ISIS were talking about.
In addition, the U.S. administration requests that the doors be placed behind applications from application developers.
That's why the treasure is now beginning to use its own solutions instead of trusting whatsApp and Telegram encryption.
UAEA: Iran's agreement with nuclear power

How should half-smokers be valued?
How should the students evaluate half-calculation?
For semi-trailers only; listening, playing, television and computers should not be allowed to spend time and be considered.
Half the talent; it's a very important opportunity to prepare for the new course and explore the past cycle.
A half-tial, called free time, is also an important opportunity for people's development, information, taste and taste.
Make an appropriate evaluation list.
Write everything you plan and try to apply.
I'm sure you'll enjoy this, and you'll have a very generous holiday period.
Now let's talk about how a data-sharing period is for students who are preparing the YGS-LYS.
Because most of our friends who are prepared for YGS-LYS trials are asking us the most questions: "How should we evaluate this cycle, how should we solve a lot of questions, or do we have extra issues to deal with?"
Let's write down some tips with friends who are willing to answer these questions and make a given period.
We're trying to complete this in more than one year, when the preparation process is going to be a period that starts under normal conditions from the 9th grade, and it's forced us to spend the last year more actively, data and time in the right way.
At the same time, the last class student needs to carry out school writing work at the same time in the preparation of the test.
Even if the student completes at least 1 test (YGS-LYS) and has been tested, it is also critical for him for the year when the message student prepares the test again.
Because most of the message's students and their family are looking forward to the last chance of the year, and this brings more stress.
It's a job to work; it's a job for a student who doesn't take pleasure, it's just because he's feeling strong, and it's usually because he's always giving up his job, but it's a job for those who're doing it, who's doing it, who's doing it, who's doing it, who's doing it, who's doing it, who's doing it, who's doing it, who's doing it, who's doing it, who's doing it, who's doing it, who's doing it, who's doing it, who's doing it, who's doing it, who's doing it, who's doing it, who's doing it, who's doing it, who's not doing it, who's just doing it, who's just doing it, who's doing it, who's not, who's just doing it, who's just doing it, and who's doing it, who's gonna to feel it, and who's getting it, and who's gonna to feel it, and who's gonna to make it, and who's gonna get it, and who's gonna get it, who's gonna get it, and who's gonna get it, who's gonna get it, who's gonna to get it's gonna get it's gonna to get it's gonna to get it's gonna to get it.
Now we have half the talent, and we have to appreciate it in the best way.
And for that, there must be a plan to make us manage our time well.
Average years in full - time ministry:
Everyone needs to plan their own situation first.
On the 1st day, what's done, what's gone wrong; day, week and 15 days should be planned.
Within this period, there must be repeated and questionnaires.
At the same time, students who do not have a good score can do an average test 1-2.
Your Excisive Affairs: Research; 75 percent of what people learn is a week, 66 percent a day, 54 percent a day, and one hour.
It's the best and most effective way to get rid of forgetting.
In particular, students who make too many mistakes in the past should stress their efforts in general.
Introduce your special matters, and plan day-to-day, and place your affairs day-to-day.
This planning will ease you both academic and psychologically.
Make sure that the most mistakes you make when you place them on your plan.
Because in the future, you're not going to be a long-term holiday.
Enter question resolution:
It's very important to resolve the matter until we do it again.
Because we can see how far we're going to go, but we can see how far we're going to go by asking questions.
Don't forget to set a number of questions every day.
The number of questions you're going to solve may vary according to the work you're going to do on that day; you can't solve a lot of questions on the day you've worked hard, but at least we need to do some sort of question-solving work there, to see how much we know about that day.
Tests Resolution:
Another job you're going to do in half a year's term has to solve the tests.
As long as it's not over, at least you can do the test tests.
So let's say you've made Turkey a great deal of training, and you can solve Turkey's 40-questioned training trials.
And even if you're doing it, do it for a while.
40 Turkish question, if you can solve it in the first 60 minutes, then you can solve it in less than a few minutes.
Tali & Hobi Plan:
In other words, it's not just teaching, but you have to divide for a few days for a holiday, a rest and a hobby.
It's just that you're going to be out of your schedule and slow down your rest.
So there must be a special time for you to separate yourself from your plans.
Reading books, watching television, surfing on the Internet may be among your plans, but the most important thing is how long you will be apart.
I'm going to have a little advice for friends who said I didn't spend the first time.
If it wasn't my first time, it wasn't very good, I didn't work very much, and if you say too much of my ex-boyfriends, it's a great opportunity for you too.
But first you have to decide and believe it.
Turkey's football superseded between 76 and 90 minutes in the 2009-2010 season.
Now, you answer the question you're asking and you're going to the gym, or the game's still going on, and you're gonna shoot a lot of minutes?
I don't think anyone wants to say, "We'll watch the games in front of us."
The only thing you're gonna do now is leave the past and look forward to, not running.
We'll collect what we say:
( 1) Plan a half-calculation plan,
( 2) Do what you know is right and do it again.
You've done your best.
4) And resolve the issues,
( 5) Solve the trials,
( 6) Read and study the Bible.
7) Set new goals for the new stage,
(O Prophet), set aside time for yourselves and your possessions and for that which you have been given.
And set aside time between your family and your friends.
10) Share time in social and cultural activities (synema, sports, theatre, concerts, trips, picnics, etc.)
'Kervan' has gone long.
Each average of 45 metrics and 45 metrics, one of the largest "home" stores in Turkey, joined the company of Kervan, the founder of Cheinas Demirel and his son Hasan, who had 25 stores in 17 houses in 17 houses.
Recently, Kervan also owned 17 Home Sweet Home store outside of the house with a complete operation.
"Now we're going to run a bigger store with Kervan, a smaller store with Home Sweet Home."
"Kervan will be opened out of the house," he said.
The 2015 Cyrus home Sweet Home, 50 million lira, has a total of 90 million litres of beer and 90 million litres of beer, which are produced by Kervan.
The total sales area of Kervan, 35 years old, has a capacity of 45 yards [45 thousand meters].
The 25 stores belong to the parent company.
I want about 500 people in Kervan.
Home Sweet Home has 17 stores outside 25 houses, and the total shopping area is 6 000 meters away and 320 people work.
"We have come into the sector in 1998," he said. "We are happy to be able to do this in 1998."
Since the beginning, we've had a brand with the support of Chinese Members.
The truth is, the truth is, this sector's 'TRT'.
We've learned a lot from him.
We even started our first step into the store by giving us his Ac Centre store.
We've been working as a strategic partner, not as a match with Kervan.
He said, "Now it's going to be a very serious synergy with this alliance."
Last month, he explained that Home Sweet Home now has 17 stores outside of the country, and that they have also started moving to China.
"We opened our first corner in Shanghai."
We've agreed to a 200-storey ring.
"And then we're going to develop a small store with Home Sweet Home as a big store outside of the house as Kervan."
He sells his factory in Poroshenko Russia.
Roshen CEO of Vyacheslav Moskalevsky, who reported on the Liga.net news site on the matter, said the factory was sold for $200 million.
Moskalevsky, "Yes, we went to the factory."
He said, "It does not go out, and all the true receivers are gone."
As for the price of the company's factory located in Lipetsk, Russia, Moscow said, "we've appointed about 200 million dollars."
Each year, 450,000 tons of chocolate and sugar are produced by Roshen, one of the world's largest producers, and the Ukrainian President, Peter Poroshenko.
The star Holding went outside the platform.
Star Holding gathered global companies that were active in the sectors of beer and chocolate that were purchased under the name "Pladis".
De Met's, Godiva, United Biscuits and World Trade Marks were born into a new chain of $5.2 billion.
In a meeting on the integration of global companies in the World of the Year, President Murat Lander said, "Our goal has been to be a global company for the first time" and added:
Murat Läker published 335 million lira sales live from Periscope
This company, built 72 years ago, is now developing to become a global brand and global company under the name of Star Holding.
In the meantime, we grew up in villages of the Ambaya, in private view and in various numbers.
We're at 77 factories operating in 14 countries, with 300 brands.
Länder, who said that Star Holding has created "a loving family of 50 thousand people," said, "Now that we look back on our family's opportunities, we want to focus on our mother's work and be global in this area, we are reorganizing it," and he said:
The life story of Sabri Bey's father
We reassess our company, we reorganize it.
We have divided the world into regions.
And we shared these areas with our CEOs.
Mehmet, Muhammad and Jeff will be our CEOs.
Mehmet Tuesday, Central Turkey, K. Africa and the Turkish Communities.
Mohamed Elsarky, a member of the United States and Japan around our global Godiva work.
Jeff van der Eems will be responsible for England, Qatar and Africa.
I'll be able to call it a kalith and innovation band, as Ali Lüker delivers a global message on his own, and Cem Karakaş will help me with my work.
China, part of Russia, we will re-establish South East Asia and develop areas.
Murat Ulker sold his hat at SAF GYO
His words, "We are happy for the whole world in every press," said Murat Läker, "the name of our global firm, which we have built to make."
"If you say where you created the Pladis, that name has no special meaning," he added:
They call it Maya.
Japanese Subaru, Pervin in Iran.
In Arabic, we were inspired by the name of the seven-star Pleiades of the Pleiades Group of Stars, who came to the World Council.
So we translated the Nassian world globally.
As Vice-President Ali Läker, co-operation with laboratories in various countries, the Star Holding Management Foundation also launched an "innovative synergy in innovation" and added:
We have very valuable AR-GE teams, and we've got these teams working on an AR-GE platform, bringing them together.
We have 27 names under Pladis. We have the Ar-GE center.
These are the biggest in Turkey and England.
Our dear AR-GE agent works here for 300.
They're even starting to give the results.
The digestives draw (Nibbles) created in the country's chocolate factory in Silivri, which is to start the war on England.
Another example of scenario: Marks are different but products are the same country of Krispi.
We have won our country under the name of the country of the World of Crispie Trottique, by adjusting the product of Jacob's Crinklys, in a short time.
Laviva, whom we all know, met with fellow Americans today.
Call of Duty series exceeded 250 million limit
This series of events, Infinity Ward, Treyarch and Sledgehammer games are known as the world of gold letters, seems to be unforgettable for many years.
In particular, there is strong evidence of how detailed we should find the new sales figures.
The Activisation, which is in the hands of the series's license rights, has shown 250 million copies of the order that he has participated in at the end of the year.
In the beginning of last year, the company that shared the sales of the entire series was able to sell 75 million more people called Call of Duty.
If we're making a lot of this number, we're not making a lot of mistakes.
Once more General President-in-Office has been elected
He was elected President Kemal Kölczdağdål, again in the Curulta.
Kłączdağlu, who played 990 of the 238 delegates using the moon, became the new president.
Of the games used, 248 were invalid.
After the final statement, the parties were happy.
A total of 275 delegates from the CHP were present.
Kurultay finished his work on meeting at 10 a.m. on Sunday.
He specifically said:
We'd like to play games here and tell you the turquoise.
But it's not open to the point we're here.
There's a truth in Turkey that doesn't control it.
The atmosphere that's happening is driving them all down.
The reason for the Karamsar table is that they manage the country.
As CHPs, wherever you come from, whatever you come from, we're against.
Terror is a human sin, and terrorists must never be forgiven.
It's done with intelligence and intelligence, it's done with poison.
Of course we're fighting, we want no one's eyebrows.
What's the difference between the photos in Syria, the photos in Lebanon, the photos in the South?
They made serious mistakes while sitting on the table.
The blood of the eagle, the eye, the whole body of the dead.
In 2002, they received the country with zero terrorism, and today there is a Turkey that has become bloodthirsty.
Who is responsible for this?
Is the cab driver in the diarbakara?
What's he paying Turkey for?
We're going to attend the meetings as a whole, and we're going to talk about changing laws.
We won't let anyone build a country on personal meetings.
I say, "Let's change the working spirit."
In the morning, their homes are being closed, and they are being taken into custody because they have made their views clear.
We also have ways we don't participate, but people should be able to express their thoughts freely.
The dictator says, "He eats the government's bread and hates the government."
And I want to ask him, why didn't those who benefited from all the government's opportunities even think about it?
The biggest change in the CHP is the country's party.
We'll always prepare for my fourth major revolution.
Whatever the case, we will bring this country a democracy of freedom.
They can arrest us, they can take care of us, they can do whatever they can, no matter how difficult it is, this country will bring freedom from the CHP.
I'm calling you clear, David.
Keeping behind the law of work, the man who kept it didn't put his mind on the job.
You gave him a gift of service.
What work are you talking about?
Let's go back to fool the people.
The party's officials were running another three revolutions: the creation of the community at the 1st of the Great Revolution and the creation of the community at the 1st century; the departure of many parties from the single party period of the Second World Revolution; and the transition to social democracy by the 3rd century Bülent Ecevit...
He has qualities and responsibilities.
There's a boss's food in the 103rd table.
We know how important it is to the Namus and the honor of this community.
If a person goes out and gives this word, he'll make it his death.
'Cause namous and honor won't work for us.
The man who's a dictator's breaker means you're respectable and self-esteem.
What do you know about honor and honor, why did you make this oath?
What does that mean to you?
I want to know that.
A religious man has a reputation for honor and honor.
Their purpose is not to remove labour law, but to judge labour law.
They don't have enough. They want the presidential system.
How's the president; the boss's presidential system.
Why are you rejecting Osmanley's parliamentary system?
A man will do his duty.
Are parliamentarians working well in Turkey?
No, it's not working.
If we bring free democracy, the system works.
They call it work, but they strengthen their work law.
Mustafa Balbay, the nationalist of Izmir, explaining his reputation for the general presidency, failed to compete because he did not collect the signature of the 128 delegates required for the appointment.
Balbay, who can collect 92 signatures, said, "I can't make a difference in the circumstances."
The National Party Meclisi (PM), the Centre for Conduct (MYK) and the members of the former CHP Leader of the Sea of Baikal were also given the opportunity to sit in clubs with the parties.
Instead of sitting in a place separated for the people, the Istanbuln national leader sat next to the President-General Kłączdağlu.
Yalova was also one of the subjects discussed in the institute's class at the meeting with Muharrem Ince, Kłąçdağlu.
In fact, he explained that he did not accept that he had been invited to become a PM member.
But from the general city sources, it was said that the request for a meeting came from India and that the PM was not proposed.
In fact, he shared his message from Twitter, "Whoever can learn from the Istanbul People's Ali Özcan from these general city sources, the content of the meeting."
And he said, "How can I know if two people met?"
It's like, "He's gone."
It's hard, it's hard to get used to it.
On the first day of the "Democratic, Change and Brotherly Rule" that took place, the party meccal (PM) classes were shot.
He started working for the PM list when he went to his later house to talk at the office.
While preparing the 100 key lists, it was learned that the existing members of the MYK, who did not want to take place in my administration, were told that Yakop Akkaya, Sencer Ayata, and Ercan Karakaş, who are also known as PM, would be on the list, calling their 13 MYK members out of the Eryhan Erdoğdu.
It indicates that 100 people on the PM key list can be identified to another expanded list.
In a report on 21 assets accepted in the CHP Kurulta, the removal of the drought on the European Regional Government's daily dispute with DTK was requested to increase its share of land.
The report also set out the objectives of "the end-of-party government", "the establishment of a government that can be calculated"
Kurultay, Vice-President-General of the AK Party, has been watching Mr. Ruhsar Demirel from HDP, Mr. Idris Baluken from the MHP.
The AK Party has left the hall on the arrest of President Erdoğan.
He said, "I can't accept it."
In the hall, the journalists who took photos of Can Dündar and Erdem Güll took note of the poster, which was written by Kurt, Turkey, and the English-speaking "Barsh".
In the mornings of July, the group of Yorum and Ahmet Kaya began singing.
President Baro Baro's wife, who survived the armed attack, received a message from the Turkish Ambassador's wife.
Beckin's mother, Elvan's mother, and Sami Elvan's father, joined them.
It was the most popular part of the conversation, which said they'd have to pay whatever bet they had to pay.
To date, 34 of them have been collected at the CHP, which is 52 to be 18 to be extraordinary, and 53 to be held in Ankara Arena yesterday.
My partner's high.
There were more than 15 CHPs in the 12,000 colloquial room.
But there was no excuse for the majority.
The most exciting time was when Külçdoröğlu's wife, Selvi Kłădádöğlu, joined the hall.
He was excited, and he continued to say hello.
There was no lack of discipline in the AK Party building in the hall.
There was a great movement in the area in the area of Arena's area, even when she was talking to her mother-in-law.
Obviously, the CHPs, party managers and journalists who wanted to join the Party preferd to call for support.
One CHP manager tried to explain that the situation was not bad by saying, "It's good that parties who think it's a party meeting in Korea or the Soviet Union can't sit down and do nothing."
There's another difference between the CHP facility, the AK Party or the MHP facility.
Only the general presidents speak in these parties.
The CHP is also a platform where party issues are discussed.
The number of parties that wanted to talk at the day's facility was increasing, and it was difficult to adjust the period of President Dian Murat Royalis.
There was also a saying in the hundreds and in the languages, "The country is going bad," as well as in the words, "You're changing the style of going out of this room now."
All of the CHPs, if they said, "Let's do something," they didn't have a strong answer to the "What to do" question.
It's a big effect that no choice will be made in the next four years.
When we went out to the blackout, we were waiting for the press to answer the question, "What should we do?"
He said, "What's going on?"
He took note of the issue of the media, the fact that the media, the academics, the residents of the South, have been paying attention to the fact that foreign policy is entering.
He has long been referring to "unless party", "supports", "participating parties" such as the "Adoluts" party.
"What to do," she tried to put "strategy" in place instead of talking about some of the things she had to do."
He pointed out that all of these problems could be brought to justice with a stronger democracy.
He also made a promise on behalf of the CHP, and he said, "We'll do whatever we can until we bring democracy."
He said, "We'll fight death for democracy."
One last note; it should be remembered that the CHP has dealt with the "organisation" issue in the course of its 53rd session, and that it is now able to collect it without problem.
At the same time, a card was printed for 900 journalists who said they would follow the institution, but the journalist's participation in the hall wasn't at that level.
Neither did the Ankara representatives of media organizations want to follow up on the facility until the AK Party was established.
Authentication requested
The 4th Criminal Court, which has been prepared for 7 seconds with 3 arrests by the Public Prosecutor, has been approved.
In India, the PKK/KCK has been described as being made under the name of the "administrative" in some of the rivers and areas of the "administrative" in the name of the top-level managers of the PKK/KCK earthquake in Istanbul, Shrön, Mardin, Mush, Hakkari.

We've been hit by an impostor with the ISED
The conflict between Syria, Düden, and Kara Mezra, which is facing the Kilis, continues to be intensified between the Fethith Army, which has been brought to an end in the Kara-Mezra District of Kara.
The voice of weapons and aircraft fired during the talks between the UN and the UN at the border, which is close to the border, is also heard by Turkey.
The presence of high-level tsunamis from regions where frequent explosions occurred in Turkey has led to a rapid increase in security forces across the border.
From the eighth floor of the ISIS military's investigation, the town of Meheit Mehmet border Karakolu was set on fire near the village of Kilis, near the village of Yavuzla.
On that occasion, the soldiers encountered an obese and heavy weaponry in the area where the fire of the Tatar was burning.
According to the report, Russian warplanes were launched an attack on the Hamein village, 17 kilometers away from Turkey.
Six Syrians injured in the air bomb were brought to the Killis State Hospital for treatment by their neighbors.
Loto took the bait of the rich
Robinson, who lived in a small house in Munnessee, in Munford's province of Tennessee, had a loan of $328.8 million over a 29-year period, preferring to receive a single payment of $328 million (about $1 billion) instead of a total of $128.8 million in 29 years.
Both said, "There's no guarantee of tomorrow, though."
John Robinson, who worked in a store complex, and his wife, Lisa, who worked as an assistant at a dermatologist, said that even though they were now a millionaire, they would be at the top of their business day.
Both aim primarily to pay home credit and help their neighbors with their money.
It was explained that the Great Ikram was divided into three parts.

FedEx's income is going to fall in 2016.
For three months, FedEx has reported the consequences of misgivings, and the burden debt has reduced the demand for cargo services and the increase in land services.
The company also said it was planning to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for tickets.
Last year, FedEx announced that 50,000 seasonal workers would be hired for tattoos.
Nearly %2.5 in the pre-opened process 45 minutes before the launch date ends on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. In May of this year's end, he said he was expected to win between $10.40 and $10.90 in the final financial year, which was expected to be less than 20 percent lower than the previous estimates.
Analysts were waiting for $10.84 on the basis of a FactSet study.
4 Although it is likely that the average will be above the level of 4.9 and that the heavy or large packages will start in November, it is likely that the average will rise to 4.9.
According to the company, the capital caps are higher and the winners are expected to be even higher than the previous year because of the increase in e-commerce.
The president and CEO Fred Smith said that the company has demonstrated a healthy performance in spite of the fact that it is expected to be a global economy."
A day later, the UPS company was able to draw up their plans, so the same number of years ago, the UPS said it was planning to hire 90,000 or 95,000 extra workers.
31 August, in three months' time, FedEx won 692 million dollars a year, according to the previous year, 692 million dollars.
Hesse, who won, Zacks Investment Research, took place in $2.44, at $242 level, of the 12 analysts who were found by the research.
The next five percent increase, $112.3 billion.
Six analysts from Zacks were waiting for $112.23 billion.
FedEx, the nation's previous year's prime minister, got a job from returning to the prime minister, and that's why there's been an explosion in the Express unit.
But the explosion of the translator's trade has raised the results of the FedEx Earth Services.
In the last few years, local services have increased by 29 %, but the business income has been based on large packages and high prices in the internal repository.
When high-ranking employees came to work in charge, they saw a high-ranking express of high-ranking events.
About an hour before the opening, FedEx's feelings turned into $13.85 or $2.5 by $11.15.
On Saturday, they closed down by 17% under the record rate of 11th and 11th of the year in Haziran.
At the most expected meetings for years, Federal Reserve Policymakers decided that this week a 27-year-old Honduran will not be able to spend two days on the table, spending nearly ten years on the increase of the season.
It will be a wall of the United States of America, a two-storey meeting room located on a corner of the Central Bank.
Don't remind me of the fact that the map's woman president, Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues kept their national economic outputs on everything else.
The Central Bank has two responsibilities from Congress: to make the U.S. will at the highest level and to keep the prices stable here.
However, since the Great War, Fed has acknowledged that it is a third venture that has not been written by the leaders of the world.
And this third campaign may be an X factor in a close-up decision that has not been expected since the end of 2008 of the United States economy to be notified of a recent phase-by-fashioned disaster.
Although most data may show that the economy is growing in a healthy way, the latest theft in the global financial markets can still lead to more attention given to Fed's members, the reference federal background figures - even less than one percent - in the case of increased corruption.
"It's going to be the first and most important thing they're watching about the market for open labour and inflation," the union firm Staffel Nicolaus & Co's chief economist Lindsey M. Piegza said.
He said, "But I think if they're looking for a cure to prevent it, it will provide them with enough to wait for more uncertainty around the world market."
There's no consensus on what Fed's gonna do, and this leads to what's in his own financial markets.
In the near future, half of the economists that Bloomberg met this week were expecting a steady increase.
Along with this, the financial markets expect Fed to stay in the waiting room with his mother, who only shows a potential increase of about 30%.
This situation may indicate a fall in the market on the basis of a document, if the policy makers do not ignore the effect that another increase could have on the environment.
On Tuesday, the Daw Jones averaged 228.89 points or 1.4 times 16.599.85.
Moody's Capital Markets Research Group chief economist John Lonski said, "The future of the Fed politicians has been shaken by the expectation that they will maintain their position this week."
He said, "It would be amazing if the Fed were to increase the situation right now."
If Fed's managers decided this way, "they'd have to take a long year to settle the money markets so they don't panic."
The other experts pointed out that Fed would be able to settle the financial markets because of the rise in the bond of the silencer.
Only a month ago, Fed seemed to be in the interest of an increase of 0.25 points this month, which would have been a small step that would have enabled the United States to collect money quickly.
Yellen, despite the economic needs of liberals, said he expected this year's growth in the months ahead and in writing.
Despite the decline in job creation in August, growth in the labour market has continued this year.
Last month's unemployment rate fell to the lowest level of 5.1 per cent in the last seven years, and Fed was approaching the level he wanted.
She showed signs of maasing increases.
And although the inflation center continued to look under the target of the year %2, Fed politicians said that there was an important reason why oil prices were cut short.
Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson said that the economy "can cope with higher rates and need this despite the confusion in the labour market."
But in the last month, the global financial markets began to collapse after China went to a devaluation.
Due to the fear that Dow Jones would reduce the global growth of a slow-down Chinese economy, the index distribution of the Dow Jones season fell to 16% in May's record level.
By the way, when Dow was almost 10% below his high level in May now, he somehow dropped back.
Fed's gambling player for policymakers makes it even more difficult to calculate the time when fashion will increase.
UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, and former Fed member Stephen D. Oliner, said, "They may have been involved in this meeting with the lack of information on the financial markets in China for a few weeks and the lack of information on economic deterioration."
Now he expects them to wait for at least one month to manage these effects better.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about the impact of the US economy, and there is almost no data in his hand to link the progress of China's progress to date," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of Fed, so it should not have been one of the times of technological recovery.
But actually, Fed has become the world's financial power.
The impact of the central bank has been great in recent years.
Until then, President Ben S. Bernanke's sole target was to "dependencies" on the economic growth of Fed's world's market economy.
In a world where markets and economies come together, it is expected that Feds will not only follow developments in other countries but also talk to other central bank managers and experts to read the global economy better.
The property management company Investnet Inc. said that the decision-making process of world strategic director Zachary Karabell was "a lot of skills beyond my knowledge."
Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va. President Jeffrey Laker pointed out that this month, "feed's financial market movements that are not related to economic foundations have shown an extraordinary attitude" in the past.
For example, Lacker, who was a member of the Committee on the Law of the Public Payments, who was a member of the Political Developers of the Federal Open Piano Committee and was a member of the press for the increase in the number of people, was following its 1998-99 decisions.
Lacker said, "Despite limited recognition for the growth of the EU, the financial crisis in Asia has resulted in a decline of 0.75 pounds during the three meetings of Fed in Asia."
A year later, Fed's officers returned these orders.
Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Central Bank's Central Bank's assessment committee, said, "Fed should only face financial concerns during major crises during the 2008 season."
The last thief said he's not approaching this level.
You really don't want to stay in fear of going to an increase because the markets are expensive, said Peterson International Economic Institute President Posen.
The Central Bank's law does not yet speak of having two assets and money, and I don't think they should be in this direction.

Brazil encourages health care during the Rio Grande Pediatrics Committee
Brazil's Pediatric Center for Pediatric Pesticides, SPSS, testing and health care for women, introduced a shocking approach to the birth of unhealthful children with five births.
Human milk, many proteins, water, vitamins, and carbohydrates have come into play to provide all the senses needed to develop a healthy apology system for babies.
Because of their energy needs, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to raise their daily calories to 500 calories.
According to recent studies, breast-feeding is not limited to taking calories alone.
Texas Baylor and College Professor Robert Waterland, according to a new work carried out by pregnant women's health care, has prevented their babies from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, it's not healthy to give up on the child's apology system.
Seven's Sunrise, despite the fact that Nine's leadership in Today Show's leadership is being promoted in the retreadings
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson were unable to provide a regression increase for Canberra in order to reverse the leadership of Liberal and Lisa Wilkinson.
After Tony Abbott's attack on Malcolm Turnbull, Nina's coffee was presented to the national president.
David Koch and Samantha Armitage were intertwined with the weekly international series of Rival Sunrises in London, Dubai, New York, Niagara Hills and Cancun.

The great news for Seven was the beginning of the 800th Word-to-Speech chapter by Erik Thomson, the star of the Rafters.
With the two children of a new widow's father, he reached a most influential middle of the new 1,219 million drama about deciding to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children.
The prosecutors asked that Thomson's Rafters would not be a solo show without Rebecca Gibney's old-fashioned driver.
Last night was a "yes" answer.
Seven's X Factor has been protected by 1,136 million monitors, Block (838.000) and TBL families (726,000).
You've got two Takip-Austurayas in the middle of the night.
The first half hour of the new information contest that Andrew O'Keefe spoke about came to an average of 446,000 observers (17:00-17:30).
In the second half of the hour (17:30-18:00) my number fell to 623.000 spectators - it was enough for a little chance against Eddie McGuaire's Cold College (613.000).
On Monday night, the number rose to 720,000 in the second half of Takip-Australia's first half hour, reaching 550,000 spectators.
Cold Coltuk has an average of 620,000.
Takip thought that Australia's second night's retiring fall would give Nina a chance to win the Black Colt.
Tacip Australia was a change in the amount of millions of dollars that were not spent on McGuier's shoe.

The last three people think Bekar Sam Wood is a perfect man, but who will choose him?
Did he go out in the middle?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackya and Snezana Markoski might have put in place who won Bekari.
Sam Wood was in a big secret at the end of his Becker's program.
And the other three girls are doing their best not to tell who the last laughing area is.
But the day before three people fell in two, we'd check Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Marcoski, they might have given us a hint about who the winner was.
Sam Wood burned his mouth at the end of the day.
Three women told us why Wood was perfect in a Liric language, and they said they wanted to be his partner in helping him to be a good partner.
But if you're not, who's gonna get Wood's last smile? They might have some information about who's gonna win The Bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and de Marcoski quickly gave them the name Mackya as the best name for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been very close since the first day.
Javons-Fellows said, "Since I came home, I've felt that the energy (Sarah) and Sam's energy are compatible with each other, and I've thought that through the program."
Marcoski added, "Sarah is very practical, very pleasant to be around."
I saw them together, and there's a chemistry between them.
They're very good and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood will be a couple of very well-informed.
Mackay said last week, his visit to the house said he thought Wood was "the right person."
He said, "When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was not just a game, and I'm totally attached to him now."
Otherwise, when he was asked who Wood could choose, he was undercover.
He said, "I don't know if I can say that."
"I love the other girls the same way as Snezana and Lana."

Jaryd Hayne's career in the NFL has been given a variety of options.
After Detroit and Seattle moved herself to the U.S., they took a lot of interest in her, and a lot of other teams approached her after the day of the public training.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and her husband Jim Tomsula, and this seems to be a very clever decision.
Some of the horses sat on the roof of Hayne because of the loss of performance in Australia's Rhab line, as it may have taken 20-3 against Minnesota on Saturday.
But Tomsula believed this man and knew Hayne more about an opportunity to play after Reggie Bush's silence.
After Tomsula's game, he continued to show the real color in his bedroom.
Instead of lowering them in front of the whole team, he gave them a chance.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne during the post-mortem press conference.
The 49s team leader Cam Inman, Hayne, said that he also took care of the special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey and forgot this fall and was advised to think about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne, why Minnesia Vikings was in the first quarter and fell into a lot of trouble
This wasn't what Hayne and her grand Australian monster kitten imagined for the first game in the NFL.
Well, when the crowd fell down, he saw that he disbelieved and then said that the Australian radio couple Hamish and Andy didn't think of a bad start for the NFL career at 2DayFM 104.1.
He said, "It was just one of those things, and you're sorry about the next game, and that's it."
Hayne also reminded Queensland of Origen's first game in 2007.
I still have a great experience for this 27-year-old player.
Well, after the game, a piece of paper was published in Instagram while wearing an Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin will come to an agreement on meeting their sexual rights

President Vladimir Putin, who was publicly opposed by Khodorkovsky, was imprisoned, and the oil company was quickly cut off from Yukos and democratic efforts were made.
In Nepal, Police Protetocularate Plastic Shooting Program, 4 Killed
According to an authority on Wednesday, the result of a police fire on a police force that offered a new mother mother in the country was the result of a 4-year-old boy who lost his life, including four-year-olds.
On Friday evening, President Katmandu arrived at the town of Rupandehi, 175 miles away.
The Prime Minister Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said that more than 1,000 of them were gathered outside a police station and some were throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal, before using plastic bullets, the police said he opened fire on the air using beer gas.
He said the police and the five civilians were injured.
It's known that he died, but it's not clear why plastic bullets used as a less deadly alternative are caused by such a high mortality rate.
In general, Nepal's southern regimes have been the last of violent protests which have continued for weeks, leading to the political impact of the newly formed regions offered by members of the Macedonian ethnic group.
The ethnic group of Tharus who wants to build their own governments is also doing protests in western Nepal.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have lost their lives in the violent conflicts that have taken place since the 11th century.
This date has been agreed on the division of the four major political parties into the countries of the country - it has been considered important to prepare for a new motherhood in Nepal, which has been run by the central government for centuries.
The work on a new mother has continued since 2008, but legislators have been speeding up this time after the devastating earthquake that struck thousands of people and caused their deaths in Nisan.
Lawmakers worked on their mother-in-laws this week in Katmandu, and the authorities said the new text would be arranged until the Passover day.

Another well-known low-pressure system was seen between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilleans, and Miami's central airway forecast was probably 60 percent in the two days ahead.
Google has launched an 11 million-dollar matching campaign
Google Inc (GOOGL.O), a campaign to collect 11 million dollars for thousands of people who have fled from war-damaged countries, who have fled to Europe.
Google has led an unexpected person into the blog with me.
Instead of making this statement by an administrator, Rita Masoud, a Google worker who escaped from Kabil when she was seven years old, wrote her own personal experience.
"In our village there were plenty of dark buses and trains along the sides of hunger, cold, cold, and fear."
I was lucky.
But I'm grateful for the help of a lot of families like my family, because of the crisis of immigration and immigration in Europe.
Grants, migrants and migrants will go to a four-fold non-profit organization that will help: the International Committee of the Red Cross, the International Rescue Committee, the Rescue of Children, and the High Commissioner for Foreign Affairs.
Google said the first $5.5 million will be equivalent to google.com/refugeelief's address until 11 million dollars are collected.
Europe, 2nd World War, still facing the worst civil crisis, the greatest cause of this year's internal war, which took more than 4 million people, four years, to Syria.

In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, weight loss may help
According to a new study, the benefit of obese surgery in type 2 diabetes mellitus may last for at least five years.
However, it is still early to say that patients with moderate hepatic impairment have not lived longer than they have observed patients who have not experienced surgery since surgery.
According to Dr. Robin Blackstone, who wrote an article on JAMA's new work on the operation and obsessive action, "it takes a long time to identify all aspects."
Kilo loses operations, called bararartic surgery, use various methods to reduce the medi rate.
These reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to digest.
Over the years, the type 2 diabetes mellitus has proved to be effective, but most of the studies have been conducted on subjects with a body mass index (VKI) of 35 or more.
BMI, 18.5 to 24.9, which is measured by kilolons, is generally accepted.
25 or BMI shows that the person is more than kilograms, and those on 30 BMI are considered weak.
You can calculate BMI from the following link: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new study, Taiwan's fully-fledged Min-Sheng Hospital has used the data obtained from the trials they have experienced in the treatment of two types of middle-level obese patients since 2007.
Since the end of the fifth year of the study, the average number of patients who have been treated since the end of the fifth year of the study has risen to 24.5 BMI.
The BMIs are safe in 29 villages of those who have been exposed to unserious, non-serious diabetes.
Of course, in 36% of patients, a total of 28% were solved.
In the treatment group, the diagnosis is complete with only %1 and only part with %2.
Also, according to the authors, blood pressure control, triglycerides and "low" LDL cholesterol, was generally better in the "serious group".
At the same time, researchers have shown blood haemoglobin levels of A1c, which are present in patients at the same time.
Researchers say that A1c haemoglobin is best kept below 7%.
After surgery, A1c was averaged from 9 to 6 percent.
In the medical treatment group, 8 percent remained stable.
But, according to Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his team friends who conducted a better "glysemic control" research with the levels of A1c hemoglobin, he did not lose the cause of death within five years.
The investigation team compared the findings in hand with these two types of operations.
In the fifth document, a group of patients with tuberculosis-naïve renal disease (18.7 to 14.2 kg), BMI (7.4 to 5.1) and A1c haemoglobin (3.1 to %2.1) were found to be higher and likely to recover from all their diets (%46.9 to 16.7).
Although the study did not indicate a net benefit from post-life surgery at the end of the fifth year of the study, Dr. Blackstone said that Arizona, of the College-Phoenix, had passed the life-long period of the operation, according to a work carried out in more kilograms of patients in Switzerland.
In this work, Sweden, another group of obese patients who had been diagnosed with briar surgery had died within 15 years, and another group who had seen a more conventional treatment of death was 29 percent lower.
Although this new work has not shown what the benefits of survival of patients with surgery have been, it is, according to Blackstone, and it is a safe haven for people under the BMI 35.
This is also the most exciting part of the article, because there has been no increase in the risk of death or renal failure in a group that has fallen BMI.
Blackstone added that people and doctors should begin to take the matter seriously by falling BMI below 27 and 30 pounds.
I think we're waiting for people to take this matter seriously, he said.
I think it's really hard to replace this once these genetic changes have been collected in the universe, which have brought their bodies into harmony with the universe.
"It's impossible to get to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Dalai Lama, who told all citizens of Europe that they would not have a home, added that the real solution to the existing militarism crisis lies in the Middle East.
Tibet's leader, Buddhist, found that violence has been brought to an end in the countries of the Republic of Moldova.
At the beginning of the 10-day visit to England, Dalai Lama, who was going to work on ethics, was in favour of the continued militarized crisis in his speech at the Oxford Centre.
He stated that under existing circumstances, countries or cities should plan ahead for mankind's exits.
At the same time, however highly assessed, it has also been pointed out that the situation is not sufficient to address the country's humanitarian crisis in Western Europe.
He said, "It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe."
As far as Germany and Austria appreciates the efforts to cope with the crisis, Dalai Lama asked that these were only temporary solutions.
"It's great to deal with a few thousand minorities, but at the same time you have to think about long-term solutions, and think about how you can bring about lasting conflict and sustainable development to Muslim countries, based on education."
We need to think about how to reduce deaths in our country.
We need to reduce the use of power.
I've never solved problems with my use of power."
As the issue turned out, Dalia Lama also regretted George Bush's 11-year-old attack and wanted the U.S. government to initiate a series of uncontrollable incidents.
11 years later, I addressed my wishes in a letter to President Bush, and I said that this problem had gone through non-violent ways of solving the problem.
I know that their dreams are well meant, but he used his own strength and became the result of unexpected results," Dalai Lama said.
In the last 4 years, 4 times the number of suicides seen in children has increased by 4 times.
The U.S. gas control centres in the United States have reported an increase of almost 400 percent in high levels of alcohol in children aged 12 years and under the age of six since 2010.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Georgia’s Zehir Center Manager, an anti-semitting arm was found in 12-year-old children who were diagnosed with cancer from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
Lopez said to CNN, "Children have shown more affection for this kind of product, and it's sad that there's something that's going to happen soon."
Some kids say they've been drinking their hands with antiseptics, who's doing this in an attempt to influence their friends or a social media.
Videos on YouTube show antiseptics instead of soft drinking.
It has been reported that some adults have mixed their antiseptic interaction with oral water, alcohol, and alcohol to get a stronger drink.
Little kids can get caught up in antiseptic dreams.
Lopez said, "The boy doesn't think it's a bad thing."
Most of those who are more attractive.
Children have high-end antiseptics that have been presented to them by the end of the day.
Where the antiseptics are seen, it's between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in small children, it can only cause a few droplets of alcohol to poison.
Dr. Stephen Thornton, president of the Cancer University Hospital, said that Kansas city of Fox 4 has "a high-level concentration of alcohol."
You don't want to leave a couple of habits on the average, but people leave these antiseptics in the middle, and that's a very easy way to get too much alcohol for the kids.
In recent times, only four times in high school has been removed to see six-year-old Nhiajah Russell to receive treatment.
According to Dr. Chris Ritchey, this was two parts of the legal limit of alcohol accepted by an adult.
Nhaijah couldn't speak his words and he couldn't walk when he came to his emergency room.
According to Rithey, the doctors kept him in a hospital all night before any brain trauma could be identified.
Anne said in her statement to CNN Ortoria Scott, "he was very scared."
He could have been a killer for my kid.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or contact with antiseptic agents and remove them from places where children cannot reach.
In addition to the use of alcohol, it was seen that some antiseptics were associated with death threats.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died of an overdose containing an unexplained poison substance.
Health authorities have pointed out that the substance of the word is not alcohol, as it is listed in the list, but it could be methyl alcohol that has a deadly effect.
In the past month, three fourth-class students from north New York were prepared to poison their "small heart" teachers, according to police reports, with the aim of "setting anti-bacterial products around the class" as a complement.
The teacher ordered that he be used in class because he was allergic to antiseptics.
The plan before the police is designed to provide discipline to the school administration, calling it a "goose train".
You too come to Samandura
Robin van Persie, who was watching the game with the Lonkomotif Kuban, joined Udoh, Veseli and Melih at the end of the interview.
Van Persie, who made a warm conversation with Udoh, his own favorite, "I'm here to follow you."
You're gonna watch my training with your friends.
He said, "I'm waiting for you at Samandura."

Let's say, fuck you, what's wrong!
You're our hero.

But he's not ashamed!
Two weeks ago, Mirray Ince was murdered at the Sur Hall of Shrunk.
It's been three months.
She was with her aunt.
They killed him too.
They killed Joseph the Rainer on the third floor of Ocak.
I think he was running away from the aliens.
They tried him when they were looking for a safe place.
He also had his wife.
One day after that, they killed Melek Alpaydin at a coffee table in the Small Central Soka in Dyarbakur.
A couple of days later, they set fire to Sema's High School.

I'm sorry.
No, it's not coffee.
It's a shame you're in charge!
The killer's pulling his hand out and looking at our face.
Someone's trying to get his attention to something else.

Saudi Arabia did not withdraw from TUBITAK
The Scientific, Scientific and Technological Opinion, developed by the Institute for Scientific and Technical Research (TEUBITAK) of Turkey, indicated that a new agreement was made for the second party to Sweden (BALISTKA) for the sale of the second party to Saudi Arabia, "the number of BALISTICs serving in Saudi Arabia will rise from 6 to 14 by agreement with the development of the 8-year system and the acquisition of its structure."
Light, TUBITAK Space Technology was found in statements on BALISTKA, developed by the Research Institute.
He said that the weapon used in the case of the system, the mercenary, and the trials faced by the rebels were not the same as the data found on the central database.
The information obtained from different cryptographic locations and associated information has shown that BALISTKA can be kept and questioned.
BALISTKA, one of the most important features of BALISTKA, has identified more detailed and less accurate three-dimensional data to be taken into account in its ability to capture and display the potential to make decisions that the system has made in terms of innovation, and that its success has increased greatly.
BALISTC was introduced into the "SUBA-1 Project"
BALISTIKA reported that she met all the criteria of her success and that she took the full note of the Secretary-General's report to the General Assembly, in the light of the fact that the system set up in the 10 separate regions of Ankara was covering Turkey.
The Light, which led to the opening of the system's success, recalled that the "SUBA-1 Project", carried out by Suudi Arabia, was launched by BALISTKA and was successfully completed in 6 regions in 2013.
Apparently, BALISTKA said that a new agreement was made for the second party's sale to Saudi Arabia, indicating that SUBA-1 was signed on the basis of the SUBA-2, and that the development of the 8-year-old system and the acquisition of its establishment would be made in Saudi Arabia from 6 to 14 BALISTKA.
Timeh fossil found on bus size
The pre-historic period was indicated that the length of the seabed was 10 metres long and 3 tons weight was found.
Timsah's head length was only 1.6 meters.
Researchers have published their findings in the Cretaceous Research report entitled "Macimosaurus rex".
Federico Fanti, a leading student at the University of Bologna, described fossils as being 130 million years old as "almost in the size of a bus".
Fanti, who spoke to the Washington Post, said that the steamy water supply in the wall was "at least in a given region at least in that time."
The paleontologists explained that M. rex, the largest tissah on the sea, had been thrown into the lakes.
History is thought to be the greatest sweet water season, 110 million years ago, living in Africa and South America, 12 meters wide and 8 tons heavy.
They're all so confused!
The first book of the 1996 writer Ece Temelkuran, "The Head of All Women," was inspired by the same name by the Aysa Produksiono Theatrosu.
Selen Ucher plays the role of the Sea Cakr, Zeynep Cankon, the Black Turks, the Kadir Cermik and the Sebenmzemez.
The first time that Uçer continues to play games called 'Poz' and 'Study' is a game where women's heads are concerned about the writing and management experience of Uçer.
The game, last week, met a viewer at the Trup Show Center.
The game starts with the radio theater.
In the dark, a voice that took us years ago...
Then it opens the door.
A woman living on the side of the window, flying down.
It's understandable who's here and why he's in trouble with his neighbors.
A CONVERSATION WITH A NEIGHBOR
The Hebrew Uysal, a popular writer, was inspired by the Sea Cacra.
She was abandoned by her husband, but that's not the only reason.
There's something that's been going on since childhood.
His lack of appreciation for his father’s love, his lack of study, his lack of understanding of his past son’s past, his wrong relationship with him, led him to this point.
She decided to leave a letter behind, but she can't escape.
Because the ship and the white cleaner on the side of the bridge, the secret woman who's standing up against 'Aysel' (Zeyonep Kankonde), keeps him away.
Normally, they're getting closer to it as if it's been a long time ago.
The woman's still coming, and she can't be on her own.
The conversation between the third and the famous singer 'Meltem Kaya', who cleans the house, is turning into a good cook.
"Meltem," which is more naïve and almost universal, can't sing when you see most of the people below.
This interesting entrance wins a different size by entering the girl's house with the seventh key.
It's out of the question of giving false information to Meltem's press.
The song of Nazan Pancel is also used.
BUNALIM GUARDS
For the first time, the Führer was able to make sure that the game was fast and fresh.
The game's comedy's load is drawn from Turkey's source with Zeynep Kankone.
Types of caricature that the two of them are alive; the needed germs can make the viewer laugh with the necessary replications.
When I take the experience of the last few years to the stage, there is a positive performance that convinces me of the destabilizing spirit of the 'Ebru Uysal'.
Kadir Cermik, who has been described as the "Sermašek" performance of Tolga Célik's award film, has successfully cooperated with these four women.
The only casual game described as a comedian is to laugh without a headache.
Most of the people who come out of "Perran" that was played by Shönmez are like, "They read the writing of the works; they don't live, they see."
All the children, their parents, once thought about dying to punish their parents, and then they kept crying.
The woman is in the air like an incomprehensible joke.
She's always looking for a funny reminder that she's always missing her most important place.
In fact, every habit starts with a kind of release.
Sometimes I have to put my hands in my pocket, and I can't follow things that are innocent.
He's wondering where the man's gonna put his hand.
As soon as we're surprised, we'll have a lot of hands.
People say things they don't understand, and they lie.
A misunderstanding is true.
All women's heads are confused because they're confused.
You've got a chance to live because you're not dying.

The micro-organisms in the syndrome system are divided into two groups that are useful and harmful.
The useful microorganisms are called probiotic microorganisms.

Succumbing confidence in the United States in 7 months
According to university data, UMICH, at the end of the ocean, was 0.7 pounds, 93.3 pounds.
As a result, since 2015 Haziran has been identified as 92.9 as the highest-level market expectation of the index.
In his statement, Director of Chemical Research, Richard Curtin, writes, "The fourth month has led to the improvement of the prospects for economic growth in the future of consumer confidence."
"Union funding expectations have been at the highest level since 2007 because of the general lack of inflation," he said.
The explanation also pointed to the fact that the prosperity of the consumer is now dependent on the fact that inflation is now disproportionately low.
Since 2004 the average of 92.9 years, UMICH has reported the best performance since 2004, according to the results of a 50 questionnaire questionnaire with at least 500 people every month.
Super Lotto results
Super Loto's results were determined by the raid by the Milli Pyango Authority last night.
Five weeks ago, Super Loto was worried about the consequences and was waiting for the excitement.
When Super Loto 14 was pulled out, the amount of 9 million lire in the Ikram was not six again.
Super Loto spent eight million 734 thousand litres a week with hopes.
Here's the Super Lotto results, the week's winning numbers and the insurance list...

Putin, he's crying.
While Russia was preparing to identify Turkey's services in a way that would not be otherwise opposed to Turkey's services, the Russian Tur Operators Unit also made a statement "Russia's parents are not leaving Turkey".
The Russian Economic Protection Agency, which calculated that the ban on existing economic relations with Turkey would lead to further competition with Russia, prepared and published a new "Istitus Status" design for Turkey with regard to the Russian Government.
I'm going to do the table published in the Russian Federal Administrative Directory to ensure that the Turkish companies and companies are allowed to work with Russia even if they enter the area.
It is estimated that the supply of other sources outside Turkey is impossible or that local production in Russia will benefit from the production and service of Turkish companies and companies.
The karma commission will determine which Turkish human property and service will be included in this category, which will be established by the Russian Economic Development Agency for the whole of Russia.
So the decision can be made by the bureaucrats whose Turkish company can work with Russia.
According to the same document, it will have to prove to the Commission that the work of the private companies with their state institutions in Russia is not important for them to do with Turkish partners.
The plan will also create a written record of Turkish companies that are certified by the Russian government.
Russia's Tur Operators Unit, in his statement yesterday, said that the Russians did not leave Turkey.
The statement was addressed to them: "In spite of the sales law and the Russian Foreign Office's recommendation to go to Turkey, our relatives began to call for the formula to organize the holidays alone."
In social networks on the Internet, there is a growing number of the most practical and easy-to-be-to-dwelling letters on Turkey.
The most common suggestion is to make a hotel reservation online and fly with THY.
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev identified the 30-dollar oil price as a "dramatic" development in Russia.
Medvedev, "It's been a terrible surprise for our government, like no one has ever imagined that Peter's going to lose $30.
"It looks like it's not possible to replace this moving hole with the current situation."
The last month of 2015 we left Geide.
After the crash, Russia's President Vladimir Putin announces that the economic performance of the airport will be even deeper.
In those days, our employees who were trying to get to Russia, our THY personnel, were shooting at the border gates.
Turkey's treasure is wrapped in gold. It's based on control that won't come suddenly.
It's not long ago, it's been a month, and it's been reporting from Moscow yesterday.
That's what I'm doing or I'm doing.
Well, why?
It's very simple.
You are no longer trying to turn the political struggle into a economic war.
Look, we're still writing to Iran, and we've been writing about how the economic embargo has been brought to an end for years.
It looks like a lot of friends like Russia and Turkey, but it's not much like that, it's actually a good idea for two neighbor countries.
It's not technically possible to pick up these two countries from one another on such a night, with tourism involvement, customers and customers.
If you close the doors, the people of these two countries will enter the country of each other.
It's the right thing to do on the table to do the political debate without the new Reza Zarrabs (Sarraf) created.
Before the economy's insinuated...

Konders, who spoke at a conference in Lahey, said that Esad was responsible for the flood.
Koenders, who pointed out that it would not be possible to come to Syria as long as he was on trial, recorded the following:
Esad must be sentenced to UCM in Lahey.
Someone with so much blood in his hand should be charged against the court.
At the same time, Esad is the only responsibility of the rescuer against us now.
In contrast, I know that Esad will not leave his assignment in the near future.
That's what we need to talk about, and Russia needs help in this case too.
A deafening protest to the blind
In the 59th minute of the game played with the Medica Sivaspor, Burak took up protests until he reached the goal of the post he wanted to give to Sneijder.
On this he showed kindness to those who were bent on denying the truth.
Then the behavior grew, and every group came to the football player's feet, and they heard protest sounds.
Some tribes later supported Burak's victory and protested against their own players.
Then he supported a large part of the tribes to the House of Lords.
Decicode Case: There is no inconsistencies in Celtic
Deila doesn't care about saying inconsistencies in Celtic while she's going to admit that Hopes is in the wrong place.
The fight against hearts, the punishment of SFA Neilson, and the unity of the Team against the Wharburton's arrests,
Leader Don's made a lot of difference with Celtic.
ADAM Rooney's first half-year-old pendulum brought Aberdeen to the Pittodrie in Hamilton, and given Don the opportunity to create a five-point difference between themselves and Celtic.
Griffith, it doesn't matter what you say.
The statement made by the CD in Celtic reflects the difference between Griffith's hand and that his and his teammates were not under any increased surveillance feeling when they were preparing to meet the League Leaders in the Netherlands.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I'm in the corner where players are impatient for this.
It's not about the Scotch race. It's about Boer's life in the Netherlands.
Rangers' former middle-class player and former international football player in the Netherlands says they lost their interest in Celtic because the footballers in the Netherlands didn't get back to Rangers.
De Boer, who is now an Ajax apostle, said, "They don't give the names of Celtic games in the Netherlands anymore, why?"
Because Rangers isn't there anymore.
People don't just talk about changing Rangers back.
They're talking from the old team.
They're talking in groups, they're talking about it.
It was not just the Scots who wanted to watch the old team's games.
I'm gonna fix things, Deila.
RONNY Daila Celtic admitted that he was fighting, but the Norwegian boss said he was going to change the course.
The attack against Malmö and then the Champagne champions followed the game that was lost against Aberdeen, which was now five different points from the five rounds of the scoreboard.
But Deila said, "There have been days of misfortune in the past; we shall return."
Now we want to show ourselves as soon as possible.
I know that the situation is very traumatic and that there are so many people who are angry or sad.
We're in the same situation, but we just have to keep going.
We really need Celtic's support because it feels much better for this player.
Now it's important to stay together.
The gravity of Warburton's fair transfers
Just two weeks ago, despite the efforts of some Ocak transfer targets, Rangers' boss Mark Warburton is ashamed of the signature, and he insists that Ibrox's team be broken.
The ex-Brentford Prince said, "The transfer window is very different from the writing window."
For the players you've written, I've had a time before you've had a season that you'll trade them for, and we've seen this season in our own group.
The team's really good.
Sometimes it's more harmful to add unnecessary players to what you really need.
He's targeting Celtic Michu in the field of surgery.
Swansea has been connected to Celtic in the Michu transfer window and has emptyed the prospect of being able to communicate with the Towers.
Two years of age, two years of age, were suffering from a problem footache, and there was no way to get out of Gallery.
Hearts are ready for the SFA wizard on Neilson's terms.
When Patterson was fired, the Hearts were 2-1, and then 3-2 were lost, and after the defense player's red card changed everything -- Collum's third red card in eight months.
Neilson doesn't give up on what he says, but he says, "I never asked for unity, I didn't ask for performance."
Griffiths, tried to advance Tynecastle
He was surprised to hear a song about Rudi Skacel, an old-fashioned Hibee player who was attacked by Rudi Skacel.
The event took place in March 2014 at a bar in Edinburgh, in front of the Edinburgh border in Tynecastle.
"It was a game of dragons and his mother was hot," he said, adding, "I can't go to Tynecastle without playing with Celtic.
Tunnadice building Dundee United's safe management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly, they're still confident that the U.S. management team will improve the work, but it's just the end of the drop in the field.
I think Stephen Thompson trusted us.
We'll get the kids back on the way." Donnelly said.
Welcome to McClness Hamilton's "winning"
Derek McLness, the Aberdeen team acknowledges that in the first half of Adam Rooney's Penitentiary, they have to be held in despair in front of Hamilton Accices to see the top seven possibilities of Celtic on top of five points.
McLnness said, "There's no team that won without the game."
The same thing happened between the Scots while there were more unemployments in England
The number of unemployed people in England in Scotland has risen to 1.82 million, while the number of unemployed in England has not changed between the May-Temmous period.
According to the National Statistical Office (ONS) figures, the unemployment rate in Iceland was 5.9 percent higher than 5.5 percent in England.
Eight left in Scotland has fallen 122,000 in three months, and the number of people who are working now is 2,612,000.
The demand for Iceland fell to 74.0 percent, this number is higher than 73.5 percent in England.
President David Mundell, who was responsible for Iceland, said, "The government's long-term plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It's almost a year since Iskoshia decided to remain part of England.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen progress with the increase in demand and the reduction of unemployment.
Why I'm a witness to a man in Oklahoma
In the hours ahead today, I'll watch a man's murder because of a legal case.
I don't hope so, but if it happens, I'll sit in the hospital watching the death room in Oklahoma City, where Richard Glossip is diagnosed with a fatal injection.
He wanted me to be one of four witnesses to his death.
The invitation was first made by his best friend in October, and I accepted, no matter what.
As that day drew near, I began to fear it.
So why am I doing this?
I accepted because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about a death sentence.
It's going to be a perfect perspective.
True, journalists are allowed to monitor the attitudes of Americans, and there is a lot more application in the absence of existing places, and they go into a terrible piango when they decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma's media colloquia has fallen so much since the 12th.
Whoever's chosen will follow their feelings without opening them up.
I can't do this.
I'm going to sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've been developing a relationship with him for the last few months and two hours of a visit.
I love that man.
We're laughing too often when we talk.
The prison officials said I wouldn't be a witness and a journalist, and I won't be given a stick and a bill so I can record what I've seen.
I'll try to remember all the details.
A top-level journalist accused me of being a spy on Twitter.
Here you go.
Tell the judge the story as he likes it, the winner.
I complained to her.
And he admitted, "You can bring it in better language," but he still thinks that what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip, what I say and what I'm writing, it's not the same idea to me.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and if he did, I wouldn't accept it.
When she asked, I told her she could get me out of the witness list.
But an international leader wants him to be there and write these.
If he dies, he thinks that this will help him in the face of death.
I'll be with Kim Bellware from Huffington Post.
If you want to get more information about this, please listen to the podcast series I'm preparing.
I'm not gonna tell you all the details here again.
I have no idea about Richard Glossip's fault.
Barry Van Treese's death is enough to make himself a criminal partner.
But I still believe he's not guilty of his own murder.
I believe there is not enough evidence to show a death penalty.
I think his mind is wrong.
And I'll watch his death with this prospect.
I can't say I'm really objective.
That's why you can look at the other passengers there.
The surveillance you'll take from me will be the surveillance you'll take from watching the death of a loved one who's killed without need.
After the police raid, the man was confirmed by Canning Nehri.
The Canning Valley Police Department, the man's been forced out of the Canning Nehr.
A man in Perth's behind a cop's flight from a cop's car stopped by trying to convince himself to come back to the country.
The Canning Valley Police were called on Friday, on the grounds of the unauthorized entry into Beckenham.
When they saw the suspect, the man tried to escape from the police by entering Canning Nehri.
But it wasn't too far away.
He said, "The Chief Commissioner's assistant, Spartan Castle, is standing in the water and 'I'm not going to go out,' he said, 'Get me'.
Police Member Lachlan refused to sign up for the government's uniform and used a more secure tactic -- "I'm the police speaker".
Commissioner-General Castledin said "sometimes people say funny things to try to escape."
Champion footballer Ben Cousins provides an outstanding example in his mind.
In 2006, a police officer stopped his car to escape alcohol control and set out to cross Swan Nehri.
The teasing failed, but the local people were inspired by the planning of the Ben Cousins Beatlon.
Peter Moody claimed that the chaos threatened to spy on himself and stop fighting.
Peter Moody said that Racing Victoria's wives were trying to prepare a tour in their own homes last year and threatened to leave immediately.
Racing took Victoria's cards and the department of unity and told them that they had taken a personal campaign against Lady Tatai to leave him out of the contest on their last anniversary of the war on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to do the best in the contests, and he told Lidari that he found himself in strong steps that he couldn't explain.
He said he didn't want to be "like wild grapes" for 18 months.
"I wouldn't say these things and I've been stuck on it for a long time, but sometimes you're very upset and everything's going to be together," said Moody.
They know it's going on.
Sometimes you react and you stick to its consequences, and I'll stick to what I say.
I'm gonna sleep well when I get home tonight.
I want my head up and my bosses know I'm trying to do the best I can for them.
I mean, when they started thinking I didn't do this, I shouldn't be running anymore.
I was thinking about what I could do with my license.
Earlier, Moody released a bomb accusing his department of being inside the spy compound in a rapport.com.
"Two months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man -- I'll call them if you ask -- and they're asking him what I did to them about what I did to them in my neighborhood," said Moody, Racing.com.
They clearly believe I'm a triad.
If that's the case, they're all gonna have to fix everyone's blokes because they weren't capable enough to catch me.
RVL's former president Robert Roulston, RVL's new president David Moodie and RVL's current general manager knew that too.
Should it make me think that it's starting to be personal?
RVL has a number of groups, and maybe he wants to figure out what's happening in the industry?
I'm bad for the engineer?
Am I so bad for the engineer?
Maybe people out there think I am.
Maybe they need to get my license and get me out, but I'm not sure what I'm saying is going to make them think.
But I don't care about anything at the point I'm here, and I'm sorry.
This really hurts me.
I'll put pressure on them, I'll have the responsibility of making decisions for them.
I have my family's support and I'll walk.
The persistent cobalt questioning of the operator in Lidari over a long period of time and the mental confusion that led to the next incident caused him to stop saying, "Throw my license against the table."
In preparing the unrenewed champion Kara Havyar, the winner of the Moody's victory day, called his watch for the day of battle, said that he was different from the rules to be thrown into the legs of his horse or foot.
This is contrary to the rules of competition.
I have to bear all of this."
One of my men fell wrong on his feet.
He could have taken it tonight.
It could have been yesterday, which is what happened.
He took the day of the contest.
Moody, at the end of the investigation that the managers were open, he may face three months of punishment for using the lamp on the day of the day of the trial.
It's a joke.
He doesn't know anything about those who make these rules.
"We know we need the rules, but this work has gone much further," said Moody.
The flight driver has been caught in Cobram
The police arrested a man who ran a bicycle in Cobram last week.
He was taken to the Royal Melbourne Hospital for serious injuries after a car hit on Murray Vadsi Autoway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver was running away from the incident without helping the wounded.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia surrendered to the police station in Shepparton.
To stop an accident, to help, and to blame other traffic crimes.
At 40 years of age, Cobram's cyclical condition continues to be stable.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy gave a strong response to his arguments about his records
Melbourne Storm trainer Craig Bellamy called his team's target target "increasing daily" for the two favorite units of NRL.
Sydney Rousters coach Trent Robinson Cuma said at the end of the afternoon of Storm's competition, he allowed his own team to "fuck him" with his team.
The Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett was called a "birth" game for the game team after the final match won by North Queensland Cowboys on Friday night, and after half the final match he won against North Queensland Cowboys.
He defended the resistance of the Bellamy team and said they were just focusing on "themas" while fighting.
Bellamy said it was because it meant that Storm was worried that they were going to wake up.
This is happening. I didn't hear Trent Robinson spoke to us in 24-2 weeks, said Bellamy Thursday.
I'll make sure we haven't changed anything in our defense systems or our technologies all year long, and we've only been shooting at our contacts in the last six weeks, and this has been a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years, and it's clear that he's got a big team that he's been cheating, and he's probably not used to lose a little school for himself.
And it's funny that it's been on the table this year.
Bellamy, against Bennett's idea of "the exciting football", reminded Bennett of the 2010 St. George-Illawarra Dragons' first victory by playing "skin" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
On Friday night, he made our Friday night match with his own games and how exciting their games were."
I remember in 2010 that St George was hired because he was a busy team and Wayne said he wouldn't even give a girl.
But now there's a group that's playing football that we can call exciting football, and especially young people with speeds.
This is the football you'll want to play when you're this type of player.
In 2010, he put that point, and now everyone wants to play football like this -- every team has half like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so it's not possible to play in this form.
This gives me a lot more confidence because they're talking like this because they're a little shy about playing.
When they went to big games, they probably didn't bring us into their minds six weeks ago.
Bellamy also pointed out that Storm and Roosters had a higher score than Broncos and Cowboys.
Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't seen him yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
Our game is 20 - 18, and our game is two sides more scoring, but is this an exciting football?
Or do you want to cut off your shoes, but don't you dare attack?
I think that's my day.
If they're talking about us, it means we'll meet them here on the other side.
Storm, North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks won't end this week because the first final game on Friday night was selling tickets to the AAMI Park.
The Serbian man was released from the drug charge with $200,000.
The man who was arrested on the 40 kilograms of cocaine that had fled to Queensland and was sentenced to a possible prison sentence of 200,000 dollars.
Marco Maximovic, aged 29, was one of five persons from South America and one of the five persons who had been arrested by the federal police during the time of the drug dealer's release in Coomera in August.
Maximovic met with his criminal partners in the marina this morning and later met with them at a 40 kilogram of a drug dealer in a Toyota Echo.
Despite the possibility of encountering a potential negative reward from the presence of cocaine, Ticari said that Maximovic's lawyer had no evidence that he had access to all drugs and could have a questionable purpose.
Special Judge of Divan was concerned that Peter Flaangan Maximovic was a runaway risk.
They have open connections to Serbia.
She travels often to Serbia," she said in court on Wednesday.
He lied about where the police were staying.
Maximovic's mother and his stepfather were offered $200,000 to stay free.
Judge Flangan said, "It is clear that every two people who have read their promises of peace are making up a real debt of 200,000 dollars on them."
But he warned her that it was not enough alone to hold her back from trial.
Maximovic, Australia and Serbia were left free to surrender their passports, to go to Karakola every day, and to comply with the law of departure between 6:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.
Stefan Hogg used the girl's phone to lure pedophiles into sending images
A pedophile used a 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for child abuse scenes.
Stefan Hogg, when he got her phone, offered him a series of inappropriate children sent to him by another user while he was on the phone.
She woke up later and realized that her phone wasn't there, and she found her phone in Hogg's hands.
He looked at her and immediately noticed disturbing messages before he warned his mother.
The police took care of and saw five images, then analyzed the computers found at the address, and discovered the "failure" web calls made using the terms of finding inappropriate images of children.
Hogg later told me why he did this on the Internet "directed the pedophiles" and did it for "to act like a cop."
Malik Elidhi Robertson, Dundee Sheriff Mahkemes, told them: "It's an addiction - it's a fear of people.
He admitted the calls were made on the computer, but he said he did it to scare the pedophiles.
Questions were asked about the interviews with people who did not know how to send pictures to themselves and who wanted to send more pictures than they did with themselves.
He said he did it to punish them.
He said when he was drinking, he got into sick thoughts and wanted to watch scenes of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girls found their messages on the phone, she cried to her mother and cried and cried.
Mom saw inappropriate images on the phone and came after the charges.
He met the girl and said he used the computer and Playstation to look younger than you thought.
Ward Road, 23-year-old Hogg, who lives in Dundee, was guilty of taking or producing inappropriate images of children during the past 14 years in Haziran, celebrating the ceremony on 25 October and not attending the trial this year on 24 March.
The defense lawyer Gregor Sim said that Hogg's not included in the sex crimes category would argue that there was no "known sexual element" in this case.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael's social history report was due to October.
Hogg was released in this case with freedom of choice, but he was kept in custody for other orders.
The sex crimes were registered before the court's history.
Robert Mugabe made a mistake in the parliament in Zimbabwe
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell from a podium at the beginning of this year.
It wasn't created, but the enemy's video went to social media.
Parliament's opening, parliamentarians, during Mr. Mugabe's speech, were charged with claims that they had taken an anonymous death risk during the ceremony.
In our last month's national parliament, they were excited and cut off their regular speech - they repeated the same conversation on Saturday.
The leader of the Democratic Change Movement (MDC) announced that Innocent Gonesse, the seven presidents' politicians, had come to their cell phones to slow him down during Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"When Mr. Mugabe's speech starts, it comes from a number that doesn't see the message to the journalists, but the title's part," he said.
He says that the non-attachedness of members is right within the parliament and does not work for non-attachedness when they leave parliament.
The chief speaker, Morgan Tsvangirai, said that the party was "initiated" because of threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will stop 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard will end up at 25,000 and 30,000 jobs in rehabilitating and rehabilitating corporate services.
The HP will be split into two companies listed in the years ahead; the computer and the writer's work will be divided by a larger company and service operations.
In a HP statement, the work expected to be out of work will result in a cost of $2.7 billion at the beginning of the fourth cycle.
Hewlett Packard said that HP and executive director Meg Whitman, who will take the lead in the post-distributive union, "will provide the new Hewlett Packard company with more affordable and affordable accommodation,"
"Whitman, the Hewlett Packard Company will be smaller and more focused on HP today and will be a broad and deep portfolio for the transitions of companies to new business," he said.
As a separate company, we are far better off in order to meet the growing needs of our clients in the world.
According to an explanation made by the company, the annual income of the Hewlett Packard Company will be over $50 billion, and it will focus on "study-free integrated technology solutions".
At Palo Alto's garages, "the birthplace of Silicon Vadisi" and in the 1930s, Stanford University's messages are divided into two companies designed to make electrical equipment by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard.
HP is going through a large reorganization to access mobile devices from conventional personal computers.
This action of HP, one of the world's largest PC players and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, is one of the last members of the industry's faith that frequent fair companies have shown better performance.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Arta says the team's friends are in trouble with the Dinamo Zagreb match.
Wenger pointed out that Wilsher's silence was alive on Monday and that the treatment was planned, that there was no reason to play during Christmastime.
Well, the best scenario is that Wilshere is already going to miss at least four games in England, and you're saying that when she looks back, she doesn't seem to be involved in the future European Championship.
The most embarrassing side of the problem was that Wilsher had completed the past season after a different footing and then called for the old silence before the season.
This is not a threat to a quiet career, Wenger said.
It's a completely infamous trap.
It's not big.
It was just an accident.
This has nothing to do with your licenses or your previous silences.
According to a medical perspective, these may be true, but there is a danger that Wenger will be able to make further progress in the middle of the season, as Wenger will accept.
At the same time, there's an unsatisfying stay.
According to a study by the Premier Productions by Ltd, there have been 23 different discomforts recorded since Wilsher's beginning six years ago.
In the last five seasons, Arsenal's 157-leg game was played only at 65.
In a large image, Arsenal has been one of the two First League teams that have often lost peace since 2007-08.
Wenger accepts the potential for a short turn, but he believes that good will be achieved in the peaceful record of the past season.
"Sometimes you'll live a clear period of rest during your return from peace, it's a time you want to strengthen your body and win the battle," said Wenger.
Jack's as young as he can get under it.
I hope the body is stable, I trust that, and I believe he will do his right career.
The champions are playing Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur in front of Arsenamo Zagreb, which will start in front of Arsenamo Zagreb on Friday, and will be playing Tottenham Hotspur, preparing the Wenger team for this.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey didn't go to Croatia, which means they're going to play with Mathieu Debuchy.
Wenger and Nacho Montreal can start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Theo Walcott.
"I insist on protecting the sea and providing solutions for the players," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is one of the main favorites of the F Group, he lives among the most popular stadiums in Zagreb in Europe.
The last season, Dinamo, didn't sell 41 matches after producing his own "Smoking" campaign.
According to Richter's size on the night of the stadium, he was hit by a depressive of 3.2 violence.
That's the 10th row in Zagreb this year.
Wenger Arsenal believes that last season the champions of the League have received the necessary training from the University of Monaco, and the success of the club in bringing the first European Cup to a distant destination.
"It's a motivation," says Wenger.
It wasn't like that in Arsenal.
We're very close in 2006, but I have the experience of being real on the other hand.
We need to hold on, but we're not a dreamer.
FriendsFest: Comedy program that gives us serious lessons about friendship between men
The lack of similar portals is particularly noticeable in programs, especially in a period where there is a 15-year-old presence between men and young men.
In 2013, this was the biggest cause of men's deaths between 20 and 45 years of age; and women were three times more likely to have men than girls.
To address this problem, Sefil Life Fight campaign (CALM) launched 2015 as a Man Year and aims to confront a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
There's a friendship in the center of the struggle to fulfill this difficult task.
A study of more than 2,000 depressive symptoms among high school students showed that if a person who is suffering from this depression had a high number of "healthy fashions" friends, the chances of getting better is two pages.
Similarly, for those who do not feel depressed, a mental environment can develop into a healthy environment that can lead to depression.
But, of course, friendship needs to be made available before it's too late.
At this call, I have a serious social media message; the room in which I'm going to miss is a matter of priority, rather than a meaningful communication.
Our digital lives, our strong, fun, and the need to look like successful people, even if it's really all in isolation.
The values that successful psychologists say are external values; money, belief, and social status are under the control of society; these are, after all, internal values that have a deeper impact on our mental health — personal development and friendship — our internal identity.
As the Creator of billions of video games has explained in the near future, money will not be able to buy more happiness.
The beauty of the friends list was to turn this room point down.
Not by his actions, but by his personality; and by his dealings with his friends.
Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the minutes they watched football in comfortable chairs, and Ross' connections to Rachel, all the men's feelings about exactly how they're going back on their plans, actually they're going to be able to communicate with them.
A helpful worker told me, "I've seen how even the smallest interaction between friends can make a difference when people listen to depression and irritability."
They're not talking to most of the men who've been in contact with us.
It's a strong feeling like going away, and it's a sign of weakness that doesn't open to others."
One of the programs that came to mind while offering long-term advanced exit mechanisms is the Friends series.
A man's friendship's little moments have come to an end.
In my case, a foreign status on the phone helps people in times of difficulty, but long-term support comes from families and friends who have close personal networks.
And if you're joining FriendsFest in the Comedy Central this weekend, why don't you take your friends to Central Perk for a drink in this beautiful environment, where they're redesigned to celebrate?
Or, better, if you see only one in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You don't know how to make a difference in your friendship.
Friends, from the beginning of the end in Comedy Central - all 236 parts - posted for #FriendsFest
The gold that Di Maria threw has made it easier for PSG to hit Malmö
Angel Di Maria greeted Blaise Matudi and Edinson Cavani after his defeat at Malmö.
Angel Di Maria, at the beginning of the Champions League, made it easier for the Swedish team to pass the record of the PSG on Tuesday to Malmö.
Here's the game reports and the game reactions.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavanni started a 2-0 final and clean match against Malmö in the Park des Princes City on Friday, Paris Saint-Germain, in the battle against the Champagne League.
The gold player in Maria was a PSG player who made sure that the French champions continued on their way to the League, but at 61 minutes they did not appreciate the second rounds of Cavani's head.
A Group needed to launch a strong initiative against the Swiss champion of Paris, which was held with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, and they needed it not only to get out of the group of action, but also to improve the final performances of the last three champions.
But the game they were playing was not the best game for a team of Laurent Blanc, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic spent a lot of his position around the criminal scene, and he joined him in the country's team that started his prominent career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win the champions in the League, whether outside or outside, it's not easy to win, but it's going to create problems for our opponents, and there's some things we need to improve within the season," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and win, even though we didn't have one or two dollars left.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team at the end of the week with 2-2 players who played with Bordeaux in Lig, but in the fourth minute, he was in the shadow of Di Maria.
When he was transferred from Manchester United last month, he was seen as a higher-level PSG player in Europe and behind Marco Veratti, the Malmö champion of Malmö, showed that such thoughts were not wrong when he ran away from the good fight to the remote files.
With this, everyone was disappointed to wait for PSG to win a big battle.
This time, Malmö, who played Celtic at the playoff, went down to the stadium with nine international players, a five-person champion and two middle-class players, a hard catch.
At 34 o'clock, Nikola Djurdjic and Kevin Trapp were attacked but few.
On the other hand, the PSG gave them the opportunity to slow down the game with unnecessary passports and unsolicited final attacks, and the first half failed to act in at least five attacks, and when the second half of Cavani's game began, he was disappointed because of his failure to sleep.
He showed that he was more proud when he came to organize his business with his friends, and at 52 minutes he gave Ibrahimovic behind the fake fight that he had sent to Wildan's career.
After a full hour, the second ball came to Cavani, and the Uruguayn player, after Ibrahimovic, recorded the sixth round of the season's head on the left side of Maxwell's left arm.
After the idea of the return of Malmö's game and the uncounted support of Ezequiel Lavezzi, who later entered the game, was released by William, David saved his empty suit and did not allow him to change his shoes.
Later, Malmö coach Age Hareide admitted that the PSG was superior to his own team, and Norway said, "We were the last champions' league in the summer last year."
From that time on, we only played ball at the Swiss League, not at the same level.
I don't have enough teams in my hands.
He's being taken out to Paris.
It was a great game for them.
Glencore made $2.5 billion of his mortgage sales.
Switzerland's central mining chief, Glencore, bought $2.5 billion on Wednesday, selling his share of his debts on Wednesday.
Glencore, listed in London, explained that he sold a new value of 1.6 billion sterlings to pay his own debt.
This year, the company that lost 57 percent of its market value was seriously affected by the increase in China's demand for economic slowdown and the confusion in the markets.
The legal issue was why Glencore's emotional prices rose in London in the early hours of the morning in the morning.
In FTSE 100, Hesseler dropped to 131.60 pennies by 0.69 higher than 2.77.
The week we spent on Glencore, the 30 billion-dollar debt congregation was declared to be part of a $2.5 billion-dollar sales plan, which was part of a three-year reduction plan.

White Sharay Xi Jinping proved Washington's Visit
White Saray confirmed that China's President Xi Jinping will be present at an official visit to the United States at the end of the month.
The explanation indicated that Xi's first official visit to Washington would take place on 25th July and that the visit to Barack Obama, who came to Beijing last November, was intended to take place.
After the second meeting of the two heads of state, the President of the United States and First Lady Michelle Obama will have dinner with her wife, Peng Lyuan, with Xia.
The statement also stated that "the two-country relations of the visit to Xian would enhance the cooperation of the United States-Cheap in regional and global matters and would enable President Obama to address the issues that had not been reached by President Xi's disagreement in a constructive way."

Obama and Xi are expected to take into account some of the controversial issues of Washington's concerns with regard to the allegations of cybercrime in China's operations and the allegations of asylum in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon, shows the difference in filmmaking
Matt Damon, saying that he didn't have to be behind the camera during a variety of contests, came up against the African-American filmmaker Effie Brown.
In the project Greenlight Pazar section, published at HBO, he finished the experimental actor term when he pointed out that the selected Brown project should have alternative views on the black parent character of the selected scenario.
Damon, when we talk about diversity, you're not in the player's camera, you're in the movie player's camera, you're in the mind.
The funny Brown showed his attitude towards this, like, "All right, all right."
The partners were brought together by Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers to discuss the finalists of the Damon and Brown show.
Brown said before, "I wanted to figure out how people would behave in the mood, regardless of who you are."
It's just a black character shot by a white guy.
The editor of the beloved White Peoples, the finalists, and Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio, asked about the rights of film management.
After the conflict was exposed, there was a social media riot against Damon's interests.
Twitter user Mr. Pooni expressed his anger when he wrote that "the diversity of this person can be expressed as pain in the EU as a pain in the face of Matt Damon's speech in the room."
After tweeting, he got 5,000 retweet and 4,000 fans.
Damon's strengths came when he was in front of the social disputes in the media.
In 2014, after being killed by a young white police officer named Michael Brown, he urged black life to be an active force in the country by lawmakers and artists.
On Saturday, the singer Prince spoke openly about the movement when the Year's Album was identified in Grammy Awards.
The albums are still important, he said.
And the albums like books and black lives are still important.
In the near future, the leaders of the movement of Black Life have published a counter-information on whether Elizabeth Hasselbeck, an important person in Fox News, should not be evaluated as a hate group.
Leaders, Black Life is an online love group, he said.
In the past, it was announced that Damon was included in the list of manufacturers, manufacturers and media bosses who were invited to visit the Pope in order to dispute the recognition of the Catholic Church in the West.
I'm not sure he didn't accept the invitation or he didn't meet Dad.
'American Ninja War' race to the first stage of the champion's campaign
The professional rock climber and comedian Isaac Caldiero was the first athlete to win the American Ninja War programme on Friday night.
The seven-year-old was never seen a full-fledged contester in the gang parlor.
At the end of the season, Caldiero and Geoff Britten were able to stay on the final tour.
The last task was to raise a 20-metre hole in 30 seconds.
Britten became the first person to complete this race, so he managed to be the first athlete to complete the American Ninja War in 4 years, but Caldiero was able to finish it three seconds ago.
After this tough chance, Caldiero spoke to E!News about winning 1 million dollars a big loan.
Isaac told E! about a big deal about his own money, saying, "I'm glad to think about it, I've never won more than $10,000 a year or gone."
So I can't even imagine what it's going to be like... I don't know what it's gonna be.
Maker Kent Weed de The Hollywood Reporter finally met and explained why no reward will be paid even if the first contestant finished the British parlor.
Under the rules, money will be given to the quickest.
Weed said, "If you're over me, he'll win the fastest reward."
Though the money is a great reward, and the life changes, he has won a great deal.
I don't think it's a bad idea about it.
He's so happy he did what he did.
He's got to take a ton of surprises.
He's a great man and a family father.
A hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "I'm glad it's Isaac if someone's gonna eat me."
I think if he had changed his roles, Isaac would have thought the same thing.
The American Ninja War has renewed the treaty for the eighth season and the attacks will begin in the summer of 2016.
Detroit Tigers went through Minnesota Twins.
MINEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season wasn't very nice for Detroit Tigers.
Tigers, one of the best baseball players, is now taking place during the last time of the American Central League.
Tigers, who sent the game to ruin, was able to play a perfect game on Tuesday, and he was able to place Minnesota Twins in Target Field 5-4.
The Twins lost the chance to raise the U.S. Second League to the field map of Houston Astros.
And for Detroit, even for one night, he was in the middle of the second half of the season in a good turn for a good game that was not seen very much.
Tigers' manager, Brad Osmus, said, "No matter what happens, it's all funny."
Tigers' baller, Alfredo Simon, was able to count one in the sixth and ninth rounds, showing support for the first three attacks by Detroit in the first two wars.
Simon (13-9) 6 sets 3/1 shots, three of which were shot.
This was only the third quality beginner in the last nine stages.
"I just want to shut up for the year," said Simon.
It's hard for the Sevens to empty each game, so I wanted to force him into the game too.
Tigers' election shooter Victor Martinez made three attacks, and both of them raced to become the first RBI he won since mid-August.
This was the first three night of the first battle that Martinez won against Seattle Mariners in about six inches.
"He used to suck his ass," said Osmus.
She looked good (in the race training) and she was better looking in the BP than she was in the game.
By the end of the seventh battle, he had the best chance of re-entering the game of Twins, who had three races.
The middle stage player, Byron Buxton, started a two-way battle line on the left.
The right-wing player, Aaron Hicks, could only make a slow fight, and Simon's second driver, Brian Dozier, left for Blaine Hardy before he took off.
Mauer, two of the guys who ran into Drew VerHagen's right-hand player, followed up with the only player who was able to attack Miguel Sano.
On the second round, a couple of drivers, VerHagen, were able to pull Trevor Plouffe's third player into the second game.
Plouffe's attack on DP was 27 times the big one this season.
After he met up for a flight guaranteeing Detroit's nine-year-olds, Mauer went through the RBI and opened up with Tigers, and he approached Bruce Rondon about 5-4.
With this, he was caught in three explosions to rescue Sano.
Detroit took advantage of Phil Hughes, who lost his form.
The Tigers won three times in their first two shots against the newly experienced right-wing player who stayed away from the streets for over a month.
"It's not the game I want to play openly," said Hughes, "but I felt more comfortable in the future and I was able to do very good explosions in third arrows."
Hushes took the second shooter Ian Kinsler from the game when he first made a successful shot.
The right-wing player J.D. Martinez left Victor Martinez alone at the first stage of the game.
Victor Martinez competed with the racers to cross the 0-21 band in the construction position.
The third killer, Nick Castellanos, looked at the right one, won another race, but Victor Martinez was shot trying to make the third one, so the threats ended.
The Tigers made a second addition, and the catcher James McCann, an outside couple and middle-class player, also won a double prize from Anthony Gose.
Twin's manager, Paul Molitor, said "a great fight."
He didn't shoot very well, but he went straight to the ground.
The shooter, Hughes, made three shots that did not bring the number to the opposite end with A.J. Backer.
Hughes was convicted of three races in six wars and four innocents.
NOTLAR: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez is out of the game because of the pain in his habit of shooting.
In 2007, Dr. James Andrews, who performed Sanchez's facial surgery, will be interviewed.
Since August, it has been planned that Sanchez, who has been on the list for weeks, should start working on Wednesday.
When Sanchez is missing, LHP Daniel Norris is going to start with DL against Twins.
This is still four games with Norris and Tigerler 1-1 before the 30th anniversary of David Price transfer.
20 August doesn't play due to the pain on the right side.
Tigers and Twins will finish their three game series on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA), Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).

Minitary cache is now multi-mode-Time magazine two
The roads in the fashion world are turning around and coming back to tents.
Those who are mined in recent times...
You can also say that the little bags connected to the adults are being taken care of.
They say everything's so small.
I think it's fair for the boxes.
It was almost impossible for them to walk through the streets of the city, and the rain was completely different, and they wanted to be reduced.
There were small bags already, but this time they came up against us with the reduced conditions of their large armchairs.
It's just your phone, credit card, and your keys.
The oil that started with Céline and Hermès was spread with Prada.
The turning of Santa's beauty into a mineral interest also influenced new models.
Loewe, the fun bags he'd prepared this season were double-sized.
Panda, the most beautiful of the bags in the file form, the box month and the file format.
It looks like the sizes of large bags that are bearing the names of the luxury brands are still the most redest of them.
Hermes, Jane Birkin, is one of the most favorites in the "Birkin" account he's ever prepared for.
Mr. Jane Birkin said he didn't want his name to be known by the press, but now he's taking place in the memory.
The fashion weeks gave me the cash flow off.
In the basements, too, my purses are getting the better of me.
It's not possible for you to touch them because they're too thin.
They can be used with long-distance weapons.
But in the podiums, we've seen more and more of those long-distance arms, turning into the plates of models.
I'm a fan of the people who have moved your bag to a point.
I've got something for those who don't fit in the bag, but those who don't give up.
The big bags are my friends' bags.
How?
We're turning the mini bags into one that can connect them to larger ones.
I mean, I've seen this noise coming out of the basement, and I've found it in the street, and I've got it.
Let's see what else we'll see!
Level change in the cell
Turkey is going to fight with world brands on the subject of religion.
This experience that I've gained is now enriching with design.
Loft is one of them.
We see that the black models, which were once a few, are now starting to take place in each season's numbers.
He found his closest friend during the season when the blacks were so tall.
Degree parts and detailed designs are being promoted as friends of the gods of the gods.
In general, the phermural short models called "motorbike" in the day.
The powerful atmosphere of the brain is still closing in black parts; the long blues, broken sweaters, provide a bright view of sport.
Young people used to say that they wanted to lose their clothes and most of them.
He was supposed to save the day.
Now, young people want to carry a piece that will hit the light as much as it's comfortable.
It is possible to say that Loft has correctly understood the target range with the collection and the complete pieces.
Small step for banks, global
The World Premier of the "The Art of Banksy" collection, which brought together Banksy, was made in Istanbul.
The original 85th century was the first of the world's Karakoy building, which was the site of the 15-year-old work.
The first edition of Bansky's secret street manufacturer opened in Istanbul on the first day of World War II.
Of course, there was no famous artist in the world who was hiding his identity and using his personal name.
And we don't know he's not coming to Istanbul.
But according to Sergein's author Steve Lazaridas, Bansky doesn't even know about it.
There's no situation where he needs his permission.
Because the old friend Bansky and Lazaridas' path was broken 12 years later.
Some of the cells that have been processed have been collected from the collectors of Lazaridas and some of the collectors.
But there are things that Bansky's followers are curious about.
What did Banksy think about the art of Banksy, which was brought to an end by 85?
For example, how did they cope with the introduction of the electric bill (35 TL)? What did he say if he saw a small store that was built at the end of the 800 m2 gallery area?
Does the red Babylonn girl, the cleaning woman, sound like the world's worst of all?
It would be a shame for the Banksy followers to be brought into the possession of such property by an aristocratic spirit-containing producer.
It's not the kind of Banksy.
But you still get the tickets on the limit number!
The great series for the small, global world for the Banksy can be seen as far as the moon of the "The Art of Banksy."
Those are the lowliest, the wrongdoers.
If they go, they'll be punished.
Colonel Recep Tayyyyy and Erdogan, took his stand for the academics who signed the announcement.
He said, “They are wrongdoers, and they are the ones who are the losers.”
Indeed, those who are wrongdoers are wrongdoers.
He said, “They have done the same thing, because they are with the disbelievers.”
Recep Tayyyyip Erdoğan, who fought for the explosion in Sultanahmet, said, "In this action in the Sultanahmet Meedan, an area that is known as history and culture, there is a conflict in this region - in the near future of Germany - we need to share our sympathy with the German Mayor and the German Chancellor in a region like this.
And I want to get out of here with the families of those who have died before my wishes to the German people."
He said, "We will continue our fight against terrorism."
Erdoğan, who was referring to the academics who signed the notice, said: "I am especially jealous of those who have signed the academics, and I am violent."
It doesn't make anyone realize who our people are much closer to, that is, Professor, that they're just stupid.
These are the people who are merciful.
It is they who are the wrongdoers, and it is they who are the low ones.
And they were guilty of the same crime, because they were with the disbelievers.
And where will those three-year-olds who're going to be in Qinar, who's going to be with their father?
How do these guys get to take a seat next to his killers?
I'm inviting all the courts, university senators, and our laws to take action on the basis of these actions.
Yesterday, I said the steps to be taken should be postponed.
So let them go wherever they want them to.
Those who want to do politics should be political in parliament.
But if they don't do it in parliament, they'll go, they'll be shot or they'll go to the mountains.
I'm so open and clean.

The red hair of Sultan's hair, the face of Beren, Justin's hair...
Although it is considered normal to try to compare people to one place, psychological discomfort is seen after the point where life begins to affect the whole.
'Celebrity Worship Syndrome', the other 'Celebrity Worship Syndrome', the world's already academia, and we have a new talk.
It can be considered normal for the ladies to run to the Qafra halls with their famous photos.

Only the sides will be short.
After you've finished the cutting process, you'll have to put your hair in light water.
Set your hair with spree help after the presentation process ends.

We're talking about famous people on behalf.
It's normal to be curious about them, to have sex with their lives.
But in most of the young people who have lost the head of the cancer, according to the expert psychologist, it's quite common when there's no names that represent good behavior in the family or around the world.
Not always good examples.
"And they're copying weaknesses, son."

Most people don't have their options.
As for those who possess, they will not be like them.
Or that they were not mine, or that they were not mine.
Those who do not have the means to pay will be given permission and will not be able to live in the same manner."
There's no difference between those who're gypsy or those who're watching over the brain.
They're both dreaming of being drunk.

Dr. Fevzi is sorry, answering questions in the office of the Meydan newspaper.
I have a bone in my skin, and every morning when I wake up, I go out to the bathroom with my wife's pain after meals, two or more times a day.
Could that also stop me from giving my kilo?
I'm starting to use it right now, but I don't want to eat, I can't give you a kilo.
That's what I've been doing since I was a kid.
What am I supposed to do?
Do you think I'm supposed to have an operation?
CEVAP: The white blood cell usually has an infection.
It is a sign that when you eat the pain of this woman who grows from the meal, it is as if you were on the brink of a scalding rag and you release her to the folds of the palm-tree.
If you cry because of a long journey, you'll be able to throw it out immediately.
That's why you're going to the bathroom often.
And because you're going out in the cool tub, it's getting your food out of hand, and it's slowing down your kilo.
I think you need to fix this situation.
If you go to a gastro enterologist and you're diagnosed with what I'm saying, you can get rid of this condition using antibiotics.
But in the end, you may have to have a sachet surgery.
The underlying probation may reduce your anxiety a little, but it won't.
I'm telling you, whatever you want to do, keep using the probation.
Because the biggest help for your failure is probiotic dust.
I'm eating a lot of food when I'm stressed.
When I'm stressed and pregnant, I give myself food and I take kilos.
How can I cope with this?
CEVAP: The demand for extra food means that the energy needs are not really met.
It could be a little food, or it could cost them breakfast and breakfast.
Another reason is that you can't control the muscles you eat.
To do this, your nervous system needs to work well.
If you're listening, responding or having a problem like that, or using a probationary drug, it's easy.
You'll see more.
I don't know why the doctors don't know why.
You've got information that's usually due to a weakness.
It's all very reasonable for me, but my situation is a little different.
I can't take a pound.
I don't know why it's important.
He doesn't say anything to the doctors.
CEVAP: The techniques we use are not just a failure to achieve the physical work of the body, turning it back into ideal sizes.
Poverty and poverty are the same problems.
It's the same technique that can't take kilograms to weight.
And you're more weak when you eat the sweet and fresh meat.
I think you've already understood that.
You too may be warned by carbon point and take kilograms without a healthy supply.
I mean, you've fallen out of your ideal body.
The rest of our patients have gone away from their ideal bodies.
You'll reach your ideal body by weight, and they'll reach it by weight.
If the system gets out of the middle, you get kilograms, they'll give kilos too.
But first, the system needs to work properly.

A child is turning himself into a 'freat' from being worthless.
There's some sense of the human emotion that's born in the world.
Fear, sorrow, joy, surprise, sorrow, anxiety...
But hatred, anger, and feelings like resentment come into play in children, as well as in some wrong attitudes.
Every man needs to be able to be smarter than his childhood.
So you respect the decisions of the head or of the social environment, ask yourself questions and feel that they are worth it.
These are the basis for a healthy person to be made.
For example, when it comes to the child’s choice of clothing (what to wear, what to eat), it means that he does not respect his child’s character, not ignoring his wishes, and that he is directed to his own rights (the child who wants to go to football) instead.
A child who is not respected for his identity and his existence and who is deprived of freedom of 'free' creates a sense of guilt and hatred in the community.
"Because, in fact, it's quite different to being angry and hated." Psychologist Hilal Arslan says that the child doesn't accept what he has done to himself, that he is worth it, and that he tries to tell himself and his environment.
A psychologist who doesn't accept the child's condition and therefore reacts to it as a result of his personality development, says, "The hatred here means 'I have', and it serves to protect the child's self-respect."
He says, "If you're allowed to have a child, you're gonna get mad."
He tries to protect his identity by protecting his children, his children, his children, and his hatred.
Arslan, who says that when children are left mentally and emotionally disabled by their parents in their younger years and in the most vulnerable and most vulnerable times, they are likely to live with a feeling that their existence is unknown and invisible.
Arslan goes on to say: "This can sometimes be in a way that only the need is emotional (not to love, not to sleep, not to talk to school or other need), and sometimes the physical needs (to eat, drink, go to school, etc.) are not met."
It's a development that has opened the door to hate.
In emotional and verbal violence there are acts of humiliation, humiliation, humiliation, torture, unnecessary and heavy punishment, a feeling of worthlessness, and a feeling of emptiness.
These behaviors affect a child’s character in a very serious way.
"The child, or the child, learns the respect he feels for himself and tries to protect himself from feelings of unappreciative, inhumanity and inhumanity."
