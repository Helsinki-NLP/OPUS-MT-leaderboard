The rest of UNIP who reject those who live with HIV are a perfect example.
You are talking about when Nigel Farage said that NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the United Kingdom for health tourism, and when, with this in mind, he answers yes specifically when the interviewer asks him whether people living with HIV are included in the inadequacies.
First you use special arguments, and then you discount them by using a veal pendulum homophobia.
Every time I or my family need NHS, we have to make the backbone of the intlerants to chronic hypocondria who think they're all right.
I think it's you who use special arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the right corners, does not exist in practice.
I think that's what we call democracy.
So no one would be affected by UKIP measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
There is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell may appear as a revolutionary.
A quote drawn from a torch is not evidence.
Yes, you'll get the message.
Mail didn't write the report, he just commented on it.
Those controlling the majority of the media in this country should be put in place to spread such popular propaganda as if it were the reality.
I don't think you know what a special argument is.
You don't know anything about my personal situation or my identity, so you should pay attention when you try to kill the debate with homophobia charges.
Farage's phrase is quite surprising, but only because we rarely talk about this problem.
He has made absolutely no homophobic remark.
You'll have to succeed in giving it back to you.
I'm not sure where you want to come from, but I imagine you don't like when the media talk about what you don't like.
We speak so rarely because contrary to Farage and his loyal disciples of Thatcher who think AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that mankind's complexities are something good, then not.
Finally, the situation is also serious in Ireland and in Spain.
With the new crisis that takes place during the austerity period, there will be nothing.
Waiting for nearly 5% of growth in 2015 is a great pleasure.
Ireland has the ''TIGRE OF EUROPE' for us, there are a few annexes.
We've met the next time!
That begins reading the article again.
It is attempting to believe that Ireland is a vertical country and that a '' NEW ECONOMIC MIRICLE' is being produced.
With the Brussels agreement, taxes on the lowest companies in Europe, a three-time job market, a continuing migration.
With these ingredients no "'''dowish" for the moment with the coming of the Poles.
In the 1980s, Ireland was one of the poorest countries of the European Union, with Portugal In view of a constant period without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was in front.
That their development was not a long calm stream, it is in view of recent events.
The lowest impact rate in Europe?
That's wrong!
Latvia has an impact rate of 0% on companies.
There is now a real hypocrisy in France on the part of policies on taxes actually paid by multinationals.
If a report is believed to be issued in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in France in general.
Only SMEs pay well.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge, and there are new (and expensive) cars on all sides of the road, just as before the 2008 crisis.
I have lived in Dublin for 14 years, the repetition is evident in the daily mouths since the return.
Is it supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon come to light.
In another article that they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra is involved in an A140 acceleration.
Does Ryanair now count to transfer passengers from one flight to the other in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of devices, so some boxes and wires on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That's what I'm saying with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of these two guys once again.
So that would be entirely the mistake of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair pay the passengers extra for the additional fear we wanted to provide them?
But without this kind of Irish business, you couldn't afford to leave on vacation, young man
I've never taken Ryanair, and the last three times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers a quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can give them joy.
No matter what the article on Ryanair begins out of dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair instead of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay other than the basic fee are only taking it to themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with additional costs due to this incident.
I ask what will be the delay and if it is necessary to compensate passengers and, if that is the case, if Ryanair can avoid paying by saying that it was an error of airport inspectors.
The passengers were put in another plane for less than an hour, they were entitled to no compensation.
I'm sorry to lose you and your pension dreams.
Welcome to this British Airways flight that runs the English ISIS in Syria, not as you say.
Good Travel
Last Sunday in Paris, France-Bourgeois Street: the Marais is in large parts of the world, and it is literally growing.
People do not come to a mass for the quality of restaurants (anywhere, for most) or for the Review Room in the Whites-Mantaaux Space (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the stores are all open and that the neighborhood is incredibly alive and animated.
With many foreigners who depend..
Do you think the opening of the Monday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Frances Bourgeois where the shops are open on Sunday, worldwide with 50% tourists.
@aloes Faux!
The only argument that seemed acceptable to me is that of areas receiving an important number of foreign tourists, and it is shaken by the fact that they buy in retail.
Tourist areas lose a considerable volume of business for the same reasons each year.
It remains the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, can reduce prices.
Dominic rest is a right that benefits, except exceptions, employees.
That is why it is planned and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister for Economic Affairs nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs, nor the rest, nor the Minister for Economic Affairs, have the least competence to reform the labour code.
Then they blow her up.
What is the law for?
To satisfy a part of the population and businesses that want to work on Sunday.
In Montreal on Sunday, I will take my little children to the municipal library.
In my City of 30000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the wee!
This is access to culture ...
And this is also the rule of working time.
the way of life he has defended with tenacity against fascism
the way of life he has defended with tenacity against fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter's succession was, against her will, used to pay the expenses?
There are paintings.
Some are good, others not terrible.
No doubt his succession would want to be his part of the chest, if you'd like to express it to me.
His preference for a victory for nationalists/Franco in the Spanish Civil War...
And his hostility to the independence of such places as Ireland and India and his fascist ideas in all of them, and also add his well-known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
I'm not anymore.
But for five years, and only for five years, he was perfect.
In 1940 he took the lead in other government aristocrats who wanted to discuss a “agreement ” with the Nazis and was greatly rewarded.
Thanks to its magnificent rétoire and its energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting against fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, France, Belgium and, in the end, the whole world can thank God for having these five years, just those five years, Churchill at the bar and nothing else.
The size of Churchill has nothing to do with this debate.
Its descendants sell free market paintings in order to collect the money of the succession costs, they could even benefit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, they gather the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use tax money.
When it was “the time of truth, ” Churchill’s personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
A slowdown in the internal market by public works will only benefit large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding charging, infrastructure buildings are not refurbishable.
With regard to the social reforms proposed by the Minister, they are well reflecting the true French illusory: lack of confidence in dialogue
Return to the values of the prince.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
May the weakest of us not be in need!
Whether we come to his assistance with a solidity, it has DROIT in exchange for services that it has made or has made to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H that I prefer to the smile corresponds to this vision.
There is also the whale who lives from his property's income.
There is a difference between the one who invests for a return at the time of his retirement and the one who lives from his pensions.
A good thing to do is look at two for a couple on top, it's time.
The small genius of the Finance only lacks imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of shortage in large infrastructures.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
Developing countries are subject to supervision.
The need for infrastructure is marginal, so in no way a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the issue of redundancy arises in response to a recession which is only a wild redness so brutal
You should have reason 30 years ago: more needs (or possibilities) of bars, coal mines, autoroutes...
But if we want to reduce the future climate-energy shock, then the need for investment is growing: isolation, railway network renewal, urban transport, transport and energy storage, etc.
Taxation that promotes high income and pensions.
Who's in power?
Obtained by smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a gallopin.
Samsung's benefits are damaged by iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
The introduction by AppleTM of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have been sold by buyers who would not have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided for LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a client, but not for Apple's benefit.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft introduced this philosophy, we knew a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open-source community.
We must have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and they cannot be met by one manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I love their underprivileged philosophy and appreciate the design.
Some people do not attach any value to the design, for them the options, functionality and price.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let's stop looking for "a better platform".
Is there "a better car manufacturer", not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a flowering port industry, with radically different approaches for people and different markets.
It's healthier and has to be encouraged.
That's what's in our interest to all.
I'm glad you've found exactly what you're looking for and that it's not an Apple product, even if I made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our fellow empfrontists who, according to one of them, fight the ideas and not the men (in contrast, even on Parisians) could tell us what author(s) they're fighting the ideas of the kind and tell us the books they're just trying to fight.
Or do they just attack the kind described in The Figaro, Minutes or Current Values?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, Jean, I love you very much, and you're some intelligent and cultivater.
I said this about Judith in the wine of Furusato calling Holopherne, who had not come near me (I have no life of mind).
Otherwise, in the "back", because you bring it back, I don't care, and I honestly don't see where the problem is: I hope you and your friends can get me out of my drive, because I'm slow but I understand...
@ Jean: recognize that, culturally, take Judith back to Holopherne, that's what it is.
Who was afraid to ask the World?
But of what do we fear those who fear?
Furasato and @ provide us with answers.
The first by calling on Judith of the Bible, the second by qualifying Judith Butler for a very symbolic gorge breaker.
We see how closely these studies affect them.
We are obviously no longer in the debate.
It's another thing, much deeper.
@ Have you read,Jean, that the World published an article on the need for theology?
@: With regard to an idea debate, I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
I don't think I'm very strict about fighting ideas from the only exposure to their tractors ( Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Genre or X Lacroix, theologian).
But as I explained to our friend empfrontist, it is all the difference between having a clear opinion and a simple opinion.
I'm not on anything else that he's got the nuance.
I didn't read Judith, the very symbolic cave breaker, I'm happy with the "second sex" (it was more than my time) which I believe is the source of "the source" according to Lo's views.
As I looked at the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon quickly showed when clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and compensated a little for the disappointment of having the view sometimes blocked by clouds.
It was great here at FNQ.
Yes, the cloud of the last night would really close the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had a clear time.
Special flash blood moon.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey makes the lab responsible.
But if the Labour accepts our unfair budget, we will give it its true color as soon as possible.
You're obsessing, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne then, of course, I saw only clouds.
Melbourne has also been able to cover for the entire week of the rain of Perseide meteors and for virtually all important astronomical phenomena in recent years.
I start to think there's a bad genius whose only purpose is to prevent the people of Melbourne from seeing what this is from heaven.
Melbourne is not really the best place for an observer, even though things are much better on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes where I couldn't see the eclipse because of clouds above the Melbourne pool.
I'm gonna put a TAXE on this eclipse.
THIS EQUIPMENT looks at this eclipse should pay a TAXE.
I think your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last one before you fall.
Who or what will surprise you when it comes to the end of the fire?
You seem to spend a lot of time reading the discussions by looking for messages that people are critical of the Abbott government to then accuse EUX of being obsessive.
Superbe photo of the moon above Sydney's Harbour Bridge.
We'd say Mars would go into collating with Earth!
Nothing about bourgeois and real estate speculation.
Nothing about the inequality between labour and capital income.
Nothing about tax fraud.
Another liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too or not.
The details and arguments of these claims are not given.
There is no hypertext link to original documents in order to make an opinion.
Let's see today on Tuesday 15 October the results of the miraculous revenues: in Spain, exports have been at the lowest for five years.
In Greece the bourgeois is sinking.
However, it seems that there are examples to follow.
The reform of the notes would generate a request for compensation of EUR 8 billion.
The Department of Economic Affairs claims that these applications for compensation are not based.
What if the Department of Economic Affairs errs?
Will the decision-makers who have organized the political benefit resulting from the bold attack of the notaries have the same courage when the bill is presented to the state budget?
It's his time.
Okay, thanks, JYL....
@lol Not the State is not comparable to households with regard to the management of its budget because the time horizon of the State is theoretically infinite while the household is born by the life span of its members.
In addition, unless public expenditure is considered to be ineffective, it contributes to the financing of tangible and intangible investments in tomorrow's growth and thus future revenue.
A few elements of the answer.
A sad decision.
But remember the sacred promise of Hippocrate: the health of the benefits of world pharmaceutical societies must be preserved first.
Jolie's theory of the conspiracy.
Unfortunately the truth does not match your fantasy.
The medical staff would like to be able to serve them, but they have their hands tied to the law as it is written by the politicians.
It is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risks of surgical intervention, the shots secured for drug users rather than having them in the streets, etc.
On these issues politicians want to please the innocent masses.
In fact, doctors do not earn money from drugs.
That's why there are pharmaceuticals.
doctors don't earn money with drugs Because the Liberians want our health system to look like the United States, you should tell you how it works.
Doctors around the world are briefed in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been wrong to put the mistake on the pipes, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to the benefits of businesses and "search".
So read some rare reports about our pharmaceutical costs and the negotiations with pharmaceutical companies in relation to other countries.
Compare the world prices of medicines present everywhere, as well as the differences from one country to another on what is being sold free or only on orders.
This is strengthened by a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, either directly or indirectly.
In fact, some companies are currently testing Marijuana's inhalations against oncological pain, despite the laws that restrict them and the honours necessary.
Although manufacturers of certain medicines are likely to be happy only with alternatives such as marijuana, those who come to a version offering good quality products at known doses will benefit widely.
I'm sorry to tell you, lady, but you're mistaken, there's a lot of things going on in the colleges for doctors and pharmaceuticals.
As far as the hospital was concerned, they were happy to serve until someone put the powder in the ear of a hospital official.
We can't make a list of patents on the tree...
If "researchers" in social sciences did research instead of policy and networking, their "work" could be used.
An investigator, he doesn't compare one fact to another.
Compare is not looking.
To compare is not to make the pedagogy of research.
It cannot be said that "the search has to be applied" and then in the same jet "it has to be experienced at all times".
If your research is boring, why do you try?
If your research isn't boring, why do you ask why we're applying it?
Can I explain how a "researcher" might be discouraging that a student who cannot imitate the mathematics alone could easily be like the mathematics and other materials?
New technologies allow students to learn the condition that they learn to use new technologies but how would they get to learn new technologies if they don't know how to learn?
The step tests are only a indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory.
What does it mean to build an indicator that informs you of what is going on, a self-promotion will, a fraud?
The only path to train teachers is to avoid the training of sophists and psychologists and to teach practitioners.
factory reject the paragraph on the stages (which helas is not very argumented) and you will see that your conclusion leads us to the most ineffective conservation: "It is a device that leads first to the reproduction of current practices, and does not allow the system to progress " .
In view of the general consensus on the status of the French system we cannot wish only practitioners to teach practitioners, even if they have their full place in a modern teacher training
Theorists of education must have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you mind being operated by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never put his foot in an operational block before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the educational system.
Giving more weight to the theoretical of education would definitely destroy it.
Your analogity is completely fragrant: if I didn't like to be operated by a practitioner who has only a theoretical training, I would rather be working by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned about the task.
Mike Weatherley, the conservative member responsible for the fight against copyright violations by David Cameron
Why didn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exams thank you.
If one day I begin to feel guilty of violating the author's right, I will be able to read an article like that.
In an information economy, violation of copyright = flight.
That's the same thing because they have to quote their sources correctly.
Often, obtaining a license does not cost anything.
No, it's a violation of copyright.
Not the same thing.
Using the content without adequate license, you private artists from their payroll.
You can always discuss peding hypotheses - but that's the flight.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it won't become so real.
It's a violation of copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I begin to feel guilty of violating the author's right
Obviously, this does not bother you to privacy the artists of their income.
If they think that they should receive money for images used in school duties, a very perfect definition of what should be a reasonable use, then I am happy to take them out of this fictitious income.
Lesson 1 should be shown how, if children themselves create anything and publish it on their preferred social networks, they will abandon any intellectual property on the site under the general conditions they have made a click.
Perhaps if they share the audiences of their mp3 ballader with a partner in the school bus, they should be expelled for violating the law in this way.
Oh, if we could export this resource that we're using, the liar who says everything's going to be wrong...
If it is a PS member who claims it, then we must believe it.
I have 2 children and when they are old to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed from here.
France draws people to the bottom in the constant attendance.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy will have created.
What brings France to the bottom is the speeches like you.
@gus I've been working in a private company ever since.
I had the CHANCE to work in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it's rare.
I'm hired because I know I don't have the skills to run a company, and this choice allows me to pull red balls on the zero patterns that I often encounter.
At ease in my pockets I share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he says the horrible truth!
@gus, if we compare with German companies that the heads of French companies are constantly quoted to ask for reforms in France, in Germany the companies have structured their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large and medium and small companies - What do French employers expect to do so??
What's the state holding their hand?
What is this state that they accuse of empire?
@ Jacques L.
Always this anti-primary business couple of yours!
Remember, what have you created as employment, as added value, to be also severe?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In fact, France is faced with an insolvent problem: the incompetence of the heads of French companies unable to create jobs and which discourage and lose while waiting for the State's permanent assistance!
It's terrible!
But they have solutions: removal of the Labour Code, parental duties, taxes, work 45h/week paid 35, and some, leaving on eggs, may claim the reduction of wages without their removal!
I hate to see all the negative comments on this subject.
What is ironic is how people always complain about First Group.
As far as I can see from where I am, Last has not really been an investment for us contributors.
They tried to keep themselves in place rather than transforming themselves.
This does not mean that the ways of making greens are not improved since the West is taking care of them.
But they also improved with their predecessors, including British Railway.
Unfortunately, we don't have the power to do this, hey.
I tried to have them recently, but I couldn't.
Well, the lab's gonna pull us out of here, isn't it...
It's an international branch.
They already operate trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the United Kingdom from creating a more moral society and participating in bids.
But it seems that we are not very well managed, most of our private services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and criticisms when First won the Virgin contract, all to finally cancel the decision.
And it's better: MTR, a Hong Kong company has won the Crossrail operating contract for 8 years.
Well the Labour, as they have repeated during the referendum campaign, is entirely for the commonization and sharing and believes that workers must all go beyond the borders.
It can therefore be assumed that they will be happy with this decision;)
Perhaps because the Dutch management is on good tracks while the British are not.
What ScottRail needs is not just a change in ownership but especially new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchiser.
"It was a fighter girl."
Sir, I have, but I really have this kind of expression.
Suppose the fact that being "battant" is a higher quality than many others, the interest of others, the intelligence, the listening, for example, the fact that being "battant" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancers "battants", which are no longer dead, I know the speakers.
Leaving a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Let's go where we're going to start, too.
I'm not telling you that it's LA condition to manage, I'm telling you it's AIDS.
Nothing to do with anything worthy of...!
When it comes to the examples of your life, there is only you to judge.
It's a start.
Insinuating, it would be only an instant, that we may have the right to get out of a disease or that we may have to stop doing it, is simply a monster.
The body's sweating or not.
A body that escapes, in spite of will, despite trust in medicine, do you have an idea of what C is?
On the contrary, there is no doubt that having strong moral values allows for more readily accepting and preparing heavy treatment, to try experimental treatments as this woman did, and not to reject them with fear.
Someone who's fighting medicine is first of all someone who trusts medicine.
But if we prefer to return to "Lord" it's another thing..
Not with merit or courage.
These considerations are for moralists.
When you catch a salad, a real one, you're going to throw yourself off the point of becoming just a zombie.
I personally caught two, Salettes, big ones, and if I'm "battu" as these psychologists say, it's completely out of my mind.
Unless this fight is to close your teeth, to suffer the fire, and to cover your teeth.
I believe that the charge against Milosevic had been decided and finalized a decade ago.
I haven't seen that name in the papers since at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten anniversary.
The process was carried out “fastly ” and then buried under the carpet.
Is this the story we related at the time?
Has the communist become a nationalist who has started three wars in the Balkans over the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what has been voluntarily left by: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under the LA MINDRE rule of international law?
What country did Serbia attack you?
As for RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why not mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, he would be evaluated by the Western compressor.
The West used a smoke screen to detach a part of a sovereign State that then unilaterally declared its independence and was fully recognized by the Western States who then lied about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, mentioned here, died politically after his first mandate in order not to understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the day.
Finally, the Guardian should not qualify Milosevic from Tiran (even if we do not like him).
In my knowledge, there is only one method of predicting seismicism in Greece, measuring the level of pézoelectric in the quartz.
This kind of study is incredibly useful and thanks to us for sharing the results.
A hope, then, is to put this water to nothing, according to a study conducted by Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine of the University of Maryland.
Method to be followed.
Like those who involve animals with a threat of arrival.
Thank you, Master of Science, for providing us with these experimental trials that are carried out in the world.
How would the animals be saved ( Before )?
There is no doubt about the perception of other elements whose rate changes in case of seismo.
Like the radon, for example.
A gas has inodori priori for man but may be depleted by animals.
All these methods are detectable for man, but not for the measuring instruments he has.
But we don't have any reliable results on these tracks...
It has always been observed (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely for a few hours with a seismic, including chicken, cow, dog but especially fish and snakes.
I have seen an art report relating to the fight against two scientific teams, one California, the other Japanese, to recognize the validity of their work on the sensitivity of animals to terrestrial magnetic fields, and in particular their modification before a six-year-old.
Well, I'm not scientific, but their assumptions convinced me!
Or are we on these research?
Why are you so angry about this track?
We should learn to listen to nature...
If we examine things calmly and strictly, we publish them in a serious review, and no one hates them.
As soon as we speak of the "signs" given by the animals, we get the same way: the whole world will remember that 5 minutes before a sysism the red fish would suddenly turn around.
I don't understand that we can think that Boris would be a good leader for the Conservatives.
He did it too much as a mayor of London.
When we listen to the LBC program we can't stop thinking that this man knows nothing and that he's always trying to make a difference with a blog.
He never answers directly to any of these.
He also said he agreed with Farage, and then the representative asked him what.
He couldn't count one point.
He made so many promises to make himself a mayor and he didn't keep it alone.
It's just to highlight what the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bunch of shit, isn't it?
Because he's popular.
Because he's crazy.
He was in "Have I Got News For You".
Because it's a celebrity and people's worship of celebrities has been involved.
The Londoners voted for him and will be the same for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) take the direction of the party, the rate of popularity of the Tories will cover the ceiling I am certain.
May God help us.
I'm not so sure: people love blogs, but they don't want their prime minister to be one.
That's exactly what we said about Londoners.
He should have given his friend the parpaing, smarter than him.
Anyway, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as President.
The French are truly and are always disappointed with the history of the war of the Pacific.
For all who have been punished for reading a few books (there exists, including a French and excellent B.
Millot), the "Solomon" and the "ferraial destruction" speak, as unfortunately as the dead who remain there.
It is understood that the Australians who knew (one of their heavy crossers, Australia, must always be there since the battle of Savo) did not want to return there.
We're actually gone before the island of Savo, in the Iron Bottom Sound.
Even if the mission comes to an end.
It's very small.
But the side here is a total inflammation.
Calculate the kerosene consumed in order to achieve the objective of fully deredabilising the concept..

Your story makes me look back, identifying me a little at the passage (I have also learned to sail with the Crocos de L'Elorn to Moulin Blanc on Brest!).
Chapter also for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of the movement.
The end justifies the means.
Continue to review us, and show with enthusiasm that the Bretons are great travelers!

Bonsoir I think that the red flag that has shown against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the British Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local communities and public agencies of all kinds should not spend a sum of our taxes on financing the dreams of some adventures as sympathetic as those there!
Are there players in the current Serbian training that is of Kosovar origin?
I know Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, sometimes at the Youth and now in Fenerbahce, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still in the team.
This is Bisevac, Lyon's defense officer, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was in the mid-70s and early 1980s and trained many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and has played as an attack on Velez's great team, which, under the guardianship of the legendary Solomon Rebac, has completed twice in the Yugoslavian league (and has also had points such as Vahid Hallilhodzic and the faithful team of Arsene Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you, Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just by curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a big player when he was in the Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was connected to Blackburn *fresson*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to Fener, and as far as I know he's not entitled.
Maybe he can do something else, maybe in the Super Indian League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, there's no fear.
You should love Albania because you're a neighbor.
The trick is that this drone's suit is not the true Albanian suit today.
Apparently it was the flag of the Great Albania, which includes all regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A bit of excessive nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (which I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian suit with the map not of what is called the Great Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give the country’s shoes to neighboring countries.
How can we feel "an explosion of joy" seeing two towers deepening knowing that women, men and children are undoubtedly inside?
How's it going?
What I'm wearing a little bit in this "witnessing", is that the only fact that I've been able, is that once, suddenly, to rejoice in the terrible death of thousands of people, to witness in my eyes a "board line" personality that all "witnesses" should be taken with the greatest circumspection.
Without a doubt, in the short time of "joie", we will not have thought of the dead or the reality of the torment.
We will have just thought, once, that, for once, Muslims had succeeded in really and apocalypticly harming the great evil Satan in his own heart.
Make qqch powerful.
That's great.
It would seem that this feeling had been shared by thousands of Muslims who felt humiliated by their feelings of humility.
With witnesses filmed in Palestine.
Classic Shadow joy.
We had a little doubt.
The "Christian/Blanc/Gaulois" event cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the Muslim when it perceives the general poverty, the social and cultural development of the Muslim Arab world of today.
I'm talking about Cairo or Alger's faubourgs, not Dubai Tours.
The past mirror, of course, is not a comfort, on the contrary.
How does the Muslim world get out of this devilish darkness?
At the same time, 2 major poisions in the Arab world are inextricably opposed: the bigotism of power in place and the fascinating nihilism.
The common point, the gel of thought and the excommunication (duce or army) of its critical expression.
That we've understood it before, it's not necessary to re-examine the Muslims.
It's the only way.
Are you sure you want to close this article?
I guess it's true in many countries.
But in Great Britain, the Automune marks the beginning of six long months of nightmares, tired and depressed that affect the well-being and humor of many people.
In addition, everyone falls sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering myself.
When the light goes, it becomes the hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help with humor and well-being.
The autumn is beautiful in Great Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign in particular is to cut the breath automatically.
Not so much to cut the breath as the green of the summer when everything is alive instead of being on the point of death.
In Great Britain, if you have the chance, the summer falls a week-end.
We've had a beautiful summer this year, don't make your grench that cuts the clichés!
Not everyone.
I rarely fall sick in winter.
But now I'm in retirement and I'm no longer developing immunity to the brothers outside, it can change, I guess.
It's not about dying, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of awestruck, with a febricity that culminates with festivals such as Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of hate and other wonderful words.
It's enough not to stop doing things!
Here's my recommendations for the parties for you.
Yes, these months of sleep and gray make me actually much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of growth for children , this is the amount achieved by the State which is mainly from the dates 8 to 10 .
However , with regard to the number of households that have seen their tax increase to this extent , these are in particular the figures 4 and 5 which are related ( average income ) according to Figure 2.
The elimination of the half-party in relation mainly to widows is not of any treaty in the article or rather of its impact is fully assessed: 230M of Euros is a pleasure which does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and is understood to be incorrigible.
And it's not ready to get organized.
Well, we're not on the real ball, but we're singing.
For once the PS makes a rather left-wing policy we won't cry...
Of course, those who are part of 20% of the richest must bear much more than 75% of the tax increase, why not 90%?
Continue to do so and encourage these 20% to work less or to leave.
Well, I know, that's not politically correct, but I'll tell you when.
Live the Trots and OCIs recycled in the PS: they have everything.
Adam, you see what you look at.
The ratio is always the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population has 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax, it's when it's forbidden to anyone to hide as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit, the money loses all its usefulness.
And once the use of money is exceeded, money is no longer used to make money, i.e. to make the greatest number of harm.
We're part of 20% of the richest.
There is no doubt also 20 per cent of those who work most (and create the wealth of which part is lawfully redistribution).
A fair tax must allow these banks to benefit from some of their efforts.
Or so much to lower your arms and live in social minimums, especially if you have a social housing.
The tops of the heads of heads in the red khmer have been happy to live.
I've done two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things that we would not have been in a 5-star hotel and we had no time to get to the reception or face the least concerns.
It's enough to go to someone, to sleep there, to run back and forth.
It'll be my first choice when I'm on my way.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your house.
In most cases you will need a kind of ownership insurance.
Make sure to use a service with the good logo!
Ah, 6h too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and very risky" No, it's not true.
You've just really missed a chance.
According to the link provided in the article:
At its download, Airbnb's response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
At 24 hours after an e-mail provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locker to change the locks, made provisions to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is secured, but even when).
So why does Teman mention this article complaining that he received no support from Airbnb?
I love AIRBNB, to get you a way to travel
Good morning I'm looking for people who have already used bnb just to comfort me.
I'm planning to pay an account and a month's rent, but I'm a little afraid to send $1,600 to a site I've never really heard of.
But where are you going?
"Supporting the troops," sang the Bu$herie on all the tone...
So non-violence weapons.
I'm sure this will make families and close friends of thousands of dead Kurds to be able to learn that their parents and friends have been subjected to something other than the chemical bombings of Saddam Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain Polish).
In addition, what would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that chemical weapons discovered nearly 20 years later were still useful?
It is not too clear the author's style: "to search for weapons of mass destruction.
We're fine.
You think it's time to slow down the army to strengthen education.
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still in war.
Alternative: IS IT TIME to strengthen education, because we are still in war?
There would already be a lot of strengthening education if they were "worked" at 35 hours instead of 17.
At the same time, our teachers are gaining more than engineers.
And we do not believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their programs.
But this is not seen because National Education does not have the means to provide an office to college/lycée to its professors, so they burn in them.
A type of cable forced into the sum, except that the employer pays neither the computer, the Internet connection, nor the supplies.
Also, it's so much the plan at 17h per week and 4 months of vacation that we don't get to fill the maths CAPES, come, we'll wait for you.
How did you not want to have some bad-educated chips that your parents are scarring you by treating you as a branler?
I think that the priority in this area is to disarm the Jihadites so that the Kurdish population can better expand.
Where we can see that Bush administration has absolutely nothing to do with it.
My first degree job was in the sale in London three times, and it was still a job for which a degree was needed.
A year later, I saw an announcement to be opened for the London Metro, which was paid $5,000 a year more than a year and we didn't even ask for the patent.
I've never regretted it.
In this regard, you don't do it if you don't find a degree job, try to find anything that pays well or you like to do.
If I had stayed in a job, I would still have paid my student loan
I don't like work in the business, so I hope to end up in both public service and university.
LOL LOL This article is coming really late!
Exactly, when I got my degree in 2011, there was already a three-year run.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
Breaking out of soft hair like art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy/political sciences is what we call chommer diplomas.
I've got one of these diplomas and I've finished the production director.
It turns out that the important was not the degree, but, as the article above says, a good professional course, starting at school and all along the university.
Of course, the starting wage was lower but we quickly climb the stairs because in the real world, what counts is the results more than knowledge.
This debate of engineering/artificial fairs has lasted for years.
Scientists cannot solve all the problems, it is more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time, and interact with people in order to achieve results.
Letters, philosophy and art are bubunishes?
It's ridiculous.
I suppose you're talking about diplomas such as media studies or whatever the record is missing where you're going.
Letters, philosophy, political sciences and art are true women.
We need people who can explain the great issues to the students, who understand the importance of cultural bases such as literature, art, etc., and value them.
Would it not be better for a genuine territorial policy to disarm Paris and dynamize the rest of France?
Personally, I see the inhabitants of the end-funds of Essonne and Val-d'Oise make 80km back on bicycle every day to come to work in Paris.
Intra-murants and small-room residents already have a number of other common means of transport (metro, bus, tramway).
> Several secure and locked parks, as they already exist in the cities of northern Europe, Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
Good idea.
On the surface, the space is channelled by the 2RMs.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris is working with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
So much to benefit from their great experience in the field.
Well, we haven't found a place for A SEUL device for a bicycle acceleration.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Well, it's not gonna be all right.
When we discuss with drivers and other users of common transport for which they do not suffer, it seems to me that the main reasons they come from are: 1/ is a dangerous hyper with all these vans, these trucks, these helicopters that run super fast and are coming from the survival of the vehicles 2/ they take full of pollution in the head To me the cyclable tracks are steps to go, it is necessary to reduce the driving movement ( urban type load load), reduce the speed (Paris = zone 30), to comply with the road code systematically (even when the bicycles are required to adjust the code of the road that is written on the road, so that they are able to travel through the streets of the public pools, where the pools are not located in 100 years).
The cyclable tracks are of apartheid, but it is necessary to rebalance the occupation of the urban area.
Nothing on the bike in the big Paris?
Not a word on the road in common transport?
EELV's right.
The target of 15% of round movements is ridiculous.
I'm starting to think Anne Hidalgo has rolled the greens in the oven.
In addition to reading what OR reports, the ELVs seem to be skeptical.
You'd rather be optimistic.
Before the rocket starts, it would be better to find who's really hiding behind this mask.
Index: this is not Russia.
I'm not sure to love the way the world evolves.
It looks horrible.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case to CEDH, but I did not understand that a complaint had been filed effectively.
In addition, they should first lodge complaints in Germany or Ukraine.
I also hope that these cases will be resolved by waiting for the outcome of the accident investigation and the criminal investigation that would result.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow Pan Am 103 no more.
Malaysia Airlines is not in the wrong place, the failure lies with the authority responsible for the security of the airspace, in this case the Ukrainian Government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had previously been fired, Ukraine had launched in the area of air attacks against the rebels, and all aircraft could certainly be considered as a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian Government taken reasonable precautions in view of an obvious threat or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocents so that airlines can pay the rights of the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls who defend their government as a usrpater / the ultranationalists of West Ukraine - and who want to show in great measure that Putine has defeated the MH17 flight.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the government of Kiev because they are responsible for what is going on in their heavens.
The previous: a 1986 judgment of the International Court of Justice that concluded that the provision by the CIA of weapons to the opposition forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for its actions.
There's no chance that Russia will let this case go to the ICJ.
It is important to think that Abbott is saying to Putin that Australians have been murdered by rebels supported by Russia.
I hope he can provide evidence to support his allegations.
So far, the investigators haven't said anything like that.
His name's Ricardo and be such a beauty in eco, it's afflicting!
The name Polaire is lost in the north and happy.
One simple question is: is the poverty of today more poor than the poverty of yesterday?
I can't stop to notice that those who are most virally critical of the book of Piketty have not read it!
It's easy to read. I've had a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequality-concentration, inequality of labour income, property of capital, merit and heritage in the term log.
It shows that today's capital concentration combines that from the beginning of the 20th century before 1914, it shows that it is the two world wars that have reduced the capital concentration from 1914 to 1945, and how the concentration continues after...
Bernajuzan: You don't know what.
I'm asking you how long it took you to read this apparently knowing that an individual's concentration capacity is limited to a few limits.
Then, the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is fair or not.
If she is right, we can discuss it without having to read the book which the main purpose is to argue in favour of it alone.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long have you been reading it?
Is the central theme of his poem summarized by the press is false?
I didn't read it and I wouldn't read it.
So I'm going to sum up his central thesis and that's the one that seems to me to be a pure smoker.
The notion of a difference between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Is humanity not globally rich?
And this increase in population growth is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the price without a doubt.
But remember, she's only 17 years old.
An age in which most people begin to find their place in the world.
I hope this price will not be a burden for the young girl and she will find her way to a happy life.
The problem is not the price, but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old addition according to which colored perverts are the incarnation of evil.
All my wishes for happiness in Malala, but she must realize that she is used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the popular areas of Great Britain!
Someone thought his speech was a little strange.
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom, but she said that if she was not where she is now, she would have been married at 14 years of age.
Doesn't she even be part of these "colored evils"?
You shouldn't have any "time to wait" on this site.
You yourselves are a terrible evil.
It's absolutely rebellious.
No, her father didn't marry her at the age of 14.
She was 15 when she was shot.
His father runs a school where girls are educated and he is in favour of equal rights for women.
It is, and has always been, for her to receive higher education and for her right to decide for herself about her marriage.
For this reason, it is something unusual in Pakistan, as far as he thinks women are equal to men.
What she said is that a mean Pakistani girl should often marry at 14 years of age without having her word to say.
I'm sorry she didn't say it out loud enough for you.
This may seem contradictory, but perhaps she means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at 14 years of age.
More disappointed by this entry in season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange, who appears to have a bit of trouble finding her partner from Marlene Dietrich.
I've just seen the last two seasons that are quite different, but I have to admit that it's one of the best series of watches, one of the most boring!
A fascinating first episode.
The achievement is close to perfection and Jessica Lange's show singing the anachronic Life on Mars of Bowie is just turning around.
I haven't seen this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange buf buf buf).
In the case of American Horror Story, I prefer to have all of a couple of times that look at 13 episodes on 3-4 months.
But one thing is on, outside of Jessica Lange's extraordinary, it's mainly the risks of scenes and mounts that were behind me.
The AHS has an original estimate of plans that does not corrode the aseptication of today's productions.
That's a little bit out of me to see you throw your espong forward for the next few months without even waiting to be able to enjoy the quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series, but, you say it anyway, there are other things.
It's not just for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and how she uses it) is really one of the pillarrs of the series outside of technical qualities.
And good bah I look a lot at her.
Then I find that the series is written, she wants too much to do at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in the 2 there was too wide despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them do 10 American Horror Story or it'll end like 24 hours a day.
But it's good for everyone to do what he wants here!
That's why I say, "I won't look later" that everyone is obliged to do the same!
I just share my point of view of nothing more, nothing less.
Jessica Lange's loss, I think she's gonna kill him.
But then, here, it's just my opinion.
In terms of less tax rates, please - cuts rather in State spending.
No, let's increase the costs, please.
Those who wanted to know in spending failed.
Deploying policies on relatively small expenditure posts, such as development assistance
The problem is that this is less than the margin of error in government spending in the United Kingdom.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances instead of changing direction that electors seem to call their wills and for some time, in each camp, they seem to be much more important and substantial than they are - and the voters see clear in their game and find them evil faith.
Less than 1 per cent of expenditure.
"debt" is one of the assets held mainly by financial institutions in this country.
"This" is nothing to worry about.
I would not have any problem with the government's approach to a third of my income (even before talking about consumer taxes) if I thought it would be useful.
But this is not the case, and many contributors feel the same way.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been entirely honest about how to reduce taxes, but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, the subsidies to small-scale windmills and the nuclear centres that cost the double what they should do, you get to a figure that makes the Tax of Labour and Lib-Dem very ridiculous on the most luxurious properties.
Your first £10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who gets $35,000 a year on payroll about £5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with $50,000 would pay around £10,000 (a fifth), etc. and someone with 200 000 pays about £70 000 (a little more than a third).
And social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking costs and the car vineyard, and that is before VAT.
Nearly 30% of my money is taken to the source before local taxes and the car vineyard.
I'm paid in a decent way, but not extravagance.
Not that this is a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But we don't seem to believe that money falls from heaven, or that it's not important to know where billions of tax books are going.
How can a waitress who's looking for work at the port can prove it?
Even though 20% of the hommers wouldn't look, that means 80% are looking and they don't find.
As my own roommate, am I more interested in what others are looking for or not?
That a potential recruiter receives 10 or 20 CV, it increases my chances.
In fact, I haven't had any news from Pauli's Employment for months, does that mean that the agents are more involved in control operations than actually making announcements of employment?
I don't see any interest.
Because it's not for the state to provide work.
If Poland Employment does not provide enough jobs, then you have to move from Poland Employment.
What is it about a sensitive subject?
All of us have rights and duties, in the event that we ensure that we ensure that we perform our duties contrary to their rights.
As a controller, they are entitled to transport to users by means of a means of transport, a service officer or employees of their work, etc.
Nobody creates the scandal in these cases, right?
In fact, it is good to remember that unemployment rights are right: the only two cases in which I was dealing with Poland Employment, my rights to the ERA were wrong, and on one of the files, 40 per cent, there was a firm battle.
It takes time!
I'm not a legal expert.
The file and control are currently taking over, while Paule Emploi is actually close to being an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should concern only employees, that is, those who pay the costs.
Non-Salarian politicians and French have rights that they do not have!
It's not normal.
I would add that a decent unemployment insurance is part of the evaluation of work.
More than waiting for Arab killer tweets...
In fact, there must be a direct military response in Iraq / Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then be similar to the spread of black plague in 1348/9 in connection with war and the displacement of populations at the time.
The Saudis had the intention to ban this year from Hadj to Mexico from the three countries affected by the Muslim pilgrims.
The country reported that 7,400 had seen their visa applications rejected because of their country of origin or their recent travel.
In fact, there was the case of a comerian from Bosnia who contracted the virus in Mexico during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a comerian from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same spirit presence.
Is it not without heart to propose to prevent Ebola's diseases from taking a plane for Europe?
I thought it was a simple sense but apparently those "who know" have decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
These countries in West Africa where Ebola is out of control should be placed in strict quarantine.
Nobody's lucky.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days after treatment of patients before they can go.
If they hire the Ebola virus while they're there, they stay there until they're at war.
This isn't Draconian measures.
Nothing but last week, people were contaminated after having had contacts with people in West Africa, although they took “all the necessary precautions”.
We can stop the spread of this disease.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
We are forbidden to offer volunteers to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with Ebola's typical symptoms, so that they can be immediately placed in quarantine.
It is possible to pass the message of the first and second individual (including religious) group and it will deserve the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt that it is possible to enrich the image of God characterised by the entire cortex of the planet in operation.
He's still far away from this concept there.
It's only 20 years ago that information appears as mankind's first data, while religion, out of the brain, has been directing our actions since maybe Lucy.
What is the interest of becoming a single Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed it, Catholicism is very minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not put their feet in the Church in any way, there is only a small number of protestors in France.
What is the next step, taking away the notion of sin, too "anxiogenic"?
@louise: Sorry the church has no limited vision in France.
And in the world, it may be possible to touch more people...
@Martine E, in order to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you consider it was before Christ.
One century before he had already said, "Don't do to anyone else what you don't want to do to you, that's all the Torah and the rest is just comment: go and study!"
Christianity goes well beyond a simple reciprocity but introduced the apé.
Your "progression of justice, peace, brotherhood" but no God?
Is this a return to communism?:-)
Next step: the incarnation and the resurrection are removed.
Jesus will remain this hero who violated the moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be ready to play their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace, brotherhood.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the low number of Protestants in France is mainly explained by the fact that their ancestors were then eliminated and forced to immigrate a few centuries ago.
I'm too late to buy this, the new alien game, or the Westeland 2.
And the new Elite game soon.
That's not happening.
I would personally choose SoM.
I love Westeland 2 (I even participated in its fund-raising campaign), but I don't think that's worth $30.
If this is the PC version that interests you, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM to £30 and also offers a good 20% reduction.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM to £30 and also offers a good 20% reduction.
I'll take a look.
Of course not at work.
The joys of the computer department block all sympathies.
Hello, is it £30 then 20% reduction, or is it that £30 includes 20% reduction?
However, note: PC version is only for DX11.
I was surprised, I bought it, but I can't play it.
Besides, I bought it on Steam, so no refund is zero.
It's time to buy a new video card * Make the needle*
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam identifier, I think.
I didn't use it myself.
Amazon 30 £ for PC, 35 £ for Xbox 360 and PS3, 44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I would be afraid that one day they will destroy your library if they decide to work against the people who sell it there while they are outside the planned region.
So join Elite's beta version: Dangerous.
So, was France a "potterland" in 1940?
So you say, this Nobel prize has all the air of a gift.
Do you need to love France of 40, that of "the missing stranger"?
When we see who gets the Nobel of literature we ask if Proust or Dostoïevsky would have it today.
Nobel is not even an event, we don't even want to read the primary authors.
Brazilians, Chinese or Australians will read Modiano which is already difficult to read in French and which describes a universe that is so limited and self-centered?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible, but I honestly doubt them.
Modiano, Levy, Musto have only a far-reaching report with literature.
Have you read it at least?
Or another Nobel prize?
That would be better to judge.
Don't worry about the Chinese, the Brazilians and others.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They would appreciate Mr.
Modiano to his fair value, if they don't know him already!
On your side, continue to frequent Levy and Musso.
I share your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso retain all their chances.
So let's see who got the Nobel of Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Say hello to the frescoes.
Since I drove one in Iceland, I don't stop seeing the Kia Sports everywhere.
I think this trick has followed me to this point.
Maybe she wants to break me up?
Do you want me to act like Superman III's horrible computer?
Hello Dantra, always hate her?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my medications.
It's mencredi!
I had a few days of rest.
It was cool.
The last weekend I went to the feast of beer and cadre of Nottingham.
That was ridiculous.
I was able to enjoy 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people down there, there were only Camra fanatics (not confused with the camera fanatics).
The driving on Sunday's return was really hard.
Monday evening we went to the grandpa of a pot to play on the brand card.
Thanks to a real chance to start, I've been able to deal with a few decades ago.
I hope if I reach 95, I'll be as alive as he is.
Yesterday night I went to a cicchi cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks has arrived with a top cut above.
I admire M.
Read a bit of Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That says, without going against you, I think you're a little away from the subject.
This famous total, it prohibits the interrogations for jihādists at the exit of the mosque.
She's not late for arms traffic.
We have big eyes open like Meddeb and Taiya or Boubaker or large eyes closed.
You have to choose.
It's not keeping our eyes closed to the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again, you make a monumental contrast: the whole of the authorities, organizations or associations representing, Muslims or not, who have formally condemned the II and its crimes, the French, Muslims or not, have nothing to add to these uniform official convictions.
He doesn't say yes.
The problem is that people like you once saw them as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, doubt exists for the whole world.
As I said thousands of times, some doubt the approval by the Jewish French of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be foolish and indisputable to accuse them of priority and demand that they publicly prove to the rest of the French society that they have failed to doubt.
This principle is in my mind the denial of the Republic and can only contribute to the detachment of French society.
If there's no doubt, as long as he says.
Who says they agree, but what do they agree with?
They consent to a close relationship with EI or to the condemnation of II.
The silence is very practical, is the main weapon of those who want to manage the cave and choose.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically comprehensive.
Alex Saland predicted that the Ecosse could, at the elections, "turn away" from the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap between their proposals for decentralization was widened and what they promised to protect the referendum on independence.
Cameron has to be petrified to lose all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives are completely afraid of the Ecosse because they have no seat.
They can do what they want in all electoral impunity.
I do not think that even Cameron would be stupid enough to believe that the Labour losing seats in Westminster for the benefit of the SNP would be a good long-term thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who's going to send an alarm for the Labour Party.
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by SNP and UKIP, which will cut their heads in the north.
And Miliband joined the "Promesse" thinking that he would save his part but without realizing that he had signed the death sentence of his Scottish Members.
Not surprisingly, some of the members of the Labourlists are asking for accounts from their supervisor.
If the SNP receives 20-25 seats and there is no majority in Parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and the Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralization.
I think it's rather important.
Not if the Labour or Conservatives want to be realized one day in England.
Circumcision of 8% to 85%, this is not a super electoral strategy.
In addition, once the Scottish MEPs are no longer able to vote on issues relating to England, the Conservatives will receive all the votes.
Oh, I think it's him.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband.
Maggie did it with Ulster's unionists and it worked.
However, he is still in position to be the prime minister in 2015 and has been in charge of the Labour Party.
So, large, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It's "The Life of Others" of East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of FRIC...
The same fascination for monitoring techniques.
In the end, this will have at least a sterilising effect.
I expect the next ticket: Amazon manufactures free VOTRE based on VOTRE profile and it automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!
It's gay like the world.
It's very stimulating.
Thank you for the article.
As under this system, the management of DRMs is not implemented, I still have the reading of Pirates files, books from the public domain or purchased by some editors who have the ability to propose files without a mouchard.
I saw the price I paid Kobo, it's no regret.
I am aware of the generalized addiction of users to the general appropriation of their private life.
In your large public library, you will note systematically that everyone gives their loyalty card (ff*c, d*itre, ...).
There are also demanding executives whose opening and completion rates are undoubtedly desirable.
For example, James Joyce’s “Finnagnes Wake. ”
@Thomas: In the age of Big Data, data does not really need to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to place all literature in the same bag.
The collection of anonymous data when there's a profile...
The harvest is not anonymous.
These are the data published by Kobo which are, not allowing either readers or authors to identify them.
But Kobo has all this information, to him.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements by the Turkish Government these last days that the country seems to be headed by a class of motherhood with schizophrene under acid.
It is even worse if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism.
It's interesting that some Erdogan's party thinks Islamist is such an insult that they supplement your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well seen:-P But Turkey does not want to take a ball in the foot, unless it gets something.
If she attacks ISIS, ISIS will recover, so it's actually taking a ball in the foot.
A diplomat wrote on his blog: "The AP reports that Iran has kept the United States and that it would be a mistake to seek to reverse Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad's law because this would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran sent a serious warning of arrests or simply advised caution.
This second option is more likely and, in all cases, what is really surprising is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic commitment concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region.”
Indian Punchline's reading is to strongly recommend that anyone pay attention to details rather than to c*neries balanced by traditional media. The short article you are giving the link is important and should be kept in mind by the previous observations/warnings coming from Iran on a proposal from Afghanistan about 1979 - 1980.
Who are these "moderate" who seriously fight the fierce Laic Assad and at the same time the sinners of ISIS?
The pipette policy moves the world towards ambition, and I would suggest that those who refer to “moderate” people who do not have to pay more attention to the facts and alternatives before sending other children to fight in the Third World War.
"It's even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism" Does it have other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I've got one in my head.
It would require a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Should he be "sustained"?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have the least chance of being alive yet?
It's a little late for that.
Wouldn't criminals not be old-fashioned now, like 120 years old?
It's a little late for that, isn't it?
In part about the tripuvirate of the CUP that planned and directed genocide, Talat and Djemal were killed just after World War I by the Armenians, and Enver was killed by the Bolsheviks in a famous location in Central Asia near the same time, when he went to the bottom of a Turkish Empire.
What a deal!
An impressive master of fatal paint sophism, but on the other hand, we are looking for contact with reality.
It's like no arguments.
The foot will always hear a heart that beats even in the belly of a pregnant mother.
The lesbian couples can be simply a desire for children and not a desire to be accepted.
So are the heterogeneous heterosexuals.
About the kids!
What a shame to designate them as future psychological imbalances.
One day, they will be able to defend themselves, say that they are happy to live, earn their lives, and pay the woman's retirement (?)
The GPA is certainly a temporary "solution" in the evolution of the medicine known to our world.
She doesn't date today.
Many women took and put children in the world who were not their husbands.
It's still that way, we're done like this...
The important thing in this regard is that this practice is covered so that the "marketing" of the body is limited.
But aesthetic surgery, cosmetics aren't they also marketing bodies?
Anakronic Variance Unit...
It is certainly more elegant to expand a good in a country far from the Internet and Pay Pal than to reduce its responsibilities and or avoid scandal in another century close to home without calling it at this time on all roofs! ...
These practices were no longer done in the name of the church! ...
There are only Christians and believers who reject these practices ...
There is no more than a real problem with the exercise of bodies.
Oh, you know, this man is passionate about something.
At the end of the 70s in the Midlands, I saw it just far away.
I had to go there every day because I didn't have the right to go there tonight!
But if you like this and you listen to music - this music today it always touches you so much.
I don't know why there are so many disturbing comments about what Paul Mason said, maybe they're put by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I think that in the sports section there is an article on the foot that waits for your comments.
Super article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's film, there has been a decrease in reporting that really reflects the reality of North England's culture.
No wonder that Paul Mason had well understood the social and political context, he understood things well.
Northern alone is still alive, but it has been vaccinated by capitalism and today is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That is what you can hear if you are in the London region in November: 99psoul is going to re-examine sunglasses, including the full Northern sun, on Saturday 15 November at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought "always the same story", but here's a very written and thought little article.
Your critics really need to be more constructive.
Super article.
I loved your documentary.
I suppose you're happy to have escaped to Newsnight.
Last train for Wigan from Victoria/Exchange and go down to Walgate.
Taking pills.
What a 15-minute walk from Wigan after buying a ticket to stop after Victoria!
The beginnings of the Northern Soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the series of police George Gently entitled Gently Northern Soul, which takes place in Newcastle in 1968.
Business is becoming increasingly disturbing.
The Palestinians have no partner in peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahou never misses an opportunity to take an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahou does not seek peace because he wants to continue to occupy-colonizer (also, it was also the case of Rabin).
It is clear that Rabin, Netanyahou and their electors have all preferred occupation-colonization in peace.
He removes his clothes, puts them on the rock and enters the water.
An Israelite had stolen them.
The representative of Israel is angry and shouts: "What are you talking about?
The Israelites were not even there at the time!"
The Palestinian Representative (UN) said and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its people have no confidence in the Bipolar Government of the Palestinian Authority and will not undermine the guard ...
That this shift to the ancient Israelites is evidence, it's not the search goal ...
Antithionist: But I have answered you, I have translated: the global geopolitical report ...
And it's always as long as politics is globalized...
Avoid it, avoid it...
In the Israeli-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain, it will lose!
For the creation of Israel do not answer you.
What force report has allowed the creation of Israel?
Anti-Palaticist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a force report today!
You're in doubt!!!!!
Besides, it doesn't only turn around Russell Brand, but the Guardian journalists seem to have the wrong to go beyond whatever it was not to say.
Many of what he says are just some pseudo-chomskys written by others.
There's proof that you don't understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a result of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter loves her well, which would mean that it's a matter of immaturity).
A truly vital burden, with just a suspicion of consciousness that Russell Brand said some truths, may be the truths we prefer not to think about.
Close up, this feeling will be more and more frequent!
I can understand why Brand is horrible at times: he sometimes speaks hypocritically and after all the absurdities of the tablets he actually gives the impression of being a starting populist, but all this story of not voting has been completely misunderstood by me.
The general consensus seems to be that it just tells people not to vote and rather to cross arms and ignore all the political process - but if you look at Paxman's interview and other articles/videos he posted, it says that voting once every 5 years for the Labour or Conservatives (or the Lib Dems I suspect) and limiting democratic commitment to this is completely useless, both parties (at slightly different degrees) who are essentially in favour of special interests, multinationals and wealth, A does not say just ignore the policy, because these parties do not rule only for the Labour or the Conservatives (or the Dems) and limit the democratic commitment to it.
I do not say that I need to agree with its solution (because I think that being politically active in submitting its requests can go against the vote, because politicians are gurus who will change their opinion if they are really at risk of losing the elections), but it is ironic to see all these confusing answers that say that this foolish Jesus tells young people not to take the pain of voting and to expect that all anger is better because it is really to deform his arguments.
Its solution is extremely controversial and would be good if people were to discuss what he really said rather than simply label it as irresponsible and to address his concerns and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The vote was completely broken.
The ineffectiveness of throwing a booklet into a urn every 5 years makes me very upset because my vote really doesn't matter.
I want more referendums, e-vote, direct democracy and Members who make their electors accountable locally.
In addition, I answer the idea that Russell Brand's issues are not the sixth (written by others).
He is smart enough to have his own ideas and ideas, even though they are strongly influenced by the sort of thinkers and universities anti-stabilisingly over the counter-culturalism that Suzanne would want to group under the label "pseudo-chomskys Billives".
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne would do like Polly Toynbee and Russell's interview on a veranda, with even the head raised on the mount!
Like Max Keiser, who at first attacked Russell but ended up being one of his fans and inviting him to his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
It is then in a political discourse that has existed since generations, but which has been marginalized by traditional media - including the Guardian - since generations.
This "fronde" reveals in my mind that intellectual debate has not been held for a long time in the history of RDV where metier historians have become minority and where the trades of specialists have come to the benefit of loan-to-thinking sciences Po for press files.
For my part I had seen Pierre Bourdieu's intellectual attitude as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to take it to a copper, an emissary mouth.
They develop one another's very rational reasonings, but this rationality is based on these exhilarating lips that are the key to their thinking.
I think for Foucault the state was essential as a couple.
This is a very archaic thought, the self-sacrifice thought, which is also the magical thought.
The problem of the relationship with the other is solved by the elimination.
There is an architic, neo-lib and / or /liberator pen (for two terms the second mark is a stencil of the state's desire for irradiation , the first know-how to seek State aid for its markets ) within the meaning of the least of the State / not all of the State at Foucault .
The old dream of the foundation that is beautifully organized.
Its opinion is based on the State's guilt: without this liability it does not have any advantage.
Who says bad, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position against the three intellectuals mentioned here .
No one else's support.
The total left remembers the good old time, the one of his god then, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you no doubt have read a houya too fast if you have taken the texts of Foucault on the Iranian revolution for an apology of Khomeinny.
Today, even Pierre Manent wouldn't like to attack Michel this way...
Gauchet has a deep reflection on the contemporary and collective individual, on the difficulty of the mechanism of accession in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, he is an original and respected thinker.
See this cable orchestrated by researchers in human sciences on the left of the hard left who do not expect to pass the allegation to their minds, it is quite likely.
Narcissism and authoritarianism of these people are unlimited.
One important point to add seems to me to be the position of these "rebellious", which is not only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other "yields" that I witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't like to hear our Australian friends about this, then.
And where was it in Russia that a Russian could meet a Chinese man and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember ever seeing a Chinese guy for the last time.
In London and they were sympathetic to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia - the last time in the 1990s, in a market.
The Chinese think the same way about the Whites!
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them say anti-Blanc violence.
My father doesn't like his old daughter being lucky with a White.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially during the past few years: they are increasingly rich, prosperity spread out of big cities, and because of this prosperity, people travel abroad and see how others live.
As I was told, the Russians were particularly vulnerable to temporary workers with no original qualifications from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in the metros and areas where they have many opportunities to be exploited by their employees or faced with high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the rivers of the Ienissei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard Australians' opinions on Chinese and Aborigines.
It's really strange that a stranger tells me that I don't support the Chinese, while I met two in my life (including one abroad), didn't keep bad memories, all people are brave and, in fact, those in London have been very nice, that's the only reason I remember they were Chinese.
But we don't remember who we're meeting, all people grow up, how to remember who it was.
You know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here speak of the Chinese as a sort of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with Lady Blanc.
How many Chinese men are with whites, by comparison?
No one, because there's a lot of chance that these Whites' parents would attack them.
No measure of impartiality of justice.
However, it is the mother of all the battles and justice in France that remains manipulated by strongly marked groups on the left as the union of the judiciary...
@Marabout: I'm sorry, but the judge environments are clearly marked right.
When it comes to the Syndicat of the Court of Justice, it represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its parity may be made from the relevance of the law in the courts, it shall remove two obstacles.
That of the observer's political vision as that of the actual interpretation of the Magistrate.
There remains then the required tool of the law to refocus the evaluation on the basis.
The extent of its non-observance in all the judicial acts of judges, including the case, has the power to make a distinction between the error and the parity of the judges.
It should be argued that justice acts do not divide between these three groups.
The claim and ignorance are not relevant for objective analysis.
And if all of this is not analysed, how can we say that justice improves in France?
If this is not only by means of statistics, it appears to be inextricably low.
The previous preambulation allows you to well list what follows in the third ratio.
The one from the corruption* of the judiciary.
Sensitious subject in proportion to the power of nursing* which is conferred on the judicial institution capable of such a haresis.
The area is considered to be the source of spoliation* of inheritances committed to the procedure* by successive genoologists appointed by notaries.
This profession receives 150 million euros a year in good time, while benefiting from the coverage* provided by the almost penality of the French notariat.
For the understanding of their mechanism, a part was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this combined statistical improvement* moderated by the previous comment is that the judicial institution has produced, in many cases, differences between geneticist and reticent inheritances, a set of judgments contrary to all the laws that favor the inheritance.
Is not the presentation of European statistics that ignores such reasonable criteria, then, a form of lie?
Prices must be completely prohibited.
More of the equipment for the arrest of the disabled.
We can say this, but my brother has one of these tricycles all over the country, built to measure his size and weight, and it really allowed him to use the whole air as never a normal wheelchair, with rough wheels and tires, could not.
As we say, tastes and colors...
The Tankchairi is similar to what Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The tanker at EPIQUE air.
I think the Whill inventor never had to clean a dog's chest on a chair.
I'm sure my sister would love the tricycle all over the country, but it's just too expensive.
The long-distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a penchant for the longboard.
Here are some colleges that would like them.
The prices seem to be actually high, but there are really people who put this kind of price in a bicycle, so “you see it. ”
The tricycle all over the country seems especially useful to me.
Not all persons with disabilities are poor, however.
Many of them have a reasonable amount of insurance.
Only if they have become disabled.
The trick is that the market in the rolling stock is a niche, so they can practice high prices for things they know they really need us.
We can't really say that the Whill is a minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately it's just a mistake, it's not intended to make it.
I am pleased that the "long distance" error does not occur on the market, because there seems to be no way to drive this trick.
Nearly 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intense bombings in densely populated residential areas.
Two million human beings are prisoners of the Israeli block of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of the Palestinian Territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under the age of 18.
The eight-year-olds lived their lives under Israeli blockades!
The only situation in the world, unacceptable situation, also illegal situation, as this block imposes a "collective penalty" on all Gazan civilians.
" Entrepreneurs working on their projects turn a little bit of their stone into the black market " ...
Ah, that's not the language of wood instead of concrete and armed lady...
References are there to support an argument or fact.
Anti-censionist ...
The good stone goes into the tunnels!
There's the black market, there's some, and it's recognized.
Two million human beings are prisoners of the Israeli block of Gaza since 2007.
The only situation in the world is unacceptable for anyone who has a heart and a moral sense.
The US has a well-guarded area: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi didn't have the time to rule because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) has excluded it!
Don't forget, too, that after you got up, Morsi had restored the block!!!
And I'm a Westerner, so I admit...
Jonathan...
The Blocus is Israel-Egypt ...
The children of Gaza live on a underground fortress built against the people who have chosen their masters!
Having a boat, it's a lot of work, Alex.
I hope you've reflected well.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
It is even the definition of the share economy, without a lucrative purpose.
Many are looking for just a couple of evenings on Cuchsurfing.
So it is to pay (or at least expect it) in another way.
It's always much less expensive than a hotel, if you need to look for the good addresses.
In addition, owners and tenants who are trusted often stop using Airbnb and treat directly in species, including Airbnb.
Where is the community in all of this?
"What's it put on?"
No problem with the verb, what's the problem with your Grammar?
We do not use the word "your law" in the United States.
The author just used an American expression.
It is an international newspaper now, where you should not have noticed.
It would be better to have good safety for the boat, make sure it's 100% in accordance with all the safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers to do business (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I have tried to rent (in all honesty) on Airbnb, in short, is really a treasurer...
Did you think that the ships could be moved, driven and repatriated, stolen, etc.?
The pennies are so slow as if someone tried to fly her would always be near where you left her.
Or surrounded by pirates...
All these Somali immigrants who come here and attack our pennies...
Where are you going to hide it?
No Marine Le Pen has no reason!
Populism?
There is no truth but the one who exposes the facts!
Poverty is growing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth among the richest is a reality.
Who defends who?
Who's defending what?
In 2017 the month will be said!
Capitalism won't open up!
The high financial, special, play with our companies, so our jobs, our primary materials, so our purchases, our food, our food, our care structures, our health, our debt, our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and our money they hold..
All of this for the benefit of a few hyper-mega-obessives of fear.
Until it proves otherwise, FH said, "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is money."
It was 2012.
In 2014, he appointed the Minister of Economy an elder from Rothschild Bank, a history of better defending the interests of bankers, alone responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Did anyone else compete?
You call this how: return your clothes, lower your pants?
Primary and populist reactions
In fact, we don't know much about Marine Le Pen's thinking.
Where do you see this?
Because the Germans refused to rescue survivors.
I'm not sure Spee's really "refused" to save the survivors.
One of the aspects of this battle is that none of the parties seemed certain of the exact strength of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book Castles of Steel suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British cook in the area.
The sea was hot at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the battle ended after sunset, making all rescue operations more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, that of the Malouines, where, on the photos showing survivors being rescued, there is a calm and full-day sea.
In addition, rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this stage.
Well, that doesn't really fit what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
"A certain confusion arose among the German ships about the fate of the two winged cruisers who had disappeared in the dark after they had stopped shooting, and a race-track started.
Le Leipzig lives something in the fire, but by approaching it he lives that it was nothing but a trap.
Nürnberg, slower than the other German ships, join the battle slowly and survives Monmouth, thinking and seriously damaged but still moving.
After drawing his projectors on the ship's deck, the proposal to return was rejected and opened the fire, finally closing the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee decided that Good Hope had to leave and stop searching at 22 p.m.
Concerned about reports indicating a British cure in the surrounding areas, it is heading north. ”
So, if that is true, the Germans, in darkness in advance of the radar invention, did not know that a ship had crashed, and could therefore not find survivors.
They also thought that there was a more important cure for the Royal Navy in the area that would have caused them serious damage, so in confusion they drowned to benefit from their progress.
They were far from their base, and Spee was well aware that they should take a path through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them torture and had cost about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally captured.
A number of votes are taken by the UMP to request that it be included in the law that a definitively condemned election is of this definitely ineligible fact.
Here's a brave position, which would also touch the left-wing elections on top.
But tonight, it's a joke.
For this idea, an inscription on the death of the cons of Magistrates is proposed.
When is the ban on trade unions in already protected sectors?
How long will this gap between citizens be tolerated?
Keeped by policycards whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, they are always quick to love the same ones who will take advantage of their immobility to prevent the actions of real politicians, who are really trying to make things worse, not the beautiful speakers whose real estate is to the extent that they are sufficient.
I met them in the metro to the midi with their small pankarts for justice" they came from the province and did not make the difference between Percy and POPB.
It supports the existence of political unionaries whose members have enormous power to hold the service of their party.
It would not defend the same thesis if right trade unions, right-wing or right-wing unions, designated for the purpose of the personality of the board, and were facing a legal-media war.
Your confirmations are totally free.
Yes, right now, the court's news is just a fact that it has committed the facts that are relevant to it!
There is no example of the right person who had so much to do with the Justice, but all those who had taken care of him had not been treated in favour.
On the other hand, it must be remembered that the union of the left-hand judge is not the only union of judges and that he is a minority.
That a minister supports with such commitment the unions show how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you mention may be minority among the judges, but its influence is great in Chancellery, it is not a secret.
It is now asked whether the "mission" of certain judges is more likely to go out than to teach.
@ kos - You should be satisfied, the SM is minimal.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: you forget that the judges are not officials like the others: they are the only ones who have the power to accuse and imprison everyone.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I believe that even the most famous weakness of glory realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised if someone accepted their offer.
Many are used as a tremplin to start a successful career.
The One Directorate is filling the world's stadiums.
Others have then sold a lot of disks or are part of West End.
Popstars, the director of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who is actually part of the jury.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, have all done the Eurovision competition, as well as others.
While others, such as Frank Sinatra and the rest, have participated in U.S. competitions.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the light entertainment stars of British television.
Of course, some have fallen into the dark.
But that's what happens to most stars who do not participate in the competition.
Rare are those who, after a tube, succeed in doing it to others.
In any case, most of the singers/groups can best expect three albums and one of the best.
Yes, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, there are only fans in the United Kingdom.
His celebrity is part of his marriage with a football player who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it is more likely to be on a career than the typical rock road, even if in your dreams you think that all guitar farmers who smoke the grass in their father's garage and balance three agreements at a high school level will certainly become stars and that the only question is how much they want to touch before they even go out an album.
And rather than ridiculous: it creates a completely artificial distance between the Western audience and the peoples who are studied – a distance that quickly turns to racism, because the sacralist ethnologists present us these people far away as infinity supersistency and ritual bigotiation petrites, while most of their ways of doing so are strictly equal to us and inspired, like us, of practical considerations daily.
Unless you're imprudently interpreted in reverse.
Either, but rather than saying that the drum is desecrated by sacred character, should it not be better to admit that our Marianne and our Molières have not a certain sacred character?
Our way is as reminded of seeing the sacred as a sort of well-defined object and surrounded by the religious sphere.
The article is very interesting whatever it is.
It's the deco ephemera to melt the empty.
Nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of Figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of holiness is always alive.
Who else believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would lead to the origins of non-scientific interpretations of the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When does a critic compare discipline to a bit of rules?
Because what is important for archeology is also important for interpretations that give other disciplines.
This would result in a dose of healthy moderation.
Your hatred for archaeologists is all unjust!
It is thanks to them that we constantly discover treasures, valuable evidence to restore history, understand societies, and the example of comparative archeology here is fascinating.
This method is not very old, and before the archaeologists knew their "instinct" and their knowledge, they could deceive themselves.
Today we have such effective technical and scientific means that the interpretation of the scrolls is better but can always be caused by other discoveries!
It is there in full (and old) polychemical about the chamanism promoted by prehistoric Jean Clottes (with its book "The Names of Prehistoric History", especially the increased re-edition of scientific controversy, published in the editions of La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this article strong instruction
Heteros love anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could put it on.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why we can't continue to three?
This journal is meant to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall in the canal?
No, but we're not against a theater room above.
We couldn't watch a musical comedy up there in reverse, that would be too gay!
We could expect to have this kind of comment from you.
It would be said that Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your test offer is almost over, I suggest you go to Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers Mikeodow.
So I suggest we all look for a newspaper that pays real journalists, courageous, to write on the Middle East, Ebola, etc. on their risks and losses.
It's rather than cleaning up with these dirty rags.
Not very bad.
Come on, then.
If you're so shocked by these "puerile blokes", you're not obliged to participate, are you?
You also know that this journal also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is possible to do both and publish an article on the annual sex?
Is it the subject that surprises you, or is it that people are regular?
Still we find the amateur crash video on the net...
Lover video of crash on the net...?
If the FOM chose not to show these images, it is only to protect its interests in no case from the pilot.
If the FOM wanted to protect the pilots, it would have come out of safety because at the time or another vehicle (e.g. decanne) entered the circuit.
But it was necessary to finish immediately before the typhon that we knew it was coming, but for which the FOM did not think it right to advance the time of departure (telephone law, pub, money...).
But on the other hand, they protect the pilots well.
Good to see you, I'm also sharing this opinion.
But there is also that if the very British FOM makes it into the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance to fight the English that then...
You're lying on this blog of my dear Dayrton.
But it's not serious, I have a little time to abuse all your c*****ries.
No, just not.
There have been cases of conspiracy in F1, but never one who endangers Commissioners in death for a long history of the possibility of defeating one pilot to the detriment of another.
It's not the FOM that's safe because it's the FIA.
Such a nuance.
In view of amateur images, the lack of image allows the FIA particularly to avoid the gender issues of the type: How does the Commissioner act in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, this is not because the video is judged too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident but because it is clearly seen as one of the Commissioners acting as a green team, it indicates that the course can normally resume and that it is more under the yellow suit scheme.
Some comments show a summary of F1's knowledge.
Yes, dear Etienne, the course is no longer under the scheme of yellow suit APRES the place of the accident, where the green suit is organized.
It's the usual procedure.
The position of commissions just below the accident (in the case, it may be 10 meters like 100 meters after the accident) will force the green to tell pilots to take a normal walk.
Sensitentialism sells the pub.
Before I thought the media were an integral part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda offensive, but I'm very afraid that, in the end, it's just for money.
And sex, we don't forget sex, the fear of not having sex, the pub and the media are good for us to sell things that seem to improve our sexual life.
The information is exactly the same.
Making the buzz with information that we don't really need to worry about is right to continue to fear people in order to keep controlling them.
"When the tabloids touch about Ebola, we all catch the fear "It should be "dangerous", not "suspend".
Given the medical reference, “all” is better in this context than “dangerous. ”
I wonder if all the people who pretend that Ebola might be spreading by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You make them too proud.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the approaching apocalypse.
Ebola is the antichrist!
You're confused with Ebola and Murdoch...
Super article, thank you!
A short and concisal article that is perfectly and firmly reticulating this pseudo-journalism object.
I've had a lot of trouble.
This makes me feel that the media are talking about most things with this optimism in the world.
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently fraffled and angry (without getting to the hospital) for the government to get us down when it needs it.
I think it is perfectly logical that, if we must rise to a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attention, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any cases?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that he himself has invented.
Isn't there something fundamentally problem with the idea of rule by fear?
Congratulations for this post, and to be still in this world nearly 35 years later.
In addition to the beginning, this had to be terrible, given the context of the 1980s-90s.
I've been bluffing, living with the certainty of passing it for years .....
Witnessing is absolutely useless.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only do the evidence serve nothing: it is taken alone, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have a bad influence on the objective appreciation of the facts.
@trafic: Evidence cannot serve as scientific material.
This may be why questions are not asked to patients in psychiatric care when reliable observations are made from close relatives.
My psychiatry file mentions that my mother psychiatry explains that I was taught telepathically by her beautiful mother.
So this is an objective symptom.
When I say it's fotosis, it's a subjective witness.
Ah, because the testimony of a fact (= here is this witness, which attests to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) is nothing in a scientific way?
What are you looking for, then?
On ghosts?
Do you have the same level of fantasy theories and facts (= presenting verifiable evidence) ?
'Resilience': the word bidened by the great mothers, fans of J-L Delarue, which takes place for great psychologists after having read D'ansemburg.
@Jim: There's a lot of buzzwords out of sense in the psys.
Cyrulnik has given us the cut of "resilience."
As it is a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he has broken us up a reliable scale of measure for quantification, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could all save us from Farage and company?
Don't you think of Team America?
Seriously, it's not a good idea to draw the Sentinels of the Air...
So why?
It was a great series and we would say that those who come out of it have a conscience!
So let's leave our health to the power that can do miracles.
But how are they gonna do it so children get closer?
The only solution that comes to my mind is the kind of pippi-caca, which would kill the series.
It was already a series for children.
Children were growing up.
Ah, because it's a series for kids?
The UKIP works for the Misterons.
So watch your American team.
Always in Super-Mariation?
This will not be the same if we don't see the children and that animation is well done. :-)
I hate to see this (although an adult), but I hope that this will give the idea to a chain of re-examination of the old.
The series has never stopped spreading here in Australia; it takes at least 40 years to have episodes of one hour on Saturday and Sunday at 06 p.m.
Since the arrival of the free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-order commercial channels and it can always be seen at these times.
And in addition, half-hour episodes are now at 5:30 a.m., Monday to Friday!
All right, I'm probably a 60-year-old sad guy, but I don't look at this series every day!
There is no "Mount of the Temple" in or under the monsoon!!!
The radical Zionists invented this to give political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Furthermore, all the Israeli caves below and around the monasteries mosque for decades have not been able to find anything.
The mountain of the temple if it exists is there.
Can it be in Argentina?
This mountain has not been searched for the simple reason that it is the colline on which the mosques were built.
Their summit, or the Queen of Rocher, is located in the middle of the Omar mosque.
For Muslims, Mahomet is raised to paradise from this rock.
For the Jews, the mount Moriah was Abraham's son-in-law to offer up Isaac.
From the time it was taken and contextualized, there was no propaganda, but information, cher K1K1.
Israel also has its extremists, it is good to remember them regularly, and they are unfortunately related to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahou, the latter had accepted the plan to 2 states, and was subsequently freed!).
It is also good to show where Jerusalem's accession is not a peaceful fact.
Will God recognize his feelings?
The shortest of Jewish blogs: "God be praised!"
For us to enjoy tourism in Israel, we often see young children born to half of the dead, naked on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, very different from what we show advertising, as we can see on the photo that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary at the same time.
And this photo is a great preaching work!
The damage that Reuters photographer did not take in photos was the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to enter the Temple Mount and who preferred to cast down Jewish loyal ones in opposition, praying at the Wall of Woes.
@Mat, If this photo offends you, it's right, it's not the newspaper, it's not the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she transmits that she has to condemn.
This system is not sustainable and will end in tears.
The only way to put an end to this system is revolution.
Since the economy seems to be on the rise, large companies have greatly benefited from their employees.
They managed to convince their employees that they had the opportunity to have a job and that they could not afford to increase their wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they had paid more and more important wages to the small elite at the summit.
You are right, this is not sustainable, but it will only change in this country when workers speak truly of one voice.
Instead of laughing and laughing when someone else makes the cry, support them, prove some solidarity and understand that their cry is not only about their problems, but also show your employer that people are not punished.
Unless we give up democracy, if you do, it's sustainable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you forgot is that British and American companies sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
For example, China and India.
All of this can't end well.
It's because we're in democracy that it has.
Did you vote for the PCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (PTCI) aims to increase the profits of the companies held by these entities in the short term by national governments by secret courts.
This seems incredible, but that is exactly what the dispute settlement mechanism proposed by the Agreement is.
The Greens are opposed to this project and try to warn people of the inimitable damage that this agreement will have to do with our lives.
This is just what we recently started to talk about in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement Watch these links and you will understand what is being negotiated in your dose.
Did Churchill not say "blood, sweat and tears"?
That's what makes a great retreat, while digital money has no reason to fall and even less to push on trees.
The next low mail will certainly be the car market.
This gentleman was right, in the 18th century, there were unions in all systems.
In the very French Catholic army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Leave her (at last, her officers, the others, no one knows anything) to believe in France's eternal values, and she beats and closes her throat.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, short: the dissoluteness of the idea of the Nation, having this little religion, is comforting.
Even if it's more unpleasant for her...
You still lack the union of married men, celibates, married women, celibates, lost dogs and I don't know what else
If you don't write French correctly, I'm going to sign it.
You've been prevented, it'll be your fault.
In order to defend the categories of interests, there is already enough protected professions with trade unions, which has created a breach of equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh at the fear of the risk of a staff member.
We can well imagine a system that ensures some freedom of expression without unions, or then without the right to cry as in Germany, in contrast to the protection they enjoy.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
And with the charters ready, the government is pleased.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance in effect...
I was ignoring Sybille's ignorance to the military and other officials, as this is the subject here commented...
"by means of its delegates" is deleted in Article 8 of the 1946 preambular Constitution.
He will become: "8.
Every worker participates in collective determination of working conditions and business management."
This is absolutely necessary with the interruption of information power.
And yet you have opened it, probably then comment on a specific article entitled "The Great British Back Off Review". ?????????
Wait, the section was here, all empty.
I thought he had to start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's marriage that I've seen, and I can tell you that some have been well murdered.
In Joffrey's marriage episode, we had one of the best moments (which was the wine) in the history of television.
Also, from the tart mmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time of affiliation that, strangely, the issue ends with a victory of the least bulging ; no one has ever done a "bout, here's my cuckoo girl now blow it up and point it in front of your master!"
Maybe the additional pressure of friends and parents out there finally had an effect on them?
In the past weeks, all these outside persons were kept separate.
And there's also this idea of "playing security, there's always next week" that goes away last week.
I like cooking, but I don't think I'm influenced by it.
I am grateful to those who do it and thus offer us a great fun and motivate us to try new things.
Forward to GBBO 2015!
I agree that the last challenge of the last year, the wedding feast, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to do them and should break up at 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really difficult to start, I don't know how they could choose a winner.
In Luis, the only real mistake they had to find was that the base was a bit dry (even though I agree with Hollywood to say that the green glazing on Richard's moulin was not done, Richard had already lost it at the moment).
I need to know that several challenges in this series seem a little artificial because of the time spent.
There is also the cancer that looks at, with solar wind drops.
Clearly, we all succeed at this time.
A bad time to pass for mankind, we hope for it.
You freeze solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
The UVs are mainly blocked by the ozone layer, which is formed directly by the impact of residual solar air particles and UVs.
So even if the magnetic field had weakened, there would not be enough solar wind to "shake" the stratospheric ozone.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and cancer.
Fortunately, the ozone layer doesn't block the UVs.
They have a range of useful functions that you don't suspect.
If we are limited to man, they are interested in allowing us to have oss (vitamin D synthesis), to heat us (other than infrabouges), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morals.
The ozone layer blocks cancerous UVCs and allows UV and most UVBs to pass.
Do you know that you are not obliged to be conscious and consider your interlocutor a stay when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor clarification that was underpinned in the comment, which he himself intends to give evidence of pedagogy.
Without saying I'm a melanoma habit, UVs only make it possible to adapt to its development.
They don't do it.
To prove: not all people burned do not have melanoma.
Either, when a tube tells you that you need to avoid the sun and live in the background of a cave, it is best not to listen because UVs are necessary for everyone.
The excess, on the other hand, is like everything: he kills.
But for other reasons.
The UV directly causes melanoma.
Can we cry?
And, more importantly, can we pass it to the mixer?
or pass it to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those interested have established that everything can be washed if a sufficient force is applied and iPhone 6's robustness is perfectly acceptable, for which use it is intended.
I think the army would need something more resistant and that's why the iPhone6 has not yet been adopted as first-line communication material.
But for the rest of us,
It remains a good choice.
the majority of those interested have established that everything can be lowered if a sufficient force is applied to them.
Save and Nokia 3310.
More specifically, has it already been spread?
This blog is made in every discussion.
I've decided to count on them.
It's the fourth blog on the page I've read in today's comments.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before you install specific software, you can imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production chain and you can see how wrong it could be.
So, ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...................................
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which the iOS has not been correctly installed and which is therefore compatible with the manufacturer's test code installed.
I don't know how they do these tricks.
But would they put testing software on everyone?
Photos on Ebay clearly show the absence of FCC or EC logo and the presence of a red prototype connector.
ah l article for bobo by excellence.
We want little expensive products and we wonder that industrial products are produced in »industrials' We put first super or but all the teachings and even the small trade are concerned How well, bio avac 1650€ (mean balance in France)?
But to respond to your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After each one is free to set his priorities where he understands it.
For me, food is one.
Go without a scratch, I'll kiss you.
It's called baboons, or better boboecolos, people who see the world through an ideological "software" that makes them want to connect with reality.
It's the total disaggregation thinking.
They are gesticulating experts, for example, claiming to save the planet because they avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in tartuferie, joining the left-caviar, which they are sometimes above, for example by condemning CO2's withdrawals while spending their holidays in Maldives.
The vast majority of our conceptions do not support this mixture of heavy ideology and tartupheria nor are you surprised to meet criticisms about them often.
Waouh, thank you for this complete and comprehensive theory and for all the details associated (air, shower...).
I'd love to share it, but I can't find it.
The concept is not so complicated.
The bubbles are monoblock.
Did you understand the concept of the left-hand side?
And you are able to understand the concept of boboécolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in the Ecos as soon as possible.
The baboécolo is actually part of it, but it is only the most visible break of the echolos because it is the one who infects the media.
That's a nice giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to see this giraffe in the face.
It's so bad that it looks like a naked woman.
Chut, you're on the side of the plate.
It is necessary to be part of the microcosm of the art in order to understand the amazing beauty of the truth of this work.
But you just don't have any legitimacy to make a comment because you haven't spent countless decades studying and flirting with great artists.
The important thing is that Emin does not know how to draw and seems to be always obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she has really succeeded in becoming very rich and famous with no artistic capacity.
That's "l'art."
No, it's from the coke.
The fact that Emin doesn't know how to draw
That's not really a fact.
It's rather an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can appreciate is real dog reproductions that smoke by playing the billiard.
To judge art may be problematic, but not in this case.
Design, it's better than just represent the real.
If you're looking for it, a camera will do the job.
The author also speaks of Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image talk about itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is more to be done: the horse-powering activities, the number of horses of the Republican Guard or the status of the generals who are no longer in active service....
It is a duty to say that France has reduced its effectiveness, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more tragicly, to start with Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
The operator without the support, it finds its limits fast!
A single approach, at a time when we observe the weaknesses, the shortcomings of our defence tool, particularly in Sahel.
A bad turn for the local communities concerned, who lose a dimension of their activities, wants a part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuary?
@edmond: It's good I said, look where else to make savings but especially not in me, it's really not possible for me to...
That's exactly what you're proposing to do, to see where the gabage is certain.
That all those who had little or much of the military thing can come here, eyes in the eyes that have no money spent on this perimeter and this without laughing...
The same position across the public function and public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really cold: look at the inflation of public employment in the other departments and you will understand why The Defence may be a little busy!
Well, the economies on which everyone agrees to say that they need to be done, even though that's something, isn't it?
Lack of power, those on whom it falls commit suicide when it comes to them, the poor love.
It should be done, but above all, it doesn't fall on me because, in this case, it's a crime and not an economy.
Giignols, go!
What will closing the Grace Val will weaken our defense tool in Sahel?
For local communities, history repeats each closure of position, maternity, hospital, household.
But the whole world is for the well-known economies.
It is strange that a major UMP wants compensation and does not enjoy public spending savings.
This article is truly the most exciting trick I've ever had!
This is the moment when the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It's the pressure to expose his Facebook file and to see that 80% of his friends began their status by the phrase “This moment is boring.”
I think they're gonna make a movie.
It will certainly be based on hilarious scenes where someone falls per hazard on his ex in the bus while going to work and only finds out where his juice is returned to his cult.
It's not wearing, it's totally with it.
Not really, I think the author adopts the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to stir his emotions and close his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a Kate Bush fan, the announcement of his return on stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now in the heart of a battle to know who will have the rights?
I don't have the Internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
They don't have a computer.
Oh, my God, I need to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe what point this article is the most incredible trick I've ever read!
Charlie has truly proved that he's still at the top of the cosmic universe that is satirical journalism!
I fell in the back of it!
It is absolutely necessary that I share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter in order to finally have the lighting and discover the incredible clarity and the insurgent genius that binds Mr. Brooker's keyboard as a divine light.
Oh, my God, it was really empty.
Especially if it's not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive change in democracy: the rise of regional policies and effective associated initiatives.
Until the new order, we are committed to confiscating the right to save our planet by States that play the tarts at each meeting to save the planet.
So we decide, citizens, to take things in hand.
With the Commissioner they planted energy, all these fine recommendations were involved ....
Translate : Solar Eolines and firmas are the round points of the morning.
It's all funded by the con-tribunal.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much worse at the level of its losses and in the event of an accident.
As long as the thread is not mastered in its integrity, it is better to limit it to laboratories.
Renewable energies are our only health, provided we are clearly aware of a drastic reduction in our consumption.
Renewable electricity to combat CO2 emissions?
France has nothing to do with it.
Nuclear power is zero CO2 emissions to production and epsilon for other stages.
The electricity by the renewable eoliene or PV is already more GES on the other steps, especially gas, or worse than carbon as in Germany, to compensate for intervention.
Replaceing the nuclear fuel with the renewable oil or PV will be opposed to the fight against CO2.
Christial I don't insult you myself as a Doctor of State in physical science 1981 more I have done nuclear physics research. I'm trying to prove it against what I said.
For what I didn't say you are the one who gave me ideas I said nothing about Germany in fact you didn't answer what I said and how all the people are entitled to cancel the interlocutor I never do.
I also quote the conclusion of experts commissioned by the German Government: the current renewable energy programme of Germany is a non-refundable and ineffective way to reduce GES emissions and should be stopped.
0 emissions if you do not account for the extraction of uranium and construction and if you do not account for the greenhouse effect of CO2, it is true that the two-thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power station is partly in water and a little in the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a South Asian giant!!!
Last time, Pakistan won against India.
It is not surprising to me that most Indians who make comments want to read and comment only on articles against Pakistan.
In fact, it clearly shows your mental state.
This would have been the case if they had qualified the South Asian Giant Indian...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players are participating, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would just open a box of corruption and mafiosio Pandore.
As for the ISL, today's opening match was extremely interesting, the Kolkata Athletics imposed 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a lot to do.
Compared to the billions and billions that India spends on the IPL cricket and now on the football, how can we make a day to relax with our "browing neighbors"...
The race to the low cost launch pays cash.
It hurts for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the absence of any design appeared only with a helium too cold.
So we may not be in a lack of design, but in implementation...
unlike arian space which is a private company, it seems well that soyouz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as the state here is its own insurance.
They can pay the satellites in frigates who know..
This is so much easier than many media take the only titles of articles - and that many readers consider these titles only .
In general, this creates a mistaken impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
In agreement with you, the title is not appropriate, it is wrong to cause the project while this is just a problem of launching.
