When he called, the professor admitted that he shot his friend
During the call to the emergency line, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he had shot his friend and that it was necessary for them to come home.
Lamb assumed that his "speech dog" was alive at home and probably broken up, and that contacts on the family of a dead woman can be found on her phone.
In the police, Amy Prentiss found the body and manually wrote a report on the white office paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could come back, I loved Amy and she's the only one who loved me," was in a letter signed by the authorities Lamb.
There was no doubt that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would have spent 300 miles on a school campus where the police thought he had shot beloved Professor Ethan Schmidt at his office's doors.
The chief of police at Delta State University Lynn Buford said the university staff heard the shooting on 10:18 a.m.
Lamb first made a bad phone call on the emergency line shortly thereafter.
Finally another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the shooting at school, the students and the faculty were offered to hide behind the closed doors, and the responsible authorities are still trying to track down what Lambo's motive was.
Details published by researchers on the side of the state and students and employees who knew it together created a picture of a talented but probably a problem teacher.
The students confirmed that they enjoyed his lesson.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no record in a criminal record or violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in the book he wrote, to thank the "great people" with whom he shared academic life.
Both taught at the University of Social Sciences and history, along with the other 17th members of the faculty, and many students went to courses at the same time.
At the same time, inclinations have emerged when it comes to problems.
A student who praised Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said that he also seemed angry and frustrated, "as if nothing had happened to him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, said Lamb told him that he was experiencing stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb already asked Delta State University for medical reasons when he said he had a problem.
And this year he only studied two online courses.
Recent changes in the number of university employees meant that a doctor whose Lamb worked hard not to guarantee his automatic working period to become a professor's assistant.
The president of the University of William LaForge said he didn't know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamb must have suffered something."
Lamb will no longer answer these questions.
After leaving the camp, the police caught his foot when he crossed the border of the state of Arkansas back to Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a single gun gun at the house about a mile from his parents at Greenville, Mississippi, confirmed the Crown of Washington, Methel Johnson.
He left the car on the street.
It wasn't clear right away why Lamb went to this house, even though Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this country.
Lamb started to work at a university that has 3500 students in a city that has about 12,000 inhabitants in 2009 and has taught the country and education hours.
He got a doctor on the train.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny man.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lambus 20 when they met with fellow friends.
She was with her friends at high school and he was the great older boy who taught her to play guitar for years.
It was quite a heart attack at the time.
The heart of all the girls grew up as they appeared," said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives on Jackson's property.
Lamb and Prentiss apparently walked together for some time.
During his emergency phone, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the marriage record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a cyclist house that is next to the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was okay.
Former husband Prentiss, Shawn O'Steinberg, said they divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends and had a daughter who is now 19 years old.
"It was completely red," said O'Steen about his daughter.
She was the best friend she's ever had with her mother.
He said that he didn't sit with Lambe, but through his daughter Abigail, he knew Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail went to the summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played decent gigs together.
He said his daughter writes and sings her own song.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for different online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barman and a potential entertainment coordinator in The Jule Room, arguing the bright bar near Gautier, said that last saw Lamba and Prentiss on the night of September 5, the path that Lamb missed on the guitar and harmony for endless tax.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"It was just a happy couple," he said.
We used to make fun of each other, and we played jokes together.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a murdered professor, conducted a seminar in the first anniversary and specialized in original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, professor of English at school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of a boy school club and student government.
In the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including members of the faculty, employees, students and members of the community, participated in a memorial event with candles.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and Brother Jeff Schnitt also participated in a wake-up, during which the university council called "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
She started school again in the middle of the night.
"We're trying to get our students back," says LaForge.
It's a crisis for us.
This is the day of treatment.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported to Cleveland, Mississippi.
Authors for Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans also contributed to this report.
This story was designed to reflect the fact that the police now claim that Lamb made a phone call on the emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called his wife Prentiss, there is no evidence that they were actually created.
Toys R Us is planning to hire less seasonal workers.
Toys R Us announces that they will not take as many seasonal workers as last year, but producers of child toys and products claim that it will allow current employees and seasonal workers to work more hours.
The company also indicated that it plans to employ about 40,000 workers in trade and distribution centres throughout the country, which is a decline of 45,000 last season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company declares that it will start with a sample of depositors this month, and the employee will be collected by October to December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is close and companies are ready to take temporary staff to help in trade and sales, for the delivery and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox tweets about his "rande" with Princess Diana
The Prime Minister "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Foxe.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater and waited for the coming of the royal family when I realized that the sitting next to me was empty and I found that Princess Diana would sit there," said in the trailer for the accompanying document, "Go back in time."
The movie starts and I'm getting into something that could be called a fake date with a princess from Wales.
"Back in time," is the document on "Return to the Future," which introduces talks with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Landeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The Prime Minister "Back for the Future" was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It's really the best travel document ever filmed for me."
"Back in time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in selected movies in October.
UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
General Secretary Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russian rapid military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict of almost five years of conflict and more weapons are only the worse violence and suffering of millions of people.
The Head of the UN has repeatedly called on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unite and support an inclusive consultation on finding a political solution.
Ban told the Central Press Conference that he was planning to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent councils of the country - USA, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the end of the ministerial meeting of the Valne Assembly at the end of this month because of the situation in Syria.
He expressed his policy that the division in the Council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "has made this situation unsolved."
The Ban has called for five permanent members to show solidarity and units that have shown themselves to reach an Iranian nuclear agreement in the resolution of the crisis in Syria.
8 optional numbers showing Donald Trump in real light
Some have tried to describe him as a person who often changes his mind.
The rest of them held their hands like the unexplained smile.
And some are ready for improvisation.
But if some Republicans are already trying to pull Donalda Trump down from the top of the vote, they will not be able to do so (yet).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in charge of a two-digit number, and some people start asking seriously what this means for the nominal chance of this magnet in the area of property.
Of course, it's still the beginning of a voluntary cycle.
Nothing of this says that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's lead led to Herman Caino's arrival, and at last one of them did not win the only position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he could get involved in general elections.
But outside groups such as Super PAC Jeba Bush and the Economic Conservative Group Club for Growth are aware of Trump's desire to maintain and begin to spend their dollars on the stand with a view to attracting him.
Here are some recent voting figures that indicate that the actual magnet is not just an intermittent phase:
The pollutant's rating was 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidate in mid-June, the Monmouth University voting showed that only two of the 10 Republicans had a positive view of this real magnet.
In half of July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six of the 10 Republicans have a reputation for Donald Trump.
Three out of 10 people say they have a negative view of him.
And this number is going to be in the initial stages.
Following the vote of the University of Quinnipiac, which last week, it was found that 60 per cent of the Republicans had a positive opinion on Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be at peace with Trump as a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 per cent of Republicans indicated that they would be either "relief" or "peace" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 indicated that they would be "disgusted" from his candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates a hole at the same level as the Trump (43 percent of people said they would be "inspired" to 40 percent who say the same about the Trump).
Next closest to top level?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of Republican voters claim that they would be "sustained" or "solved" if they were to favour Jeb Bush as a candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperature as a problem.
While Donald Trump was widely criticized for his jealousy and hatred, 52 per cent of Republican voters were strongly urged to believe that the actual size has a correct temperature for the president's post, according to the ABC News/Washington Post vote.
The same number is held in the state of Iowa senatorial club, which is the first in the country where 52 per cent of Republicans think they have the leadership, according to Quinnipic from last week.
Still, 44 percent feel that he has no personality to serve effectively, and almost 6 out of 10 independent people say his temperature does not belong to the White House, according to ABC/Post.
The Republicans are accustomed to this idea.
When they set up their student clubs, Republican voters think that Trump is a real candidate.
On the question of who, with the highest likelihood of winning the GOP, four out of 10 said that Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC study last week.
It's a change from late July when four out of 10 got their money to Hell Bush.
Full publication: GOP fans did not in the past have the best Christmas dress.
In the past cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans selected Rick Perry as a candidate for 28 per cent for the possible appointment of Mitta Romney.
However, it is shown that a certain number of GOP voters see the Trump campaign as credible.
Even though the Republicans gathered around another candidate, the Trump also beats almost everyone.
Some students point out that the split field is probably contributing to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trupov's support is diffusively extended between more than a dozen other candidates.
But a study by Monmouth University from the beginning shows that in a hypothetical direct file between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump is almost always receiving majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorin on 13 points, Mark Rubie on 14 points, Walker on 15 points, Fuck Bushem on 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Christ on 33 points in each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruise.
The only candidate who's hurting him?
Ben Carson would lead a dealer with 19 points in a hypothetical match against one another.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters claim they've already made their own opinion.
A new CBS/NYT survey shows that more than half of the supporters of the Trump claim that their views are no longer changing.
It's obvious that many things can change, and no one can really say that he would never change his mind.
46 per cent claim that they leave open the rear door to change between candidates.
However, Trump's current most powerful opponent is his foreign neurosurgery colleague Ben Carson, but voters who consider their final opinion to be twice as likely to vote for the Trumpa.
6 out of 10 Republicans are clearly in agreement with Trump on immigration issues.
Even since Donald Trump has called immigrants from Mexico "violent" in the announcement of his campaign, immigration remains the main and central theme of the 2016 conversion.
Some fear that the Trump's insatiableness removes the key Spanish voters from the Republican side and damages the rebending force.
However, according to the new ABC/Post survey, six of the 10 Republicans claim to agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as the subject of immigration remains in the sphere of reflection, Donald Trump will also remain.
Freustration from government achieves new maximums.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson today receive half of the support from the Republican voters, especially in view of their status as aliens.
Six of the 10 Republicans in the new ABC/Post new Sunday vote claim that they want a political outsider better than someone with government experience.
And they're also very loose in Washington.
The vote of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowj a few weeks ago said three of the four Republicans in Iowë were frustrated in the Congress, 54 per cent were "unsatisfied" and 21 per cent were "failed."
The Council supported most of the State's coal payments.
Chesko gets more than 400 million.
In the first reading, the delegation supported the government's new mountain law, which regulates the high cost of payments from high-performance coal companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised the Members that, thanks to this, they would earn more money than the state fund, so the city budgets.
The proposal was criticised by the opposition's representatives who feared that the tax companies would no longer want to sponsor citizens as long as they would pay higher payments directly to the state budget.The first reading supported the government's new higher law, which also means that the state should receive a large share of the tax on the surface of heavy coal from the tax companies.
The country's share increases by 67 per cent, while the city's share decreases by 75 per cent by 33 per cent.
The proposal also changes the way in which the compensation is calculated for non-increasing companies.
The change in non-increasing payments will result in a government deficit of 427 million more than in 2013.
The city's budget is based on the government's neutral impact, because the payment is going to be higher.
In the previous year, the city received a total of 450 million dollars and a national budget of 150 million dollars.
From the difficulties of the coal mine, the city was about 200 million kroner, and the state was 66 million kroner.
The new is also calculated by increasing the rewards from the supply space with an approved weight of 1000 kroner per hectare per year.
Acceptance of these offices must continue to be fully accessible to the public.
Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MEPs that the citizens are getting 14 million to 100 million dollars annually.
More tax payments will no longer be prescribed by the law but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
The remuneration shall be re-calculated as a fraction of the amount of the growth and the rate for the individual types of non-growth.
According to the government, changes are the result of changes, except for the possibility of a generous response to the current economic situation.
Ambassador ODS Marek Benda, however, warned that the establishment of a fee under the government regulation should not be in accordance with the Constitution.
However, according to Minister Mádka, the tax is not in this case because the state pays off the state's state-owned state-owned non-growth.
Payments are made only to the citizens whose territories are seriously affected.
In the case of deep difficulties, the coal will receive three quarters of the city’s money and a quarter of the state.
The same will be true in the case of the difficulty of radioactive horn.
The share of the money that will stand on the payments from the difficulty will be literally bound.
For example, 28 per cent will have to be injured after pregnancy or in order to ensure the protection of the pension.
The proposal was criticised by opposition messengers who claimed, in particular, that the people were affected by the hardship and the land.
For example, Michael Kuchera (TOP 09 and Starostov) warned that tax firms would no longer want to sponsor citizens as long as they are, because they will pay higher payments directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget of the Minister of Finance," said David Kádner (Usvit) selected in the Austrian country.
Before the growth of unemployment in Moscow, KSČM Hana Auliká protected the delegation.
Kádner and Aulicka successfully proposed a new refusal, Kuchera wanted to return the government to work.
According to the recitals above, the increase in the prices of coal prices is not acceptable in the recitals, since prices are more than 90 per cent long-term.
The main consumers as electricity or heat should therefore not be able to feel the price.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that the charitable organisations will be compensated for the increase in the wage by their efforts to reduce their operating costs, which would, in particular, mean reducing the number of employees," the government said.
However, it argues that the increase in wages from employment is unnecessary.
According to the report to the new Milan Urban (ČSSD), it is crucial that the Members know the conclusions of the updated energy concept and, in particular, the decision by the Government on the limits of the burden.
If the oil is weighed beyond the limit, then it will have an impact on the benefits for the state and the population, it will increase.
Urban does not agree with Mádek that the decision to break the threshold at the bottom of the Czechoslovakia Army should fall by 2020.
The limits below ČSA should be broken down by reason of social, national economic and long-term stability of Turkish energy.
Happy to take Chechny as a unit, setting up an influential time.
All four times the Tennis will appear during the fourth rescue of Davis' garage in India on the table and this time each of them will most likely be involved in the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navrátil plans that, in view of the difficult conditions, the burden will be spread throughout the quarter.
In Dilli there is hot and high humidity in the air, so we are expected to be able to hold up to five seats.
We've got to take it back.
I'd like to spread it in time.
And according to what it will look like, Naturnal said at today's Czech election training in the center of Rajje Kumár Khanny.
With the same team and the world's fourteenth-century Jirrem Wessel, he's counting into the fifth and Sunday games.
In both positions, Luke Rosol and Radek Štépanek are probably vaccinated.
I'd like them to join almost everyone.
I've got it in my head, but I'm not saying it yet, the captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech system should be Štépánk's participation in Saturday's four.
It's just a question of who's going to be next to an experienced deblicacy, which has in Davis's quarter of the balance of 18:4.
It's probably not gonna be happy.
There's a chance with Rosa or Adam Pavlás.
"I really don't know who and how it's going to look," he said.
It will be decided according to the development of the two.
The variant can be Pavlásek, with Veselý in the 1st round of the prize in the mud over Australia.
"He's very obedient," said the Naturnal.
I was told against Australia, and when I was playing, I'd like to introduce the same performance as I've shown from the second set.
"I like those experiences and I would like to bring a point," said Pavlasek.
Homestead of two Yuki Bhambrih (125. in the ATP bridge), who won the last week's challenger in Shanghai, where he won the third and fourth cents of the bridge.
The two will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
They're both players from the challengers and our experience from the ATP Tour, but we've been convinced many times that the jellyfish in Davis do not break up.
"It resolves the present form, time," said Navrátil.
The flight openings begin at 6:30 SELCH and can be extended for time.
According to the prediction, the ring has a ring and the chart is not under the roof.
However, the game can be played by artificial lighting.
They've already won it, and it's got some two thousand lux, which is enough.
"It should be allowed to be buried under the light," he said.
Jeremy Corbyn will start at Prime Minister's Questions
From his selection, Mr. Corbin's debut in PMQ is highly expected
New staff leader Jeremy Corbyn will have his debut in Prime Minister's Questions later, and he will first have to work with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn is the first of his six assigned questions shortly after Monday, while his performance will probably be carefully examined by the media and the Members.
In his weekly statement, he asked for "a little bit of a diva and more facts."
He also indicated that he could skip several sessions that would leave his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corby's leadership, which will come after his appointment to the Chinese Cabinet and his opening speech to the TUC Annual Congress.
In the meantime, the decision of the lab leader to be quiet during the national humour in service on Tuesday for the 75th anniversary of the battle on Britain met with criticism from a number of conservatives, and it is the focus of some of the stories on the title pages.
Mr. Corbin's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
Speaking Mr. Corbyna said he'd be stuck in silence and he'd recognize the "hardness of the Royal Air Force in the battle against Britain."
However, Mr. Corbin's member of the shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, sent the BBC Two's Newsnight program to recommend the lab leader to sing the national anthem "no matter" on his conviction that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost thousands of Chinese ministers refused to serve in Mr Corbin's top team, cited differences in the economy, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than six parliamentarians initially supported him as a leader.
Political co-rapporteur BBC Robin Brant says that political differences in work are also "ordered" after Mr Corbin's appointment over his position in the European Union and the government's duty limit.
Mr Corbyl pointed out at the TUC conference that the Administrative Party had proposed amendments to remove the whole concept of the dose limit.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, a shadow worker and pensioner, indicated that the party "very clearly" was renovating government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Head of the Division, to whom David Cameron has been headed for the last decade since his election as the leader of the conservatives.
The head of a business party who has promised a different approach to politics, claims that he has an idea "from the tax" on Mr Cameron's questions and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North argues that PMQ is too confrontational and that it remains as "pretty answers" to the so-called trade, and instead promises that it will focus on important problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn says that Angela Eagle, a shadow trade secret, will represent him on PMQ when he is not involved — for example, when Mr. Cameron is traveling abroad.
He also left the idea that he would allow other colleagues to come up with him from time to time because he was allowed to hear that he was still discussing the whole matter with the speaker John Bercow.
When Mr. Cameron became leader in 2005, he said he wanted to withdraw from the style of politics "Punch and Judy", which was often linked to PMQ, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed.
Since its first release in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer for leaders, their leadership and their position between the other MPs, although critically argued that they have become characterised and needed long-term reforms.
"Focation in Joburg": Young homeless trained as photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place for homelessness.
But one group of former street children found a way to learn something and make a living.
"I was out in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take photos of their neighbors and make money like that.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

The Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging reports from the Richemont luxury group.

Chief JD Sports says higher brains could damage expansion
The Executive President of JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that a higher minimum wage for workers in the United Kingdom could mean "more purchasing power in potential consumers' pockets."
But it is unlikely that the purchasing power would carry higher air costs in his company, he claims.
The costs could include plans for the expansion of JD Sports, which could mean less new jobs.
The Prussian apartment's backyards are on fire.
Controversial building got a step.
Investor Prague Progetti e Investimenti considers the decision to be contrary and will appeal against it.
Against the building that was to arise in the close proximity of the Anesh monastery in the centre of Prague, a protest was made before Prahy's office of 1 percent of the people, and a petition was made.
The Magistrate found in the decision that the construction law had been violated because not all of the grounds for the territorial decision had been met.
"The appropriate territorial decision does not include, for example, any kind of land, distance from neighbouring buildings, sufficiently clearly and understandablely described structure form, delimitation of the territory affected by the construction," he writes in his decision.
As an illegal master, he also considers that some of the basiss for the decision have been issued to an original document which has changed.
For example, it's about the position of the authorities in the environment.
The part of the building should arise on the ground of the National Gallery, an investor but has no valid agreement.
However, it appears from the written material that the owner of the land, however, only agreed with the project documentation for the land management, not with the installation of the building on his land, writes the Building Board.
According to Francesca Augusta Razetta from the investment firm of the Building Board, he did not take a decision by the Authority - the Ministry for Local Development, according to which the duration of the study had already expired.
Anyway, it's about the scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for seventy years, we have observed all the laws of the Czech Republic and we respect all the authorities and institutions concerned," Razetto said in a press report.
The project that people are experiencing because of the specifically proposed color of the fascists is a marsmellon, leading to a strong emotion in Prague.
In the center of the city in the past, hundreds of people gathered in protest against the building.
The association and the inhabitants of nearby homes are concerned that some permit was issued years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticise the inadmissibility of buildings for the historic centre of Prague and the independent neighborhood of the Anjek monastery.
The house was proposed by architect Zdeněk Francek, the project changed several times.
The original form of the 2008 project, calculated by the original phase, was rejected on the basis of the view of the National Memorial Constitution (NPU) of the Ministry of Culture and cancelled in 2010 the approval of the Prussian Memories.
The new project of Prague Projecti e Investimenti with face-to-face windows, but the NPU and the Magistrates agreed and a building permit was issued on this basis.
The author of the proposal rejects the emissions of resistors, before never counting the façade in pink, which gave the project a preview of red sugar.

At the time, he said it wasn't criminal in Hungary, he told Lid's newspaper.
We knew that the guards of the law would not be able to handle this.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise, they arrested us and transferred us to an investigation mission in Szeged, he wrote a letter.
At last, he spent nine hours in politics.
The police were right at first, but they had to communicate because they didn't know English very well.
However, the connection he said was sad.
For example, in our entire range of approximately three times four meters, 15 swirls from Syria were pressed.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people had been closed there the second day, and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what was going to happen to them, presented Berg.
What can't be fun anymore?
Ask the President of the Executive Chamber.
On Friday, 18.9., from 9:30, we will answer readers' questions to the President of the Executive Chamber of ČR Mgr. Pavla Fuchíkova.
You can ask it for amendments to the implementing law applicable from 1 September 2015 and other matters relating to executives or executives.
Metcash launchs a campaign on the outside to fight invasive Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA business from Aldi's efforts in southern and western Australia.
Metcash launchs a campaign on the outside to fight invasive Aldi
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first of more than 120 shops in southern and western Australia at the beginning of the next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food providers and make IGA brands through marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers add marks such as the Simmo's based ice cream maker at Dunsborough and the business owners sell discounts on the Australian football league to local customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29, when food, alcohol and hardware vendors celebrate their annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot in the chain because southern and western Australia represents nearly 30 percent of the Metcash IGA trade steps and generates higher trade than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in southern and western Australia are notoriety provincial and IGA trades enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA compared to around 14 per cent in the eastern states.
Anyway, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will recover by 5% of the food market in these two countries during the 12th month since the opening of the first trades that took over markets from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
This week in his report analyst Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, estimated that the retail IGA could spend $360 million on annual sales and Metcash $250 million at the end of 2016.
This proposal is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops in South Australia and 30 in the West during the next year and will generate sales of USD 500 and $600 million in individual markets.
The loss of food and volume of sales at a fixed price base of Metcash could be estimated at around $13 million in the pre-tax income, Mr Kierath confirmed.
Meanwhile, Metcash lost part of the markets in the eastern states, mainly against Aldi and Coles, although last study found that the buyers in IGA were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that the sale of Metcash food is 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, and its market share is reduced from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week leading manager of the Hamish Douglass fund, founder of the financial group Magellan, said business in Melbourne could "be very likely to disappear during the decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Douglas's comment.
But it is known that a member of the Metcash presidency contacted Douglasse last week.
The IGA market share fell from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and the profits from the Metcash food trade, which provides about 1200 retail IGAs , fell by 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting the operational development of speculation changes because sales and outputs are under pressure.
However, large sales went to the counter and invest more than 150 million dollars a year in order to adjust the fuel prices in Cole and Woolworths to hundreds of products every week and thus help IGA small businesses to refurbish trade by adding fast-growing food and newspaper from individuals.
Executive Director Metcash, Ian Morrise, claims that the price adjustment and supply of goods are taking place and hopes that the wholesaler will return to basic profit growth in 2017 first in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis Australia Steve Healthy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise for his conduct rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis became more lost in his recent habit around his friend Nick Kyrgyos and deserves to be praised for his conduct rather than criticism, says President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a young member of the talented two often-called "Special Ks," took an unwelcome look at himself, thanks to the affair with a well-known Kirgios and Stan Wawrinko at Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a highly qualified run in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be split up twice, Harrison then declared, "Wawrinka had one to push Kyrgyzstan and I had to push him too."
While he was the last to see how they broke the rocket after he was hit by a possible escape from Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Kokinakise suddenly denied Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgov, where he competes with Sam Grothem on his second round of Bernard Romic in the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"I've been thinking deeply about the fact that Thanasi was a little involved in the whole dispute," says Healy.
He destroyed himself when he lost his rocket because of a crash in the US, but he's not the first player who would kill himself because of frustration on his own. I know Thanasi's pretty well and I can say that this is not going to happen.
But he did very well because he was exposed to a very provocative situation in the US for Harrison and so on, so I think he deserves great recognition.
He's got a fantastic team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated some hard.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he's working very hard, and he's got a great team, and so far, he never had a problem with other players, he's very respectable, he's hard, he's in a wonderful condition, it's a very stable and successful young guy, and I just think he deserves to be a judge according to his own reasons.
Healy also supported the decision to review Kyrgyzstan's important campaign on Friday, stating that "a mutual decision" is the right solution for everyone, but supports a family from Canberry to return to the team as a long-term chair.
"First of all, we want our team to be just focused on the game and not on all the controversy surrounding it," says Healy.
And I think Nick's standing as fast as Federer, Murray and others show, in public eyes, he also made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and some time beyond the explanation when he's going to be able to think about it, is in my opinion the best solution for the team and also for him himself.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares emergency status, closes borders and keeps migrants
Following the notification of the situation of the threat of Hungary on Tuesday, the southern border closed with Serbia and those who tried to pass it illegally so as to stop a host of migrants.
On the border was chaos, as hundreds of migrants gathered in the country, and Serbian authorities reacted badly.
Those who have spent an unknown period in the sands of the land between the two states shall stand before the violence in the land of their birth; they shall stand up and prostrate themselves.
But there's a sense of frustration coming.
When helicopters pass over them, migrants call together "Open Borders!" and provide a regular unit of Hungarian police.
Some protesters refuse food and water.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declares that it was "unacceptable" to send the refugees back from Hungary, while they are increasingly arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbian) wants to be part of the solution, not just an immediate commitment.
It will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries during the next days," says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The rest of the Hungarian-Serbian border came the day after the block of 28 states did not come with a single immigration policy at further meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people looking for protection in the surprises of Italy and Greece and spoke with hope of reaching a possible agreement next month or at the end of the year, which would take more than 120,000 other refugees, including Hungary.
The German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Rakousko called on Tuesday for a special European summit next week to discuss the continental crisis.
Hungary, however, did not trust Brussels or its neighbors.
The southern threat situation in the two southern regions gave the authorities greater power to resolve the crisis and allowed them to close the roads and speed up court cases of asylum.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Sjijarto said his country is also planning to build a fleet from the rest of the border along the border with Romania to stop passengers who are trying to cross their country when the fleet is now completed on the Serbian border.
CBS News co-rapporteur Charlie D'Agata reported that even the prisoners were on the list of those who helped pull the remaining wires between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months Hungary has become the main weakest and most entry point in the European Union for refugees from Syria and other Middle East countries.
However, the president of the government, Viktor Orban, insisted that most of them are economic migrants who are going for a better life and not war refugees who are looking for protection, which is a view that is clearly different from other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws that entered into force on Wednesday in Hungary now criminalize the breach of the 4-metre radius, which the government has allowed to establish on the southern border with Serbia, and also establish longer periods of imprisonment for those who translate the refugees illegally.
"Thanks to the situation caused by the mass migration of Hungary's government, the situation is threatening," Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
In this we have absolutely clear: illegal crossing of borders is a crime.
Technically, Parliament has to continue to accept the deployment of the army that was expected in the coming week, but the Associated Press reporters on the border have been observing the heavy armed forces with vehicles and dogs for a few days.
Gyorgy Bacondi, consultant for domestic defence, said that the authorities had arrested 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 had already been arrested on State territory.
Victims of damage to the environment and are now under police control accused of breaking the procedures in accordance with the new laws.
The authorities quickly let the fleet settle.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday after using a train covered by the rest of the road.
At the main border crossing in Russia, chaos arose because the Hungarians opened a small office in the coal container for processing and caused pressure on people.
There were about 20 in there, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of sprinklers blocked the main distances connected with Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border to Hungary.
Volby 2016: Next Hillary Clinton before Bernie Sanders reduced half in national vote
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton is still holding a double-digit scholarship in the Democratic National Nomination Institute, but Senator Bernie Sanders is getting her scholarship.
Clinton now supports 47 per cent of the democratic primary voters (less than 58 per cent), while Sanders is second with 27 per cent (more than 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who is still aware of whether he will want to be president, receives 15 per cent of the support of democratic prime ministers.
More than five months before the start of major competitions, the most democratic voters claim that it is too soon to say that they are clearly the decisions the candidates will support.
But the sponsors of Clinton are more sure of their choice than those who support other candidates.
From a CBS News survey last month, Clinton's soil was lost under foot in several demographic groups, while Sanders received several times.
Clinton keeps a big gap between women and tends to slow down, but her behavior gets worse.
Her support between the men was significantly reduced and Sanders only lost five points.
The outcome of Clinton's journey with democratic voters was less than 50 years old, and now they're equal to Sanders.
Clinton still has great leadership thanks to older voters.
Last month, Clinton had two-digit jumps in front of Sanders between liberals, but now Sanders is losing only 5 points in this group.
About half of the democratic primary voters in the entire states say she would be very supportive of Clinton if she became a candidate for the party.
The fourth would support it with certain rewards and the next 15 per cent would support it only because it is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
It's probably not surprising that Clington's current allies are particularly interested in her.
The views are mixed with those who do not support Clinton at the present time - only about a quarter would support her.
While 48 per cent of the democratic primary voters say that they would support Clinton, less Republican voters also say about their favorites, Donald Trump (35 per cent).
When Clinton's guests are asked in an open question why they want it as a candidate, the most common answer is that he has the right experience (16 per cent), that time has come to be the president (13 per cent) and that he is the best candidate for this job (10 per cent).
Clinton's peers also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
It is further cited that there is a great choice and agreement on problems.
While the vice-president is considering the potential candidate for the president, 57 per cent of the democratic primary voters would wish to take the lead - a third still thinks that the candidate should not.
When the primary democratic voters were asked who would choose as the second election for appointment of the party, the most common election is Biden.
Among the recipients of Clinton's award, more than half of Biden's bid as their second vote, far before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to apply for the appointment of Democrats, Hillary Clinton's leadership will be extended from 20 points when Biden will apply for 30 points without his candidate.
Fifty percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning in general elections; however, this figure fell from 78 percent last month.
Beden is far different in this respect, but the percentage of people who see it as the most likely choice is rising.
However, when it comes to the question of the greater importance of the candidate, democratic voters give priority to solving problems before greater election opportunities.
Like last month, not one democratic candidate or potential candidate does not appear to be an unfriendly candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key characteristics among their primary voters.
Most see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and think they have strong leadership qualities.
The fact that all three lead to honesty while Clinton is a powerful guide.
Thirty percent of the democratic primary voters do not think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, so twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent does not have this opinion.
Primary Democrats also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological view.
As far as all these measures are concerned, perhaps the fourth of the democratic voters has no opinion on Sanders.
As questions regarding Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal e-mail and server as state secrets continue, most of the primary democratic voters are satisfied with its explanation of this matter and say that their overall view has not been affected by it at all.
But between the U.S. public, it's a totally different story.
Half of the Americans are now upset with her explanation, while only about a third is calm.
Public views on this topic have already been divided in March, shortly after the issue has been resolved.
Most Americans claim that this emial controversy has no effect on their overall view of Clinton, while 36 percent of their views on Clinton have been distorted.
It's mainly about the Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 claim their views on Clinton have fallen.
Although Clinton is considered to be honest and reliable among its voters, this question remains a problem among the registered voters in general: only 32 per cent sees it as honorable and reliable, which is a decrease of eight points from last month and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think they're honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters throughout the country do not see the Trumpa as honorable and trustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump have good signs of leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, the best were Biden, Carson and Bush.
Sanders sees more people as honest than bad, but, just like Carson, a lot of voters don't have an opinion on it.
The error rate in the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson finished with Donald Trump in the national elections
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times
Two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest survey and the others are leaving to collect support.
Several Republicans throughout the country continue to support the Trupa tree majority, with 23% of the support in the latest CBS survey carried out prior to the Fox News debate last month, 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson fired from 6 to 23% at the same time.
The study also found that Carson is leading well over demographic groups and lists the Trupa among university-educated Republican voters.
The remainder of the field with the exception of Carly Fiorina and the state government of Ohio John Kasache, was completely supported by Scottt Walker, who has fallen to 2% at the same time.
Former Governor Floridy Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all 6% in third place.
The error rate in the sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest survey is 6% plus minus 6% and ran into September.
The latest study of CNN/ORC published last week showed that Carson improved and reached 19% of the support between the Republicans for Trump by 32%.
A recent study from ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump was clearly ahead of Carson.
At a steady trend, Carson decided to dump a blind neurosurgeon in the service, and even Carson apologized for his arguments regarding Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during the campaign in Iowë.
Five members of the brotherhood were charged with the death of the student of the first year of Baruch College
About two years after the student died during a brotherly ritual in Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, he was charged with murder against five people.
The New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chuna "Michaela" Deng during the beginning of the order in September 2013 and later taken him to a hospital, which contributed to his death, reported to the police.
The police state that he had a pregnant eye, had a full weight of 30 pounds on him, and was repeatedly burdened when he tried to reach his goal through the frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally ran into his head pain and then fell unconscious.
The P.D.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P. didn't call 911 immediately after Deng's speech, and apparently waiting for an hour before they took him to the hospital, the police said.
However, they found time to change Dengo's dress, to overcome his symptoms and to contact Andy Menga, the president of the whole of the brotherhood, and to ask him for advice, police chief Chris Vagner brought him to the press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide the equipment and essentially gave priority to the welfare of the brotherhood before Michael Denga's life," said Chief Wagner.
He couldn't revive him and died the other day in the morning.
According to the polling report, Deng was repeatedly hit by a dumb object into his head, body and foot.
"A large number of families were forced to suffer because of overcrowding in the brotherhood, and at least one student dies every year for overcrowding since 1970," says Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Dengo's family, in a statement.
The brotherhood and their members must be responsible and this step is important by the authorities.
The High Court of Monroe County recommended the murder of the third grade for the first five members.
Thirty other members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Menga, will also be accused of the attack on the accused and criminal society.
"We want to keep not only the participants, but if there is an organisation that has approved it, whether officially or informally, we are also responsible," Wagner said at the afternoon press conference.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood broke down its relationship with the local branches.
This happens when Fed increases interest rates
The increase in the rate will come and the current market will collapse, the debt benefits will rise and the economy will be reduced to recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how long it takes and how long it will last.
For the economy, the stories of a small source of timing are presented.
Reception came after 11 months after the first increase in the rate and lasted 86 months.
The aggression of the Federal Reserve System in raising the rate is often, although not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
That's why the U.S. Central Bank officials emphasized so strongly that investors should not be focused on when the increase of the rate begins, but rather on the trajectory as long as normalization takes place.
There are actually more variables in the game.
However, in the end, the Member States can ensure that all trends due to an increase in speed can be overcome.
"The first rise of Fed from the time of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as the end of the era of 'left money'," said Julian Jessop, a leading global economy of Capital Economics.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual return of American level rates to a more common but still low, creating a seismic shock that many might fear.
That means it's going to happen to the inevitable effects.
Here is the view of how some areas of the economy will react on the basis of historical trends:
In view of what the market has recorded in the last two months, the expected increase in the rate may cause air to become somewhat unstable.
As soon as the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend for re-stopping action after 12-24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect the gap in foreign policy," the Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the Feda increase.
More specifically, the market for the last 35 years is often the largest - about 14 per cent - measures to increase rates in the range of 250 days (mean increase of 2.6 per cent) and then returns to normal status after 500 days, with an average cost of the last six cycles 14,4 per cent, according to the recent analysis of Boba Dolla, the main strategy of the Nuveen Asset Management, published on Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on the action tends to become clearer later in the increase rate cycle and the return begins to decrease.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but increasing rates often help her.
At the present time, Fed is facing certain conditions that have not yet existed and could speed up the recession.
The most remarkable thing is that the rough home product is near its lowest point in history when Fed's rate increases.
According to Deutsche Bank, during the year 1950, only two times the nominal average growth of GDP was under 4.5 per cent.
Although in the second quarter of 2015, it was 3.6 per cent, it was low to expect its maintenance, while in the third quarter it was only 1.5 per cent, says Atlanta Fed.
The increase in the rate in this complex economic background could be risky and the question could arise, "if this time is different," Deutsche said.
The market participants were ready to grow up throughout the year and all eyes turned to the meeting of the Federal Free Market Committee, which ended this week and ended on Thursday.
While many strategies and economies believe that FOMC could accept growth at this meeting, future trade only indicates a 25% probability.
"In our study since 1950, all the growing cycles of the past have been in the supercycle of increasing the peace effect with the HDP covering tops of the start of the recession very quickly after the beginning of the siege," says the report.
On the other hand, this was a markedly slow recovery from the worst recession in the sample collection period.
The current cycle is far the longest when Fed was waiting for the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, we are now 74 months and we are still continuing.
It was also a positive result, since the market expects a price increase and the pattern is somewhat similar to what the shares are doing.
The main difference is that the impact is faster in debt than in action when Fed changes policy direction.
It appears in the letters that the results of the change in direction are immediately after the first rise/down of the cycle.
At the end of the debt increase cycle, debt benefits fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Strategic Charlese Schwaba believes that increasing the rate leads to a close approach between long-term and short-term debt, which is just a mistake.
Debts with high performance often work better in this climate, even though "we are still careful about pushing output," said Kathy Jones in his analysis, a firm analysis of fixed income in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones thinks that markets are already adapted to the expectations of Feda's policy.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to a more tighter exchange policy," she wrote.
The short-term interest rates are higher, the profit margin is wider, the credit gap has increased and the volume has increased - all market characteristics as Fed accelerates policy.
It is generally said that companies that carry out most of their business in the United States will win the rate of growth and local products will become more attractive.
A lot of debts will be incurred by international companies, as the growing dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market and their debt will also be increased.
"History shows that "quality" shares tend to overcome over the course of three months after the initial increase of the rate," Goldman Sachsve said in a customer report.
With strong balances, the companies presented weak development companies in each increase in levels in 1994, 1999, 2004 averaged 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital outputs, as well as low-voltility savings, have also exceeded their current lower quality by 4 (percentage points), respectively 3 (percentage points).
It's going to be a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of moving interest rates will lose most, Goldman said.
Despite clean stock games, consumers are also struggling with growing dollars.
The participants can also see their profits through higher results, but experts have different opinions on how long it will last.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, claims Ambassador Andrew Bingham
Conservative Ambassador Andrew Bingham criticised this station for "circumcised"
The view remains that what continues to be more noticeable than its commercial competitor
He also focused on BBC Music Awards and says they're just subduing British.
Postlane colleague Damien Collins attacked Voice and says he's not the original idea
BBC Radio 3 "changes" in Classic FM, claims the previous messenger and collects a clean pressure on the transmission to show that they're doing something that commercial transmission doesn't do.
Conservative Ambassador Andrew Bingham also told the BBC leaders that the public service station seems to be "infamous" and is still more indisputable than its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems to be--I don't like to use the word "crazed"-- but it seems to change to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on BBC Music Awards, which began in December of last year.
BBC Music Awards, which began last year, seems to be Britain under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different -- these are two examples that attack me when you actually just like what we have on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director-General of BBC rejected the charge on the grounds that BBC Radio 3 is far from its commercial competitor in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 would not have been taught on any other radio.
And their commitment to live with music and the creation of music is actually at the top level.
"I also think that Radia 3's commitment to finding new songs and introducing new works into practice is also very important," he says.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Regulator Radio 3 Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to join the audience than before, because the British are less learning about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only first production of BBC, which got under the ball because of the defeat of commercial competitors during the sending of Culture, Media and Sport and got to the hearing of the Commission.
Conservative Ambassador Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a musical talent show that BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media for the estimated price of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is discussed as non-original and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the show BBC1 - in which the stars of Palma Faith andBoy George as judges - was made "in a typical way for BBC."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from its own state" when it's next to start a fun series.
However, he refused to order more future series of The Voice series or spend money on other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales increase the lowest temperature from August and may be on Friday
The first three months of 2015 recorded 7% increase in online sales
Last month was marked with the lowest growth since the year 2000 itself began
Internet sales were strengthened three years ago by mobile purchase
The expert believes that November's Black Friday could be the reason for the speeding of the loss.
For more than ten decades, virtual purchases have been on the rise, and thanks to it, many of the British main streets have become the cities of the spirits.
However, experts claim that there are signs of online sales standing, and new data indicate a seven-percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for the srp represented the lowest growth increase since the year 2000, with an increase of only 5 per cent compared with the previous year.
The experts claim that there are signs of online sales standing and that new data indicate a seven-percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"When you look at the level of growth over the past year and go back to the year 2000, the situation has always been rationalised in time," says Guardian Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG market index.
It explains that Internet sales were strengthened three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to carry out purchases.
This meant that people were able to buy online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the discount.
But now (growth) is going down somewhere, and that's why it seems to take off.
The phenomenon of the Blackbird, which was transferred from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
The experts believe that customers could keep the purchases before this event takes place on the last Friday in November.
In the past year, five times more than the average purchasers turned to their computers to arrange for purchases and agreed on several sales sites.
The experts believe that the Black Friday, which the buyer re-contracts, can keep customers from other purchases
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of each £5 was lost online.
For some products such as television and practice, more than a third of the sales are carried out through the web trade.
Also more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of buying in stone fashion shops.
Muslims buried the victims of the fall of the river in Mexico and the family Bin Ládin was sentenced
29 dead bodies were transferred to the streets of Muslims during the first funeral in Mexico
Saudi Arabia partially digs wine for a colapse of the design magnetate Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health indicated that 394 people were also injured after the plague
The Muslim forces gathered to bury 29 victims of the fall of the lake in the Grand Mosque in Mexico. The bodies of the victims were taken off the street.
Dressed in a certain measure in white, the mourners chose the way and paid the sacrifice when the first of the victims arrived on their last trip to the cemetery in Al-Moais.
The sad message passed through the holy place, where just a few days earlier the building vessel had broken through the mass and became believers.
The body was released for burial and the king of Saudi Arabia sentenced the construction group of bin Ládin to a disaster that also left 394 wounded.
29 dead bodies after the fall of the sea in Grand Central Moscow in Mexico were taken by streets
Among the dead was the father of four children Qasim Akram from Bolton, the Greater Machester, who was on his first trip when the lake broke.
Mr. Akram was in Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of each year's squash.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that as soon as they arrive in Mecca, thousands of people will continue to join the city.
King Salman said today that Binadin Group shouldn't have left the upper edge of the sea if he wasn't in operation.
The Arab version of the statements by the State of the Saudi Press Agency states that Binladin Group is partly responsible for the flood.
The English service of the disc agency did not report this detail, but indicated that the heads of the company were prohibited from travelling abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to discover what caused the seabed to fall into the Grand Museum, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims flocked before Hadj’s attack later this month.
Binladin Group did not issue any statement of the Cyrus's collapse and were not made available to its representative for comment.
The Royal Statements also accused the Group of not using the latest security measures and lack of coordination with the meteorological officials.

Chief B&Q claims that Eastern European traders are already working for the left with the trend
The British are still more employed by traders, says Veronique Lauriy

Brits are retraced and sold to educated Eastern European farmers to work with them at home
If it comes to you with a loaded or malaria victim, you seem to be in the minority today.
Because the British continue to employ more and more traders in order to carry out customs duties at home, according to the Chief of Srewfix B&Q.
Veronique Lauri, the new executive director of Kingfisher, who owns the network for domestic needs, claims that the large increase in the number of students from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher is planning to open 200 other Srewfix trades aimed at dealers and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Ms. Lauri says she wants to hire more women in B&Q shops because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the shop make better half of them.
At present, most men's employees are male.
She said that there was a need to explain the rising demographic trends that reflect more female households, which are more domestic than in the past.
Mrs. Laurie says, "We're still working with most men in the shops.
We need to get closer to balance.
About half of our customers are women who make 80% of the decision on goods purchases.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Lauri, who is one of the only five women in the cormidas of the leading companies under the British FTSE100 index, has also restructured her spy team to reflect the balance between the directors of men and women.
Kingfisher is almost the same as having half the representation of women between employees, including executive and financial heads.
Ms. Laurie says: "It was a wise decision - diversity is an important issue here.
So it wasn't hard to find a good woman we'd take.
Kingfisher announced the fall in profit in half a year and sold after the group took over the cost of closing trade.
As a result of Kingfisher's trend, which owns Srewfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new shops
Prosinc's contribution to 600 crowns of pensioners is at risk.
"It is the justice of equal complaints, it has nothing to do with human justice," said the president of TOP 09 Miroslav Huosek, who stressed the principle of complacency.
The President of the ODS Ambassadors Mr Stanjör pointed out that a single contribution would be good, but it would be better to be in standard valuation for years to come.
"We have the space to find the mechanism we're going to set up," Stanjira said.
He supported the original proposal of Minister Michaely Marks (ČSSD), which was to be assessed over the framework of the law next year.
Mark’s argument was raised by the argument that it would improve the social situation of pensioners who are not in line with it.

From the outset, it was clear that Bartošk’s main role, which he had already worked with, was invisible.
Still, he was surprised by the early heres, who appeared before the camera after a further stop associated with the reconvalence after a serious illness.
We talked to each other three years ago.
I let him read the script and he said he likes how sad he is.
And he surprised me that he's obviously a busy athlete.
In the past, he always wondered where he was going to sit.
This time he walked on his bike, slept on the stairs, and even went to his head.
And that's all in record tropical veins, the director's face.
According to Bartowski, the former women are taking a tiger to make a queen in time.
They're gonna find him some stuff, but right away they're gonna close the door so they can't find him playing outside the palace on a tiger.
And we're trying to tell our movie about it, he commented here.

Azerbaijan has rejected a part of Telić's visit for the criticism of human rights violations.
The Czech Ambassador of the European Parliament, UN Secretary-General Paul Telečka, abandoned the four-fourth trip to Baku because the Azerbaijani authorities have cancelled the official part of his visit today.
Baku argues that the EU resolution of last week, which criticises the violation of human rights in Azerbaijan and has been a telečka co-operator.
In its decision, the Azerbaijani party Telička explained in a press release his Brussels office the possibility of discussions with the official partners and the visit of political prisoners who depend on the agreement of the authorities.
The road planned a few months ago, Telićka wanted to use the text sent to the Czech Republic to meet with the leadership and representatives of the executive and representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners.
The EP resolution condemns "unforeseen repression against civil society in Azerbaijan".
It called on European representatives to consider sanctions against all policies, officials and judges involved in political prosecution.
The resolution was adopted shortly after a recent ruling on Azerbaijani opposition journalist Chadiju Ismail, who was charged with detecting corruption in government circles.
Russia does not consider that it is building its airport in Syria.
The visit to Novosibirsk by Bogdanov did not suggest that in the future the Russian airport in Syria will arise.
We don't have such plans yet.
Nothing's left out, he declared.
In Syria, Russia already has an airport sea base in Tartus, which has been used more recently as a service and logistics centre.
According to the report of the Russian press, since the beginning of the Serbian supply of Russian weapons and military material to Syria have been stopped.
According to Moscow, it is a military embargo resulting from the payment of trade agreements.
Pentagon claims that the Russians are planning to build an airport in the city of Latakya, which is currently in favour of Syrian President Bashar Asada.
Washington, however, does not have a clear understanding of Russia's specific military objectives in Syria, the American commentators agree.
Foreign Minister John Kerry spoke on the situation in Syria on Tuesday with Russian colleague Sergey Lavrov, who had already been their third telephone conversation in the last ten days.
The following week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is released to Moscow to relieve the anxiety about the gathering of the Russian arsenal near Israel.
The White House spokesman Josh Earnest marked Asad's support for the protection of the sword by Moscow.
Russia's policy objectives in Syria have been declared to be more unclear.
According to him, Moscow made its satellite from Syria.
It may first mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a long-term goal, but what is not clear is what is said by Earnest.
The train in Syria must be based on today's speculation of Russian press with the main theme of Putin's appearance at the upcoming UN Valne Assembly in New York.
The situation in the Ukrainian Donbas, on the other hand, was not agreed by the Russian leader.
According to a report in The New York Times, the U.S. government does not consider President Barack Obama to be able to meet with the Russian President during the UN session.
The views between White House councillors are still falling apart.
The TASS agency today, calling on the words of Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov, wrote that Putin has not yet been on the program of his New York meeting with Obama.
Sezami oil is used in breast-feeding, which can help strengthen immunity.
The best way to increase the presence of unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra pannesic oils.
All healthy substances will remain in the oil when leaching from seed for the study.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of healthy diets, such as pellets.
Some extra pancreatic oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
They have just been based on the Institute of Medical Information and Statistics for several years as the most common cause of the death of Czechs.
Women in particular are affected by the lubricant’s activity, which helps them to cope with the effects of the oil.
If you are among lovers of the Asian cuisine, you should not miss out on the pastry oil, which is part of the original recipes for exotic foods.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in the heat treatment of foods and has a range of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in breast-feeding.
The essential fatty acids that contain are a good prevention of the cause of yellow stones.
These are 90 percent of the causes of sexual harassment, and women suffer 3 times more than men.
In general, problems are particularly affecting people with obesity who do not transport and consume a lot of animal fat.
Sesame oil can be used successfully in the liver, which is very similar to that of the cholera.
If people want to use all the health benefits that bring the consumption of this oil, they should pay attention to products from exotic foods.
Manufacturers from Asia often use seeds that have a more pronounced taste.
But the oil comes about all the active substances, Ladislav Hačecký, executive director of the Czech company Bohemia Oil from Kraslic in Sokolovsk, who produces the Pan-Pan oil that was lit for the student.
The company also manufactures and uses unexplained seeds of white cheese.
In an hour, our lion is able to draw up eight kilograms of sesame.
The raw material shall be heated at a maximum of 40 degrees by mechanical washing and therefore the product meets the criteria for marking an extra pancreas.
High temperatures would result in loss of vitals.
Sunflower oil is present in patients with heart disease and veins.
The Czech favorite between oil is solar.
A study by Jarmily Hamerské, who led to the University of Masaryk, revealed that he prefers 43% of the respondents in the hot kitchen.
However, it is not appropriate to decompose, and it is already starting to refuel at 180 °C.
It is better to use it, for example, on salads and is especially used in a diet that helps prevent cardiovascular diseases.
It contains the same high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which are the most low in cholesterol from all fatty acids.
When problems occur with the heart, attention should be paid to the amount of total intake of fat and calories.
For example, in one lake of solar oil is 62 calories, in the lake oil is 99 calories.
As regards the energy value of food, it is important to realize that there are many more natural foods with viable substances than so-called empty calories.
They are part of industrially modified products.
That's why it's appropriate to cook for extra pancreas oil.
This sun will remain the same as the sesame and total nine months.
The storage in the refrigerator is still longer.
Old oil people are especially familiar with the smell.
On the other hand, he didn't care about the bottom.
It's a sign that the substance was not chemically refined.
The total oil contains the most healthy acids.
The seeds of the technical knop are arranged for so-called superfood, and thus the total oil is considered to be the most healthy of plant oils.
For this indication, the maximum content of omega 3 and omega 6 of unsaturated fatty acids is added.
These essential fatty acids cannot produce the body itself, and man must accept them from food.
Especially important is the intake of omega 3 fatty acids.
A study of scientists published in the European journal of clinical experience showed that daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece spend 0.6 grams on it, but the Icelandic will take 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Concomitant oil is suitable for food as part of a supportive diet for the strengthening of immunity and for the treatment of injury.
It has harmful effects and is an essential part of rebellious membranes.
People don't need to be afraid of using total oil, it doesn't contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil was found on the way to consumers confirms that Bohemian Oil was one of the most sold.
He sells it 500 litres a year.
People often use one lie after the morning.
The final oil is not very attractive, but it is very strong immunity, Daniel Vlček of the beautiful company Bohemia Oil.
According to statistics, they're the largest nation of American grillers.
One house there is 1.4 greole.
Then there are the most diverse competitions throughout the world, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
They're not even Czechs in the back.
On the basis of consumer research in the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people did not cry.
Most of them then scream several times a year.
In order to be successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to adjust the mass to marineization several hours before the heat adjustment.
Which oil is the most appropriate and, at the same time, does it leave a healthy supply of wholesome substances?
It is generally paid that in the process of rinsing itself, the flow should be monitored.
The experts agree that much of the oil starts to lose their appetite at high temperatures.
Healthy extra pannesian oils also come about the body of prosperous substances, which we otherwise obtain when consuming oils from foods prepared at lower temperatures.
But that doesn't mean that extra pancreas oils will not find their use when they grow up.
A dangerous oil for heating, health and beauty.
When the mass is told, experts from the company Bohemia Oil from Kraslic in Sokolovsky will immediately be provided with a terrible oil.
Well, that adds a taste of meat and fish.
The kitchen identifies the unique properties of raising the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for shrinking and cooling because it has a high level of heating up to 216 °C.
Even at such high temperatures, as one of the few oil stores the health of the prosperous substance, Daniel Vlček from Bohemia Oil company, which belongs to a few Czech producers of this oil from the coal mine.
The experts agree that the dangerous oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
The following contains a high amount of linoleic acid and is thus effective in fighting cholesterol overheating.
Our body also accepts important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Due to the toxic content of these substances, it helps reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidney.
Consuming dangerous oils also helps to enhance our outer beauty - improves the elasticity of the skin, is used in the treatment of acne and helps care for dry and leg hair.
The chefs admire the use of dangerous oil in the kitchen.
Not only is it suitable for the preparation of studied foods, such as salads, but also for the warm treatment of foods.
In the case of rinsing, therefore, it can be used immediately in two ways, when rinsing and rinsing itself.
By marineizing mass and fish, we maintain their flexibility.
The preparation of marinad must contain three ingredients: oil, oxygen and corrosion.
For example, we add the yellow octopus, and we aim to dry the meat.
The roots also supply the mass of taste and the oil preserve and supply the correct line, says Daniel Vlček.
It also adds that dangerous oil is ideal for marine navigation because as one of the few oils it can penetrate through dark mass.
Therefore, marine masses or fish are ready for landing, how to proceed?
Extra pancreas oils are indicated by the presence of only a few cups for the preparation of foods.
It's the same payment for heating.
Some oils are for this way preparing a simple taboo.
This is particularly true of lignite, concoction and fish oil, which should not be burned at all.
Before cooking, you need to grow oil, so you can stop the burning of food.
The necessary part of the glazing is also the preparation of the Annex.
The giraffe’s mass and fish are produced practically anything - green vegetables, cooked bread, light green salads and many others.
The heads of Bohemia Oil recommend, for example, the Horké summer salad.
You need it: • 1 sachet • 1 sachet • 1 sachet of hands • 1 sachet • 1 sachet of salad leaves • 3 sachets of crude oil
Add to the salad table a mixture of salad leaves, sliced cherries, and a large boned broccoli.
According to taste and smell, you can also smell sweet chili and soybeans.
Finally, dig a few droplets of terrible oil.
Then you can taste the salad with a delicious flavored mandela.
Diluted sclerosis: it does not only concern the patients, but also the patient’s will to fight.
Sclerosis is a complex disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of experts: neurologists, physiotherapy, ergotherapy, urologists, ophthalmologists, psychologists, and many other specialists.
It is not only about medical care, for example, for women with osteoporosis who need advice if they decide to have a child, for example, on the care of these patients and on social and social advice to improve their housing, etc.
However, this is not enough: the development of disability can affect the patient itself in a major way.
The longer he is able to work, the longer he has to change the style of his life.
As the doctors warn, the passive care of the patients leaves room for the disease activity.
For example, regular movement is shown to be significantly longer when the patient needs some compensation, for example half.
It is important that patients and their surroundings do not rely on different methods, such as the fact that the disease automatically leads to the end of the vehicle.
And that's why the website of Dej created a chance (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by the current media campaign.
The most important person in the care of a patient with dilute sclerosis is neurology.
In dilute sclerosis, it has twice said that when the disease starts to be treated early, the doctor can influence something more.
It's because we've got medicines at a dilute sclerosis at an interesting stage when the neurodegeneration process is not so strong yet.
The earlier we get involved, the more hope is that we will be able to stop and remove disability, explains MUDr. Eva Medová from the Neurological Clinic of the General School Hospital in Prague.
Rehabilitation care is very important in people with depleted sclerosis, which most often solves the weakening of low-ends or imbalances.
It works with patients according to their individual needs: keeping the conditions, improving the foot, strengthening the upper hand, reducing the damage to the knee, or improving coordination.
"It's really individual, depending on the patient's particular problems," says MUDr. Martina Kuvari, primary clinic rehabilitation and physical medicine Faculty Hospital in Motole.
People with depressed sclerosis suffer the same difficulty, but it appears in each other a little differently.
Rehabilitation can't stop, but it can always slow down her symptoms.
The movement activity also strengthens the immune status of the body, which is in the case of depleted sclerosis requesting.
Another positive positive of regular exercise is the fact that the patients check everything they can, and that strengthens their safety.
"In exercise, endorphins also flow and the person feels well after it," warns PhDr. Kamila Rēss, of the Rehabilitation Clinic of the Royal Vinohrad College.
By affecting the physical page, we influence the Limbian system responsible for emotions.
That's how we get into mental and immune processes and stabilize the disease, it gives.
"In the past, these patients have so far gone, we know today that they need a targeted burden," says Professor PaedDr. Pavel Kollar, head of the Rehabilitation Clinic and the School Hospital in Motole.
The aim of physiotherapy is to make a person more self-responsive, including work order.
Therefore, physiotherapy cooperates with ergotherapy so that each person will receive compensation for his or her treatment.
Many patients also need the care of psychologists or psychiatrists.
They're in a difficult situation.
When you get into life with a serious illness, most people find it hard.
They live shock, panic, fear.
He has to react to a great burden - a loss of health.
With such a sick soul we have to go with someone, not trying to destroy everything on our own.
"I work with them so that they can finally conclude that even with disabilities they can live a full-valued life and that frustrated sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubertva from Neurological Clinics General School Hospital in Prague.
Without the Persian producer Latecoer, the airbuss were not flying.
Aeronautics is a synonymous of accuracy and advanced technologies.
New planes are full of titanium or light and solid composite materials that no one can now produce and process.
Still, it can be applied to super-transparent, computer-controlled machines, auto-keys to create compositions to something as common as the mercanic pecks.
In the bubble, which reminds the toy of the sugar vat, the powder is mixed in the mixture with the pellets of the pellets that just came out of the cooling machine.
"No one has yet come to anything better," laughs Ivan Dubski, the director-general of the airport factory of the Latecoere Czech Republic.
In the area in the Persian Latvians, the former airport is making a complete door for Airbus A320.
As the only ones in the world provide the door for Brazil's Embraer 170.
The doors, which are part of Prague, are also entering the first and highest classes on the top decks of the world's largest transport aircraft Airbus A380.
There are also doors full of compositions for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
The accuracy here is the main motto.
Maybe a moment's key lets the company serialize twice a year.
If there is a lack of control record on the yellow carpets, they should explain to the auditors from Airbus or Boijing in the Prague competition that are regularly running to find out whether the doors are made in accordance with the agreed rules.
Human meanings, but advanced technology has not yet completely built.
On one door to A320 is 1500 knots.
You have to break the ninters manually.
It takes them two days.
And according to the sound of a falling stick, they know if eating is already correctly broken.
Tolerance where they move is minimal.
The nest can rise above the surface of the aircraft from zero to 0.13 millimetres.
It's a bunch of doubles of human hair weight.
There'll be a number of enhanced sizes to be checked.
When the controller passes his finger on a series of notes, he knows if he's some other than a tolerance.
Then we'll take the exact angle.
Flights were eaten before 1989 by the L-39 military airship programme.
Only in 1991 was not one of them.
The company had to find new orders quickly.
At that time, it was introduced with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won the election order on the supplier of the required door for model A321.
The talks with Boeing weren't so happy.
"We were then a small company that did not have enough money for investment and that Boing could guarantee long-term stable supplies," said Dubski.
The door to the American producer would remain closed if it did not attend the 1999 International Conference of the International Aeronautics Industry of the French Group of Latecore in Prague.
I was talking about our cooperation with Airbus.
The next day, she broke up with Francois, says Dubski.
A year later, latecoer bought a Czech company and a strong company came with new orders.
In the year 2000, the installation of the part of the door for A320 was opened.
Three years later, the door came up for A380.
In 2006, the company set up a new hall for the processing of compositions due to delivery for Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoer, we wouldn't be able to get on our own with this big contract.
Maybe we could do parts or small parts.
The partners want a supply guarantee for twenty or thirty years, Dubski explains.
Loni, Czech Latecoere, won over 2.9 billion dollars and won a total of 147 million dollars.
The exclusive position between the supplier of the aircraft is not free.
Latecoer in Prague has invested 1.5 billion dollars since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, 170 special production processes certifications and evidence of qualifications for key employees.
Without them, the firm wouldn't have built any doors in the airport.
Find certificates that manufacturing processes meet customer requirements, and maintain them in repeated controls according to the Dubai million kroner.
Production processes are changing every year.
They're more accurate and tighter.
We need to train employees, equip the equipment and re-certify the whole process, provided by Dubski.
The company is now completing the process of packaging the zinc and nitrite that replaces a harmful cadmium for human health.
The task came from the manufacturer, but then the technology had to be adapted to the devices or chemicals used in Prague.
People from Boing will come, check the concept of the whole line.
Then we'll take the product to them.
They're also checking our lab.
One set of samples test themselves in their laboratories and then compare the results with ours, draw closer to the way the receivers control it.
Reimbursement is a long-term exclusive contract.
With the Persian race today, it stands and the production of embryos is falling.
For A320, it produces half of the total volume of the door.
It is either impossible or very difficult for the Brazilian or European producer to repay the Czech Latecoere.
It doesn't mean, however, that you could say any price at the door.
The share of the contract is the price charge.
This guesses how many doors one will stand after ten, fifteen, the same pieces made.
The price for the sample shall always be at a certain limit value.
We have to get to this price model.
If we don't, we'll work, says Dubski.
Half of the halls, where they complete the military aircraft Airbus A400 M, are still empty.
But it's a symbol of the future.
On the ground here, a new polobotic line is built for use and the mounting door for an innovative model A320 Neo.
It'll speed up and clear up.
"It's a trend that mounts in the plane," Dubski adds.
The transfer has a future line secured.
Airbus reports that airlines have already ordered 3278 pieces of new model A320.
Only a few meters along the lead line for the complete mounting door for the upper deck A380.
It's a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production time and reduce costs.
A full mount could start in two years, says Dubski.
In the meantime, however, the company must carry out the qualifying tests necessary for the installation of certain electrical and electronic devices into the door for the largest Airbus.
The company is also involved in further development of the production of composite materials.
In addition to Boing, she should also participate in the new Airbus A350 programme, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"It is a huge credit for the company when it is able to process compositions in addition to metal materials," Dubski says frankly.
In Czech, however, latecoer is available on production capacity.
There's no other place in the airport where he's sitting.
Before the French mother came in, she had 180 employees.
Now it's 800 years old and it could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are to surrender to the hundreds of new aircraft they order every year, there must be no fear of work.
Although he had orders for several years earlier, the Hungarian parent company Latecoere was at risk of bankruptcy.
The French group didn't have enough money on cash payments.
Finally, Latecoere was able to talk to the main believers.
At the end of August, some loans were exchanged for shares.
The trustees received a EUR 57.4 million share of 37.4 per cent in the company.
The company owes two thirds, then 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial healing came at the beginning of the session.
The company signed a new share of EUR 222.9 million between existing shareholders.
The basic capital of EUR 280 million was so high.
At the same time, the whole group is suffering from the growing production of Airbus and Boing, which divides 85 per cent on the markets.
The average growth of the ban is expected to be four per cent annually by 2017.
The book contains orders of EUR 2.6 billion, corresponding to four-year production.
The French media claim that Latecoere can finally breathe again after years of fighting.
The Czech race in the Persian Latvians is important for the group.
The group's market is 16 per cent.
According to the number of employees, it is the largest foreign side.
Ambassadors supported most of the state's coal payments.
The change in non-increasing payments will result in a government deficit of 427 million more than in 2013.
The city's budget is based on the government's neutral impact, because the fee has to be higher.
In the previous year, the city received a total of 450 million dollars and a national budget of 150 million dollars.
From the difficulties of the coal mine, the city was about 200 million kroner, and the state was 66 million kroner.
The new is also calculated by increasing the rewards from the supply space with a allowed weight of 1,000 kroner per hectare per year.
Acceptance of these offices must continue to be fully accessible to the public.
Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MEPs that the citizens are getting 14 million to 100 million dollars annually.
More tax payments will no longer be prescribed by the law but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
The remuneration shall be re-calculated as a fraction of the amount of the growth and the rate for the individual types of non-growth.
According to the government, changes are the result of changes, except for the possibility of a generous response to the current economic situation.
Ambassador ODS Marek Benda, however, warned that the establishment of a fee under the government regulation should not be in accordance with the Constitution.
However, according to Minister Mádka, the tax is not in this case because the state pays off the state's state-owned state-owned non-growth.
Payments are made only to the citizens whose territories are seriously affected.
In the case of deep difficulties, the coal will receive three quarters of the city’s money and a quarter of the state.
The same will be true in the case of the difficulty of radioactive horn.
The share of the money that will stand on the payments from the difficulty will be literally bound.
For example, 28 per cent will have to be injured after pregnancy or in order to ensure the protection of the pension.
Today's proposal was criticised by opposition Members who claimed, in particular, that the citizens were affected by the hardship and the land.
For example, Michael Kuchera (TOP 09 and Starostov) warned that tax firms would no longer want to sponsor citizens as long as they are, because they will pay higher payments directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget of the Minister of Finance," said David Kádner (Usvit) selected in the Austrian country.
Before the growth of unemployment in Moscow, KSČM Hana Auliká protected the delegation.
Kádner and Aulicka successfully proposed a new refusal, Kuchera wanted to return the government to work.
According to the recitals above, the increase in the prices of coal prices is not acceptable in the recitals, since prices are more than 90 per cent long-term.
The main consumers as electricity or heat should therefore not be able to feel the price.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that the charitable organisations will be compensated for the increase in the wage by their efforts to reduce their operating costs, which would, in particular, mean reducing the number of employees," the government said.
However, it argues that the increase in wages from employment is unnecessary.
According to the report to the new Milan Urban (ČSSD), it is crucial that the Members know the conclusions of the updated energy concept and, in particular, the decision by the Government on the limits of the burden.
If the oil is weighed beyond the limit, then it will have an impact on the benefits for the state and the population, it will increase.
Urban does not agree with Mádek that the decision to break the threshold at the bottom of the Czechoslovakia Army should fall by 2020.
The limits below ČSA should be broken down by reason of social, national economic and long-term stability of Turkish energy.
Time for decision on the United States Federal Reserve rates
The whole world is watching how the United States Federal Reserve wants to meet in two days in the middle and Thursday to make a fundamental decision on whether to increase interest rates first after almost ten years.
A survey of 80 economies dedicated to Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think that they would remain inactive for some time and leave interest rates between 0 to 0.25 per cent.
It's a historic event because it's been a long time since Fed's reduced rates to zero.
First, we are approaching the situation where the central bank could be able to get from the zero-cool and start the process of normalising the rates," says Angel Ubide, a leading staff member of the Peterson Institute for the International Economy.
The US economy was quite well-known, it came to the collapse in the form of adding trillions of dollars to the state account and creation only of low inflation.
However, Fed cannot ignore a less pink global perspective.
Markets were protected to be prepared for increase, but circumstances suggest that they also see a great chance against this step.
This Decision shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Shooter at Delta State University left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his friend in Mississippi on Monday - and later on the same day as his colleague - wrote a message stating that he was the first murder and that before he could take it back, they revealed it to the government's third office.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, announced that Lamb, a professor of agriculture and social science at Delta State University, called the police on Monday morning about ten hours
And he said he shot someone.
The speaker's Lamb asked him to send the police to his house.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and also mentioned that in the house there is "a beautiful dog", which "will not eat anybody" but is dissolved.
The police asked for the name of the caller, but Lamb didn't show up.
Lamb also didn't explain why he shot at the house.
When the police arrived at the scene, they found 41 - year - old Amy Prentiss’s body and manually wrote a letter from Lamba: “I am so sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who loved me."
After his resignation, Lamb set out for 300 miles on a long trip to Delta University, where he killed his teacher of the history of Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
Thank you, William LaForge, said he didn't know about any conflict between Lambe and Schmidt, but that "in Mr. Lamb's head there was obviously something played."
Despite the Sunday announcement that Lamb had evidently believed in the romantic relationship between Amy Prentiss and Schmidt, the government authorities indicated that there was no "proof evidence".
Shawn O'Steinberg, who was with Prentiss' wife over seven years ago, said she was "a great person".
The divorce came 15 years ago, but both remain friends.
The 19th-year-old daughter of O'Steen and Prentiss were "stumbled".
O'Stepen said Prentiss and her daughter were best friends.
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as Sun Herald mentioned, worked with Prentiss from home via the Internet.
Knewles said Prentiss, who had a dog named Blesk, went with Lambe for about three years.
"She always wanted to help the others," she kept listening to Knowles.
The police said Lamb spoke to his friends on Monday and said he's not going to jail.
When the police got him in the distance near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and ran into the forest where he was shot.
According to a biography published on the websites of schools, Lamb received a doctorate in the field of education at Delta University in the spring of 2015.
The Stars Who Lost Their Cosmos
Herec (left), on the picture with his son Redmond (right), has been behind him for several years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia and lost his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett for cancer in 2009.
Hereec also had a drug problem, and was detained for drug use in 2008.
I'm sure all these things choose their taxes.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be a few months from the game due to a double break.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of right foot during the strikes of Manchester United in the League of Masters against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left-handed defense left this wound in tears and ordered it out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks that Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury caused an unprecedented delay in Héctor Morena in 15 minutes when twenty-year-old Shaw went to the PSV space.
Nine minutes were healed at the hospital and a oxygen mask was also needed before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's had a double leg fracture and now he's in the hospital."
It will be transferred tomorrow or maybe tomorrow and then further operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester at the age of 18, it's got a very hard time, but it's playing fantastically, and then it's gonna happen.
When he was in the barns, he also had a oxylic mask.
It's a play.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture requires six months of treatment and will not be able to play in a group phase.
I believe he's still playing this season.
Moreno was lucky he didn't get a red card and a pentalent cap.
The decision-makers Nicola Rizzoli Mexicana didn't bother.
Van Gall indicated that the Italian decision-makers were wrong.
You can decide for yourself whether it was about a pen and a red card.
It was a very sharp break with both legs.
She says, "Thank you for all their messages, the words can't express how I'm destroyed, my way to life begins now and I'll be back even stronger."
Related: Manchester United reported Luke Shaw's injury in a fight against PSV
The English defence will have additional motivation for the movement in the form of a European mystery in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, a PSV trainer, said, "It was a very serious injury."
If any player leaves the kitchen with such injuries, everyone is very sad about it.
It's never the goal of our players to hurt the player.
Moreno endured a break in his leg while fighting for Mexico against Van Gaal of the Netherlands at the 2014 World Championship.
"It's very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt the player, and when you hear about the severity of such a injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
I wasn't able to get through this moment.
I saw only a sword that led to another direction, so it seemed [Moren] hit him, but I didn't see a shortcut on Luke.
In the talk for SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult it can be.
I feel very bad about it. I'm sorry.
Player PSV Andrés Guardado was also transferred to the hospital after Chris Smallinga.
David Cameron must know The Lorax better?
Every parent knows this: When a child loves a book, it doesn't last long before he learns to remember it.
You mustn't be David Cameron at all.
To ask the providers of child schemes to name a favorite child book, the president of the government of Lorax, a grandmother of Dr. Seusse from 1971.
It was hard to choose, Cameron writes in a report published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "Witnessy, creative, creative and strong content, I like to read this to my children because it has always been a picture or message I've never seen before."
Well, in the following paragraph, Cameron clearly described the work of the book according to the 2012 film, which added additional positions and details in order to complete an expert original text.
"In the town of Thneed-Ville surrounded by lightning, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is comedy, a boy named Ted hopes to have the heart of his dreams, Audrey, that he is eager to see a real tree," is an expert book that mentions the object of love unknown to Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
Jacoby was not alone, and the text added by Cameron reads as a total stream of Lorax, which is on the website of the Internet Movie Database, and begins with the words: "In the town of Thneed-Ville surrounded by lightning where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is comedy, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of his daughters, Audrey."
Because he was an open-ended practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would meet with the event of a book where the so-called young man learns that the local nature is causing a rough, casing industrialist Onse-ler, who even through the protests of the titled Loraxe, a cut-out, booked creature, who "speaks of trees."
With the greatest likelihood of relatively little significant PR task, he got an assistant who never read Lorax children 20 times in the bones.
Speaking Downing Street said the text was most likely from Cameroon's station office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text provided the employee Cameron, but without another comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of warning England, but he's still holding.
To compete with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but following the team that England chose for this tour, I think the 3-0 seizures that endured in the series of trials are unlikely.
I wouldn't have excluded the reward of the guests either.
The Alastaira Cooka page can be tried less than three years ago, but here is a good spin player in this burning set and also a collective thought is strong; there is no language from 2012, only a youth positive.
The sword is Moeen Ali developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the level of the experimental series, represents an attack option.
Related: Adam Lyth came out of the English team in a series trial and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to mention Adam Lytha is a hard time for me to analyze because his main trainer is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests were against two good attacks in the mood conditions and simple, but the reality is that the players are on the basis of performance.
For example, by the name of Joe Root, there were no questionnaires, which led to the announcement, because — and this I have already introduced — players are their best selective.
A few more centuries ago, and Lyth could prolong his series, but he had control over his own judgment.
Let's hope that if he can get more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
The chief trainer of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his position, even though his performances were not completely percentage, and that doesn't surprise me; he was always a team player.
The question of how long he'll be getting a pilot to show himself is a hard cut.
Lyth got seven hats — just like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance home and out.
The only thing you could think about is that England gave Jonathan Trottt the first chance in Caribbean — although Lyth was in the best form — but this wonderful opportunity is already past.
There's Alex Halles coming and it's a bullet that I appreciate very well.
It's the x-factor player of the cricket that we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season, when he got 236 on the throne of Trent Bridge, which did so little.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors had received, but of course all of this will depend on the overall composition of the United Arab Emirates.
The idea when Moen began to follow the Cooka side, which would get another extra spinner while holding four quicks, was overrun and I have no reward against her.
I don't understand why strokemaker can't fire and this left-handed man has already shown that he's a great cricket player.
Moen may not be able to do his job for his country, Worcestershire, but he was a number 3 for them and a big difference is not.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 tests before his appearance in 2001.
He was suddenly hit by three centuries ago, and he didn't even notice.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a base spinner and when I had the opportunity to follow him, he treated me like a very discreet young man.
People can look at his grave statistics — on average 31 with a ball and 35 with a sword — and I see it as a charm, but not a lot of spinners who would raise their hands and pickers decided for young people.
He'll learn a lot about this tour.
Despite the team, England seems to have made a number of changes and smart additions to their training staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardenea, a policing from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for experimental sports can be a mystery tah.
He is one of the most beautiful players who will bring rich experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in part of the tour white-ball and brings into the team as energy, so cruel ice.
I've always felt that he was born directly into the world of international cricket, whether he's already a player or a coach, and just like Mahela has an intelligence that can be used.
New voices in the chat room, even though they are voices saying consistent things that have been said in the past, can sometimes be relieved and freshen the atmosphere.
Player Collly Durham Ben Stokes got one-day freedom, just like Root got a similar stop against Australia, and I have no problem with this decision.
Even though many disagree, coaches and electors do not create harmony.
And you have to remember as players that their work depends on the results.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could be won if the economy is beginning to stagnate by 2017.
An unexpected strategy for David Cameron's renegotiation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU will be addressed to other problems with every single day and without choosing the General Jeremiah "Is It Yes or Not?" Corbyn to the head of the Division, or the TUC will be taken to the next Tuesday to the Council of the whole situation across Europe.
The foreigners also have their Corbin and Nigel Farage.
A close friend of European diplomats recently explained how Europe is hiding in the various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States already have enough British self-centered agencies, partial concessions and negative changes to the treaty that most of them did not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided not to do so even if they were under attacking social protection.
We can even call it Dave and George's own agenda.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolis, take a photo before a famous local monument, or without local treasures, and then return home with the words that they win a link to reform.
It's all about me.
My friend of the Europeans, who wants to see the independent British in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - indicates that some short-term ministers and officials in some major cities have reached the point where they are not concerned about our departure.
Angela Merkel, a well-known German Chancellor, was a connector, but she was 10 years old and wanted to leave her post before she became a bad person, as it was in the long growing Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Francouz François Hollande is headed for renewal or replacement in 2017.
His power also appears.
Poland can have a nationalist government on the right hand side, Spain on the left.
It's hard to see how your legs are using Selfie Brits, who could invest their energy better in preventing Scotland from leaving the UK - which is something they don't want because they have similar separatistic tendencies.
So some of these ministers can plan to make SNP-style notes in the campaign before the 2017 referendum in Great Britain to speed up the Brexit process, a firm friend.
"Repeating has solved the problem" and "British has nothing to do with reconciliation."
Europe's own concept of how the Fleet Street can be and how skeptical about the EU are the prints of the oligarch baron, because they were not during the referendum inspired by Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 to 2:1.
They can recall the name Boris Johnson, the successful Euro-portunist who made his name so that the Brussels report "EU straight bananas" began in the early 1990s.
Despite his innocence, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the combination of free taxes gifts, strangers touching phones and dogs from the overseas departments, who owned most of the big news.
In fact, Tony Blair thought of them the same, but he realized that if you ran out of fuel in the bottle, you'd have to protect her from the bananas so that she wouldn't get you to dinner and then to tea too.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he reviewed Cameron's referendum from the time Blair abandoned the principle of the broken EU constitution, which was overthrown by the French and Dutch voters in 2005 and received a notice of resignation.
The press never let him go.
But my dear Jeremy Corbin, who paid me back in Westminster on Monday - I told him that I must no longer spend time on me - it seems to be in danger of repeated adoption of the boycott strategy Murdoch Neil Kinnock, which was still missing.
It may take some time, but it needs to develop a coherent media engagement strategy, not with me, but with Andrew Marre, who left his seat at the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin's official position against Europe, I'll tell you, it's nice, they're developing.
He claims he would like to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside the survivors of the Ukip and the wild shores of Tory's little Englishism can definitely join.
That's what Hillary said: "Bem, but not Benniite" Benn on the radio and television this week, when his internal scan couldn't stand to let Corbin's name be called abrasive McDonnell as a stage office was a bad decision.
It reminded me of that in the 1970 ’ s when his old father was fighting on television about his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
The Hillary game was much more attractive.
But to fight to remain "in all circumstances" - Benina sentence - according to everything, it wasn't what McDonnell said or what the JC told colleagues and Members at their private meeting in the afternoon,
Whatever the background, the sensitive image Corbyn wants to tell - remember, touched me - the discipline of the news remains important in the age of full-time television transmission, especially in faith, the paranoia and the fates of which are social media
It is free to provide Cameron with free access to Europe, which would allow him to consider supporting the Share Party in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell pointed out.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnel and Corbin's basic statement on EU membership - in accordance with their bonite economic, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of the esoteric debate between left-wing dissidents, for which the Narcissism of the small differences is the central foundation of the dogmatism.
As with his statement about Nato - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end - foreign diplomats will have to try to understand the meaning of all this for their own husbands.
Why should Paris or Berlin lose political capital - they also have suspects - because of the British concession when it seems to be too late?
The United States is already quite driven from the poor military operation in Iraq, Libya and Syria, and even in reducing the costs of the conservative government, as I was reminded at the beginning of the afternoon something called the British Security Forum.
Experts critically review electronics published by Public Health England
The government-funded agency's statement that electronic cigarettes are 95 % safer than smoking has resulted in a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are associated with the tobacco industry, by researchers.
The experts in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet's criticism of the evidence used in their report on electronic cigarettes by the Public Health England (PHE).
The PHE agency published a "internal" report last month and described it as a "complex review of evidence."
However, a number of researchers have lost the ability of data and have warned of the relationship between some experts and the tobacco industry.
In his professional journal Lancet attacked last month on the "extraordinary charter basis", on which the PHE agency had put its main conclusions.
Two other experts who write for BMJ have questioned the claim that was "founded on a rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, said: "The basic principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They argue that the public could expect the approval of the PHE agency, which sounds "the best idea today is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from a single meeting of 12 people authorised to analyse the multi-criteria Decision (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the damages associated with various products containing nicotine; the results of the treatment were stored in the research report.
McKee and Capewell state that one sponsor of this meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health, which the Director-General had already received financial resources from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
He also agreed to trust public health with the Bat in the sustainability report, he says.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting acknowledged funding from electronic cigarettes producers, but not the funding that was received in advance by Philip Morris International.
The reason for selecting panel members is not available, but they contain a number of famous electronic cigarettes campaigns, some of which also announce industrial funding in the news.
Some other attending meetings are unaware of their expertise in combating smoking.
The PHE meeting also participated in the follow-up.
The report in this group "explainly consented," missing "solid evidence of most of the product injury on the majority of the criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these references or restrictions are recorded in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the PHE claim that "there's still no evidence that e-cigarettes would be able as a way to burn for children or non-smokers," was earlier.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at the PHE, stated that the claim in BMJ was already responsible.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are essentially less harmful than smoking."
One of the two lifetime cooks will die because of his addiction.
All the evidence indicates that the health risks represented by electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what the evidence shows and what they do not show, especially when there was so much public concern over the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people die every year because of the lack of smoking and smoking are $2 billion a year.
By making clear the current evidence - even though e-cigarettes are not without risk, they are not just the damage caused by smoking - we are filling our national competences.
BBC should end with EastEnders, former director Channel 4
Former Director Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop sending programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rival would "give right hand" for the football show like Albert Square.
Johnson said that the licence fee should be used only for programs that are not created by another British television.
He criticized BBC for setting up public service programmes that would probably only follow up on people's heads, in the complex times of sending off his rivals "greater rating show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After general director Tony Hall said that the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had failed to connect with the BBC for six years, which he worked on Channel 4.
"I struggle with the idea that the BBC will launch and send programmes that would certainly be sent by rivals without state contributions," Johnson said in the Committee on Communications in the Horn as part of the discussion on the future of the BBC.
If you keep the licensing fees that I'm not sure whether they are in the medium or long term good thinking, you should reduce the creation of at least as regards programs that are not produced or run by others.
They send out The Voice in the main transmission time because they want to get as wide as possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would send him is a funny joke, and of course not.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why the Regressive Tax should support programmes that can be financed in a safe manner.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders is another, and is naturally produced on the home floor.
The other channels would give them the right hand.
I can't understand how these public broadcasting services are.
I don't think it's going to even make the BBC worse.
Johnson, a serial businessman who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told BBC that he felt guilty that he had earned ratings "because of the ambitious people who worked here, and because he believed it was the best way to ensure long-term support."
His comment on the most popular BBC show repeats the former Executive Director Sky, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003, to suggest that BBC sells shows as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even higher public programs of BBC services "are going to BBC4, where they are not often able to measure the pledge, but they are filling their power and they can argue when they come to their covert mission to justify £4bn income from license fees, "But of course we do all these cover programmes that no one is looking at."
They send them out when no one sees them.
With regard to the licence fee, Johnson said to the Commission: "I call on you to find a more regressive system with regard to who will get the best value.
Understandably, we all think that 150 British freedoms are huge annually, but for people with 150 freedoms a lot, I would be surprised if they paid so much because they don't look so much at BBC.
Former Director Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who appeared before the Commission on Tuesday, said the BBC should review its Rethyvian mission in the sense of "information, education and fun."
He confirmed that the small volume of BBC production had already been classified as a teacher - it was 1% television production and 0.1% in radio - and should be taken as an example of public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to "inform, explain and engage."
On the issue of Elstein's partnership, the BBC should do more in areas such as Proms, which were only broadcast on television, and contact commercial reporters so that we can all see them online.
Sonogenetics or control of brain cells using sound waves
This video shows how the sound impulses influence the direction the leaves move.
Scientists have raised red with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
The short charts change direction at a time when they are hit by sound impulses that are impossible for human ears.
The pulses function so that the cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to react to these ultrasound waves.
Related: Scientists are able to read and write brain activity by means of light
Scientists have noted that these reds are a great indication of new methods of somnolence, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activates outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla in California, pointed out that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation - invasive procedure in which electrodes that stimulate brains the brain. This method is used for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease.
In general, ultrasounds do not react, but Chalasani found that the reaction is delivered when it is placed in the fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he discovered, bubbles strengthen ultrasound waves that then pass through the body of the reds.
Solid ultrasound waves are used in the iontic TRP-4 channels, which are located in the membranes of some red cells.
With sound waves these channels open and activate cells connected to them are reported in the journal Nature Communications.
In order to control the list using ultrasound valves, Chalasani genetically modified reds so that some of their motor neurons contain ion channels TRP-4.
When he used such modified red ultrasound, the sound waves were strengthened by microbubulins and transferred to the reds where the modified motor neurons were activated.
The new method is a multi-faceted optogenetic, a protopic instrument that allows scientists to stop and emit neurons by means of light.
Chalasani, however, had to hear that sonar genetics might have a lot of benefits from this technique.
Unlike the light which must be sent by an optical train to the required position in the brain, ultrasound waves can pass the voltage without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that when we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment for neurological diseases," Chalasani said.
He added that his method would also be found in the treatment of swab cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture device - right on your ass!
The insulated British arms trade.
See the video on the anti-arms market from Amnesty International.
The deadly drones!
The shoes on the legs that the hunters have.
Three shots!
And electric spindles that cause unsatisfiable pain, but they don't leave any feet behind!
The joyous voice and the caricature of the metaphor leave no one doubt that this advertising on the world's largest weapons is a sharp parallel created for Amnesty International because of the increasing desire of the British government to sell weapons to repressive regimes through the defence and security facilities of the International Veselice in ExCeL Centre in the London district of Docklands.

But the campaign is also known as the introduction of posters on bus stops and meters that require a different view.
"The important announcement, Traveling to DLR from 15 to 18 September?" read one, using a letter with the sign of the London Metro with the DLR lines becomes a picture of the tank.
This year in September, the generation of arms dealers will meet at DLR ... Customers are asked to help stop arms trade.
On 300 posters are created by artists who perform their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismalland.
A collective name Special Patrol Group has helped distribute throughout London and with "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is £6 per piece of Allen key, which literally "have access to the top of the third commercial bus stop area on the planet."
Transport for London is not entertainment with this airposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodys made by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindona, curator of the Cruel Designs and a professional assistant at the University of Essex, artists are becoming increasingly suspicious and attempting to show political activity of monsters outside the gallery.
Many artists go to work with activists in protest camps and realize that they have to get out in the real world in order to have their art impact on society.
Other complaints against trade with health weapons travelling in the metro.
The Amnesty video was followed on Facebook by more than 100,000 people in 24 hours and was created by a VCCP agency that worked without a warrant for the honorary and graphic designer and commenter also worked free.
The creative director of the VCCP Matt Lever would be surprised by the silent advertising of arms trade - he saw an empty space in the exCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's show them a campaign that is trying to avoid."
They played with the creation of more realistic risk-making company ads, but "by joining oil colors and animations, I've aimed at attracting more people."
"They took a fantastic cut of work and helped us wake up concerns about selling illegal torture tools on the market," says Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we need now is that the government of the United Kingdom takes action and ensures that it does not deal illegally with the torture system on our dust.
Almost the most creative art covering arms trade comes from outside ExCeLu, where manufacturers sell fantastic euphemistic products.
In the press report Saab withdrew an order from the US Army to "on the ground of ATCS RS".
This includes "a single-shaped head that gives amazing effects beyond burning within the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Life at School
11 years ago, I moved to a student course as an untidy 19-year-old boy, still believing in bars and moral relativism, but so far I have developed the drunk smiles of those whom I led -- and read, long-lasting problems on the other.
All I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The movement on the wheels can move from mild to mild to progressive nerves to completely dissipated.
It's a nice bluff: tell people where you're from, if you take the year off, what you think of Corbin and why "you don't really love or hate Marmite right now, because people, it's just a break from the HAHAHA, I'll be in my room."
Deep down.
And help others to breathe too - ask and show interest.
It'll lead to a conversation and help you find people you like, and those you don't care about, even if your hair's in a fire and they're going to give you hot devices.
Let's get people out of here.
People's rooms are often changed to drinking receptions, places of movies and public places, but they are also rooms where people dress and manage their jobs.
Related: Don't even think about starting to go high and being close to the relationship
Introverts on high coming soon.
Your room should be clean, although many change into a multi-pocket history culture that is friendly, social and contributing to lifelong friendship.
It could be a trap for someone who needs to offer.
No culture allows you to say, "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to go back to the energy I needed to talk to you."
Try to know when a colleague is tired of socialization - and maybe write it in place of lockdown.
If it's about cheating, you'll be lying.
One boy in my tracks used to say that if the doors aren't locked, he's invited inside.
He saw a few things.
Make friends through cooking.
Because you started going to college at the top of a rock mine, closing a door, and making a presentation with a plated cake seem less strange than "Hi, in the neighborhood, something I've wrapped up for you, now I'm laughing while I'm going to ask myself personal questions."
The offer of pets is a good way to find friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you, and maybe everything ends up so that your face will fit into a funny surprise.
Of course, it's the subject of being a decent baker.
Badly condensed bone marrow, sugar and dust are likely to disrupt the rest of the sleep when you try to lock them up on the door.
The theft of food is on the students' street with a common crime.
The theft of the whole kitchen is of course a crime, but is the cup of milk to your tea stealing?
Check with the milk owner twice.
There's a chance that they'll offer you milk even when they're going to get in.
If someone steals something, it's disgusting and you have my sympathy - but try to arrange it a little more mature than my roommate who changed his milk for lunch so that the thief would be upset.
He's in jail now.
You shouldn't make sounds that corrupt people from sleep or study.
It's not only about being a decadent human beings, but you're also the historical people in the slums.
The girl from my walk asked her neighbors if they could have a little rest of the door and bass because they were 3 in the night and she had a letter in the morning.
Their response was to strengthen the song.
When they finally ran out at 5: 00 a.m., she let her sleep for two hours and then let her voice down her own music, shut the door, and go to her three-hour letter.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future to walk on the same bike as you?
On the other hand, wouldn't it be very embarrassing if you'd set up a roommate for your future tea, slept together, broke up and had to see each other every day and maybe take control of your fellow friends too?
Of course, you don't recommend - but if your sex partner is not your future partner, try to talk to your weaknesses a little bit.
At the moment you realize that someone left keys in his locked room, there is only a narrow boundary between play and play.
A good shot is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about their safety by hiding something - never destroy any room of toothpaste and shampoo.
Close the doors and give them the keys to the water that you throw into the oven, but never throw away their things on a scale more than twice.
Eva was happy for both, despite the uncertain prospects for the future.
Eve had spent a rough time in pregnancy with a seven-year-old widow.
His father broke up with her, and he was alone in preparation and training.
With the situation going on, I've done quite quickly - I've been very happy with the baby and I've been looking for the positive.
I'm not sure, and since I'm with the kid myself, I've tried not to touch him.
And I'm sure I had hope that we won't stay on our own for a long time, mentioned today by Eva on her first pregnancy.
She was already on the Internet with an old Vaska chat, who started talking to her about favorite movies.
Your Eve and Vicki even brought home from the family, but he didn't take too much in the role of his own father.
"For a while he got out of the program," Eva wrote in the documentary series Four in that 3.
The motivation of the third series of Czech TV series is just looking for luck on second try.
Péchi on Vítka and the family’s financial security enabled her to work on part-time care and great help from her mother and aunt.
Even aspects of responsibility for a foreign child at the end of your dedication to Eve did not show up.
They definitely gave themselves together around Vicki's other births and now you understand him as your father and praise him as well.
Even though your two adult daughters are already married, your father is in his 80 ’ s, and the children are more responsible.
In addition to the Viteka, he was accompanied by another 2-year-old Leontynk and finally two-year-olds.
"Our family grew so naturally, perhaps because my mother never talked too much to me about relationships," says Eva.
A little place?
At least we're close.
Both Emma and Ella were born into a cicada line after Evé was diagnosed with a pregnancy at the end of pregnancy.
This is a defect in the production and activity of cell acids, which then in excess are released into the blood of heavy and, in particular, manifested by consent.
The disease is dangerous for an unborn child, which is threatened by premature birth and death, in the mother’s mother’s mother after birth, most of them automatically give birth.
Emma and Ella were born healthy to Eve and yours, even though they were first in the 36th week.
Emičk was placed in an incubator on the intermediate department, where Vaško's non-terresist who was able to take over and move.
Elinka was bigger and right after she was transferred from JIP to the room I had, she describes the year after Eva's birth.
In the family she spent twenty days until the doctors agreed to release the mine, which, inter alia, managed to reach the border of two kilos.
Waiting for children to be raised in Eve's family was a joy, but it wasn't.
"I was crazy about my wife and children," recalls a tough moment in the 16th grade of a four-year-old mother.
She also considered signing a reversion, including one of the other, because of the unsympathetic approach of one of the doctors.
But eventually, the doctors left Eva and two of them in the care of the home.
Four pregnancy and childbirth events sent ČT1 on Tuesday night at 21:45 p.m.
The entire family can be brought together.
They live together in a small village near Prague, where Eva had to cope with the electric double and tight conditions.
The house has not grown, but your house has made Eve happy by mounting a gas heater so that the preparation of food for six people is more comfortable.
When it's dark, we're gonna have a fight on the taxi.
Eva is convinced that children are particularly concerned with family order and a pleasant atmosphere, not with size or size.
In the past, we've been doing a lot better than we've been waiting for.
The order goes up to the top in the small space, and sometimes we cross the little girl, but at least we're all close, laughs at Eva, who can find a positive page in every situation.
Your work of lighting in the film is not a guarantee of regular income.
That's why they sometimes go to the Persian streets as a taxi driver.
In his 60s, according to his words, the family finances and the children physically control how long it will be, but how long?
"I realize that in view of our age difference, I will once be the one who will live this family," admits Eva at the level when asking for the future.
I would like her to come back to work, but she still loves her own business.
I'm not with four children for employees.
And when it's the worst, we can talk to your husband about the taxi, he's making a sympathetic blonde.
Apple post yes-jo effect.
They can show up for everything.
The most efficient processor, photoparate with greater resolution, stronger hair or display of the recognizable power of touch, are in short order recently represented by the iPhones' ninth generation.
The last two also have a negative impact on the size and volume of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus.
The available trend of the Applu was that each new iPhone generation is easier than it was before.
The exception was only the third and fourth generation, whose weight was gradually increased by previous iPhones.
The two-gram difference in the disparity of the news presented was therefore quite noticeable.
However, it doesn't pay for new iPhones.
In contrast to London iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, the volume grew in a smaller model of 14 grams, then a larger of 20 grams.
On the one hand, you can't be surprised, the lower affrey in Apple's pockets has been greatly affected.
The sixth newspaper is so far from the 7000 lynic slytin, which has also been passed on to the mass.
But they have a lot more impact on her.
Apple also used 3D Touch technology in the news, thanks to the display's different power of touch.
To that end, it was necessary to provide another type of capacity sensors.
The volume of new iPhone displays has increased by more than double over the previous generation.
In a smaller iPhone of the original 12 grams of 29 grams, in case of greater than 19 grams of 40 grams.
The iPhone 6s is the most difficult component to use.
The volume of only 143 grams is then achieved in this news thanks to the impact of the evaporation curve, which touched most of the remaining components.
The larger model is then the hardest battery used, but its weight has never changed.
And in this case, the largest growth is just in the display.
The mass 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus so reaches 192 grams.
As soon as the new technology will be practical, it will show up until it is used.
The first users will be able to test it already on Friday, 25 September, when the sale of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus is started in selected countries.
Are the boots of the champion's breakfast for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglici, archaeologists have found an interesting possibility.
They have revealed the stages of modern man's isolation from various times, including small furniture, the remains of the tools and so on and so on.
In the 23A species, which is dated 30 thousand years ago by instruments, scientists have discovered something very interesting about the rest of the breakfast buffet.
On the other hand, there have been traces of sheep's ears that have apparently passed through the production process of so popular today.
She'll be the first to go home to her today, then dry up, get rid of her shoulder, so she's crying, then she's asleep, and they're going to break up.
In the cave of Paglicc, a grain found that was burned or burned according to all the heat, and then apparently broken up between two millennia stones - at least this indicates the rates of use on two stones in the cave.
Thus, scientists have failed in their publication for PNAS magazine to point out that in the autumn it would take the complete process of production of cotton, but the similarity is really very subtle.
We also have no evidence of how people could eat the cartridges, but the idea that it was with some fluid and maybe even the heat, of course, is entirely logical.
It is also a very interesting evidence of the intensive use of crops long before agricultural production.
If the interpretation of the vowel is correct, the oldest of the vowel millennia has been before the agricultural society for twenty thousand years.
New report of the station in the City of Brna.
So once again, I listened to the announcement of a stop in the bus: Hnusáčkova, Přízrak, Frazova, Sprateká.
Of course, trolejbus was somewhat more quieter, so the voice of men was somewhat less understandable than before when the suspensions voted for the woman's voice.
Women's voice is higher, so in the deeper wave of transport, it's better different than in the deeper male voice.
DPMB argues that these voters have chosen themselves to travel - I don't know who, I don't know, did not ask me, but they certainly chose from the studio records set up in a simple silence, which, of course, seemed quite different than in the framework of the bus engine.
I live in Brno for a few decades, so I know the correct names of all these suspensions, so I don't need this report, but strangers who don't know who are in Brno and for whom this report is first appointed may be confused and may at the end where they are mistakenly mistaken, then claim that the suspension to which they were to issue was not even reported.
Perhaps this choice of voters - but better to repeat voters - should be done again, and this time undercolored by the ordinary transporter and the engine wheel, in which the player's knock on the bus is almost lost.
So we don't have to keep listening to the names of the Water Herspica, Shmírva, or then Ponorna in the hideout in which I stayed in Komárva.
I guess my old ears didn't sound so much in one day when the voter changed.
That day, I understood that report quite well.
Good morning, comrade-in-law.
From the tapes of the truck.
Today, however, the minority knows what the most important and smartest of the governments have been so complex checks.
I've allowed myself to mention it.
The bus was late.
I was killed at the diner's office at the time the radio said it was just seven hours.
"You're lucky you didn't get upset with your partner, came in a minute before you, and it seems like you don't have the right mood," said the speaker, while I was writing in the book of futures.
Thank you, I'll give you a kiss.
You're writing me that I'm going to take a little review of the mechanism.
That's not gonna happen. There's checks today.
They're all fucked up as hell.
What's this about?
"But you'll see," said the speaker.
Next time you'll be, too.
I ran away on a walk.
Then the door of the chief was opened and the chief appeared.
He's in the middle of a stone frame, in the perfect fall of the same circle.
"Good morning, Mr. Chief," I greeted him quietly and quickly shut down two buttons of yours at the same time.
"Good morning," she answered, and I ran to the second floor, without realizing the student, the violent tone that the old man had answered.
"You're playing," said engineer Eva, the elderly lady I loved very much.
She was even the boss before her friends met her.
They're checks, and you're gonna get a tattoo.
How many times have I asked myself what these complex checks are, but no one wants to talk too much about them.
First they've been once in three years, everyone has to go to him, and it's pretty uncomfortable.
At least for some.
But I'll see you first.
I got out of the bottled fascicle with periodic reports and that phone.
"Here Holcman, come to me now," the chief's voice was called.
What's going on?
Now we've met and nothing... I've forgotten, but no one has answered me, everyone just with his thoughts.
"Good day, sir, I came to your order," I complained, and I barely entered the Chief's office.
The chief sat behind the dog's table and looked at some leaves.
"Sudruhu mechanizer," he walked for a while without raising his head and still looking intently at it, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He walked out on the desk, sat down in the back of the chair, and, frankly, looked at me with a normal, unpleasant, bad look.
I found out.
What's going on?
Last night, the mayor praised me for working very well and for being at peace with me.
That the chief did a lot of good when he pulled me out of the street.
And now this?
I'll know that you're a walking distance technique, and that's what you have to do.
The greeting you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I swore that I used such a greeting from childhood, that I was so raised, and that I saw nothing wrong with him.
It was like a red hat on the handle.
"You're on a socialist train and the only acceptable greeting is a privilege of work," said the deputy chief.
And also, you're still complaining about the terms of the superiors.
You're gonna say "lord" once and you're gonna say "steward."
Just because I'm not your boss, I'm not your associate.
The tenants are the allies of the tenants, the top traitors are the fellows of the top transiters!
Remember that.
I'm sorry, sir... I'm in favour of the chief, but... but I greet you with the usual public greeting.
There's nothing wrong with it... and it's a privilege of work or a friend... you know... I'm not on the side...
"It's not your priority that you're not on the side," said the principal, who calmed down a bit.
But it's still going to be about it.
Anyway, remember, you're not supposed to be in bed sitting up here.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something was not his priority, it didn't look good about it.
For a while, he tried to seduce me by means of a study, a look at the chicken, and I looked for the words I would answer.
I was also impressed by his elevated appearance.
He was only a few years older and played for the god, actually a comrade.
He's jealous, focused, authoritarian, arrogant, as he's been doing right now.
He's got all of them running.
Wake up, he's the boss.
In fact, not everyone, the president of his party organization, like all the parties, but not the non-partners, said.
But the chief said many, especially those who could apply his sovereignty.
He just made me look like a complete cow.
I've been thinking about shit, and I've had enough of a fight to keep him from shooting at him.
I just wouldn't even go back to the dumpster, so I'd keep doing this to the dear officer.
What would I do with two kids?
And that's a broken barge!
I was in trouble, but I was in control.
I'm not making him happy here.
"That's all you can go now," said the chief's audience and began to look around again in a bright mirror that he had in his hand before.
They called me in half a dozen.
Everyone in the office was already there and asked questions about what and how, they answered, yes, that would be good.
Only Jožin suddenly found out how his habit was that all of us can't be distracted because the work would have to be done by the headmaster himself with his faithful, and that it would not be dangerous.
The word "soldier" also highlighted what my old friend was saying to me this morning.
In general, there was a good outcome.
The Chief of Staff, after his writing, and at the long advice table, other colleagues who were to decide whether or not to be my official.
Cádávák, president of the ROH, secretary of staff, rapporteur for special purposes, something in a way that runs counter to the war, and the deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, the president of the partnership organization.
I knew him from the street.
A common trajectory, he killed a pig or a pigeon.
But it was also an ex-boyfriend.
It turns out there wasn't any shit with him that night, a beautiful animal.
Bad language claimed that he went to school in the seventh grade, had nothing to learn, had nothing to do with it.
And when the crime was dropped, he ended up shooting in a dumpster.
But the band, yes, the band was defeated!
The chief took me to sit down.
There was a little baby in me in the church, an uncomplicated bottle.
The mayor read the case from the municipal council from the place of residence.
I'm from a working family, I'm married, two kids and so on and so on.
It's been a good time, I thought, and I've had a little better breath.
Then the trial from the street organization of the party.
He copied the case from the civil committee, and perhaps both wrote the same person.
It just happened!
The parents of the long-term members refused to provide themselves before the audit committee and subsequently emerged from the party for health reasons.
The chief looked at me intently.
The cadre looked at it and stopped reading.
The Chief has indicated he's going on.
It was just worse.
I was a member of the SSM City Committee, and I was received as a candidate for the party.
Regardless of the parents who came out of the country, the party gave me confidence.
I just got married and had a wedding in the church, except for the National Committee.
I lost trust in the party in the worst way.
That's why I was expelled from a number of her candidates.
But that's not enough!
I let both children get baptized, and even my mother, when she died, I performed church funerals even though she was a former member of the party.
That's what I'm giving the most negative position to the leading role of the party.
When the tape was read, only pressing the main complaint to the table broke the drunk silence.
Everyone looked at me, and I wanted to be far away somewhere.
At the same time, I kept repeating in my mind, "Communist, Communist, Communist." What did I get?
Why don't I stay in the bathroom?
I could fix my moves without any separate checks.
But now?
The director's career took place before she started.
Go back to count?
It's probably not going to work. I'm sure the chief's coming out in an hour.
"The judge, how did you check out the company here?" interrupted the chief of the secret question on the cadre.
Well, according to a survey from the previous employment.
Do you have him here?
The camera wasn't obviously twice.
On the cover of the bridge, he was nervously sneezing as if he were checking himself.
He's severely charged and handed the chief some paper.
"No," said the chief with the sign of jealousy, who was often too proud of the storm.
For the first time, he praised himself, studied the industry, worked as a carpenter, and met the standard by a percentage of twenty percent.
It's just essential.
From where did you take the case, mate?" he turned to the frame again, who felt how it began to turn against him, and that he could not be a framer very soon.
This is where my girlfriend gave me a ride.
Is that enough for you?
"Well, when he came up to us, he went up to the cross to read," the black hat.
And there's no need for a search, that was more like it, so I gave it to him in the box.
"So when you entered the technical function, this paper was enough for you," the chief said.
The camera was nervous and had no response.
"It's all right, we'll do it later," concluded the chief's concern and the cadre has obviously fallen.
He's been doing it for a while.
"So what about you, buddy?" the chief turned to me again.
I'll get it right away, so it's over!
I got stuck in my eyes, I got burned with anger.
He's been following up on education and charges, and I knew that I was the most powerful creature in the world who doesn't deserve the least of it.
By supporting the incomplete investigation, I put it in the error of the curator's firm, which I did not understand, why the case was incomplete when I got it from the cadre in the factory.
I have also been an antisocialist life that supports the ranks of religious darkness even in the construction of real socialism.
That it was a lot of what I've been saving, or maybe I'm still sleeping, and I prayed for it to end.
It's been all the same to me.
I was just wondering if I could get out of the mechanic's place.
I had one thing to do. I'm gonna take that pumpkin too.
It's work for honest and obedient people, not for the enemies of the people I was in the eyes of the mayor.
"That would be enough, Mr. President," the chairman called on the chairman of the party and firmly rejected the President's levitation.
The judge here made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, he's made a fool of himself!
He's already got his punishment!
Don't forget that, Your Honor.
What could be worse for a young man than to close the door to his side in time!
To be opened again, he will have to prove that he has changed that it is again our trust.
An uneducated baker spoke like a book.
Where did it come from?
Is he so short or he's sneezing sentences from party training and meeting?
That's why this young fellow must also get the chance from us!
The chance to prove that he's changed.
And who's gonna give it to him if it's not you?
It is your duty to support this young man, the truth, somewhere in the wrong company, in his efforts to correct him!
It's your foreign duty that no one can rescue you!
In fact, it's a foreign duty for all of us.
The judge here must see that his side has not been forgotten.
It's like a kind mother not only punishs, but also loves her.
When the president finished, no one heard.
No one ever expected such a situation.
At least I do.
"I just agree with you, Mr. President," the President kindly urged the President in an attempt to resume the initiative.
If you'd let me talk, you'd hear that I'd just go to such a conclusion.
They all moved their heads in agreement, but they had to see that they did not even believe the word.
"So I was certified for the role of a self-referencing rapporteur on basic resources," I got back to the office and broke up.
Besides Evy's engineers, everyone was eating.
That little girl listened to my independent reading of pure experiences, and I calmed down.
When I finished, she asked if I could have a coffee.
Before she waited for an answer, she put water on the fire and poured out her jars.
In the meantime, she talked about frame practice.
As one judge, often full of praise, they hand a man into the hand, and the other, in which there is a spy, sends a new employee.
I just didn't end up where I had it, but on the street in the dumpster, and so friends from the factory didn't know where they were supposed to send it.
What about our cadre?
He's always old enough to eat or drink, so it finally happened how it happened.
"It's from an old shot," she remarked violently.
He's definitely not going to miss today.
Just take care of him, he's smart enough.
What about the division president?
Basically far worse, no human beings.
Zero of the pumpkin has a great power.
The water on the coffee began to run and the office was filled with freshly baked coffee.
I went into the kitchen of a sugar cane, and the milk felt a hot liqueur.
I'm probably from the worst outside.
I'm not leaving now, and the other checks are up to three years.
Anyway, I don't even remember that today.
Entry into the anthology of LITERAT ON TREATY II. in the loading of EPIKA
The beast's symbol is still alive.
The windmill over Chlumem is heading again after years.
It's seen far because it's located 15 meters high.
The people around him call him "the storm on Chlum."
For the population of 150, it became even one of the elements of the current sign, which the village had received the opportunity of the 2010 family group.
"We then asked for a sign, and of course we wanted to have a sign, he knew it around everyone," observed the old man Jiří Mašek.
Chlum's windshield is a local technical memory.
It's a little bit of the current: it's a reminder of the same time when people here fought for quality drinking water.
That in Chlum in the past was a coincidence.
By 1910, the clumsies of representatives were decided for solutions, which were then expressed up to half of the 1980s.
In the village in the district of Chichov, they left a seven - foot - deep study.
Three years later, the studio was completed with a windmill, which drew water to the reservoir in the highest point of town near the lower church.
"The building carried out by Antonín Kunc from Hranic to Moravia at a cost of 2,400 kroner," says the memorial note on the ground floor of the construction of the steel.
Several repairs and damage to the windmill were completed in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter on water began to be written: the day in Chlum began to serve a new water source.
The windshield has remained only a non-functional symbol and more rare.
The Dominant was released at the annual family meeting.
By 2008, Chlumštė decided that the wind wheel would be re-adjusted and re-introduced.
They let the original car replay - reduced in half a meter.
The wheel was mounted on a chair, but still the same year it had to be cut down.
However, the replication manufacturer did not choose the appropriate material and the wheel was not to be able to withstand wind blows.
Then a chlumsy dominoist spent several years resting under the roof.
However, since June of the year, the bike is again on high ground.
On the occasion of the family’s flock, the farmer allowed the car to be repaired and placed on the top of the railway track again.
But the bike only pumps useful water from the ponds into a transparent dark frame.
And over the summer, we completely abandoned him because there was little water in the studio.
At least it's empty.
"At the bottom of the floor, the tower of the winding car from the back of the basket will rest again," explained the old man, Masek.
Chlum is not the only village in Česk, where the wind cycle has reached the current sign, however, is the only one of these species throughout the Exocation.
A similar element in the mark is in the respect of local technical monuments such as the Chvalkovic and the Green Mountains in Switzerland, the Kuzelov in Hodoninsk, the Party in Vsetinsk or the Police in Vsetinsk.
It's okay, but I don't know Lafata, she confessed to the opposition of Tripoli Goian.
"The Anti-Slavic Games I remember very well, and my head, like everyone in my career," 34-year-old Goian spoke to the passing press conference.
This time George Hagi trained us, it was a shame we lost.
I hope I still have Sparta.
I'm just saying we don't win this time," Goian continued.
That's the man who gathered 60 rounds after the Romanian representative is the key to the team's defense.
As a stopper, he's going to face the boots of peer offenses.
There's a few thousand people coming, there's no hell, talking about the river's fellow Hybš file.
And he partially knows what he can wait for him on Thursday night.
I know Fataie who played in Romanian Astre with my brother Lucian.
At the time, I saw all their jokes.
I know it's a very good attacker, so he went to Sparty, said Goian.
The next football club didn't mention it, so a direct question arose if he knew David Lafata, the best shooter in the history of the Czech League and Captain Sparty.
Goian smiled and, with a simple look, measured to the Czech newspaper.
"Why are you asking me about this?"
He's been down for a minute.
We saw some video, and I noticed that Sparta was playing a lot of team.
He's got a really good player.
What About Lazarus?
It's okay, but I don't know anyone else except Fataie.
This fellow of Goian knows very well.
"My experience in the larger clubs, it can be said that he holds Asterus's defense, is such an organizer of the game," warned Stanislav Hejkal.
Goian's got the best years of his life, but he can enjoy a very interesting photobook.
In his time, he was interested in Borusia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both the Manchester branch of the United and City, from Steauy, but was headed for the Italian Parliament, and he played for the Glasgow Rangers.
We're waiting for aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly playing European fires, but it's about victory in the Czech league.
For me, this game is a favorite game, but we play home and want to start the group with a good outcome.
Like Sparta, we're gonna try to win, said Goian.
I'm in a room with the Slovenian banker Thomas Košiky, who is very pleased with the Czech competition.
Me, too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're fighting hard.
Cofola is moving from Poland to Czech Republic, considering entry into the Prague borough.
The new seat should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland for trading with shares of the company on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary objective is to have the seat of a group in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have currently taken under the project are extremely legal and administrative and have no actual impact on the actions of the company, says Daniel Buryš, financial director of the Kofola Group.
"In relation to the movement of seats of the shareholders, the shareholders consider the location of the shares on the Prague bridge."
As a result of the entry into the Prague Stock Exchange, the Czech National Bank will complete the prospectus of the securities, which will be presented in the near future.
The transfer of holding seats and related transfers of shares will be carried out in the form of a non-public transaction with the participation of only existing shareholders.
In the context of this operation, no action will therefore be offered to the public or new investors.
"The appropriate offer of shares to new investors would be made - so the company and its shareholders will decide - later, either on Thursday 4th 2015 or on 1st quarter 2016," the company said.
The company has already indicated in the past that the appropriate offer of the shares could be derived from the issue of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could be derived from the offer of shares on the bridge in the Czech Republic and in Poland, including the location of shares on the Warsaw bridge.
Test of the objective of Czech television in information on the migration crisis.
A further small test of objectivity and exportation of the report of the main Czech media on the outbreak of the crisis.
This time, the Czech TV's main reporting relationship is sent.
How's it going?
When they're at the university of journalism to learn how the media can manipulate reality, they can leave today the Czech TV of the Event.
The migration crisis was estimated to be about 80% of the reporting.
By the first minute ČT informed the rest of the Serbian-Madarian border and the attacks of migrants on police called them euphemistic, patience came to them - they had stoned stones and attacked warheads), and now the most propagandist propaganda - give its own names of individual reports.
Criticism of non-governmental organizations - a large area for non-profit organisations that criticize misbehavior behaviour with migrants.
Syrian children in Czech school - history of the integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
It's not only as a threat but also as a chance.
Traveling refugees - ČT consistently uses words by a runner or a runner and not a migrant.
It is particularly disturbing that ČT is used in illustrations only consistently and only for small children and women.
At the same time, the same communication indicated that 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic were men.
Summary: Most of the propaganda that has no periods of communist aggression.
I have to say I'm ashamed of my colleagues as a former journalist.
Ecology in practice.
Once I got married to the panel room, I soon stopped being the only citizen.
The fish were moving to my backyard.
The domestic fish, the hazy with a change of imperfect, i.e., the non-progressing one from the nest to the breast and the young looks like an adult, only small and gradually growing.
They were opposed to me and I didn't hate them.
First handy and later chemical.
Socialist drugs at their disposal provided some blue crystals.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or something else?
But it was successful.
Later, I did the same thing with Pharaoh.
Crabic with some juvenileist who brought the ants into the nest and then he refused to royally produce a new generation.
But I threw it away.
As time went on, he also became an object of my admiration, and I became increasingly convinced that they had the same right to life as we people.
In addition, I have gained experience from life that the preservation of the ecosystem does not lead to success and one of the damages can be rewarded by another.
The truth is, I wouldn't be able to break down their karma when they're killed.
In the new room, we agreed with the partner that if we don't have fish to rest for the cow, we'll have to eat some of the leaves of the skin in a calm manner, some of these invisible lines and similar ones.
Their quiet existence in time corrupted the flood.
He was a common type of hunter who spent a long time sitting on a tree.
We had to live with temporary mice and cameras, which only increased our comfort.
Because he's been with us for a few years, we've found that he's mainly living with the fish and that he's obviously kept their numbers on the naked count.
We've found that it's unique when we have a reliable regular contact.
We were witnesses of romantic terms with a partner about a third less, as carefully as it turns out to be a haircut, so that he will not be swallowed before he reaches the weighted couple.
It took about three days when they didn't move and didn't respond to our controls.
Under the western table where loving toys were played, we later found the rest of the piled.
Then the storm came for a long week or so.
When we thought it was already behind us, we were surprised by the number of small dolls, which were growing up around her.
They're gone soon.
They've been bitten by their mother, they've broken apart.
Even the same guy disappeared somewhere after a week.
If she went to someone else or to fuck, we don't know, but after a month, two, she appeared on the roof again.
It's true, something smaller, probably the daughter of those westerners.
At some point from the summit, she carefully observed our conduct and the transfer under the flag assessed our incompetence as friendship.
The initial status of some of these fish has decreased again, and the spider has calmly sought its usual activities to ensure food.
He hasn't changed our ecosystem all year.
Our daughter reached the age of age when the use of the night was already hard.
We've tolerated it so far, but the eternal extraction of its contents has been a pleasure to us.
We've made her more and more aware of the use of the toilet.
The daughter, however, found an explanation in the box that she had seen very well when she was tired.
We're talking about seeing Daddy, having luck at home, she didn't even read.
I cried and I cried. I had my night out.
It wasn't the rest.
It's been a while when he had to report for the development of his daughter.
It's been on me.
He was dragged to the castle and showed himself through the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I used to laugh at him as a friend, but after so long a relationship, I felt embarrassed as if I were a stranger.
We assumed that the fish would start to appear more often and to multiply across the geometric line.
The world has gone wild, week, week, two, we haven't seen anyone there.
I started speculating about the cause.
I was wondering if you hadn't been there for the sake of the monsters, that the middle of the West was not as good as we thought it was.
But then the first pieces of medium size appeared, and they were gone again.
I had to think of another theory about the cause of their disappearance and I came to see that their bond with the pope had to have a reason not to see him buried somewhere else and that he was dangerously dangerous from anywhere.
Or maybe they had some telepathic connection with their predecessor and his rapid disappearance caused some terrible reaction.
You know, I don't do any illusions about their air.
They showed some kind of beauty, but that they would react to holding hands or moving fast, it's not.
The daughter's going to the bathroom regularly.
I think she forgot about the night.
There's only one thing else to do.
I'm already sending my invitation to dinner, and I hope they won't let me down after that execution.
Otherwise, we should use this cycle B.
Nineteen of Albert Einstein's products, who loved the world.
The effects of the genius of the past century will obviously never cease to fascinate mankind.
He was able to swallow up everything so deep that the explosion was always an amazing discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
To the public, he was especially fond of his special and general theory of relativity, which eventually best describes the universe in its giant dimensions.
Its explanation of the photo effect or the idea of quantification of the electromagnetic field is also not to be mentioned.
There is no doubt that the self-descript and the concept of knowledge of popular theology of relativity is so widespread that it prefers easy comparisons for closer recognition.
It's not easy, though.
It wouldn't be Albert Einstein if he didn't find a brilliantly simplified form of explanation: The clock near your sweet looks like a minute; the minute in the hot sand seems an hour - and it's relative.
I've been able to choose from all his famous quotes the ten who have just caught me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, geniuses try not to do them.
Only two things are endless.
The universe is human nonsense.
I'm not so sure about that first one.
No amount of attempts can ever prove that I had the truth.
But the only thing he can ever prove I was wrong.
But it's a sad period when it's easier to break the atom than to destroy the premise.
If the mess on the table doesn't look wrong, then what does the empty table look like?
I don't know what it's going to be fighting in the third world war, but in that fourth it's gonna be cracks and rocks.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but there's no way to wake him up.
Knowing a little is dangerous and knowing a lot too.
If I had an hour to handle the problem that would affect my life, I would spend 40 minutes with his study, 15 minutes with his analysis, and 5 minutes with his solution.
It's the hardest thing in the world to get tax from income.
In conclusion, I cannot overlook Einstein's formula for a definition of success: if we take A for success, we pay for example: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y rest and Z is to keep the language for teeth.
New to modernism.
Hospitals in the Zlinsk region are waiting for a change of 1.5 billion.
"It is a success when we consider that this year all four of them will be held in black numbers," said Haytman Stanislav Misák in peace.
The total profits of the national equipment are about 32 million kroner at this time.
The share in this is mainly higher than the insurance benefits, which are equally recognised for the year.
And this fact shows that, after the poor years, hospitals can finally allow more investment.
In Croméria, Vsetín, Uherska City and Zlynė, it is thanks to the buildings that will total about 1.5 billion crowns.
It's been a long time when we bought most of the equipment, it's over.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them the hospital will not work, has caused the plans of the National Hospital Lubomír Ness.
It's nice to change all hospitals.
The nurses will come to the hospital next year.
In Vsatin, the suppliers of the new inner pavilion are now choosing about 300 million kroner.
In Croatia, they have a planned dialling device.
The City of Hungary wants to introduce a new interior for a total of 200 million to the open central pavilion this year.
And the green Băo hospital is waiting for a long-term construction of a new central income and interior, which will require three fourths of billion.
In all cases, it is fundamental and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"For the whole region, patients and doctors are an extremely important step," for example, told the head of the Hospital of Faith Prouskova.
The five-storey building has to be a ready hole for two years and offers comfortable equipment for the interior and neurology, dialysis, new ambulance, bed and intensive care unit.
More comfort for patients.
The changes which are clearly known to patients will affect all regions.
The new buildings are well rewarded by those who, for example, sleep many patients in one room, have only one toilet on their table, beds are unsatisfied, windows are unsatisfied, and doctors do not have adequate working conditions.
"For example, our home was established five years ago and now it's on the edge of its life," said the director of the criminal hospital Pavel Calábek.
For a few years, it is therefore rewarded by the seven-day modern buildings combined with an emergency income.
Doctors and patients will have all the acute sections in one place, in addition to new spaces.
The same model already has half of the Uhersk City finished.
The central entrance is already standing, and within three years, it's coming in.
"We will pay the floor out of credit and partly out of our own resources," explained Director Petr Sládek.
Only this hospital can afford its own funding as the only one in the country.
Zisk is still the highest and has not been lost two years ago, when an ill-equipped spy has suffered almost twenty million losses.
"We have good contracts with insurance, excellent efficiency, increased income and effectively manage costs throughout the hospital," Vlastimil Vajdák, who has an economy of age, said.
Improvements are also expected in patients in the romary hospital.
During ten to fifteen years, he will be able to repair new equipment and reconstruction up to half a billion crowns.
This year it will be ready to fix the landing station, then start the construction of the dialysis, where appropriate, building for a new magnetic resonance.

No one has explained how I should keep the acceptable fugitives in the country when they don't want to live in Czech.
Minister of the Interior Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) is concerned with the fact that the other Czech States are pushing to adopt quotas for the transfer of surpluses, but they refuse any discussions.
It is also true that no one has yet explained to him how to keep assigned passengers in Czech if they don't want to live with us.
"We didn't get the answer, and that's why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text," Chovanec told journalists.
Can you describe more specifically the position you came up with to meet ministers from within and outside the European Union?
We do not agree with the quotas required as a system that just can't work.
We can't talk about migrants like dried salts or mollusks.
These are the living habitats that have some vision, some direction, some kind of friendly.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we were able to maintain migrants in the territory of the Member States if they were to redistribution.
We can't imagine that.
We didn't get the answer, so we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, thus registration sites, border protection, camps outside Europe, African country trust fund and other things, we have no problem with this.
We've been talking about this for years and we're saying that this is the road.
But to say that the quotas will solve everything?
We've recently settled forty-four thousand, and now it's a hundred twenty-two thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep those people on this land?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who pass through us want to go to Germany.
We don't want anyone here, we just don't know how to keep them here.
We have the ambition to go to other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as a target country, get asylum with us, but the interests of people from this migration wave, then from Syria and other countries, are very close to zero.
You mentioned that the hostages didn't even want to come to us, but we've already made a commitment to take it.
Wouldn't it be possible to take them this way more?
We made a commitment to take 1500 people, but on condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border protection, military operations.
And in the 1500s, it's about 1100 people coming with whom we're going to deal with the asylum procedure.
They'll come to our detachment and we'll treat them the same as those we caught.
It is a big question, and we will discuss with Europe whether we can keep people who will be registered in Italy and Greece, as far as Hungary is concerned.
Because Europe acts in such a way that if they have registrations, they cannot be detained.
This means they'll come to our territory with registration, and if there's an agreement that's not yet, it can happen that we don't even have 1100 on the territory of the Czech Republic and they'll go back to Germany.
If we are able to maintain them during the asylum procedure, we will arrange an asylum procedure with them.
If the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, are almost 98 per cent of European statistics, they will gain international protection.
Then they will receive evidence that will enable them to travel throughout Europe.
And I think these people are going to end up in target countries again.
Then there are four people who will move.
This is the second project that is currently being launched, and we have only made progress in discussing with the churches about the possibility of helping them to get jobs, housing and so on.
But it's a long run.
You said that the other states were not willing to discuss meeting ministers with us.
But it's not that the Czech Republic simply rejects the quotas, but does it not offer any solidarity step that would block the debate?
And what exactly is this supposed to be a solid step?
If the Federal Republic of Germany bids that all migrants from Syria can come to it, this report will spread in several hours throughout the camps throughout Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It's another migration wave that leads to Germany because they just don't want us.
We think that the road is the protection of external borders - just the migration flows, help the needy, and separate economic migrants.
Just let them know they don't have a chance.
In the last year alone, there were tens of thousands of Kosovos.
From the safe Kosovo, where we pay all the Saturation of this state, including police, courts, state representatives.
If we were able to divide them and not accept them or accept them only as needed by the economy, they would be reduced to 10% of what social systems are giving them today.
On the contrary, on the first day when Germany took control of the number of prisoners in Czech Republic.
Now it's eighty, it's the first day it was twelve.
Where's it coming from so that controls on the borders are still on?
We were afraid of getting caught in a series of hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we have.
We still have hundreds of free places in stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we're holding, we'll be back to Raków in seven days.
We're doing it standard.
They're the only ones who take us with them, Hungary and Greece - it's a whole story.
So where's the point of the crime?
Should it be a thousand a day?
I think it should be a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three people a day two, three days after each other, they're wasting our capacity so much that they're going to have crisis plans.
Then I agreed with Mr. Prime Minister that he would call the government immediately.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're several times a day in a phone call.
If this situation occurs, the government may sit down immediately and, by one resolution, decide to strengthen the army police, let's give it to the customs administration, whatever the prison service.
The country variant is an exceptional position which has now been declared by Hungary in some places?
I don't think that's how far it's going to go.
Be aware that our positions are different, we are the national state within Europe, we have the Schengen border, and we only have on the airport.
I don't know what would have happened in order for this to happen in the Czech Republic to happen, I don't want to spread scary information.
All the information we already have, from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, is more likely to testify that Hungary is trying to reverse the migration flows to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean the direct route to Austria.
The Czech Republic would be affected very carefully, almost at all.
Slavia paid a lot of debts for the last time.
He's trying to prevent the announcement of the accident.
The football slavia paid debts.
The footballists were expecting their money too.
Fotbal Slavia stood in the afternoon for the first time because of the insolvency proceedings before the court.
About three months later, for a total of 20 million crowns, the proposal was made by the online Services company from the Pacific Samoa.
The legal representative of Slavie Zuzana Mládkė tried to convince Judge Michael Wenzl within a few hours that he did not have to report the incident.
And I need to say she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that the previous week with the new owner of Slavy became a major Chinese industry and investment group of CEFC and also a Czech billionaire Jiří Shimán.
Obviously, the new owners of the club got the money, and that's the last time.
This also proves that Slavie's statement before yesterday's court hearing - the top club on Monday, just the day before the trial, sent ten million crowns.
"It was all between September 11 and September 15," stated the legal representative Slavie Mládková.
Who's Slavia paid for?
Modern and former players and business partners.
In particular, for example, the Slovenian ex-representation of Milan Ivana or Czech deputy Mariu Lickov.
Slavia has also contributed to your agent Alexandra Losenicke's salary.
On Friday, the club also paid debt payments in the city section of Prague 10.
The parties to the insolvency dispute thus remain de facto only the searches that Slavie is discontinuing.
Whether the commitments were made by the club, or the court disputes were brought about.
However, we are prepared to pay for the losses of these disputes.
"We have the necessary resources on the bank account, which we can make a statement from the account," the lawyer Mládkova told the judge.
"All that was after payment has been charged," declared Mládk and added that the unpaid obligations are only unpaid or disbursed.
It is also true that in the near future the court will not decide and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavii three weeks to send detailed evidence that she actually paid for the debts mentioned.
Next comes to the assessment of all the evidence.
The decision can therefore be expected first in November.
The Court ordered further proceedings on the third day of November.
However, the decision will not come at this meeting, but in writing.

FastMig X is the most recent generation of investors' vulnerabilities.
The combination of spicy technologies, hardware and software equipment integrated into modular construction brings benefits and the rapid return of investment to high-quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final set is always configured according to customer requirements.
And any of these, from the mixing of the construction steel after the mixing of the special sludges, as well as from the mixing of rough materials after the mixing of the tankes, from the application in the parts to the drawings in the boats.
An incredible amount of fraud, easy setting and expansion of the source of fraud enables quick response to changing requirements, leading to a reduction in gaps, the need to stop resources and more productive fraud.
FastMig X allows mixing with spicy mixing processes developed by Kempi, which ensure higher productivity and quality of mixing.
It ceases to waste time and does not come to waste material or fix the missing items.
It's guaranteed flexibility, it's less simple, it's more fun and more profit.
It's an annual newspaper that had a prime minister in Nitre, where she also got gold medals.
We're very concerned about these spots because they confirm the product's exception.
The former world manufacturers can be confused with similar systems, but thanks to the differences in software and parameters management, FastMig X is a world spy.
For the interested parties, there is certainly a pleasant and additional period of time that is moving around three weeks.
In the Czech Republic, we have already established the first contacts that are likely to expand beyond the railway station.
We have been his regular participants for over twenty years, and almost always our business results are better than before him, emphasising the company ARC-H Miroslav Streichsbier, leading Kemppi sales in Plzni.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final set is always configured according to customer requirements.
White was going to make it so she wouldn't go away.
But it's still about half a billion more, says the expert from the company that the tunnel was projecting.
The white man's gone safer, says the expert.
The Blanca tunnel complex was possible to prevent two earthquakes in the Persian Stromovce, said the manufacturer of the Satra company, who is the main tunnel designer, Alexandr Butovic.
He said it in the middle of the afternoon at a news station watching the tunnel.
But he says it would be about half a billion crown more expensive.
Drivers are open on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and security.
"The tunnel was going to be safer, but the costs grew exponentially," said Butovic.
The conditions in Stromovce were the same throughout the period, although only a few steps from the place where the safest and more careful method was started.
"If this measure were used 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would be half a billion more expensive," said Butovic.
The White Tunnel has fallen three times during the construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater in Stromovce died in 2010 in the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of the company Metrostav of Jiří Bélohlov, the tunnel is very expensive, said the week Euro.
According to the original plan, she had a total of 17 billion dollars.
When we calculate the DPH, which doubles during the construction period, you have a total of seven billion units.
When it comes to technology, land purchases and engineering, valuation and similar positions, it's 29 billion, which is no longer from 37 to so far, says Belohlov.
Someone ordered it and paid for it.
iOS 9: How to get new iPhone operating system with new Apple update
A new operating system can be required in the Settings when you click on the "General" map and select "Software Update" (upgradation software).
When ready, your phone will offer you the opportunity to download and install it.
Some users were affected by the problem after installation, in particular by the error message "suspend software update".
One of the solutions to this problem is to wait until you are interested in updating or try through iTunes.
Your phone is running an up-to-date process.
And this includes the need to uninstall applications to release places - but this will not be necessary because Apple has reduced the update and has also simplified the process through the use of a special tool that users have proposed to remove and reinstall after updating.
Make sure your phone is busy before you start updating.
If the battery is low, Apple does not allow the update to be started, because interrupting the process could cause an update error.
Other reports: the issue of iOS 9 has not been postponed despite WatchOS maintenance; the review of iOS 9: increasing the update of the new operating system version; iOS9: how to prepare for the issue of a new operating system for iPhone
Make sure you have passed our list of things to do before updates that try to prevent or protect them. iOS 9 will present new functions, including even smarter personal assistants and a large range of creative functions for iPad, as well as a lot of payments to speed up and repair of the operating system.
FedExu's pockets mixed, reduction of fiscal view for 2016
FedEx reported adverse results for the last quarter and a significant reduction in the forecast of the year's profit due to the low demand for cost adjustment and higher costs for the land dividend.
The company also indicated that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers through the holidays.
In this late year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers on holidays.
Companies' shares dropped by approximately 2.5 per cent in pre-market trade 45 minutes before the mid-opening.
FedEx states that it expects a difference between $10.40 and $10.90 for a fiscal year that ends the next flower, which means a down of 20 cents from the previous forecast.
The analysts expected $10.84, according to a study by the FactSet company.
The reduced view is due to an increase in rates of 4.9 per cent, as shown in January 4, and higher charges for underground transport of heavy or large packages starting in November.
The company stated that it is still expected to increase the profit of sales over the previous year due to the reduction of costs, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
The president of the Presidency and the Director-General of the company Fred Smith said that the company "provided a strong performance despite the expected economic conditions, especially in the processing industry and global trade."
The holiday rental plans were notified on the day after the airlines indicated that they were planning to hire from 90,000 to 95,000 employees, which is probably the same as last year.
In the quarter that ended in August 31, FedEx received $692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.
The share profit was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 for the share, which was predicted by 12 analyses questioned by Zacks Investment Research.
Markets grew by 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts from Zacks were expecting $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been affected by a decline in priority international ship transport, which has led to the arrival of its Express units.
But boom in online shopping has strengthened the results of the global FedEx unit.
In the last quarter, land income increased by 29 per cent, but the operating profit was essentially the same because of higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The express unit reported higher revenue due to higher basic rates, while the profit decreased in the cost trade due to higher labour prices.
In the pre-market trade, about an hour before the opening of FedEx's share, it was worth $3.85, or 2.5 per cent, to $150.15.
They ended on Tuesday with an increase of 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent under the 11th June record.
At its most expected session for the entire year, federal reserve lawmakers will spend two days this week at 27 degrees of a long Honduran mahogany table and will decide whether it is time after almost ten years to increase the key rate.
With regard to them at the end of the central bank's decoration, a double seating room will be set up in the United States.
The map is a reminder that President Fed Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues have to give economic interests to the nation above all else.
The Central Bank has two fightings from Congress: maximising American employment and maintaining more stable prices.
But since the Great Recession, the representatives of the Federation have recognized that there is an unwritten third functional period: financial stability.
And this third functional period could be an X factor too close to the predictable decision to be notified on Thursday whether the US economy is prepared to be released when leaving the unprecedented incentive in the form of almost zero short-term rates in place since the end of 2008.
Although most data show a solid growth in the economy, recent turmoil in the world financial markets could already be alarmed by the fact that it increases its reference rate of federal funds - and nothing more than a quarter of the percentage point.
"It is clear that the labour and inflation market will be the most important thing to follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, the main economy of the steel company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think that they were just looking for an excuse for not raising the measure, increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already gives them sufficient reason to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what Fed will do, which is the cause of nervousness in financial markets.
Almost half of the economies recently questioned by Blomberg predicted an increase in the rate this week.
Financial markets, however, expect Fed to maintain its interest, with a key indicator only about 30% chance for an increase.
This would indicate a decline in the share market in the case that Fed increases rates only if policies are changing, I swear that the next increase is invisible.
On the second industrial average, Dow Jones jumped to 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The meeting was postponed by the expectation that the Fed politicians will maintain the rates of this week's rest, says John Lonski, the main economy in Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising if Fed now raised taxes," he says.
If the Fed politicians would do so, "they would have to go to the country in their programme announcements and hold hands on the financial markets so as not to miss the panic."
Other experts claimed that raising the rate would calm the financial market because it would remove uncertainty from how Fed would proceed.
Only a month ago, it seemed that Fed was on a good way to raise the rate of 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in the slow acceleration of changing conditions that would confirm the economic recovery power in the United States.
Yellen said that over the years, it is expected to increase the rate in the year and through the difficulties of liberals, that more economic progress is needed.
Although the creation of jobs in August declined, this year the labour market marked solid growth.
The unemployment rate is 5.1% in the previous month, which is the lowest in over seven years and is close to the level that Fed considers to be full employment.
The ice creams showed the top marks.
And although inflation continues under 2% of the annual goal of the central bank, the Fed policy claims that for the main reason it has been a temporary effect of significantly lower prices of oil.
The economy "can be reconciled with higher rates and needs them, given the stability of the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, the main economy of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world began to disappear at the end of the last month after China took over its currency.
The industrial average of Dow Jones was up to 16% below its record value in May when investors feared that the declining Chinese economy would be dependent on global growth.
The market has sometimes been reflected in this month and the Dow is now only about 10% of the farm's maximum.
The political factor of Feda gives a complex calculation of the market's unsatisfying situation when the rate increases.
"In the absence of what happened on the financial markets, and reports of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, it would have come to the attention of this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, leading researcher UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former official Fed.
It now suggests that they wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.
"There are a lot of uncertainties about the impact it will have on the US economy, and there are almost no data that can be relied on about the latest developments in China," Oliner said.
The health status of the global economy is not one of the main interests of the Federation, so the technology should not be included in their decision.
But in fact, Fed has become the changing authority of the whole world.
The impact of central banks in recent years has been enormous.
In 2013, President Bena S. Bernanke's brief note of the year 2013 that Fed could "increase" their monetary expansion on the market has put the gap across the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly united, it can be expected that the representatives of the Federation will follow the development of others, but they will also be consulted with other central bankers and experts so that they can better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for wealth-management company Investnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, V., pointed out this month that "Fed has history of movements in financial markets that seem to be incompatible with economic foundations."
Lacker, who voted in favour of the creation of the Federal Committee on Open Market policy, quoted the decision in 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led Fed to a reduction in its reference rate of 0.75 per cent during the three meetings "I over limited identifiable impacts on growth in the USA," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed's representatives turned down these drawings.
Fed should prioritise financial stability in the event of a major crisis, as was the 2008 market collapse, said Adam Posen S., former member of the Bank of England's Committee on Taxation.
The latest round is not even approaching this level, he said.
"You certainly do not want to be in a situation of fear of rising rates because the markets have broken down," said Posen, president of the Institute for the International Economy of Peterson .
The Federal Reserve System Act has two other mandates and does not change financial stability, and until it changes, I don't think they should get to the gate.

The speed in the distance will remain with the old man.
The speed of 150 km/h Snow stopped.
At selected distances, it will not be possible to increase the maximum permitted speed up to 150 km/h under the conditions of recognition.
On Tuesday, Snémovna decided to join the Senate's amending proposal, which rejected an increase in speed.
The new Land Communications Act will now be directed to the President.
President Miloš Zeman has already said in depth that the law would allow the speed of step-by-step ten-foot speed.
In contrast, the Minister for Transport Dan Ók (for the UN), according to which the Czech remote network has not yet been established at such a speed.
On Tuesday before the delegation, the House supported the Senate's version of the law.
The new approval is now possible in accordance with the original government's proposal to increase speed from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour on selected first-class vehicles, in particular four-wheels.
The fleet first expanded this possibility even to the distance to which it would be possible to travel at selected speeds up to 150 km/h, but the Senate rejected it.
The messengers now joined his proposal.
The senators agreed with the Minister for Transport of the news that the right of the transport police to have the last word to correct local communications that the citizens are looking forward to.
The senate version adopted by the Snímovna is also calculated so that the channelling, water or cables of public lighting could be subdivided below the surface of the vehicle.
The citizens would be saved so as to get rid of land.
Citizens should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation in part of local roads regardless of the owner of the land concerned.
Newela also has the help of improving the safety of the road and facilitating urban loading with decommissioned vehicles to which the owners do not report.
New citizens could sell off vehicles that are not reported by their owners in the six-month period after notification of their refusal.
Citizens will be able to exclude transit costs from their territory by road from the second and third classes under the threat of prosecution even for shipping companies.
Newly, it is also possible to introduce electronic remote notes instead of supply paper, which will be used even after January 1st of the following year.
According to the government, it will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
An outstanding expressor is in front of the court.
He's been threatened for 10 years to win over his citizens.
The case concerns a project that has been transferred to citizens.
In this case, the police wanted to silence the delegation of Zuzana Kail (ČSSD), but the Embassy did not release her.
According to the legal qualification of the case, it is dangerous for both to ten years of imprisonment.
The main census is currently scheduled for two October days.
According to the official representative of Mandík and Macík, the damage has been at least one million kroner, resulting from the complaint.
The complainant is accused of finding a case.
The former members of the city’s leadership, according to the applicant’s title, failed to obtain the property benefits of the company which was organised to win the citizens.
According to the complainant, the former chief of the City Service, School and Culture Board has made it possible for him to speak in the election of five of the companies involved.
When another company that offered the lowest price was notified to the competition, the company was cancelled.
The city was then to trust the administrator and only Darothore was registered to the competition, which was then assigned to the City Council.
The city paid at least a million more.
Both charges are aimed at ensuring for Darothore the award of public orders to organize actions to invite residents in Ústá over Labe in the long term and coordinated at least in conflict with the requirement for a fair economy procedure, writes the national representative.
At the same time, they have been aware that Darothore subsequently calculates the Office over Lab for the implementation of the action Award of the citizens of the price, which will reverse the real value of the services actually provided without undue increase.
In three years, according to the project's description, the company has invested more than five million kroner.
In the end, the city paid only one portion, a total of 1.7 million kroner, and then withdrew from the contract.
The amount paid was transferred at a minimum of one million kroner according to the expert survey.
A man has already rejected any violation of the law.
I didn't commit any crime, I was innocent.
I don't understand this built cause, the former prime minister said that the city under his leadership had only referred to a similar project in recent years.
In 2008-2010, the event provided for Agent Roxy II.
"It was under the same conditions, for the same money," Mandík added.
Criminals initially wanted to accuse the Ambassador of Kail, who was also a member of the City Council.
The messenger's speech, but she didn't draw it.
That's why the criminals left the case in her case, but it's because Kailo's charge is after the mission's end.
The invitation of citizens was a social event that took place several times a year.
Her mother got a gift check for 5,000 kroner for the purchase of children's needs and small gifts.
Hungarian police obviously let the dog's back.
Then the journalists were able to delete the record.
The Hungarian police at the border briefly held a cameraman's AP agency and provided him with a record on which the police dog had reportedly hit the ground.
The Hungarian government, but this charge is wrong.
An incident took place on Saturday evening when cameraman AP Luca Muzi filmed migrants who crossed the border with Serbia across the Hungarian border through the corn field near the Hungarian city of Russia.
The police urged the refugees and one of them allowed Syrians to attack the dog with a knife on the chest.
The dog that called "Please, please, I'm a rat," said Musi.
The fact that Muzi's filming everything, he looked at one of the cops and refused to let him go.
The journalist should never have called his superiors or his colleagues on the spot.
The police took the Museum to a dark spot at the registering center for the hostages and asked him to show them what he had.
Then they ordered him to make a record.
This was the result of two-week work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt safe because the dogs were close.
The AP agency sent a protest letter to the Hungarian Government of Zoltana Kovacs.
The conduct of the police in it was unacceptable and indicated that journalists should be able to cover up events without risking physical violence and not fear that the government would destroy legally acquired material.
Kovacs failed by calling to the police report of the Museum's trial.
He said the police only wanted the press to show them if they were on some arrests, which they were entitled to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't use it.
"The dogs can jump - they're excited to be scared and a little scared, but they certainly didn't fight," Kovács says.
Unpredictable League of Masters.
Winning the City will catch us, believes Juventus
"It's a defeat, I don't think we deserve to lose," wrote Manuel Pellegrini, the housekeeper of the city.
We had more chance and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic team of Master's League.
Not one team has created a lot of opportunities, but the ball on the carpets we had a long time ago.
"The cause of the injuries was not in the tactics, Juventus just shot two beautiful balls," he decided to shoot Pellegrini, whose team was indicted for a long period of 636 minutes.
This finalist of the past season Juventus was at this point in the face of an exact cross-section - after the first three streets of the Italian league has only a piece of the title and the score 2:4 is up to 16 places of the table.
And that's why the work at Etihad Stadium was a great surprise.
"This prize will help us mentally, bring us together," believes trainer Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three objections - Pirla, Téveze and Vidala before the new anniversary.
In Manchester, they represented Pogba, Mandzukic and Morata.
"That's right, this victory is very important, maybe we'll get him on the winning floor," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're between the best men in Europe.
In the second time, we were better, especially in the attack phase.
My players deserve this result.
"In front of our equational sphere, we could've gotten to 0:2, but Gianluigi supported us," praised the dog Allegri General Buffona.
"We've burned a few good shots," hated Yayu Touréh, the mayor of the city.
We need to get out of the League of Experience Masters and next try to get a better outcome.
Good morning Angelo, old German II.
Before we go further on the question of immigrants, we should realize that all this media distortion around is handled by professionals.
According to the need for media as well as nurse.
And then let's stop for a minute.
Today there are newspapers and media filled with children who are not on their parents' hands on empty exodus roads.
And it causes a person - then a European person - automatically feels guilt and guilt.
Well, they don't just come here with trusted children, but look at the receptions of members joining the Greek islands that the child is not so much seeing them!
Well, and some of us have recently disappeared from the television of the ships measuring at Lampedus, the runners before the French border in Menton, where the beautiful crossings take thousands of young men.
Most of the young blacks.
And they also disappeared images from Callais, where these snows and black men are waiting for them to pass through the tunnel under La Manche.
I don't think he's getting it anymore.
Not even those images of the primitive Christian church of the Eritrejc people have made a special impression on the people of Europe.
You're getting out of this race of lies.
So when it comes to the quota for refugees, it's something to stop that it's not only about unhappy children from Syria but also about exposed ones - for older people: fashionable - young men.
Their muscles look like they're just getting out of some fixture.
That's just one personal experience.
This summer in Turkish - Muslim - parts of Cyprus were on the private beach of the hotel.
No matter how private she was, a large group of cars came to the beach at once.
But no dogs.
And young blacks appeared from them.
About thirty men and five women.
The age between 15 and 30 years.
Swimming on the beach, all clothes in brandy clothes and shoes. In hand, like otherwise, smartphones.
That it's a private beach, it's not interesting and the employees - Turks, Muslims - are obviously afraid of them.
They've destroyed all the sheets.
Whoever wasn't on it and was right in the sea, he had a sword.
They were dressed like the American rapper movie.
On the head of the hat with a nose, white and colourful adhesion on the feet.
Then they surrounded the local beach bar and started walking.
They surrounded the halls, flocked to the sitting-room and the white bar guests - read to the Muslims and to the Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children walked out of the food terrace somewhere to rest.
The next black people drank beer equal to the third of them - like in the US series?! - on the beach they picked empty beds around them.
There's still a voice on each other.
It wasn't English at all.
Then they went into wine, also with the same oil.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in character sheets, especially the young ladies - in the water they ate and drank, the mothers and children fled in fear, and within half an hour he was no longer on the beach or in the pool nor a black guest.
They've all gone wrong.
No matter whether he was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were afraid to talk about them.
The priest said to me last night, "Did you see that gold what they had on themselves?"
"Yes," I said.
"Well, they shouldn't have done it at work," said the reader.
I said, "I know, they all had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one of them had about two hundred and fifty centimetres of gold's massy cross.
And women were like gold.
"Are these drug dealers?" I asked.
"You've seen how they cry," answered the reader.
The drugs don't work, they don't use them.
They need something completely different.
So I already knew what they were feeding.
However, in June 2105, it wasn't so important to me.
I didn't know what to follow.
But the secret services and top policies should know first.
I don't think they'd know.
About 1.5 million immigrants were born in Europe at the time.
And they go, they go, they go.
Today, the main problem of the European Union is that total-political-corrective policies such as intellectuals and related lobbyist and economic groups have the greatest influence in Europe.
Germany and its policy - today the publicly recognized major forces in Europe - lies, lies and lies - but not only them, but also the EU's chips and televisions, including ours.
For example, recent television images on the award of students in Germany are at the level of Moscow TV from August 1968.
Of course, there were a few sundials on the beach, but mostly - the elderly - the Muslims saved their own men.
For many weeks, they have been bluffed in reports on Czech television, as some studies say, almost all of Germany's immigrants are coming.
Anyone who's been in Germany for a few days knows it's a lie like a bear.
That confirms further information.
For example, the famous research of the public opinion organized by the ARD - Czech Association of public television companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to the ARD, more than 50% of the Germans wanted to take more than a week ago.
It also reported on our television.
The second day in Germany, the polling showed that 94.5 per cent of the German immigrants no longer wanted - 67,000 people attended the polls.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly announced in November 2010, and five years ago, "Our efforts on multi-cultural society have completely failed."
Then she said, "Germany is making war on a multicultural society."
"Every effort to make such a connection was totally futile."
In a country where four million Muslims live, it does not mean that a strategy that allows people from different cultural backgrounds to live with themselves without integration, lives here today, and we have been saying that they won't be gone one day again.
But that's not true.
A multicultural approach, when we say we're just living happily next to each other, then this approach has gone down.
It's just a dream.
But Merkel's probably won't have the power to go against the strong Germany and Europe, especially against political correctness.
This shows the scale of the event.
The conflict is moving fast.
Euronemec Schulz, President of the European Parliament, the SPD Ambassador, the only one who has no doubt or maturity in the European Parliament - yes, that is what Berlusconi in the EU Parliament said he could play at the concentration from minutes to minutes, as he has suggested several times.
It seems, in particular under the perception of the latest results of German policies, that Germany exceeded Rubikon.
It is obvious that, while most European policies do not support these years, the citizens of countries that have been victims of Nazism are scared.
What happened to Germany?
With those rich, successful and solid Germans?
Those who for years have tried, at least in vain, to rid themselves of their terrible past of aggression and murder of millions?
Do they have the truth of what they say that in Germany there are seven demons of aggression, brutality, and violence?
Did the Chancellor Otto von Bismarck have the truth when he gave up all his power to attempt the Greats to control the whole of Europe?
When did he say the Great German idea is going to be destroyed?
He probably did.
When they left her, she started preparing for World War I.
The idea of the Great Germany, which led Germany and Europe into two wars that continued millions of lives, probably returned in another form.
After the Marxists tried to rule the state, for example with the Rote Army Group, and after the failure of the NDR, in Germany, on the basis of ecology, which was by far one of the main ideal sciences of Nazism, a new German ideology began to develop.
We'd say the sun.
The German elites have long defended the cause of German nationalism, and thus left all those combatants in the room against the atoms, overcrowded looking for a paradise for all, quietly supporting the old Cypriot and Nazi password Our forest must live.
In order to calm young people who all over the world want to do something different and better, they have been fully devoted to the fighters against the burning of the planet, stopped nuclear power, etc.
And they forgot that there was also a strong anti-Semitism, so-called pro-prolactian, and an anti-Slovenian passage that considered all of the Slovenians to be difficult verbs - since the time of Karl Marxe, who, after the parents ’ Jews, was mainly German nationalist.
And also as shown by the last years of Schulze and the German Ministers openly threatening disobedient East states, the idea of the German leadership.
Who needs to listen without interrupting.
Otherwise, you're in trouble!
And when we contribute to the fact that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And this is always the capital, especially Germany, which is responsible for the fact that Germany actually controls most of the European States through the banks and the Union.
Pseudovir of the solar system first introduced Germany into the pool of ecologicalism and multilateralism, and today it has brought them home and may still bring millions of Muslims.
Those who, in the cold voices of the siren, find themselves quickly on the wall of reality that Merkel doesn't want to see, and they start to burn.
Germany can only once again threaten its neighbours with violence, it can again be part of its citizens - but as it seems, the still smaller part - is ideologically misleading, but eventually it is realized as always.
Will Germany burn again?
The Muslim settlement is already burning.
What will the German government do when public protests against the Germans coming to power?
Will they come to help Muslims who have lived in Germany for a long time, but will they never be assimilation so that they can overcome local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when the naturalization of Muslims, Islamists and Germans are released, following the fear of Islam in their country?
What will it do with Germany, and even with Germany, when people raise their voices and publicly protest against a new Euro-Montenegro Muslim?
Germany just changed.
The conflict that has prompted solar ideology in Europe, then elite and essentially total, and its non-profit banks, is growing.
And because of undeterred conduct against the disobedient democratic Germans and all obedient and disobedient eastern neighbours, this will not have a good effect.
It's over tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of incoming sellers: to scare them to death.
It's enough to lock up, and the robbery's coming up on you in a way that's not going to get any worse.
Liver head is a nice set and pressed and you are on the way away (or more affected) of an essential seller and a refreshing juice.
Maybe it's a shame that the speaker can't really control his speech.
And we'd have a lot of jokes and jokes.
Oxalis corniculata (Oxalis corniculata).
It's a rough drive that tolerates dry environments.
And that's how it's between the outer walls near my apartment.
On 16 September 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant that belongs to the expansive swimming pools, but it also creates a beautiful idea about the flowering.
It's between outdoors.
She's unquestionable, she's in our backyard.
He likes the dry environment, it's easy to adapt, humble and harmless.
She's making a list of Chaotic compositions, but that's why she's going to watch and take photos.
From a small perspective, it is first found the beauty of detail - yellow flowers and green leaves also with a purple fragrance.
Brazilian Pediatric Society Rio Grande promotes healthy diet when eating
The Brazilian paediatric company SPRS has come in a shocking way to try to communicate to women knowledge about the importance of good care in raising images of children from the breast of an unhealthful diet.
Human breast milk consists of various proteins, tissues, vitamins, and carbohydrates that provide horses with all the animals they need to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to the excess energy requirements, pregnant women and newborn mothers are recommended to increase daily calorie intake of 500 calories a day.
However, new studies indicate that increased calorie intake is not the only diet that mothers should manage.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that the healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic makeup of their children and protected them from developing breast cancers.
Unfortunately, non-healthy diets also proved to have a negative impact on the child immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates rules, even though Nine's trying to take the lead in Today Show
The support of Karla Stefanovice and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberry for covering the costs resulting from the exception of the liberal leadership failed to create a sufficient increase in the evaluation for Today.
The morning show of Nine from the national capital after Malcolm Turnbulla tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, with the host David Kochem and Samantha Armyage, settled in London as part of a week's long series of international television broadcasts, which also includes Dubai, New York, the Nigerian Waterways and Cancun.
It did not seem that the distance between the Aussie TV fans was so much on this Tirania, because it recorded 397 000 monkeys in five main cities compared with 330,000 today's broadcast monkeys.
Today it has shown a smaller increase in its assessment compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but its number has reached the last quarter (343,000).
Today in the last few months, it's filling the line on Sunrise.
In August, Today was averaged 318,000 in comparison with 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the measles moved between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has an average of 349 000 fans and today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
The winds of change affect more than Parliament this morning, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are all right, thanks for asking!
Today added on Monday 14 September 2015
A big message for Seven was a playful debut 800 words with the former star Packed to the Raffers Erik Thomson.
A new drama about a newly married father, who decides to move with his two children to the southern part of New Zealand, has an average of 1,219 million dividends.
Critics wondered if Thomson himself would be able to shut down a TV hit without the Star Rafters Rebeccy Gibney.
The result of yesterday's evening is clear "yes".
The X Factor of Seven left behind a strong 1,136 million wildlings, with a slight increase of The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726,000)
Seven recorded mixed follow-up on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half of the new television show (from 17:00 to 17:30) that Andrew O'Keefe's introduced had an average of 446,000 fans.
The second half (from 17:30 to 18:00) rose to 623 000 dragons — enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613 000).
On Monday evening, the first half of The Chase Australia had an average of 520,000 savages and a second half of 720,000 unbelievable.
Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
Thanks to the decline in The Chase Australia from the second night, Nine will be convinced that Hot Seat at 17:30 will finally win.
The Chase Australia is replaced by a series of millions of Dollars, which failed to defeat McGuiro's show.

Three in the final agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is a perfect boy - but who's chosen?
Secret revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may not have wanted to find out who wins Bachelor.
The woman that Sam Wood comes to Bachelor is trapped in an inexhaustible mystery.
And the three remaining girls will definitely not know who's the right that's finally getting roses.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, the Snowman Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before they left for two, thank you for telling us who's winning.
Sam Wood keeps the tooth language in the quarter terminal
All three lyric women explained why Wood was a perfect man, quoted his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness as a reason why they wanted to be his partner.
Anyway, when asked, "If it wasn't as good as Wood's final flower?", their answers could work as a competitor as to who gets the heart of Bachelor.
Like Jeavons-Fellows, Markowski quickly named Mackay as here, which would be the best way to go to Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood shared a certain day's light relationship.
"From the moment I entered the house and observed the energy of Sáry and Sam, I felt that they were quite compatible and I still think that during the course," says Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is a truly ground woman, she has a lot of fun with her," added Marcoski.
I saw them together and there's this right chemistry between them.
They're good together and nice.
Sarah Mackay thinks Sam Wood could make a couple.
She claims that during his last visit home, she realized that Wood could be "the right one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this isn't just a game anymore - I opened my heart to him now," he adds.
I asked who would choose Wood if she didn't. She'd look nice.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I like both girls as well - it's not so much between Snezen and Lana.
Bachalor leaves in the middle of 7.30 on Ten.
Originally published as Sarah's best choice for Sam Wood?
Jerry Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the United States, and many teams were asked after his great start of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and seems to be a reasonable decision.
Some of the coaches left Hayne sitting for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which made the conversion of the Australian ruby League at the first landing at the top of the competition on Tuesday 20:3 at Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and get him into the game after Reggie Bushe was injured.
Tomsula was also still honest in the corner after the game.
Instead of bringing them together before the rest of the team, he was able to wake them up.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at the post-mortem press conference.
Reporter 49ers, Cam Inman, reported that Hayne also got a promotion from a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the mistake and only looked at another game.
During the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings Jerry Hayne made his mistake.
It certainly wasn't the start in which Hayne and his massive Australian fan club trusted his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught when he left the field after a mistake and later told the Australian radioman Hamish & Andy at 2DayFM 104.1 worse start of the career in the NFL than he could ever imagine.
"It's happening, just focus on the next game and that's all," said Hayne
Hayne compared the trap to its initial start in 2007, when the deposit in its own branch area led to three Queensland.
It was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne published a photo of the fans on which she holds an Australian train game on her own Instagram.
Elton John and Rus Vladimír Putin meet in discussions on homosexual rights
In 2003 the richest man of Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested by armed men at the Siberian border.
After having openly questioned President Vladimir Putina, Khodorkovsky was sentenced, his theft company Yukos was confiscated and his democratic efforts limited.
The U.S. has become immigrants who have settled their property's rewards.
Two immigrated in 1984 and their property gained a new owner.
In 1989 it was no longer possible for the owner to return, so the couple turned to the state of the application for damage under the laws on ammosudite rehabilitation.
The Court first added the required amount, thus over 2.8 million kroner, the appeal court, but their fines changed so that only a few 90,000 kroner had been admitted to them with a view to determining the higher refund in accordance with the 1991 price rules.
The Emigrants were brought before the Supreme Court, and they were initially charged with a complaint.
The Ministry of Finance, who was to pay the money, turned to the U.S.
In the meantime, such changes in social and economic measures have resulted in the award of the remuneration granted under the then applicable legal provisions - in order to represent the compensation adequate for the loss of property - today only half of the value of property.
"This cannot go to the ranks of other participants in the rehabilitation of entitled persons who have acquired their rights since 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to provide compensation in advance," the judge explained to the reporter Jaroslav Fenyk why the U.S. placed himself on the side of migrants.
"The Commission has repeatedly expressed its intention that the general courts should act in the matters of refund in such a way as to avoid any inconsistencies in the beneficiaries and to always achieve the purpose of the responsibilities, so that the opening of the assets of the former state of totalitarian action would be possible," the judge added.
Evita in the music studio DVA is now created by the Council of Fisher.
The Council of Fisher became the world’s youngest Evito when, in 1998, the role of the wife of the Argentine dictator Ev Perón was confirmed by the first Czech introduction of this famous music by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice in the Prague Theatre of Spiral.
To return to the same role, he says, "To date, Evity's commitment has not been very equal."
Avoiding it is not only a wonderful role, it is also a responsibility.
As the first lady of Argentina recommended Monica Absolon.
I saw Monc in Evita three times, and it was definitely inspiring for me.
I've seen a whole new drink right now.
I'm a recipient of more modern corrections, but this is just what is said.
"Rejée Ondreje Sokola is original, distant and contemporary," Fishar observes.
For the thought of the musical ring between the two musicians, it will be held at the Narozin's Monika Absolon's concert on September 27, 19 hours from the studio DVA.
Tonight, they're making the recordings from Evita's music.
The experience will certainly belong to the common Duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina.
In a limited number of representations, Ondréj Sokol also withdraws from the government library when he represents Karl Rodena as President of Peru.
For the sake of public interest, further deadlines were added until May 2016.
The fifth Czech study of world music Evita introduces the studio DVA in collaboration with The Real Useful Group Ltd.
London has been successful since February 2015.
In the state of Ondreje Sokola, the primary role of women was originally taught by Monika Absolon.
On her side, Karel Roden appears as president of Perón and as Che Peter Strenačik.
A legendary song from Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Czech texts by Michael Prostéjövské sings a live orchestra under the direction of Krystof Mark, who has already participated in the first mention in the Spiral Theatre.
4 people killed after the police shot rubber projects at demonstration in Nepal
Four people, including four-year-old boys, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot the rubber projects to give the protesters the proposal of a new state constitution, he pointed out in the middle of the official.
The attack occurred on Tuesday night in the 4th of Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of the capital of Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a leading district officer, claims that more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the police station, and some threw stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal says that the police used heavy rain and then fired into the air before moving to rubber projects.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he says.
It was not immediately clear why rubber projects, known for their ability to kill, were traditionally used as less deadly alternatives, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
This strike was the last week of violent demonstrations throughout the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhes ethnic groups say that they have created a new province under the proposed new constitution and have reduced their political influence.
Further demonstrations in Western Nepal were also recorded by the Tharus ethnic group, which requires the rise of its own state.
Since 10 August at least 40 people, including 11 police, have been killed during violent attacks.
when four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into the province — a great step toward the new constitution, but a very controversial question in Nepal, which was centrally directed throughout the year.
The work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but the lawmakers have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in depth.
The lawmakers in Kathmandu voted this week on the proposal for a Constitution and the officials state that a new Charter should be adopted on Sunday.
We can't panic right now.
After the fall on the ice of the mysterious Lithuania, you didn't even have a home duel with hockey Sparty (3:5).
Don't you have any concerns about the same catastrophic entry into extragliding as the previous year?
I hope there's nothing like it.
Congratulations, Folk.
NHC predicts a 60% probability of a cycle south of the Cape Verde Islands
The large low-speed system of approximately 350 miles (560 km) south of the most southern Cape Verde islands is likely to have 60 per cent in the wake of a tropical cycle in the next 48 hours, leading to the southern American National Hurican Centre.
Another well-defined low-cool system between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilami also has a 60-percent probability of tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, adding a weather forecast to Miami.
Google has launched a campaign with the aim of choosing 11 million dollars for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) stated that it will launch a campaign aimed at selecting 11 million dollars for humanitarian organisations to help thousands of refugees who have fled the European states during the war of lost and poor countries. Each selected amount of Google doubles.
Google announced this on his blog a very unusual road.
The report on her blog was published by employees Googlu Rita Masoudov on the basis of personal experience when she lost her family from Kabul for seven years.
"We have enjoyed many dark trains and buses and have experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear," said Masoudov.
I was lucky.
But the growing immigrant crisis in Europe is still more and more a family than that, it is a voluntary aid.
All contributions will be divided between 4 non-profit organisations assisting refugees and immigrants: Doctors with no borders, International Committee for the Protection of Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google indicated that all contributions made through the google.com/refugeelief page to more than $5.5 million doubled.
Europe is headed by the largest refugees from the Second World War, most of which come from Syria with a four-year-old war that has escaped to 4 million people this year.
Many people are also fleeing the war of Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya.

For mild obsessive diabetes, it could be beneficial surgery of loss.
The results of loss of surgery for mild obese people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years, according to the new study.
However, it is still too early to say whether mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after surgery than those with non-surgery treatment.
"The data on deaths last a long time," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obstetriculation surgery, who wrote the introduction to the new JAMA surgery studio.
Injury surgery, barbaric surgery is used to reduce anxiety by different methods.
The reduction of hunger and the restriction of the human body to absorb food.
In the course of years, baric surgery has been shown to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in subjects with a morbid weight index (BMI) of 25 or more.
BMI, which measures the weighted weight ratio, is considered normal in values between 18.5 and 24.9.
BMI values 25 or higher indicate the pressure of persons and persons with a value above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from the General Min-Sheng Hospital in Tchaj-wana have used data collected from a study since 2007, which includes two types of barbaric surgery - breast-feeding bypass and gastrointestinal disorders - in treatment procedures of type 3 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The average BMI among those involved in operations was 31 to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year, according to the study.
In the meantime, BMI remained for those who had not been given surgery for diabetes, an error of the same value as 29.
In patients with surgery, diabetes was resolved in total by 36 percent and in part by 28 cases.
In the treated group, only 1 percent of diabetes was resolved completely and partly only about 2 percent of patients were treated.
Also, control of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol was shown "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
Researchers have also monitored patients at A1c haemoglobin levels in the blood, which reflects the passing amount of blood sugar in the body.
Haemoglobin A1c is the best to keep below 7%, researchers say.
After surgery, the average haemoglobin of A1c is approximately 9 per cent to 6 per cent.
However, this value remained approximately 8 per cent in the treated group.
But this better "glycemic control" - which is reflected in better levels of A1c haemoglobin - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the group lost more weight bypass compared to the gastrictomy group (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), increased BMI decreases (7.4 versus 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% versus 2.1%) and increased the risk of diabetes remission (46.9% versus 16.7%).
While the new study does not show improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of stronger people in Sweden where they found that surgery leads to a prolongation of life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to the Swedish study, obese people who had been subjected to barbaric surgery, about 29 percent more likely to survive in the next 15 years, compared with a group that has tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show improvement in survival among patients after surgery, Blackstone said it was a comforting result for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in this procedure.
"Right here this work is critical because it states that surgery is safer in a group with lower BMI," he says without raising the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone also claims that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously after the BMI decline between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long for people to pay attention to the situation," she says.
I think that once these genetic changes are collected, which are firmly proposed by their bodies with fat and sugar, the road back is really hard.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is not able to address all obstacles, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current emergency crisis lies in the near future.
The Tibetan leader of Buddhists called for the end of violence in domestic countries.
He was far away asking the question of a sudden crisis in his exhibition when he opened the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is responsible for studying ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Great Britain.
He claimed that, under the present circumstances, the interests of the people should be maintained before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, whether it was already surprising, was inadequate in the aftermath of the crisis.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his own words.
Although Dalai Lama commended Germany and Rakouska for their efforts in resolving the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Earth with a few thousand refugees is beautiful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he emphasized.
Finally, we have to think about how to reduce the killings in their countries.
We have to limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In resolving the question of violence, Dalai Lama also expressed complaints to George Bush after a 9/11 terrorist attack and claims that "the violent reaction of the United States has created a network of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my sincere concern in writing to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent road.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and created unexpected consequences," he said.
Four-year increase in the number of children living in the last 4 years
The toxicological environment across the United States reported an almost 400-percent increase from 2010 in the number of children up to 12 years of age who had been high-alcoholic sanitary factors, according to the toxicological environment in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylorda Lopeze, director of the Gruzia toxicological environment, the number of sanitary facilities in children aged 12 who were reported to the food control centre increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are getting more often to these products, and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who have to be taken into custody," said Lopez CNN.
Some children drink sanitary media deliberately, while others want to make an impression on their friends or as a challenge to social media.
The videos on Youtube show nuctylates as they drink sanitary means because of the left-wing habit.
The nocturnals were apparently laughing at the sanitary environment with oral water containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Young children can be attracted by attractive noise.
"Children don't think about hurting them," Lopez said.
A number of more attractive (sanitatic) means are those that are parfemized.
There are sanitary facilities with the outer ear of eggs, grepus or measles, which are very nice for children.
The sanitary measure contains between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol.
Especially in young children, several places can mean alcohol consumption.
"It's a highly concentrated alcohol," said Fox 4 in Kansas City's medical director at the University of Kansas Hospital Dr. Stephen Thornton.
You wouldn't just let the whiskeys go like this, but people leave these sanitary facilities out and if they get children, it's a quick way to consume alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently woke up at school to four blocks of sanitary work with an outer iron and was taken for treatment for preparing.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is a double standard value considered to be an adult pregnancy, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who looked at her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah expressed an unprovoked word and was not able to walk after what she had experienced in preparation.
Doctors monitored her through the night in a private child hospital for any signs of brain trauma, because the girl fell into alcohol and broke her head, says Ritchey.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, the mother of Nhaijah.
It could be fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or arrange for the child’s access to sanitation.
Despite the use of alcohol, some sanitary agents have been linked to death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after a sanitary operation containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
The physicians thought that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, more than ethanol, which was indicated as an active substance.
In January, three students of the fourth anniversary in northern New York planned to expel their "bad teachers" by placing antibacterial products in the room," according to a police report.
The teacher was very allergic to sanitation and banned their presence in the room.
The police have condemned the measured plan as "infinite pressure," and refer to the discipline of the fourth school,
Fáma: No disagreement in the Celtic team
Griffiths is babate about disagreement in Celtic, while Deila assumes that Hoops are in the wrong place, but he'll turn it over again.
Hearts will fight SFA against an attack on Nelson and Warburton is worried that the new ice force is breaking a team.
Dons raise their nest above the Celtic by 5 points
Penalta from the first half of ADAMA Rooney’s administration has provided Aberdeen with a solid victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, thanks to the Dons' five-way battle between himself and the Celtic.
Griffiths argues about disagreement
This situation has created a pattern of disagreement in Celtic, which has been overcome by Griffiths, who maintains that he and his colleagues do not work under any pressure from increased control in preparations for the competition with the Dutch League leaders.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think it's a pleasure to play it.
The lack of the Scottish title rival offers the Netherlands - de Boer
Former co-rapporteur Rangers and former representative of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer claims that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no rivalry between them because of the title.
De Boer, who is currently a spokesman for Ajaxu, says: "In the Netherlands they no longer show it the best of Celtic sports, and why?"
Because there's no Rangers anymore.
Today's people don't just talk about Rangers' return.
He's talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about two teams together, and they're just interested in it.
The old companies have a lot of excitement and not only people from Scotland follow these games.
I'm turning things back to good, Deila's getting engaged.
ROONY Delia admitted that Celtic was a little confused, but the Norwegian chief insisted that things turn back to good.
The Malem strike and the subsequent fall from the League of Masters was quickly followed by the strike against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now relates to the top of the five-square-square table.
But Deila says, "Celtic has already lived a bad time and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of it as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad about what they're doing.
We're all the same, but we have to go on.
Really, we really need Celtic's support because it's a lot better to play with her.
Now it's very important to stay with you.
Warburton's worried about ice power.
Despite the comments made a few weeks ago and pointed out that he had already identified some of his ice targets, Chief Rangers Mark Warburton is concerned about the big purchase of power and insists that he doesn't want to break a team from Ibrox.
Former President Brentford says, "The summer break window is very different from that of the year."
Players who arrive in summer have the entire pre-session period for killing, which you could see on our own team this season.
That's really good.
Sometimes it will cause more harm by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
The transitional objective of Celltic Michu means income to the pension
Lieutenant Swansey Michu, who was connected to Celtic in a step-by-step window, indicated that he could go to bed after breaking his contract with Swansea.
A 20-year-old shooter has been having trouble with an ambulance for two years and couldn't find a way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight SFA for comments against Nelson
Hearts led 2-1, when Patterson was sent to the castle and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card on this envelope was later deleted - one about the third red card issued by the decision-makers Collum, who was called.
Nelson stands for his claim and says, "I have no doubt integrity, I have not commented on the performance."
Griffiths committed to avoiding Tynecastle
The stubborn Hibbe was strongly shown after acknowledging that he sang a song with the text intended for former player Hearts Rudolph Skácel.
The incident took place in the Roserburn area in Edinburgh before the Edinburgh Desert in Tynecastle in March 2014
"It was a waste and it was a terrible moment," the attacker pointed out and went on, "I can say I can't go back to Tennessee unless it's in Celtic's dress."
The Council in Tannadic believes in Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that Council Dundee United still believes in the situation in the current management of the team - but he will admit that the crash on the hill must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We're preparing the boys for action again," Donnelly promises.
McCinnes likes to be "sustained victory" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes acknowledges that his Aberdeen team had to hope to stand against Hamilton Aces so that they could gain seven league victories after themselves and a five-year victory before the Celtic at the top of the table thanks to the first half of Adam Rooney's award.
McInnes says, "There's no one who's won anything, no fires or leagues, no one's gonna win this kind of game."
Scotland's unemployment remains unchanged, while the total unemployment of the UK stands
IN Scotland, there are no changes to the number of 164,000 in the period between the flowers and the wheat, while the total number of unemployed in the UK rose from 10 000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The unemployment rate was 5.9 per cent higher in the UK (5.5 per cent), as data from the National Statistics Office (ONS) showed.
During the period of three months employment in Scotland, the number of workers has now stopped at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell by 74.0 per cent during the quarter - which is the figure above the British average of 73.5 per cent.
The State Secretary of Scotland, David Mundell, commented on the latest data: "The long-term government plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost the exact year in which Scotland made the historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we were witnesses of further improvement in the labour market and the cost of growth while unemployment was declining.
Why I Was a Witness to Reform in Oklahoma
Later today, despite the late legal intervention, I will follow the murder of a man.
If that happens, and I hope it won't happen, I'll sit in a gallery watching the death chamber of the Oklahoma State Prison and see Richard Glossip, who's going to fix the death injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officers who would testify to his death.
I first received a call in January through my best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approaches, I'm beginning to fear it.
Then why do I do it?
I've accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to follow the reforms in America and because it is often more demanding than free places, a mobile lottery is being held that determines who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of places for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever will be chosen will follow the whole correction unhindered.
I can't do that.
I'll sit next to my closest friend Richard Glossip and I've made a special visit to him over a month of phone calls and two and a half hours of visits.
I like that boy.
We often laugh when we talk together.
The federal administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at all, so I won't have a note block and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'll have to remember all the details soon.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my neutrality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the defendant as soon as it's agreed, get access.
I've been in trouble with her.
She admitted that "it could be better," but she still thinks that what I do is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could ever remove me from the witness list.
But he wants an international journalist who will be ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help his actions against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, journalist from Huffington Post, will be on my side.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I have created.
I won't repeat all the details here again.
I can't be sure Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder would make him guilty of a crime agreement.
But I believe there's a great possibility that he's innocent of murder.
I firmly believe that sufficient evidence has not been provided to justify the death penalty.
According to my opinion, correction is wrong.
And from this perspective, I'm going to follow his death.
I can't say I'm really objective.
You can turn to other journalists for this purpose.
What you'll get from me is the experience of seeing the person I love to die of a fatal death.
The man left the Canning River after the police chase
The Canning Vale guard stayed dry after he released the man from the Canning River.
The man from Petrhu, who ran the police, didn't leave after he got into a small pool of water just meters away from the police who tried to force him to talk back to the shore.
The police from Canning Vale were summoned during an incident moving to Beckenham on Tuesday.
When he saw the suspect, he tried to rescue them by himself across the Canning River.
But it's gone too far.
"He stood in the water and repeated 'I'm not going out, just come for me'," said Sergeant Shandl Castledine.
Sergeant Lachlan Perahtec just didn't want to pay for the uniform, so he tried to use a safer tactic and that's the police escort."
"People sometimes try to do things when they're running out of toys," said Castledine.
The football champion Ben Cousins gives a memorable example.
In 2006 Cousins drove the car to the airport to avoid the bus and tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were futile, but he inspired the locals to begin planning the battle of Ben Coins.
Peter Moody claims that his editors tried to spy on him and threatened to finish the race
Peter Moody accused the editor of Racing Victoria of trying to get him a spy and threatened that he was going to end the race immediately.
He focused on the organizers and department of the integrity of Racing Victoria and was convinced that he had a personal campaign against Lady Tatai's back-up on the day of the race, which was the last captain for him in the middle.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for the race and got into a difficult situation when it came to Lidarin's positive game on a cobalt that he couldn't explain.
He went to the language about the Spanish charge for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "shut-susten."
"I didn't want to say anything about that I've been sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it's going to come out of you all at once," said Moody.
He knows it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'm going home today and I'll sleep well.
I want to go up to the top and make the owners think I'm doing the maximum for them.
When I start thinking again, I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I should consider what I'm going to do with my license.
Earlier Moody released in his conversation for racing.com a bomb that the integrity of the department tried to spy on him.
"Fifty months ago Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will call on the question - and offered him employment in my states to find information about things that are happening in my states," Moody said on Racing.com.
Of course they thought I was a fraud.
If that's true, everyone should show their information, because they're trying to catch me just burned me.
Robert Roulston, former president of RVL, David Moodie, current president of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current director general of RVL, were aware of it at that time and are aware of it today.
Should I think it's becoming a personal matter?
Does RVL grow a couple of balls and arrange for people to take responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
Am I wrong about this industry?
Am I really so bad for this industry?
Maybe people think they do.
Maybe I need to get my license and get me out of here, and I have no doubt that what I'm telling them now will give them an idea.
But I got to the point when I don't care about it anymore, and I'm sad about it.
It really bothered me.
I'll press on them, and I'll get them to make decisions.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The cold frustration of the trainer has increased with a long-term study of cobalt, including Lidari, and recent theft in him has aroused the feeling that "he could have his license on the table."
Mood, the most famous for the preparation of the undisputed Black Caviar champion, marked the rules of healing on the day of the race for "murder" after the horse was applied to the legs by an empty frame or blue, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
Someone in my team made a mistake on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it could've happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody has been subjected to three-month disqualification for the treatment of expenses on the day of the race for which the editors have already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Cobram's driver who was arrested was arrested
The police arrested the men who broke the cycle in Cobra on the weekend and took off after the train.
Cyclist was transported by plane to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after the car was loaded on Murray Valley main train on Saturday morning.
The police indicated that the engine was off without stopping and helping the wounded driver.
On Monday, a 17-year-old man from Nathalia introduced himself to the police in Shepparton.
It is expected that it will be accused of stopping in the event of an accident, of not providing assistance and other transport operations.
Cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobra, stays in a stable hospital.
Trainer Melbourne Storm Craig Bellamy returns the authority of the rivals because of the resurrection claim
Craig Bellamy, coach Melbourne Storm, criticised the steps of his players as "setting a plan" by two NRL lovers primership.
Trent Robinson, coach Sydney Rousters, said that the decision-makers allowed Storm players to "wrestle" his player during the controversial victory of the Storm team in the final qualification in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, trainer Brisbane Broncos, made a quick note on Strom after his team won final qualification over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening, when he called the game "visit" rugby league and said that two of Queensland's guys weren't "too big" on the resurrection.
Bellamy defended the steps of his players and said they were focusing on "Contact."
Bellamy added that this situation increased his awareness because he was criticized by his team by two leading trainers, which could mean that they were afraid of beating the Storm team.
"It's still coming--I don't remember Trent Robinson would talk about the resurrection when we were wounded 24-2," said in the middle of Bellamy.
I can assure you that we haven't changed anything from our defensive system and technology in the last year, we've only been looking forward to contact in the last few weeks, and that's what it meant for us.
Trent's been here for three years and obviously training a great team, so it's probably not normal to lose, which could have been a little shock for him.
It's funny how things always come in this part of the year.
Bellamy rejected Bennet's idea of "screaming football" and reminded his mentor that Bennet's team, St George-Illawarra Dragons, won in 2010 primership playing "sound" football.
Wayne's talking about the rising football.
He was right that his Saturday game was just as exciting as ours. It was also exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized for being a nude team and Wayne then said it was totally one of his.
But now he's got a team that can play the style of games that seems to him down, especially his young sponsors with their speed.
You'd like to play such a football if you had this type of player available.
This opinion said in 2010 and now he wants all teams to play his football-style -- but not every team has two sponsors like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It makes me more aware of this because they say such things because they're worried about the threat against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they got to big games.
Bellamy also showed the fact that Storm and Roosters fell more than Broncos and Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos team was probably good, I didn't see it, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two other attempts, but is it an exciting football?
Or are the obstacles and the lack of effort interesting?
I think they're agents.
If they call us, it means we'll meet again at a certain stage.
The storm has a stop this weekend and won the right to host either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronilla Sharks in the spring of the next Saturday evening in AAMI Park. The tickets will be on sale from the morning of the next day.
The Serbian man received a fine of $200,000 for drug charges
The man who led a possible life of 40 kilograms of cocaine that had been dumped from Queensland received a $200,000 ransom.
Marco Maximovic (29 years old) was one of five men who arrested the federal police last month for 100 kilograms of drugs from the Solay yacht, which came from South America through Vanuatu and in August in Coomer.
Maximovic was watched when he met a fellow accused in the facility during the afternoon and later met with them at the Coomer Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Although he was referring to the potential issue of cocaine quality, Justice Maximovice argued that there was no evidence that he would own the entire quantity and that he could be in the cacao completely innocent and innocent.
The judge of the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, thought that Maximovic would overrun it.
He's got a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in the middle of the court.
At the funeral, the police lied about where he lived.
The mother and her own father Maximovice together offered a cash of $200,000 for his release.
"After reading the mandatory statements, it is clear that the deposit of $200,000 is actually a financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
Their efforts were apparently insufficient because the accused had not been brought to court, he had warned.
Maximovic was sentenced to imprisonment on condition that he was released from both Australian and Serbian passports, will report to the police every day and will keep the order of departure from 18 hours to 6 o'clock in the morning.
Stefan Hogg used the phone for girls to find pedophiles to promote pictures
Pedofil used a single girl's phone to get pictures of child abuse.
Stefan Hogg took a girl's phone when she was asleep and then logged in to her online chat, where he had a lot of disobedient pictures of kids that sent him to another user.
The girl read it and found out she missed her phone and then found it in the hands of Hogga.
She passed it and before she warned her mother, she found disturbing news.
The police joined up and saw five photos, then the analytical computers found an address and found a "deterred" search on the web using expressions to search for inappropriate images of children.
Hogg then told the police that his reason was to "get pedophiles" on the Internet before he "showed that he was a police officer and scared them."
Fiscal representative Elidhi Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it's dependent - it's dependent on people's fear.
He admitted that the computer search was carried out, but he claims he wanted to pretend he was a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent pictures to him and why he wanted to send another one.
According to him, he did it to find her.
He claims he's gone through the hole and said he wants to see images of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When the girl found a message on her phone, she called her mother, cried and cried.
She saw the wrong picture on her phone and the suspect was later confronted.
The girl was listening and talking about how the suspect used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who seemed much younger than him.
Hog, 23, living in Ward Road, Dundee, admitted guilty of making a complaint about the adoption or supply of inappropriate images of children on 14 June last year, broke the conditions of imprisonment on 25 January and did not reach a hearing in court on 24 March of this year.
Lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed on the list of sexual delinquents, because he could argue that in his case there was "no basic sexual subtext."
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has handed down a ruling in favour of reporting social workers.
In this case, Hogg was sentenced to imprisonment, but he was detained before hearing of other outstanding cases.
He was placed on the list of sexual delinquents before the date of his trial.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe has made a bad impression in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the African oldest leader, had fallen on the stairs leading to the floor earlier this year.
He wasn't hurt, but his video of his fall became official in social media.
Parliament's opening was also prompted by the claims of opposition legislators that they had received an anonymity of killings which were warned against Mr. Mugabe's interrogation during his trial.
Last month, they published it and prosecuted it during its public speech on the status of the people in Parliament - which is what he said on Tuesday.
The president of the Hungarian Group for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition policies had adopted text messages on their mobile phones to warn against the appearance of Mr. Mugabe.
"The report comes from numbers that don't appear, but it's called "death," according to Mr. Mugabe's address to journalists.
It cautions the members concerned to know that immunity ends in Parliament and, as soon as it passes out of Parliament, their immunity does not work.
The chief said that the party that led Morgan Tsvangira has "observances" with regard to opposition to the Members.
Hewlett-Packard is trying to reduce the number of jobs to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard cancels 25 000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of its efforts to restructure and support the costs of business services.
This year, the HP company will be divided into two companies accountanted on the bridge and will divide the trade with computers and printers from its rapidly increasing business hardware and services operations.
The expected reduction in the number of jobs will result in a change in the amount of approximately $2.7 billion and will start in the fourth quarter, states the HP statement.
"This restructuring activity will allow us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable spending for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," says Meg Whitman, Director-General of HP and President of the Presidency, who will be in charge of the unit after division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less sophisticated and more sophisticated than today's HP and will have a wide-ranging portfolio of businesses that will help businesses switch to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the needs of our customers worldwide.
The Hewlett Parkard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of over $50 billion and "will be focused on providing non-competitive integrated technological solutions" to the company.
This leads to the dispersion of the company which was founded in 1930 by the Stanford Universitys Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, producing electrical equipment and their garage in Palo Alto was transformed into a "family of Silicon Valley."
The HP company has undergone massive reorganisation to manage the transfer from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This HP company, the second largest PC producer and one of the largest technical companies in America, is the most recent in this sector based on the conviction that the profits of a specialised company have better results.
Captain Arsenálu Mikel Arteta says the player must get injured by Jack Wilsher before Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also emphasized to Wilsher that he's still only sitting and, if his rehabilitation goes according to the plan, there's no reason he won't play again about the weddings.
This best scenario already means that Willshere will certainly mix up at least four other English games and, in the light of history, its involvement with the next annual European mission is obviously uncertain.
The great harm of this more urgent problem is that Wilsher has completed the last season of a strong post-cocket attack and then returned to the previous forms during the pre-trial.
"This kind of injury does not threaten career," Wenger says.
It's the wound that requires treatment.
It's not something special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his cats or the injuries he had suffered before.
This could be from a purely medical point of view of the truth because Wenger acknowledged that there is a relative danger of other injuries when any player returns during the season.
There is also an unacceptable pattern.
A study conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd notes 23 of Wilsher's injuries since he had his hero debut six years ago.
In the last five years, he has only played in 65 leagues of Arsenál from 157 total:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal this means that in the sixth and eighth sessions of 2007-08 he was one of the two Premier League clubs who lost most of the days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the preserved circle, but Arsenal believes that improvements in the area of recorded injuries will continue during the last season.
"When you return after injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win competition," says Wenger.
Jack's young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he'll have a career that he deserves.
Arsenal begins the campaign in Lize champions on the middle of the night against Dinamo Zagreb with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rob his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey had to travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to occur.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Oliver Giroud instead of Nacho Montreal Theo Waldo.
"I try to maintain balance and let players who need it breathe," Wenger says.
Although Arsenal is a clear favour to the F process, Maximir in Zagreb has a history of the most threatening stadium in Europe.
Dinamo was also not defeated in all 41 matches after having held the campaign of "unresponsible" in the past season.
In the middle of the night, the stadium ran out of 3.2 degrees Richter.
This year was set up in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks that Arsenal learned from the last season of the League of Champions when he capitalized against Monaco and remains his distant hope of bringing the club to the first victory in the European War.
"This discovery is huge," Wenger says.
Arsenal never happened.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand I must be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not artists.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us important lessons about male friendship
Absence of similar views in various shows is in the eye, especially given the need for men to open themselves more confidently than when it comes to suicide between young men up to 15 years of age.
In 2013, one of the biggest causes of death in men was 20-45 years old in Britain, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to solve this problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) marked 2015 as the Year of Males, whose aim is to distort the culture that prevents men from looking for help if needed.
In the heart of this struggle, there is friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2000 middle-school students showing signs of depression found that in case the injured person had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy care", their chances of being pregnant were doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not in depression, the bread of healthy friends offers half a chance to solve mental problems.
But for friendship to work, of course, it must be first reached.
In this communication through social media, based on style and not on content of communication, the immediate response is often prioritised before meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled our need to look stronger, more fun loving and more successful, even though we are actually more isolated.
This surface success is governed by what psychologists call external values; money, images, social status, all for our real values - our personal touch after growth and friendship - which have a profound impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire and her face recently explained, money really doesn't buy more happiness.
The beauty of the series of friends was the source of this idea for him.
No one in the building was defined as his work, but their personality, which was created through a friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victim, moments of watching football on comfortable crosswalks, Ross's touch after Rachel, all of the obstacles of knowing that yes, men can also complain about it, even though most of them leave their feelings for themselves.
As one Samaritan worker explained to me: "My role as a listening person who feels depressed or self-defense has truly proved to me that even the least friendly interactions can make a difference."
Men who contact us often feel unable to communicate with their friends.
The old saying, "Coping with this" is strong in the sense that it will be considered weak to open up problems.
Friends are one of the series that will appear to me when I try to offer a longer-term solution mechanism.
It highlights small moments of male friendship.
As far as my task is concerned, the position of the outsider on the phone helps people in moments of confidence, but long-term support must come from a closer relationship, from a network of friends and family.
If you are at the Comedy Central station this weekend, why not take your friends to the Central Park, where the interior will be fully re-processed for the occasion of the celebration.
Or when you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile at him and greet him.
You never know what a difference your friendship can make.
A series of friends will be sent to Comedy Central station from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria took care of and helped PSG move Malmo side
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matthew and Edinson Cavan after the fire of the factory against Malma.
Angel Di Maria took care of his debut in the Lize Misters and helped PSG win the Swedish team Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's a story about a game and a game reaction.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both cooked in the afternoon pool and Paris Saint-German began their journey to Lize Mister with a final comfort victory 2-0 against Malmo at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria shot the bank less than four minutes after his debut in Lize Mistrós, and this PSG player sent French champions for victory, but then several shots arrived, until they finally raised their nest when Cavani shot the bank head in 61 minutes.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, and therefore the Paris team needed a strong start against Swedish champions, because they are not only focusing on qualifying for racing cars, but on improving their road to the quarter-finals that were recorded in each of the previous three years.
But even though they got three points, it wasn't a classic performance for Laurent Blanca and Zlatan Ibrahimovic before the bank and was later challenged against his domestic team and club, in which he started his prestigious career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win out or home in the Mister League, so the 2-0 win makes our opponents trouble, and it's a good start, even though there's things we need to improve through the season," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I'm sorry we didn't shoot one or two more banks.
Ibrahimovic returned after injury as one of the three changes to the PSG team that held home this weekend in Bordeaux in Lize 1, but was suspended in the fourth minute by Di Mario.
The Argentine wing was marked as a man who moves PSG in Europe at a new level after crossing the Manchester United, which last month, and showed why when he got on Mark Verratti's passport for the defence of Malma and sent a sword behind Johann Wilden to a distant corner of the bank.
However, if anyone expected it to start with a great PSG victory, he had to be broken.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the play-off and reached this stage, has grown from 9 internationals in the basic set and five defenses and two undercover agents have been difficult opponents.
But in addition to the fires of Nikola Djurdjice, who just quietly passed the distance from Kevin Trappa's branch at 34 minutes, they did not offer it in the attack.
Instead, the PSG itself took advantage of the attack by bad games and bad endings, which were neither good nor of Ibrahimovic, which could not be fired five times in the first half, and was subsequently broken because his shot came to the network shortly after the beginning of the second half of Cavani.
However, he showed himself much more appropriate when he was preparing a chance for his co-player and that was just one of his toys when Di Maria sent a bullet that ended up in the Wilderman's branch in 52 minutes.
The second head finally came after the hour of the game thanks to Cavanum, this Uruguayec sent the head of the tea already the sixth head of this season after Ibrahimovic played him after the player from the left wing of Maxwell.
This ended all Malma's thoughts about the possibility of doing something out of the game, and only the sheer rush of Willa's approach measured the hope of David Luise, and the score remained unchanged and at the moment when the head of Ezequiela Lavezzi at the end of the game was not revealed.
Trainer of the Malmo Age Hareide team admitted later that PSG was on the top of his team, Nor said: "Our last game in the Lize Misters was held in December last year."
Since then, we've only played Swedish league, which is not at the same level.
Qualifications aren't enough.
The boat down for Paris.
For them, it was a catch.
Glencore made $2.5 billion for the sale of shares
The professional giant Glencore, with a seat in Switzerland, who was hit by the price of comedy, spent $2.5 billion on the sale of shares in the context of its extensive debt reduction plan.
The company Glencore claims in its statement that she sold a new stock at around £1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
This company, which has lost 57% of its market value this year, is affected by a decrease in the price of cod, as China’s economic downturn reduces demand and distorts certain market conditions.
The legal problem put Glencore's share price at the top of the London stock market in early morning trades.
The shares increased by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pens to the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 per cent above.
Glencore's company retired last week that the sale of shares at $2.5 billion is part of a wider plan to reduce their debt of $30 billion, which collected about a third.
The company sold a new share in the price of 123 pensions for the share, which meant a 2.4% discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
So 1.3 billion shares were saved at a total price of 9.99 per cent per group.
As regards the prolongation of Chinese growth, the price of iron and steel was almost reduced by 20 to 40 per cent.
The White House confirmed Washington visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping visited the United States at the end of the month, confirming the White House in his afternoon report.
The first visit of President Xi to Washington on 25 September in response to Barack Obama's visit to Beijing, where the president welcomed the November news.
The American president and first lady Michelle Obama invited President Xi and his wife to Peng Liyuan's dinner, which will be concluded after the talks.
"The visit of President Xi provides an opportunity to strengthen the relationship between the United States and China and provides for cooperation in solving problems in the fields of international, regional and common interests and is an opportunity for constructive debate on the differences between the two states," the report reports.
Xi, whose first visit was announced on the ground, should visit Seattle, where he meets with a number of US technical leaders on the way to Washington and will then proceed to New York to the UN summit.
Obama and Xi are expected to solve the problem of conflict, including Washington's concern about China's particular cyberspace and its growing aggression in the waters of the South Sea.
How the rupture crisis swept away the Schengen area.
The present lights fired by Germany far did not attract the European crew, but the ship is already moving to change the course, wrote French journalist Le Figaro.
The European Union decided on Monday to deal with the problem of droughts: it will be more systematic to train migrants and asylum seekers as it moves on an old continent, especially in Greece, than to fight for the future distribution of droughts by quota on the basis of the number that continues to grow.
Six days after the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker requested 25 of the 28 EU countries to allocate 160 000 refugees, ministers of the Member States changed their priorities.
Before looking forward to the final destination of the runners, it is important to filter those who are already arriving today and to resolve the fate of those who are already moving inside the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the external borders of the EU is necessary for the management of migration," emphasized in the text delivered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Brussels on Monday.
After the crisis, the EU finds that it is at risk in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its determination and increases pressure.
It restores border controls, especially with Rakouska, but without blocking the presence of those seeking asylum in this country.
The central power thus makes it clear that without it there is no free movement in Europe.
As evidence, Rakousko and Slovenia had already joined this measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France also consider this to be the case, even with different intensity.
Hungary's been doing this for a long time.
These exceptional and temporary measures are eligible under the Schengen rules.
That it's about the domain effect, but it's also blind.
The key question for Berlin and Paris is now effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already gone into the interior.
French Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière were actively discussing this during a private conversation with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is never new, but it's realized.
According to informal statistics, two-thirds of new incoming runners were already registered and identified with fingerprints.
Budapest refuses to introduce any entry point on its territory because they are more afraid that there will be no camps in which the refugees will be gathered on its account.
The actual black hole remains in Greece.
On its islands near the Turkish border, more than 200 thousand people arrived in the year, twice as many as in the last time to Italy.
Most of them are actual asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after passing over the camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge opening.
Athenians who are still in financial turmoil waiting for a new government have put their hands in their hands.
This is the eastern point for the Balkan road and the source of the current joint elders for the German Chancellor Angel Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
Mr Juncker's Commission promises that the control points will be introduced as soon as possible, but has not entered any numbers or dates.
"The challenges facing Greece relate to Europe as a whole," the EU Ministry of Foreign Affairs agreed on Monday to mobilize this front.
It is therefore a matter of placing the European Border Control Agency in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity for asylum seekers and strengthen surveillance over the islands.
"The need for adequate financial resources will be met," warns the text submitted to the Ministers for approval.
From the point of view of the law, they will continue to have the last word of Athens.
The question of the origin of real European border guards was not officially raised, but Europe is closer.
The new situation of eight-year-olds has thus referred to the second question of binding quotas and 160 000 refugees, which had already been brought up by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament, and which was strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Holland.
Hungary, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Poland still don't want to hear about it.
They consider it an attack on their integrity.
The number, but never the duty, was kept on Monday in the text approved by the majority of eight-year-olds.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is broken.
One firm promise includes the transfer of 40,000 refugees in the next two years, with agreements already reached in June during the EU's Heactic Summit, will be concluded by Le Figaro.
Seven dead under the valley in Alpach, of which, it is said, three Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among seven tourists who have killed avalanche in the French Alps.
According to the German authorities, she also survived as one of the eight surviving groups.
Previously on the media, we said it's about Poland.
About thirty-year-old women had serious foot injuries in the area of bone decay in the city of Briancon.
The dead were created by AFP mainly four-year-olds.
"The rescue action ended, the victim's body was also transferred to Briancon's identification," said the Prefect of the Hautes-Alpes Department Pierre Besnard.
The accident took place about noon in the mountainous area of Pelvoux under the top of the mountain Dôme de Neige des Ecrins, measuring 4015 metres.
"The huge whale was 250 metres wide and about a high meter," noted the rescuer chief Nicolas Colombani.
According to the eight - foot - high [3900 m] team, a huge amount of snow fell.
Meteorological service today was not protected in the area prior to the emergency.
In front of the record with Brago: Finally, Europe is right.
Coach Jindrích Trpišovský, in the fires of his prime minister, was able to pass through the former European League into the basic group and now he is glad that he and his team are enjoying the right of Europe.
Sloven at the beginning of the main stage of the competition welcomes the finalism of 2011 Bragu and, according to the look, wants to introduce its hernia style.
After all the nerves in the triggers, when every head and every situation could sort you out on your way to the right group, we're there now and we're going to play six games.
Of course, we want to win, but we don't have to be afraid of every hacked bank, we can play our tactics, and we're not bound by a single double.
"I am pleased with this and it is true Europe, before it was only a qualification," said Trpishovski at the press conference.
Brague thinks he's a top team.
It will be very active, they have the same Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at games.
The opponent may be even harder to have that name, but then in his career, he has a player who gave Manchester three balls.
"It's an excellent target at the top level of teams," said Trpishovski.
For a clear favor, but Brag doesn't consider it.
I'm taking it so we play home, so the outsiders are definitely not us.
"I think we were also at home competition and in the past showed that we were strong at our stadium, and we want to confirm that," said the guard whose team lost from the eleven times this season only the first Superpohhar in Plzni.
He believes that Liberec can also take Braze's style.
He's waiting for us, the team that's going to be strong on the fight, but he's not really disciplined for them.
They're playing 4-4-2 with a quick transition to the attack phase.
"It's a very difficult opponent, we've already discovered weaknesses, but most importantly it will be how our players will perform on the stage," said Trpishovski.
In the past, we have studied a lot of the competition, which has been very helpful to us, and this time we want to focus on our game, which we also adjusted training.
"And we definitely want, even though it's very convenient to play according to our notes," added the mouse.
The student films will be held by Pisek, which begins an international festival.
Over 350 authors from 51 countries reported their work this year to the 15th anniversary of the International Film Festival in Pisa.
Four tenths of them, which were commissioned by the Commission from students and pedagogists, will be delivered from 15 to 18 October in Portic.
The best of them chose an international jury, said the language festival Jacob Charvát.
Every year, she has her special theme, which is different from the festival bells.
This year, it's a detective.
The director of annual festivals Richard Blumenfeld plans to connect the elements of television, film and theatre.
"And of course we must also solve the crime that has been saved in our annual report," Charvát said.
Visitors will see the choice of the most interesting student creation - movies played, animated and documentary.
It will be appreciated by the International Court of Justice, which will include, for example, the winner of the last anniversary, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
The organizers of the festival each year prepare an informal program.
Comes to the Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, song Ondréj Ruml, professional player on Didgeridoo Ondréj Smyekal, turbosanson group Poltíme?, plays the hat Zrní or, for example, Petra Hapková with a relattal Life on the bar.
The festival will host two photo exhibitions.
The first introduction of a graduate of the Song Film School and holder of prestigious evaluations, including the World Press Photo 2014, Jan Ashenbrenner.
The second exhibition is near the atmosphere, which ran into Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
At the address of the visitors, cameraman and documentaryist Martin Čech, the film The Cameraman introduces his music to Gerhard Gruber and the song family Brukner, Novotný and Hlach at Jana Novotné's workshop, the new book covers 3 friends from the city of P.
This year we also remember Miroslav Ondříčka, master of FAMO in Píska, who recently left us.
Our school and festivals are his legacy, which will continue to live.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to be touched here, to exchange experiences and to develop joint ties and movies," said the speaker.
It will certainly help the Pitching Forum, where students can meet with film professionals, complete a number of work competitions together and gain such a job.
The festival is linked to the event of the Special High School of Films in the Book.
Her sponsors, Vladana's husband and Milon's Terč, organized the first anniversary in 1997.
He went to the sixth anniversary once in two years.
In the case of CK, they shall have the assurance to hold customer orders in full.
Insurances should rent customer orders in case of a travel office in full.
It decided in the middle of November when it adopted an amended new law on conditions of business in the road.
Travel agencies will be able, according to the proposals to be assessed at the Senate, to replace insurance against the accident of a bank guarantee.
Insurance shall not comply with the requirements of the customer orders and above the seating limit.
The Ministry for Local Development will continue to argue on consumer protection.
The insurance has already threatened that it will end the insurance of the travel offices against the ground when it is paid.
But the proposal also criticises travel offices.
Without insurance, they'll have to either end or go abroad.
The Ministry of Local Development Karl Šlechtová (for the UN) indicated that cases where insurance did not pay full compensation are not euro-compliant.
She drew attention to the annual decision of the Constitutional Court which confirmed that the customer has a right to full repayment of the money without prejudice to the limit of insurance.
The insurance will provide sufficient information on the management of travel offices and will be able to determine the correct limit, highlighted by Šlechto.
"We appreciate the efforts to increase consumer protection, but it must have such a limit in order to be realistic," said the president of TOP 09 Miroslav Godusek.
The bank guarantee will not work according to him, because no one will limit it.
"Cession offices will have to stop or move abroad," Godusek warned.
The President of the Association of Czech Travel Offices and Agency Tomio Okamura (SPD) did not agree on the basis of a study between the members of the CK.
"Stop presenting us lobbying insurance," he said.
The statement of assurance does not make Okamura relevant, none of its official written statements in this sense exist.
But they'll find out if the travel agencies are going to be involved, which, according to Okamura, is not a problem.
Before the establishment, Jana Fischer (ODS) was also protected, referring to the position of the Competition Association of the Czech Travel Offices, and her partner, Petr Bendl, who spoke about the removal of stocks by the Czech Travel Office.
Travel agencies according to the Fishery will not be able to sit.
"The protection of consumers works," Judge Fischer.
Her proposal to release the opposing passports was rejected.
He did not come to the House of Commons of Filip (KSCHM) with a proposal to return the proposal to the committee because of a particular dispute with the civil law.
Philip warned on travel agencies that consumers might be threatened by him.
The rapporteur, Mr Berdych's (ANO), on the basis of the Court's verdict, made his proposal to limit the liability of insurance in cases where they did not know that the insurance is not covered by the full risk.
In recent years, there will be no originally proposed minimum four-million limit of insurance for travel offices offering air transport services, and a million-limit for office sales of bus services, for example.
Limits will remain at 30 per cent of the planned markets for the sale of tickets.
However, it will have to be such that in the case of a travel agency, all customer orders will be covered.
The standard even after the adjustments provides that travel agencies will have to set up a new schedule for sales by the travel agency.
Travel agencies will have to be provided with insurance before the contract is concluded, except for other information on management and the number of departures.
The approved amendment proposal of the Committee for Public Administration shall also be calculated by means of other regular information.
Travel agencies will have to provide them with information on the number of travel and sales trips, the total price of the services sold, and the level of the warehouse and markets for travel and instruction on them each month.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds that the travel agency has failed to fulfil any of the legal obligations against insurance, it shall, on the proposal to fix it or be able to prohibit it from concluding a new contract if the breach of the obligation could endanger the interests of customers.
Newela also has to re-adjust the funding of mountain services.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of the mountain service grant on the basis of its request, which will always be given by the end of the year in depth for the next year.
The request will include a report on the use of state money in the past year, a financial plan of expenditure and a view for the next two years.
According to the association, the legislator, but did not think of the situation which would happen if the insurance would terminate the CK contract.
It will not be allowed to schedule and customers who bought the ticket before the insurance is committed will come to it according to the association.
In such a case, the CK will suffer a significant loss and may also decrease, although its management was in good condition.
One of the options for dealing with such a situation is that travel agencies will be subject to a state of reparation.
Another option will be to leave abroad and use many soft conditions abroad, and then we will only act as agencies, said the vice president of Jan Papež.
The new proposal also includes a bank guarantee institution, but it is not so deliberate that it cannot be implemented in practice, because the bank guarantee cannot seem to be an unlimited amount.
Furthermore, according to the association, the change in the availability practice of de facto is essential.
In the two-year horizon, the new EU directive will need to recast the whole law.
The Czech market now operates at least 942 active travel offices.
In the year, only three CKs were completed.
Turkish travel agencies sell annual earnings at the cost of twenty billion Kč.
Merkelov: We need to improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must be based on improving humanitarian conditions in vulnerable camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to prevent refugees from coming to Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after meeting with the German prime minister.
She also once again applied for the separation of refugees who have already arrived in the EU between the Member States of the eight-year period.
We need to help the country where the refugees leave, wherever they are left.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will be based on decent conditions in cross-border camps, such as Jordan and Lebanon, said the German Chancellor, according to which such a signal could be higher financial assistance or further EU cooperation with international humanitarian organisations.
"The common countries also support the German government in order to ensure fair distribution of the burden of the emergency crisis on the European country," Merkel added.
Land Prime Minister Braniborska Dietmar Woode, in this connection with the press conference, said he expects real solidarity from all EU states.
The distribution of EU runners on the basis of a long-term quota is rejected outside of the Czech Republic.
Merkel and Woidke have also spoken to speed up the asylum process in Germany.
People need to know first if they have the chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to start with the integration of foreigners as soon as possible, said the Branibor Prime Minister.
According to him, it is also necessary that the majority of the money that Germany spends in the care of the race should be used to integrate those who have the chance of getting asylum.
More teachers will be needed to control Germany.
It's a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if it's possible to integrate habits, they can be beneficial to us, he said.
Matt Damon's story about diversity and film
Matt Damon faced an afro-aesthetic filmmaker Effie Browna during a discussion on the difference with the claim that it was not necessary for the scene.
During the weekly HBO episode, the Greenlight project was interrupted by herec contained in Brown's series, highlighting the need for alternative views regarding the Black protagonists in the scenario.
"When we talk about the variety, you do it by filming and not by filming," says Damon.
She was shocked, and she reacted badly to Brown with disbelief and woke up saying, "Hoo! Wow. Okay, when the comments about Martín came to light.
Damon and Brown joined a known producer, Ben Affleck and Brother Farrelly, to discuss finalist shows.
"I'd like to appeal to people to think of being the director of anyone's behavior," Brown said at the beginning.
The only black character that's a scarf that hits a white dog.
Manufacturer of the Golden White People, finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio have been celebrating the right to film; Damon said that their regimes "would eventually give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was over, the social media exploded into discrepancies with Damon's comment.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his reference to the clip's writing, "Matt Damon jumped into the word of the only blackness in the room, so she can explain that it's so bad that it hurts."
Tweet got more than 5,000 tweets and 4,000 people from the moment he was released.
Damon's comment comes at a time when exact racial representation in the media is in front of the social debate.
After Michael Brown was killed by a leading white police officer in 2014, the Black Live Matter raided the national impact and pressed on the form of laws and authorities to maintain discriminatory practices against color people.
In the opening song Prince made his remarks on the strike, while he introduced the titled album category of the year during the award of the Grammy price.
"Or they're still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, they're still important.
The latest leading Black Live Matter presented a statement in response to the issue of Fox News personality, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"Black Live Matter Network is a group of love," declared the leaders.
Damon was recently reported on the list of prostitutes, producers and media of potentials who were invited to visit the pope to discuss the appearance of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or already met with the pope, it's not clear.
"American Ninja Warrior has first victory"
The professional watch and pickup Isaac Caldiero became the first competitor to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday and brought home a million dollars.
In the competition that just ended its seventh season, none of the competitors were able to overcome all obstacles on track.
During the final season of the year, two men fought in the last car, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last stop was 30 square feet [220 m] long.
Britten graduated from the prize as the first and this at the set limit and became the first competitor who in American Ninja Warrior defeated a 4-pound, but Caldiero defeated her for three seconds and won the contest.
Caldiero gave a speech for the pressE! News immediately after his heavy victory and it was known that he is still in shock at the prize of the main price of $1 million.
"It's a great feeling, I've never done more than $10,000 a year in my life," Isaac E! said in response to his victory.
"So suddenly... I can't even imagine what it will be like now."
The executive producer Kent Weed provided a discussion in The Hollywood Reporter on the course of the final and why Britten does not get any reward and despite the fact that he became the first competitor to finish the race.
According to the rules, the money belongs to someone who ends the race faster.
"If more competitors are involved, the reward will be the best time," Weed said.
Although the profit of the main prize would change his life, Britten is satisfied with his performance.
"I don't think he'd be acting like a bitch.
He's glad he's been able to get what he's got.
He's got a hot reception from the fans.
He's a great guy and he likes his family.
For their children and women, it's a hero."
Geoff said to me, "If someone should have been able to defeat me, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think if I win, Isaac would feel the same.
America Ninja Warrior will continue with the eight season, which will begin to take place in January 2016.
The tigers from Detroit just walked through Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS -- For the tigers from Detroit, there was no second half of the season just passing the rose garden.
Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, is now located in the last place of the Central Division of the American League.
Only the Tigers took their defeat when they defeated Minesso in the afternoon game with a solid score of 5-4 at the Target Field Stadium.
The two lost the chance to approach the Houston Astros team and catch another wild card in the American league.
Although only one night, for Detroit it was the return of words to Z, which was so uncomfortable for them during the second half of the season.
"To win them is always fun and it doesn't matter what way," Tygrós Brad Ausmus said.
The founder of the Tigers, Alfredo Simon, maintained his offensive attitude and Detroit healed three times in the first two changes and then took another in the sixth and ninth.
Simon (13-9) allowed resistance to 6 1/3 and 3 cycles.
It was his first third game of the last nine games.
"I want to end this year with convincing results," said Simon.
"It's hard to get into a game when you're often sitting on a bicycle and that's why I want to get to the game properly."
The Tigers' arrow Victor Martinez three times has made 2 cycles and his first score from half of August.
For Martinese, this was the first class match from the last red game in which the match was four times against Seattle Marines.
"It's a good fight," said Ausmus.
"He seemed good on the train, he dropped a lot better and he was able to move it to the back."
Thanks to three rounds at the end of the seven shifts, the Doubles won the greatest chance of returning to the game.
The middle polar Byron Buxton received a change thanks to two points on the left side of the garden.
Right polar Aaron Hicks got a point thanks to the set pallet and Simon pulled Brian Dozier before replacing Blaine Hardy's left.
Hardy ordered his only opponent Mauer and before him had a rival Miguel Sana, who fired the sword and spent two years behind him and left Drew VerHagen's rights behind him.
With two players on targets and chance on remix in the second change, VerHagen was able to send a third meter over two years.
Plouffe has already gained 27 times over two years in this season and reigns the league table.
Detroit supported the 9th shift, Mauer got two landing points and Bruce Rondon secured score 5-4 for Tygry.
However, this right has been set up by Sana on three occasions.
Detroit took advantage of the benefits and got points at Phil Hughes's game.
The Tigris obtained three courses in the first two changes against the applicable law, which occurred in the game after more than a month's break due to the failure of the required waves.
"I certainly didn't imagine such a start," said Hughes, "but during the third change, I've already felt that I can make myself better."
After he gave up his first shift, Hughes left one point to the second meter of Ian Kinsler.
Two exits for the real J.D. Martinese did Victor Martinez, who was the first one who spent all the years.
Victor Martinez broke his series 0-21.
Third metre Nick Castellanos followed him on the right side of the garden and took care of another area, but Victor Martinez was moved when he tried to reach the third stage.
The tigers added to the second change when their opponent James McCann and polar Anthony Gose got two and a single point and on the result table the score 3-0.
"It brought us to the knees," said manager Twočat Paul Molitor.
"The sword didn't work too well, but he got it in the right place."
Hughes, who won the number of tops, finished the third change without points and won the rights of A.J. Achter.
Hughes fled three years, got six shots and four shots.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the real tiger hunter, ended the game with the disease in the right arm.
Dr. James Andrews, who fought Sanchez's arm in 2007.
The Sanchez, which is on the list of wounds caused by swabs in half of August, should be placed in the middle arm.
Sancheze replaces Daniel Norris' left, who returns after his injury and acts against the Two.
From June 30th, when Norris was replaced as David Price's left-handed champion, he has score 1-1 to 4 matches.
However, since 20 August, he has not yet played because of a heavy blow.
Tigers and Bicycles play a third mutual game at the Target Field Stadium in the middle.
Against Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) the Minnesotsk left-handed Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.33 ERA).
Xi calls for opening the economy to a wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to a wider world for growth strengthening, said President Xi Jinping Group, whose task is to reform tomorrow.
"The China should be committed to raising foreign investment and expertise and improving open policies," said the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group for the extension of the overall reform.
The promotion of opening in the family reforms will provide a new impetus and vitality, which will also provide a new space for economic growth, Xi suggests.
The Steering Group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory access to the market, the release of border control policies, State support (SOE) to absorb private capital and reorganise the registration resident system.
The statement states that a negative list identifying sectors and businesses which are outside the investment thresholds will be drawn up.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through pilot programmes.
This step is important because the market will play a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensuring the legal business environment and making the market more open, a statement will be made.
The government will also exercise free control over the powers conferred on it by the firm and ensure that the companies themselves will decide how to manage their businesses.
It also states that China will be able to publish new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to support regional growth.
In an effort to open up the controlled sector, more areas will be opened by private investment.
"The government will not change its policy against foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services," the statement states.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a "green card", thanks to optimization of the requirements and simplification of the application process.
A meeting was also held to ensure the right of lawyers to practice and develop a professional judge and a national representative.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and senior representatives Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
In Karlovar's country, they may create a new lying department.
According to the town of Hajtman of the Karlovar region of Jakob Pánika (ČSSD), the current capacity of two national hospitals and two private hospitals in the country is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of the agreement between individual wards.
In the country, however, there are opportunities for extended care.
For example, in the surgical department, a single surgery centre could be established where, according to the proposed concept, performing surgery committees that do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours.
In which specific hospitals, the workplace should be focused on single surgery, which is not yet clear.
In the skin section of Karlovy Vary hospital, a laser centre could also be created with the possibility of using laser techniques for skin disease.
The concept also recommended the presence of the apallic centre, which would care for patients with brain failure who are in the vegetative condition.
Such a centre should be centrally established and should be an integral part of the anesthesiological and resuscitational division.
There is also the possibility of putting such equipment into an island hospital where similar care already exists.
Other bed capacity that appears to be insufficient in Karlovarsk region are the next bed of care and in particular the bed of long-term patients (LDN), whose capacity in Nejdku is insufficient and in particular should be referred to as the bed of care acute.
Part of this device should function as a rehabilitative layer and part as a classic LDN layer, recommended the concept.
As he warns, the bed of next care is missing mainly in Karlovy Vary's hospital.
There they would be able to use abandoned buildings after centralization.
In the last few years, in the country of Karlovar, the socially healthy leukemia has been absorbed by the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.
This bed is not available in the entire Republic, so it could serve for other countries as the so-called Alzheimer's.
Hospitals should also be prepared according to the recommendation for the introduction of so-called binding levies which will allow financial resources for European applications.
"It's about the bed that will be referred to as the arms of suspended care and will create a room for patients to be transferred after a course such as cardio-surgery, neurosurgery, transplantation or other step," describes the national concept of bed care.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
