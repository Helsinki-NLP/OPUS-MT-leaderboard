Is it more useful to eat?
Is it morally wrong to eat meat?
I see a house.

I see her two, three times a month.
I'll meet him then and then.
I see silver, but I don't see gold.
I understand Volapuk is a good language.
I see the crown.
I see the house.
I understand what the problem is.
I see Tom every day.
I'm looking at the documents.
I sent Tom home.

I doubt it very much.
I'll stay here longer.
Is he okay?
Is he a teacher?
What about him?
Is he coming home at 6:00?
Is he dead?
I broke my hand with Jane.
I should be done.
I should get some rest.

I'll go and lie down at ten o'clock.
I slept like a stock.
I slept very well.
I slept very well.
I'm hanging out with my nose.
I'm getting a lot of news.
Isn't that always so?
Or how's it going, Tom?

I added a moment this morning.
I'm reading Spanish.
I suggested that she be invited to the party.
I suggest we take it a little longer this time.

A good manipulator would be all right now.
I survived.
I swear I'll never talk to her again.

I swear I'd never talk to her again.
Is your wife still in America?

I'm very upset.
It can't be true.

It can't be that bad.
It cost me my ass.
It could be a weapon.
It could be fun.
It couldn't be anyone else than Tom.
It depends on the context.
It depends on the context.
It depends on the size of the chair.
It didn't make any sense to me.
It doesn't play any role in winning the game.
It doesn't have to mean you're right.
It doesn't count, it's snowing.
I'm not surprised.
It feels really good.
I thanked Tom for his help.
It happened a year ago.
It happened so quickly.
It happened so fast.
It happened that she took a bath.
It happens automatically.
We're going to have two copies of "The Rescuer in Need."
It's never snowed on the island.
It has not always been easy.
It's been snowing for two days.
It must be me.
It helps.
I think Tom and Mary are lying.
I think he's a good person.
I think his name is Tom.
I think I'm finally going to retire.
I don't think I could do what Tom does.

I think we're still in Poland!
I think we have enough money.
I think we're crazy.
I think we're on a trip.
I think we should do as Tom suggests, if no one else has a better proposal.

I think it's best you go.
I think you need to think about the future.
I think you're too careful.
I think you're too careful.
I think you don't understand.
I think you should come and stay with me.
Maybe you should tell Tom that you love him.
I thought about it.
I thought I lost you,
I thought I lost you.

I thought you went home.
I thought you went home.
I thought you were going home.
I thought you were different.
I thought you were in service.
I thought you were used to living in a car.
I threw it out.
It's a part of the world covered with ice.
In fact, the same thing can be said in Swedish.
It's some kind of cat.
It's always dark under oil lamp.
For her, it's an abuse.
It's an old script.
It is a shame that while there are countries where people suffer from hunger, in Japan there are many homes and restaurants where a lot of food is thrown away.
It's a social problem.
Of course it's possible if you want to.
It's hard to keep conversation with someone who just says yes and no.
It's hard to talk publicly.
It's awfully expensive.
It's fun playing baseball.
It's gonna snow.
It's hot today.
It's Monday today.
It's not a game.
It's not because I hate him, but because I love him.

There is no point in trying to solve this problem.
It doesn't have a string code.
It's not cheap.
It's not safe to drive a car without a seat.
It's not Tom's fault.
It's pretty cold.
She's probably coming.
It's raining.
It's rude to point people.
The clock is seven in London now.
It's calm before the storm.
It's their right to vote.
It's not sure if the letter ever came up or not.
I'm sorry, it's true.
I'm sorry, it's true.
That's what everyone says.
It's knocking on the door.
It's like smoking tobacco.
It's gotta rain.
It's gonna wait.
It'll take a few days to get in these shoes.
It looked cheap.
It looked fun.
It looks like a cactus.
It looks like an anchor.
Looks like Mary's full again.
It looks like Tom wants to buy everything from the store.
It looks like you've finally decided.
That made me very happy.
The important thing is, not how a man dies, but how he lives.
It can hurt.
It meant a lot to me.
It must be done immediately.
It must be scary.
I told you a joke.
I told Mom everything.
I was talking about everything for Mom.
I told them to send me another ticket.

I lied and got angry all night.
I can fully understand that.
I'm sorry to have to say this, but that's the truth.
It's probably not gonna be easy.
It was unreported so that the baseball match was put in.
I thought it was yesterday.
It's in Sweden.
I wrote over my husband's car.
I translated the pen as well as I could.
It didn't really affect us.
It really sucks in here.
It reminded me of you.
It takes wisdom to understand wisdom: music is nothing if the public is dead.
I really tried.
I tried to convince her.
I really doubt that.
I trust the teacher.
I'm never trying to eat after 8:00.
It's 99.9 percent effective.
It's a bad habit.

That's all we have.
It's almost impossible.
It's much more than that.

It's always worth a try.
It's an hour's walk to the station.
There's no harm that has nothing to do with it.

It's a problem.
She's all over nine.
It's a quarter in two.

It's overdue.
It's hard.
It's hard to get a job for the moment.
It's easier than it looks.
It's easy to forget that the microphone is on.
It's easy to make mistakes.
It looks like I've got an easy excuse.
It seems to take a lifetime and three days.
Everybody seems to like golf.
It looks like you taught you a lot.
It looks like if you learned a lot.
It's empty.
It's empty.

It's just a dream.
It's just a little bit of money.
It's made of skin.
It's Mary's turn to drive.
It looks like someone's smoking in here.
It smells salt and algae.
It's much simpler here.
It is much more unusual for a person to be politically conscious than to be politically active.
It's much more complicated than that.
It's my brother.
It's my CD.
That's my decision.
It's my horse.
It's my job.
It's my life!
It's my way of saying thank you.
It's normal.
It's common.
I don't care.
It's not an opportunity.
It's not a crime.
It's not a game.
It's not a joke.
It's not acute.
It's not a problem.
It's no joke!
It's not over yet.

It's not for you.
It's not for you.
It doesn't matter!
It doesn't matter!
It doesn't matter what I call it.
It's not just a pen.
It's not my choice.
This isn't my point of view, it's my translation!
It doesn't count, it's snowing.
There's no problem.
It's not that bad.
It's not as simple as I thought.
It's not there now.
It's not worth the trouble.
It's now or never.
Now or never.
It's okay.

It's counting today, where's my paraplel?
It's true.
It's really beautiful.
It's really not worth it.
It's safe to eat the fish.
That's true.
It's delicious.
It's crazy.
It's a second hand.
It's 7:00 p.m.
It's still counting.
It's weird.
That's what's in here.
It's gonna be colder and snowy later today.
It started a chain reaction.
That's the best we have.
That's the other one.
That's the right decision.
It's the same.

It's been a long time before the kids found Lisa.
It took a night and an hour.
It took a month for my apology to go over.
It took me half an hour to solve this problem.
It took them two years to build the house.
I shut it down.
I said no to Tom.
Actually, it was my fault.

It was a hot, gray Saturday at the end of June.
It was just a big lie.
It was almost 2:30 when Tom finally came home.
It was a mistake from their side.
It was a new book.
That was an unexplainable situation.

It was black.
It was crazy of him to try to swim in the scaly water.
It was a terrible weather.
It was easier to do than I had thought.
She was five when I went to bed.
At first, it was great.
It was hard for them to move to the island.
That was his decision.
It was his silence that made her angry.
It was impossible to find an answer.
It was impossible to find an answer.
It was just a tricky rehearsal.
It was just the beginning.
It was cold and nice, but now it's getting cold.
It was loud.
It wasn't until yesterday that I got the news.
It wasn't a competition.
It wasn't as easy as I thought it would be.
It wasn't me who started it.
It wasn't necessary for him to take a paraplel.
It wasn't with the will.

So sad it wasn't.
It didn't go.
It was one of my greatest adventures.
It was really fun.
It was round.
It was so tough that I was almost there.
It was so loud out there.
It was the window that Jack took a dog yesterday.
That was understandable.
It was very hard.
It was really fun.
That's what we did.
That was your choice.
That was your choice.
It will take three months for our new school building to be completed.
It came to mean a lot to the city.
It'll probably snow in the morning.
It'd be nice to sleep a minute first.
It would be more difficult to close the window when it's cold.
It would be nice if I could travel to Japan.
It'd be nice if you could come.
It would have been fun.
It wouldn't play any role, though.
It wouldn't make any difference.
I wouldn't be surprised if Tom and Mary were married.
It's been fun.
It would have been so simple.
I get it.
I get it.
