Wells Assembly members worried that "sees as stupid"
In the midst of some of the Assembly members, a concern has been expressed regarding the proposal for a change in their title in the MWP (Wells Parliamentary Members).
This has come as a stream of plans to change the name of the assembly in the "Wells Parliament".
Members of the Assembly from all political spheres are concerned that this may provoke laughter.
A member of the Laburist Party assembly said his group was concerned "that this rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wells: In Welsh, twp means "fool" and pwp means "anyone".
A member of the Welsh Party said that the whole group was "unsatisfied" and has proposed an alternative.
A Welsh conservator said his group was "major" related to the change in the name, but it expressed that there was little difference between the words "MWP" and "Budilla".
In this context, the pronunciation of "w" in Welsh is similar to that of "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation for the publication of the change in the name, said: "The final decision to appoint Assembly members will certainly depend on the members themselves."
The law of the Welsh Government of 2017 gave the Welsh assemblies the flag to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a consultation with the public, and the latest proposal for the Assembly's appointment as "Wells Parliament" found broad support.
With regard to the issue of the title of Assembly Members, the Commission favoured the designation "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WMP", but the alternative "MWP" found more support in a consultation with the public.
It seems that the Assembly members are suggesting alternative elections, but the struggle for reaching consensus can turn into confusion for Creator Eli Jones, who is expected to present legislation on changes within a few weeks.
The legislation on reform will include other changes in the way the Assembly works, including rules for the exclusion of Assembly members and the structure of the committee system.
During the discussion of the legislation, the final vote on the issue of their appointment will remain with the Assembly members.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on the change in the country's name.
On Sunday, voters will vote for the change in their country's name in the "Republic of northern Macedonia".
The vote by the people was put in an attempt to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long established that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim on its territory and has consistently opposed its demands for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opposition to the referendum on the change in the name, said he would not know the votes.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in name is simply the price to be paid for membership in the EU and NATO.
Saint Martin's bells fell silent while the churches in Harlem faced difficulties
"Historically, the elderly people I talked to said that he had a bar and a church in every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"They're both missing."
He said that the loss of colors is understandable.
"In today's world, people are socialized in other ways," he says.
"The bars are no longer the stage meeting, where people go regularly."
As far as the churches are concerned, he expresses concern that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders claim "and sooner or later they will return to the starting point."
He added that churches can be replaced by palaces full of people who will not rely on the holy lands that have remained in the camp.
"Most of the people who buy housing environments in these palaces are white," he said, "so soon the days will come when these have been closed once well, since it is the payment that most of the people who live in these houses are going to be members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem was converted into a color - colored metropolitan community in 1870, a decade later.
The original white methodical congregation was transferred in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was financed by a colorful congregation of people who had their place of worship there.
John Howard Johnson, who led a small business boy on the "125th" road, was crossing a color-based congregation in Harlem that refused to work or promote people with colors.
In 1939, the building was badly damaged by a fire, but after Father Johnson's famous plan was made for reconstruction, they recommended the carnage.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and the successor of Son Martin, called him the career with pride "the association of the poor."
The expert who played in the Korean career called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and a "historic historical non-replaceable instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also said that this was the first career in the world played by a color musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who was transferred to a major career in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin had not replaced him.
The events of the last months in St. Martin have been an interconnected remnant of contractors, some sent by church healers and others from Episcopal diocese.
The council - the governing body of the Famullis, part of the leather trade union -- wrote the diocese in July, concerned that she "will try to transfer the costs" to the council of the Famullis, although the latter was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some famulants complained about lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Fishing the wounds of 13th-year-olds during an appeal to catch caves in California
A fisherman has attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he's trying to catch caves in California, on the day of the opening season, officials say.
Sulmi took place just before 7:00 a.m., near Beacon's beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel is expressed for KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been hanging out with some friends for about half a hour in the morning when he had heard the boy crying for help, and then he had drove his way along with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel said he had initially thought that the boy was just exaggerated by the arrest of a mob, but then "I realized that he was shouting "I was mad!
I'm fucked up!"
Hammel says that when he got to the boy, he didn't know that his entire keyboard was empty.
"I cried to everyone who came out of the water, 'There's a fish in the water!' Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the "Rady's" children's hospital in San Diego, where he has been exposed to critical conditions.
The fish species responsible for the attack was unknown.
The captain of the coast guard Larry Giles said at a media conference that a fish was seen in the area a few weeks ago, but it was defined as a rare species of fish.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the body.
Officials stopped access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for investigation and security purposes.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of fish in the area, but most are considered to be rare.
Sainsbury's planning to enter the MB Cosmetic Market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with the cosmetics of the large store style, with a specialized sales staff.
Within the framework of a considerable effort to enter the MB cosmetic market of 2.8 billion pounds, which is continuing to grow while sales of fashion and household clothing are falling, the largest cosmetics will be tested in 11 shops around the country and will be expanded in more markets next year if they succeed.
Cosmetic investment comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the gaps of waste that are sometimes used for televisions, microwaves and household waste.
Sainsbury's is said to double his offer of cosmetic products to 3,000 products, including for the first time also such brands as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing lines from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be given more space, with areas dedicated to brands, similar to those in stores like Boots.
Also, the supermarket will re-market its Boutique cosmetic line, so that most of the products are of low proportions — something that is increasingly required by the newer buyers.
On the other hand, a retail trader "Fragrance Shop" will test concessions in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which has been opened last week in Croydon, south of London, while a second is expected to open later this year in Sally Oak, Birmingham.
Online blogs and a trend towards daily food-producing in small quantities in warehouse stores mean that supermarkets now need to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Sansbury, has said that the outlets will start to be more and more like big shops, while the supermarket network is trying to fight Aldi's and Lidl's prices oils with more services and military products.
Sainsbury has set out "Argos" outlets in hundreds of shops and has presented a series of "Habitats" that, after the discovery of two networks two years ago, it says, has promoted food sales and made them more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to restructure its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments resulted in failure.
Sansbury tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the union broke up after a debate on how to divide income from pharmaceuticals into its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes three years after Sainsbury sold his pharmaceutical business from 281 Celesio stores, the pharmaceutical network owner "Lloyds" for 125 million pounds.
He expressed that "Lloyds" would play a role in the plan, adding a wide range of luxury brands of leather care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of Sainsbury's business, said: "We have transformed the view of our cosmetic landscapes to improve the environment in favour of our customers.
We have also invested in a specialized staff, which will be ready to give advice.
The range of our brands is so designed to fit every need, and the environment of attracting and voluntary locations shows that we are now a cosmetic destination of honey, which makes a difference from the old way of making nuts."
Peter Jones "gandoured" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the 11 million-pound deal.
Dragons Den's star, Peter Jones, has gone "gandoured" since Holly Willoughby's television presentation has been withdrawn from an 11 million-pound deal with his business dedicated to a given lifestyle, to focus on her new contracts with "Marks and Spencer" and "ITV"
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of home halls and "Truly" accessories.
The business of these two was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old "This Morning" presenter was directed to Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has introduced the star of "Dragons Den", Peter Jones, after the recent withdrawal from their profit business dedicated a certain lifestyle - to focus on her new promising contracts with "Marks & Spencer" and "ITV".
The sources say Jones was "gandoured" when the gold girl and television agreed during a tenure meeting on Tuesday at his business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth up to 1.5 million pounds - meant that she did not have enough time to allocate their domestic currency and "Truly" accessories.
Business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's "Goop" brand and was predicted to double its estimated wealth of 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, was directed by the Instagram to release her departure from Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his rest homes.
A source is expressed: "Truly was a failure in the heads of Holly's priorities.
It would be her future long to be associated with for decades to come.
Her decision to withdraw all the persons involved is completely exaggerated.
No one could believe what was happening on Thursday, it was so close to the opening.
In the Marlow offices there is a store full of furniture that is ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter "This Morning", which is among the most successful British stars, may cost the company a million, due to considerable investment in products starting from the west and the north to the north and west, and causing further delays in its opening.
And this could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her partner, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly and Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined her director in March.
The couple spend their holidays together, and Jones has 40 percent of the shares in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is expected to be a M&S ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as a representative of "I'm A Celebrate" and TV.
Last night, a source near Jones was said, "We don't want to comment on his business issues."
A hard talk "and then we fell in love"
He made a joke about the criticisms that he would receive from the media because of his comment, which some would call him "it belongs to a president", and because of the positivity associated with North Korea's leader.
Why has President Trump been given so much?
Trump said by laughing at the voice of news reporters.
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting, after their first meeting in Singapore in June was welcomed by Trump as a major step toward the colonization of North Korea.
But the culinary negotiations have been interrupted.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore, North Korea's major diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, was directed to the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, saying that Norway sees no "recording response" from the United States to the first steps taken by North Korea to censorship.
Rather, he says, the US is continuing sanctions aimed at keeping under pressure.
Trump kept a much more optimistic view of his speech.
"We're getting better with North Korea," he said.
"We were fighting North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve Kim’s relationship have resulted in positive results - stopping the testing of rockets, helping release obstacles, and returning home to the rest of the U.S. soldiers.
In his speech concerning Kim’s relationships, he defended his undisclosed frustration.
"It's very easy to behave as President, but instead of having 10,000 of us out trying to get into this exhausted area, we would have about 200 ourselves standing there," Trump said, pointing towards the crowd in front of him.
The famine and earthquakes in Indonesia destroy an island, killing hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign disadvantaged organisations were told that their presence was not necessary.
Despite more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population's displacement, no national disaster has been reported, which is a prerequisite for the catalyticization of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they do not seek international support, so the issue is a little challenging," said Mr. Sumbong.
While "Save the Children" is building a team to travel to Palu, it still doesn't know for sure if a foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
Given the widespread earthquakes that afflict Indonesia, the country remains unprepared in the face of natural heat.
While buildings have been built in Aceh, it is difficult to escape in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of a siren for warning of pollution in Pala, despite having been released a warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of circumstances, travel between many Indonesian islands is difficult.
Natural weaknesses make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is traveling to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster zone.
President Joko Widodo used Indonesia's key infrastructure to improve its electoral campaign, and has invested a lot of raw money for roads and roads.
But the lack of funding has worried Mr. Joko's administration, as he faces new elections that will develop next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from continuing sectoral tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim community have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes after the deployment of Christian and Muslim groups on the streets, where they have been used as ammunition, rifles, and other deadly weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool marks a match against Chelsea in the last few minutes
Daniel Sturridge has saved Liverpool from a loss in Premier League against Chelsea, with a drop in the 89th minute in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge got a ride from Jordan Shaqiri at about 30 yards away from Chelsea's port, while his team was losing 1-0 result.
He put the ball on his left before he hit the other door.
Topi flew over the area until he turned right and above the network.
The summit saved the air raid on Cape Arrizabalga and ended up in the network.
"The sign was to put in the right position as it should be to get the ball and players like Shaq always play with the ball ahead, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," Sturridge said for LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I checked the ball with a touch, and I didn't think for a long time but just hit."
Chelsea was headed by the 1-0 result in the first part, after a drop in the 25th minute from the Belgian edden Hazard.
The Blue Sulmutor made a review of Matthew Kovacic during that game, before round the field and headed with sprint toward Liverpool’s half-face.
Kovacic made a quick combination in the middle.
Then he gave me a beautiful vertical rear that brought Hazard to the area.
Hazard passed the protection in a hurry, and with a left-hand hit, he noted in the second pillar, passing the ball behind Liverpool’s gates, Alison Becker.
Liverpool will meet Napoleon at the time of the Campus Law groups on Wednesday, 3 p.m., at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at the UEFA European Law Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of people who died from malnutrition in Indonesia goes to 832
The number of deaths from earthquakes and famine in Indonesia has increased in 832, a national disaster agency has been declared on Sunday’s first hours.
According to reports, many people have been blocked under the walls of exemplary buildings from the quake 7.5 balsam on Friday and caused waves up to 20 feet high, said the audience of Sutopo Purwo's agency at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000 inhabitants, has been established under the ruins of exemplary buildings.

Cromwell's statue in Parliament, the last memorial touched by the debate for "the description of history"
Her removal would be a deserved punishment for the destruction of many Talibans of England’s cultural and religious artifacts by its fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "recording" and "testing to record history".
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the midst of the current debate on the removal of the statue of Oliver Cromwell out of the Westminster Palace.
The icons of the English civil wars were neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Maybe this would be a Cromwell sacrifice that was wrong about his ancestors' actions in the past century.
The excellent portrait of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thornycroft is evidence of the 19th century's opinion and part of the history of a figure for which many think it deserves to be praised.
Mr. Goldsmith said about "The Sunday Telegraph": "Many people, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, saw Cromwell as a parliament defender from external pressure, which was certainly, in his case, monarchy.
The fact that this is a complete portrait is the object of ongoing historical debate.
What's safe is that the 17th century conflict has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known individual figure that represents a part of that medallion.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be honored and remembered."
Deadly Killer Killer Chinese Farmer
A farmer has been attacked and killed by a storm in a market in Southeast China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only with his nickname "Yuan", has been found armed with a black artery and covered in blood by a drop in the Liupanshiu market in Guizhou, reports South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A miner is ready to inject a waste vaccine at a stop on 30 May 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It is said that he had traveled with his cousin from the province of Yunnan on Wednesday, to sell 15 yards in the market.
On the other hand, his cousin found it empty and discovered the door of a hole near the open.
He said there was a big man in the chair with his mouth with blood.
A medical examination has confirmed that up to 550 pounds has damaged the farm for death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were tied and tied," said his cousin identified with the title "Wu," as quoted in the evening news in Guiyang.
In photos filmed by security cameras, Yuan is seen entering the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his doors.
His body was found about an hour later.
The beast that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager has reported on the night news that the thief had been kept in isolation to prevent another attack while the police collected evidence at the site.
According to reports, Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of people attacked by doors have been noted before.
In 2016 a storm attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the husband.
Ten years earlier, a rain of 650 pounds had brought a Welsh farmer after his tractor, until his wife had fired the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was cut off from his doors in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba expressed to CBC News that usually, the doors are not aggressive, but the joy of blood can act as "a rush".
"They just want to play.
They're like little kids you're wearing... their intention is not to hurt you.
You just have to show them proper respect," he said.
The effects of the Rosa Ugandans are expected to bring large increases with widespread spreads in the South of the United States
As foretold, the urganian’s power of Rosa is moving toward the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, over the next few days, Rosa will cause flooding in northern Mexico and in the southern United States.
On Sunday, on the 5th of the morning with sunrise, Rosa was accompanied by snow speeding 85 miles per hour, classified as Category 1, and was 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move to the North on Sunday.
Meanwhile, on the Pacific Ocean it is starting to form a low-pressure zone, which is moving towards the East, towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa is expected to draw closer to the Bay of California on Monday at the threshold of a tropical storm, it will continue to increase the large tropical gap towards her north, towards the south-western US.
Monday, Rosa will cause up to 10 inches in some parts of Mexico.
Then, the intervention of tropical failure with the low-pressure zone will cause heavy rains in the coming days with widespread flooding in the South.
At local level, rain levels up to 1 to 4 inches will cause sudden floods, floods of waste and possible earthquakes in the desert.
The high tropical decline will result in the rate of drought in the designated areas reaching approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in some parts of Nevada and southern Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of sand are predicted in some areas of the South, mainly on a large part of Arizona.
There is also the possibility of sudden floods with rapid deterioration of conditions, due to the widespread nature of tropical rain forests.
Because of the danger of tropical raindrops, it is not advised to walk through the desert with feet.
Large waves can turn cannons into powerful rivers, and the waves will bring heavy clouds and rain into the area.
Affirmation of the atmospheric pressure area will bring heavy rains in parts of southern California.
The total number of rivers can reach half the size, which can cause a small drop of waste and rough roads.
For the region, these will be the first season of the season.
Several tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday and on Monday morning, before the rain forests expand further on Monday and Tuesday evening.
Strong winds will be let loose on the four sides of the river on Tuesday, and they will continue until Wednesday.
The U.S. theater can be characterised by high temperatures, reducing temperatures in Arctic, while tropicals remain warm.
At times, this leads to dramatic changes in temperatures in short distances.
A good example is the dramatic difference of temperatures across the United States center on Sunday.
Between the city of Kansas in Missouri and Omaras in Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, the temperature difference is about 20 degrees.
During the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to collect and rejuvenate.
A good part of the Central and Eastern United States is expected to begin October at a warm temperature, from the mid-80s in the South to the designated part of the West.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, the temperature that would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our weather forecast shows a high chance of temperature on the average in the eastern US during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have followed the Brett Kavanaugh trial
Over 20 million people have followed through six television networks the interesting witness of High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused her of a sexual assault that was suspected of having taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, political blockades continued, and transmitters interrupted regular programs to transmit the review in the last minute of the Friday events: an agreement reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct a uniform FBI investigation on charges.
Ford said in front of the Senate's Judicial Committee that it is 100% sure that Kavanaugh had touched him while he was drunk and was trying to move him to a gym party.
Kavanaugh, in a flash witness, said it was 100% sure that this didn't happen.
It is estimated that the number of followers has been greater than that of 20.4 million, reported by Nielsen on the Friday.
The company was measuring average visibility in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
Numbers for other transmission networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has problems counting viewers from offices.
To set this number in perspective, the size of this audience is similar to that of a football elimination or that of the Academy Awards.
The Fox News channel, whose opinionors strongly supported Kavanaugh's rise, led other networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the 24-hour session, Nielsen said.
ABC came second with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest continued to rise even after the completion of the trial session.
Flake was the main character in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he faced protests by protesters while trying to get into the elevator to go to the judicial session of the Judicial Committee.
In passing CNN's life, he showed up looking down for a few minutes while he was being punished.
"I'm staying here, in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
He said to them, "You have power, while there are so many women who have no strength."
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he said he would have more to say during the committee session.
A few hours later, all cable and satellite networks were covering the moment when the Judicial Committee would vote for Kavanaugh's candidate for a vote in front of all Senate members.
But Flake said he would do this only by believing that the FBI would investigate the candidates for the next week, as a few democracies had requested.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and with some other senators after him, Flake made the decision.
Flake's election was smart, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the conduct of the investigation.
President Trump has requested the opening of an FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "playing political games" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused the critics of her plans to leave the European Union that "they are playing political games" with Britain's future and compromise national interest, in an interview for Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the main page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued the attack on her plan for Brexit, so-called "Chequers", saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU pay taxes on the statistics of each other is "finally absurd."
The murder of Wade Sims: The police arrest Ditéon Simpson's suspect for the death of LSU player
The police arrested a suspect for the murder of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU team basketball player.
20-year-old Dytheon Simpson has been arrested and is questioned in prison environments under the warrant for murder without a warrant, the Baton Rouge Police Director has said.
Official sources have released the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police say Sims had lost his eyes during the interrogation.
Police have found their eyes in the location and says they have found traces of Simpson's DNA in them, reports CBS's WAFB branch.
After taking Simpson's question, the police said he admitted he had put his gun on Wade, causing him to die.
The amount for his release was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The Law Office of the Eastern Baton Rouge Community has issued a preliminary report on Friday, which states that the cause of death has been a plague caused by fire from the head to the neck.
The Department appreciates the task of recruits near the state police, the state police criminal laboratory, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area, for the aid of investigations led to the arrest of the authorities.
LSU's athletic director Joe Alleva has thanked the legislative authorities of the area for "their cell and for the position of justice in the country."
Sims was 20 years old.
The boy with six feet and six inches [6 cm] tall grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, had played basketball for LSU.
In the last season, he had a mean of 5.6 points and 2.6 hits for each game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball team trainer Will Wade said the team was "pocketed" and "friended" by Wade's death.
"That's what we worry about all the time," said Wade.
Volcano tolls on Mexico City
Hiri from the Volcano Popcatepetl has reached the southern coast of Mexico’s capital.
On Saturday, the National Fatkets Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater was rehabilitated and 183 gas leaks were registered within 24 hours.
The center had been monitoring a number of complaints and complaints.
Social media images showed the heavy irony that had covered cars’ jams in some parts of Mexico City, such as Jochimilco.
Geophysicists have found an increase in the activity of the volcano, which takes place 45 miles (72 km) south of the capital, when a 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
Volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police have been replaced with Catalan separatists prior to the anniversary of independence votes
Six persons have been arrested in Barcelona on the seventh day following the arrest of pro-invasion protesters with peaceful police forces, while thousands of themselves have joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalan's polarization vote for defeat.
A group of masked pro-separatists, surrounded by peaceful police forces, struck with lightning and lightning, creating dark clouds along the roads that usually smell from tourists.
Later in the day, there was also a cup of coffee, while the police had to use the rubber caps to end the payments.
For a few hours in a row, repeating the morning "We don't forget, we don't forgive," the pro-independence groups faced the Union's protestors calling "Spains".
Forty persons were treated for minor injuries during protests, according to local press reports.
In the region where feelings for independence prevail, tensions continue to rise even a year after the 1st October referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid, but is honored by the separatist catalytics.
The majority of voters chose independence, regardless of whether the participation was low, while citizens opposed the crossing voted.
According to the Catholic authorities, about 1,000 of them were injured last year after the police tried to stop the polls through the regional voting centres through violent attacks.
On Friday evening, the pro-invasion groups set up camps outside to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but it was forced to take another stream.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist protest together with his wife, expressed no hope that Catalan would gain independence in the future.
"Last year we saw one of our best times.
I saw my parents crying for joy that they would have the chance to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite the fact that in December's local elections a vital victory has been achieved, although with immediate results, the Catholic pro-invasive parties have found it difficult to keep their home this year, since many of their most well-known leaders have been either voluntarily departed from the country or are in pre-trial and waiting for the trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and the declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who was recording the protest on his phone using the police, expressed that the conflict was fueled by both sides' politics.
"The situation is getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catholic leaders who are in prison in waiting for the trial last year, said he would be candidate for the European Parliament next year.
"The challenge of the candidate for European elections is the best way to counter the regression of democratic values and the pressure made to us by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Some arrested after the car was moved home
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car has been parked several times with a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, about 19:30 p.m.
Detective Bob Blemmings said damages were caused at the main gate and in the apartment itself.
It is thought that at a certain point a bullet has been thrown in the direction of the car.
Menga's fault of Livingston's winning 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston gave victory
The team came from a category below, Livingston surprised Rangers by causing Steven Gerard's second loss in 18 matches as team trainer from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's award was decisive while Gary Holt's team compared the second country's hybrid score.
Gerard's team has not yet won a field meeting in Premiership, this season and next Sunday, will face Hearts, the difference with which eight points are.
But sooner or later, Rangers will wait at Rapid Vienna's home, in the worthy struggle for the European Law on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended the series of equally successful winners in six meetings, and Coach Holt has not yet experienced the loss since she replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses cases in front of well-deserved opponents
The Holt team must have been in advance many minutes before they noticed, as their direct attacks caused Rangers many problems.
Scott Robinson arrived to pass but hit the weak at the door, and then Alan Lithgow hit out in the top row after his head hit by Craig Halket.
The states were ready to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems in standard attacks.
And that's how you got a bullet that set up the meeting.
Rangers caused a punishment and Livingston created space, Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined creating Menga's potential, which hit and marked the center of the area.
By that time, Rangers had dominated the maintenance of the ball, but local protection had resulted in incredible results, and porter Liam Kelly was almost never put in a test,
This way the game continued in the second part even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to wait.
Scott Pittman's strike was stopped by Rangers Allan McGregor's port while Lithgov was hit by another standard hit by Livingston.
The charges continued to come into Livingston’s area, while two claims for penalty – after Halket’s intervention to the incoming player as replacement Glenn Middleton, and another for touching hand - were not taken into account.
Liveston-like Game - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland on Tony Macaroni Island
A performance and phenomenal results for Livingston.
For a man, they played a great game and continued to raise expectations in this growing tractor.
The style of the game and their team has not changed much since their arrival, but a great honor belongs to Holt in the way that he elects the team from his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halket was extraordinary, leading a perfectly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the struggle.
However, Rangers lacked spirituality.
Although in some cases they played very well under Gerard’s direction, they lacked quality.
There was no final delay -- only once they reached the counter defense -- and this is something that should serve as an alarm for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is expected with feelings of doubt in Colombia
Saturday (September 29th) was characterised by a loud and clear voice as Turkey's leaders and Germany met for the morning in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which was aimed at resolving relations between NATO allies.
They have been opposed to issues such as human rights, media freedom and Turkey's EU membership.
Later, Erdogan headed to Cologne to open a new giant room.
The city boasts the largest number of Turkish people outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police stopped gathering a crowd of 25,000 before the game, but many of the supporters went around to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan - many of whom were also deaf - also raised their voice to punish Erdogan’s policies as well as the German government’s decision to welcome him in the country.
Opposers reflect the distinctive ability of a visitor to worship as hero by some German Turks and famous as autocrats by others.
A road accident in Deptford: The driver dies after a car crash
A cyclist has found death after being hit by a car in London.
The incident took place near the headway of Bestrok Street with Evelyn Street, a traffic route loaded in Deptford, southwest of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped, and the emergency assistant arrived immediately, but the victim changed his life.
The explosion took place a few months after another cyclist lost his life in an accident where the author left the scene, which took place in Childers Street, about a mile away from the country of the September accident.
Metropolitane police said officers were working to identify the person and to inform his family.
Roads have been closed and buses have been notified to use other roads, while car drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin: Six officers injured during a rebellion
Six prison officers have been injured during a strike in a high-security prison for men, the Office of the Burgundy has been expressed.
The revolution broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire about 09:30 BST Sunday, and continues.
Specialist officers of "Tornado" have been called to keep track of the injuries, including eight prisoners, who have been confined to a prison area.
Officers have been treated in a location for some minor injuries in the face.
A spokesman for the Burgundy Service said: "The specialized training staff has been mobilized to monitor the incident currently taking place in the HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we have made it clear that the responsible persons will be referred to the police and may be punished with imprisonment."
HMP Long Martin holds over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison director was reported to have been subjected to hospital treatment after an attack by one of the prisoners.
And in October last year, peaceful police officers were called into prison to keep a serious situation under control, where staff were attacked with billiards.
Urgani Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (which can make the advantages of coastal areas)
Although it is rare that a tropical depression strikes Arizona, much of it is precisely what will happen on the first days of the next week, as the remaining power of the Russians passes through the Southwest desert, spreading the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued warnings of immediate flooding from the West Arizona to the South and Eastern Nevada, South California and Utah, including cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the lead in Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday afternoon with raindrops.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix expressed in a tweet that "only seven tropical cyclones have taken the status of drought or tropical depression at a rate of 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the Uragan National Centre predict 2 to 4 inches in length, with an isolated amount up to 6 inches in the Arizona border of Mogollon.
In other areas of the desert in Southeast Asia, including Central Rockies and the Great Basin, the rivers are expected to be in level 1 to 2 inches, while in isolated areas their total can reach 4 inches.
For areas outside the risk of immediate floods, Rosa's streets can be a blessing, as the region has been hit by floods.
Although floods are a serious concern, some of these rivers may be useful, since the South is currently facing harsh conditions.
According to the U.S. Monitoring Centre, less than 40 per cent of Arizona is facing extreme Category Two," weather.com reported.
First of all, take Rosa to Mexico's California Bay.
Rosa, still with urganian power on Sunday morning, with peak speed of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 12 miles per hour speed.
The storm is raging with cold waters over the Pacific, and the power is losing its power.
Suddenly, you are expected to take Mexico by the power of tropical storm on the afternoon or on the evening of Monday.
Several areas of Mexico may be strong, presenting considerable risk of extinction.
"The rain of a average of 3 to 6 inches is expected from the California Bay to the Northern Sonor, and can reach up to 10 inches," said weather.com.
Then Rosa will move north through Mexico, in front of a tropical storm, before reaching the border with Arizona in the first hours of the morning as tropical depression, which will then move through Arizona, reaching Utah south on Tuesday evening.
"The main line expected by Rosa or its consequences are strong lines in Baja California, in the northwestern Sonor and in the southwestern desert of the United States," the National Centre of Uruguay said.
These droughts are expected to cause sudden flooding with life - threatening risks, the decline of desert wastes, and land degradation in landfills.

Trump says Kavanaugh "is faced with the humiliation and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the cruel and cruel tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "is faced with the humiliation and anger" of the Democratic Party during its enlargement process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the Congress on the fourth day, confidently and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he had attacked her sexually decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness during the session concerning her case.
On Saturday, the President said that that day "the American people witnessed the greatness, qualities of character and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote for the election of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most intelligent lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a clean public service record," he said in front of the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president mentioned Kavanaugh's rise during the talk on the importance of Republican participation in future elections.
"Five weeks share us with one of the most important choices in our life.
I don't want to bid, but I'm contributing," he said.
"I'm doing so much effort tomorrow and I'm fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats have a mission to make "block resistance".
The first main procedural vote by the Senate on Kavanaugh's accession is expected to be developed no later than Friday, said CNN's assistant to a senior GOP director
Hundreds killed by earthquakes and famine in Indonesia, while figures are expected to grow
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were tried by giant firemen who were thrown into the beach, when the island of Sulawesi of Indonesia was hit by a earthquake and consumed, the authorities expressed their approval on Saturday.
Hundreds of them were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when high - altituded lights up to six feet (18 feet) were thrown into the back of the museum, trying to cause the death of many people and destroying everything ahead.
The hunt followed a 7.5-dollar earthquake.
"The next day, when the tsunami threatened, people were still doing their normal activities on the beach, and by the way, they did not run immediately and hit his victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman of the Indonesian disaster prevention agency.
"The town didn't come alone, he took his own car, storm, house, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the food had crossed the open sea with a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles per hour), before crossing the coast.
Some people went up to the tree to save their food and survive, he said.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centers in Peru.
Air photographs published by the disaster agency showed a number of destroyed buildings and shops, destroyed roofs and examples, and a water-conditioned room.
After the earthquake, the earthquake continued to strike the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake took place in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) expressed in a statement that the energy generated by the heavy heavy rain storm was around the threshold of the nuclear bomb power dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's geographical position, which is at the edge of a long, narrow circle, may have multiplied the power of consumption, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "great stones" and expressed thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels as examples.
Some ceilings were found blocked under the walls of exemplary buildings, he said, adding that 540 had been damaged and 29 had been destroyed.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the level of damage could be much larger along the 300 km (90 km) coast of Palu north, in a area called Dodrea, which is located near the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication networks "stop completely without any warning" from Dodrea, Nugroho said.
The area has over 300,000 inhabitants," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that the staff and volunteers were traveling to the affected areas.
"It's already turned into a tragedy, but the situation may be different," he said.
On the seventh day, the agency was severely criticized for not having informed the attack of Palu of the tsunami, although officials said that the blind had come at the time they had been warned.
In amateur films distributed on social media, a man in the upper floor of a building can be heard warning the climbers down the road about the coming of the burning winds.
Within a few minutes, a lamp is lit in the back, taking the building and the car with it.
Reuters could not immediately verify the reality of the film.
The environment and food caused a massive mass-up, which led to communications within Palu, making it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts by the authorities.
The army has begun sending small airplanes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but evacuated people continue to have a great need for food and other basic needs.
The city airport has been reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo expected to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of food victims in Indonesia goes up to 800.
It's pretty serious.
While the World Vision stage by Dondrea has reached without problems in the city of Palu, where workers are being placed in the backyards of their office, they have witnessed the scene of destruction along the way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They tell me they've seen many destroyed houses," he said.
It's pretty serious.
Although relief teams began serious efforts to move humanitarian aid mechanisms, some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and external status can only begin to circle if the disaster zone has been declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a regional disaster," said Aulia Ariani, an Indonesian Red Cross spokesman.
"After the government says "O.K., this is a national disaster," we can ask for national aid, but this status has not yet been given."
On the second night after the earthquake and the tsunami in Palu, friends and families of missing persons still hoped that their loved ones would be among those few miracles that would sometimes occur in natural disasters.
On the seventh day, a little boy was taken out of a bag.
On Saturday, the rescue forces released a woman who had been in the basement for two days, with her mother’s blanket next to her.
Gendon Subbandono, the national team coach of the Indonesian presupposement, had trained two of the missing presupposers for Asian Games, which were closed early this month in Indonesia.
Some of the others in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandanga, were his students.
"As an old professional in the field of predictation, I am very emotionally loaded," he said.
Mr. Gendon is reminiscent of the hours following the announcement of the hotel's "Roa Roa" show between the presuppose community, he was sadly trying to write to whatsApp competitors from Palu, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, his messages ended only with a sign of greyishing, instead of two blue signs.
"I think this means that messages have not been sent," he said.
Hayduts steal $26,750 during the refurbishment of a bank at Newport in Levee
According to a press release by the Newport Police Directorate on Friday morning, some orphans stole $26,750 from a Brink employee, who was reopening a bank account in Newport of Levee.
The driver of the car had been embroiled in a banking center and was trying to spread before others, Dr. Dennis wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, someone came running after Brink's employees and stole a bag of cash for delivery.
According to the declaration, the Witnesses had seen some suspects escaping, but the police had not specified the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identities should contact the Newport police in number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Relist the change in Ye
Retirement Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
Publishing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Allegedly officially known as Kanye West."
41st-year-old West has been called with Y's ring ever since, and has used it as the title of his eighth album, which came to market in June.
The interview came shortly before his departure on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album "Yandhi".
He will replace the singer Ariana Grande in the show, which cannot come for "emotional reasons", expressed the creator of the show.
Apart from being a short shortness of his current name of art, West has been expressed in the past that the word has a religious meaning for it.
"I think "ye" is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "t," said West at the beginning of this year, talking about the title of his album with the Big Boy radio presenter.
"For me, for you, for me, for us, for us.
I went from Kane, which means "only", just "yes", which is the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more than a reflection of what we are."
He is one of many famous reporters who have changed their names.
Sean Combs is known differently as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he said he preferred the name Love and Brother Love.
A former co-fellow of the West, JAY-Z, has done as he has done with or without a divisional form and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO is forced not to use the army against civilians
Mexico's newly elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has been sworn that he will never use the military force against civilians, while the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a remarkable representation against students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador vowed that "he will never use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, military bodies opened fire on peaceful protesters in the market, killing 300 people at a time when students' left movements were headed across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is driven to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grant to students and opening more public universities without pay.
It has been said that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education push young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for artificial intelligence
While China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the much spent for research in this field, the investor and expert of artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments have come after various parts of the US government have published artificial intelligence discoveries, although the US lacks an official strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China has announced its plan last year: in 2030, it aims to voice the first country for innovation in the field of artificial intelligence.
"The discharge of the budget for research in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, since other countries are still very behind the US, and we are looking for a great discovery of the chain in this field," Lee said.
The lack of funding may double the chances that the major achievement of the series in the field of artificial intelligence will be made in the US, Lee said in an interview to the CNBC this week.
Lee, author of the book "Cinna, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", published this month by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of the Senovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most extensive companies of artificial intelligence in China, Face+.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he created an artificial intelligence system that also passed on to the leading American players in Othello, and later worked as executive director near Microsoft Research and as the president of the Google branch in China.
Lee welcomed the US government's previous competitions for technology, such as the Agency's Robotics Challenge for Advanced Research Projects in the Defence Field, and asked when the series competition would be developed, so as to help identify new spectators.
Lee said that often, U.S. refugees have to work hard to get gifts from the government.
"It's not China that's leaving academic leaders; they're corporations," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have worked hard at universities to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can help the US to boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think old cards should automatically be given to people with the title doctor in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, China's State Council issued the Plan for the Development of the New Artificial Intelligence Generation.
The National Foundation for Nature Sciences in China provides funding for persons in academic institutions, as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but academic work quality is lower in China, Lee said.
Early this year, the American Defence Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, which is expected to include partners from industry and Academy, and the White House announced the establishment of the Artificial Intelligence Committee.
Meanwhile, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a initiative called "AI Next".
As regards the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million per year for research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, American legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been implemented for months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to decide whether its name would be changed to the "Republic of northern Macedonia", a movement that could resolve a ten-year disagreement with Greece, which had blocked its efforts for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, thinks its northern neighbour's name is a claim on its territory, and has set itself blocking its membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalists argue that the change may compromise the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonia's people.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has raised doubts if the vote will reach 50 per cent necessary for the worth of the referendum.
The question in the referendum vote speech reads: "Are you for NATO and EU membership through the accession of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change in the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, as one of the countries created by the breakup of Yugoslavia, this is a price that is worth being paid to achieve membership in the structure such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the country's future, for Macedonia's young people, so they can live free under the European Union's umbrella, since this means a safer life for all of us," 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska said in Skopje.
Although the referendum has no mandatory power, a sufficient number of members of parliament have expressed that they will hold the vote to make that decision.
The amendment of the name calls for a majority of two-thirds in parliament.
The State Election Commission stated that no irregularities had been reported until 1 p.m.
However, participation in the polls was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections of 2016, where 66 per cent of registered voters cast their vote.
"I come to vote for the sake of my children, we have the place in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their vote in the referendum on the change in the name of Macedonia, which would open the way for the country's membership in NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small scene and was setting up careers in front of the tables set up by the referendum voters.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the top head, not entering the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"Our country's poor, but we're rich.
If they don't want us named Macedonia, we can turn to other states like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will provide sufficient investment for Macedonia, which has a rate of unemployment of over 20 per cent.
"I think most of our citizens will be fair, since more than 80 per cent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
He said that a positive outcome would "confirm our future".
According to a survey published last month by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, about 30 to 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum - a figure below the required level of participation.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian television Telma found that 57 per cent of participants were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote for.
For a successful referendum, the rate of participation should be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The referendum's failure would give the pro-western government's first strong political attack, since its arrival in power in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through all Bridgeton's defenses to mark
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling met all of Brighton's defenses in Manchester City's 2-0 winner on Saturday, at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his throat in the 65th minute look extremely easy.
Argentina’s treasure trove took place in the middle of the beginning of the action.
He shot you through three Brighton's defenses, before he went out in open field.
Later, Aguero found himself surrounded by four green blouses.
He crossed a protective line and crossed the bridge at a speedy pace, and some others entered the Brighton area.
Then he followed me to the left where Sterling is.
The English Sulmuzer used his exit in the area to follow the Agueros summit, which hit the south and crossed the gate of Mathew Ryan by throwing the ball into the right corner of the network.
"Aguero is suffering from a foot problem," said City's manager newspaper Pep Guardiola.
"We discussed that he would play about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he made a goose at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the cat the initial advantage in the Premier League's fight.
This bullet was recorded in the 29th minute.
During that action, Aguero took the ball to the side of Brighton.
He verticalized beautiful for Laroy Sane on the left side.

Scherzer wants to save the role of the "plier" against Rockies
With the Nationals removed from the chance to reach the eliminateors, there was no reason to impose another beginning.
But Scherzer, who is always competitive, hopes to be given the opportunity to sign against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is a playoff for Rockies, which have a advantage with a fight against Los Angeles Dodgers in the National Law of God.
Rockies reached at least one chance to playoff thanks 5-2 to the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still trying to get the title of the division.
"Although we are playing without any motive, at least we can note by knowing the atmosphere of the typhoes here in Denver but also the fact that the opposition team will play at the highest level against which we can face all year round.
Why didn't I want to play in such a challenge?"
The Nationals have not yet informed him who will be titled on Sunday, but it is reported that they are prepared to let Scherzer start the meeting in such circumstances.
Scherzer, for whom the 34th presentation would be titled, held a training session on Thursday and could be presented in the field Sunday, which could be a normal day of rest for him.
Player from Washington, who played with the right is 18-7 with an ERA 2,53 ERA and 300 "strekeouts" in 220 2/3 of the games this season.
Trump gathers West Virginia in the mix
The president referred to the horror of the situation with regard to his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, before he spoke about the importance of the participation of republicans in future elections.
"The interior is decisive for everything we've done so far.
Five weeks they share with us one of the most important choices in life.
That's one of the biggest choices -- I'm not candidate, but I'm contributing, and that's why I'm trying so hard to fight for good candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible group of radical Democrats, you see what's going on right now.
And they have divided themselves into sects, that they may rebut each other in what they have been doing, and that ye may see their nakedness and their nakedness.
They don't want to know who they're hurting, who's pressing on to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, but we won't give them."
Democrats, he said, have a mission to do "block resistance".
"You've seen this in recent days," he said, calling Democrats "unsuspecting, cruel, stupid and faithless."
He was referred to by the Democratic Crisenator of the Senate's Judicial Committee, Diane Feinstein, as a result of an affluence from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you open the document?
Hey, hey, what?
No, no, no, I... wait a minute...--her body language was pretty bad--it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The work party is no longer an open chair.
She's non-tolerant to those who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted for the motion of disbelief against me, they didn't even live there.
Finally, I am not the first of the Members of the Labour Party to be told that they are not welcome -- all because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly, simply because he strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of disbelief was a criticism of me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corby.
With regard to the importance of a responsible economic policy, with regard to national security and with Europe, a similar ironic issue for which Jeremy was opposed to previous leaders.
In a report on the Meeting of the Working Party in Nottingham East, it was said "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight-year term as local members of the Labour Party, the GC meetings have also been together.
Unfortunately, the meetings no longer have their previous tone, and the promise of a "meekest and most affordable" policy has been forgotten for a long time, if there has ever been.
It has become increasingly evident that conflicting views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is judged on the basis of its admissibility by the party's leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, while colleagues with whom I thought that my similar political views began to claim that I took a 180-degree turn and held positions with which I would never compromise - either on national security or on the EU's single market.
As often as I talk to the public - regardless of what it says - the criticisms in social media, with people asking for my discharge, denouncing central policies, tell me that I should not be part of the Work Party.
And I'm not the only one who touched this thing.
I am aware that I am happier than some of my colleagues, since comments about me tend to be of a political nature.
I am amazed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues facing general and racial discrimination every day, but not all.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of levels of violence.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said that the Labour Party must feed a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a "open church", and with every faith move and with every change in election rules, the party becomes more and more closed.
In the last two years, they have often advised me to lower my head, not to be so angry, and that everything "will go well".
But that's not why I got involved in politics.
Since I joined the Work Party 32 years ago as a school student, urged by the failure of the Thatcher government that led my class to a general school failure, I have tried to work for better public services for those who need more — whether as a member of a local council or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clear views of my political positions and points of opposition to the current leader.
For all those who voted for the campaign on Friday, I just want to say that the country is heading towards a Brexit that will affect our families, businesses and public services.
But really, the only message I want to continue is not directed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether or not members of the Job Party: I feel proud that I am in your service and I promise you that no threat to download or political favor will prevent me from acting in your best interest.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose: Father of Impossible Heads of the List
Two recent attempts may have changed the final result some time, but Air certainly deserved to triumph in the extremely joyful battle of Tentent's Premiership today.
Now they're starting the list as the only team in the 10 teams.
In the end, it was their wonderful protection and the courage to take risks from the one who provided the victory to the local team, and trainer Peter Murchie was absolutely right to be pleased.
"We've shown ourselves in every game, and we're still inadequate, so I'm usually happy," he said.
Melrose's Robin Christie said, "We want to congratulate the Ayr team, which is more dangerous than we are."
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, returned to the floor by Frazier Climo, passed the Air in advance, but a green card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, who came for this challenge from Warriors, allowed Melrose to show the digital superiority and Jason Baggot received a free ball.
Climo increased Ayr's advantage with a penalty while shortly before the end of the first part, he marked and turned to the goal of an individual action by bringing the result to 17-5 for Ayr before rest.
But Melrose began well with the second part and Patrick Anderson's attempt to return to the hill from Baggot, reducing the difference to five points.
Later, there was a long interruption as a result of the serious injury of Ruarid Knott, who left the bar, and after the refurbishment of the game, Ayr grew the result through an attempt by Stafford McDowell, noted by Climo.
Ayr's captain, Blair Macpherson, was later charged with white cards, and Melrose again used the fact that they had a bigger player, with a minor attempt at the top of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a hard-pressure part.
However, the locals turned back and when Struan Hutchinson was convicted of black carding because he pushed Climo, without top, out of the penalty line, MacPherson made "touch down", after Ayr's step-by-step advance.
Climo noted and did the same almost after the refurbishment of the game, after Kyle Rowe caught the ball hit by David Armstrong in the area and took the player in front of the Flanker, Gregor Henry, for the fifth attempt of the local team.
Still Game star seems to be set for the new career in the restaurant industry
The "Still Game" star Ford Kieran seems determined to enter the hotel industry, after it was discovered that it was named the director of a licensed restaurant chain.
56-year-old Jack Jarvis played a prominent role in the BBC's show, with co-scanator and co-protagonist his long-term partner in the comedian world, Greg Hemphil.
The second has said the ninth season will be the last for this show, and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is Director of the Amigrormorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on history, even though a source for Scottish Sun was let down to realize that Kiernan was trying to enter the Glagow restaurant industry.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia without leaving the sea hopes the court to open its way to the Peace
Marines monitor an improvisation of the marine fleet cell in La Paz.
The public buildings have raised the blue flame of the ocean.
On the coastal bases of Lake Titicaca in Amazon, the bike is marked: "The sea is our property.
His recovery is a duty."
In Bolivia without leaving the sea, the memory of the capture of the coast from Chile in a terrible conflict for sources during the 19th century is still quite alive -- as well as the desire to cross again through the Pacific.
Now, these hopes are far greater than they have been ever since, while as of October 1, Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice after a five-year review.
"Bolivia is characterized by hatred, the spirit of unity and peace, and certainly, awaiting the outcome with positive expectations," said Roberto Calzadella, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the GJND session in large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will decide in favour of Bolivia that -- after decades of regular discussions -- Kili has been forced to develop talks to give Bolivia a sovereign territory with a rise in the sea.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic Indian president, who is facing a controversial battle to take the second mandate in the next year’s elections - Monday’s decision is quite important.
"We're very close to the return to the Pacific," he cried at the end of the August.
But some analysts are thinking that there is a lot of risk that the courts have decided in favor of Bolivia - and that even if they have, they will change little.
The UN celebratory body in the Netherlands has no authority to give another state part of the Chilean territory, and it has been said that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the GJND is leaving with a decision only six months after hearing the final arguments shows that the issue "was not confused", Paz Zárate, an international lawyer, said.
And instead of helping her with Bolivia's cause, the events of the last four years may have penalized her.
"The issue of sea access is compromised by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' aggressive retort has lost every trace of the remaining charity of the whales, she suggested.
At a certain point, Bolivia and Kili will continue their discussions, but it will be extremely difficult to develop discussions after this.
Two countries have not been embassies since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, opposed the idea that the decision of the court was amazingly rapid.
The Monday day will offer Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Kilin" and a chance "to end 139-year-old disputes with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - was using the issue of political interest.
"Bolivia will never abandon her right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The settlement is an opportunity to understand that we must leave behind the past. "
North Korea says nuclear crater won't happen for as long as it can't trust the US
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his country will never lead the first nuclear-weapon-free movement, as long as I can't trust Washington.
New was holding a speech on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during an assembly in Singapore between the leaders of rival states.
His comments come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be in the rush of the resurrection of nuclear diplomacy so far "soon", about three months after Singapore with Kim Jong Un-in-North Korea.
According to Ri, the hopes that the continued sanctions and the US opposition to the declaration for the end of the Korean War will make North Korea sinking, are short-lived.
As long as Pyongyang does not act first to make important movements of the carat, Washington hesitates to accept the statement.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second round.
However, there is a broad scepticism related to Pyongyang's serious intention to draw his argument, which the state is likely to see as the only way to guarantee his safety.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
The fashion show in Paris reveals the latest line of giant cables that will soon come in your city's streets
If you want to enrich your collection of hats or to ensure full protection from the sun’s rays, do not ask for more.
The Valentino and Thom Browne stylists presented a series of amazing giant capezes for their SS19 collection on the streets, which opened open to all the stylists on the Modal Week in Paris.
Their infamous hats have taken them to Instagram this summer, and these styles have brought out their fascinating creations in vain.
The special construction of Valentinos was an extravagance steel cap with a large roof similar to the dolls surrounding the model’s head.
Other large accessories included stone-stained shells, a magic hat and even anaanas -- but they're not made to keep your head warm.
Tom Browne also presented a strange mask - together at the time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had fragrant lips and resembled more like Hannibal Lecter than the leather coat.
One creature resembled the elements of the nest, filled with the air’s tube and water’s eyes, while the other looked like a red shark.
And if you like to follow this courageous way, you're lucky.
The fashion analysts predict that giant capillaries can soon come into your city’s streets.
The giant hair trends have followed that of "La Bomba", the head of the rock with the two broad legs that we have seen here all, starting from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cold mark hidden behind your infamous hat that he took through the social media brought another great creature into the street -- a wall of plague from it, almost as big as the model with the bathroom that was keeping it.
The tint from the red-coloured orange, stylized with a thin-colored raphae and a handy white leather handle at the top was the most special creation of the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus on the Modica Week in Paris.
The famous personality stylist Luke Armitage acknowledged for the FEMAIL: "The next spring I expect to see a giant beach bag on the streets of cities - after the stylist has left such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demands for large accessories."
John Edward: Basic language skills for Global Citizens · Global Voices
Private schools in Scotland keep record of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent results in trials, further enhanced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other fields.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), are trying to offer the highest level of service for their students and parents.
Private schools intend to prepare their students for further higher levels of education, for their selected career and their country as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can map and implement an appropriate educational curriculum, we are witnessing how the flow of modern languages continues to be a wide and popular choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone in a language he understands, your words will go into his ears.
If you speak to him in your own language, his words will reach his heart."
Those words are a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to establish relationships with people from other lands.
As a result of the latest tests this year, we can see that languages are building up the results list, with the highest level of cross-examination between private schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who have studied foreign languages have received the maximum note A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 per cent of students had received the maximum sign A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French, and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish had also received note A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as one of the vital skills that children and young people will need in the future.
Currently, foreign language debt is considered as important as STEM (scientific, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in private schools and later schools.
A 2014 study by the United Kingdom Commission on Employment and Skills found that among the main challenges the workers faced in completing the holiday countries, 17 per cent of them were related to the lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With the support of countries of employment that have the ability to master foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Despite the career one chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have real advantages in the future, as master of such a long - term ability.
The ability to communicate directly with strangers will automatically place a multilingual person on competitors.
According to a YeGov survey, which included over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 per cent of them were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to develop a conversation, and French was the only foreign language spoken by a percentage of people with 2 figures, specifically 15 per cent.
That is why investment in language learning is important to children today.
The mastering of many languages, especially the mastering of the languages of developing countries, will give children a better chance of working.
In Scotland, each school will be different for the languages in which it is taught.
Some schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will offer languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom in the 20th century, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages that you can choose in private schools, with a pedagogical staff composed of field specialists.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to providing a school environment that will prepare children and "arm" them with the necessary skills to keep them, regardless of the future.
At these times it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to have a vital importance for the country’s future, so this should be reflected in the lesson.
Modern languages must truly be regarded as "the speed of international communication".
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You need to do it.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Private Schools Council
LeBron is expected to start with Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who were expecting to see LeBron James in his first game for Log Angeles Lakers.
Lakers' coach Luke Walton has said that James will play in the opening game of the pre-session day on the day of the day against Denver Nuggets, in San Diego.
However, he doesn't know how long he'll be playing.
"To be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers' correspondent wrote on Twitter that, most likely, James will play for a limited number of minutes.
After training early this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-sex game.
"I don't need fights before the season at this stage of my career to be prepared," he said.
Time of Trump meetings in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump, launched a series of electoral meetings tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
This will be the first of the five planned meetings to be held next week, including stops in the friendly areas including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of approval left behind for his election to complete the free country in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to create support for future elections as the Republicans risk losing control at Congress when voting in November.
In what hour is the Trump summit being held in West Virginia today, and how can we follow it online?
The Trump Tower in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to be held at 7 p.m. The East Time tonight, September 29, 2018.
You can follow the Trump summit in West Virginia online below, via direct transmission to YouTube.
There is a risk that Trump will address this week's hearing sessions in the Supreme Court of candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who was stressed because of his sexual misconduct charges, with the expected vote of confirmation by the Senate to remain silent for a week while the FBI is conducting the investigation of the matter.
But the primary aim of these numerous councils is to help the Republicans take a step forward in the November elections.
Thus, President Trump's campaign stage said that these five meetings next week aim to "give energy to volunteers and supporters as republicans try to protect and expand the majority of those held in Senate and the Conference of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The Congress's control is so important for its agenda, as the President will travel to as many states as possible as we are heading the surrounding season of the campaign," a trumpeter, who did not want to be identified, said to Reuters.
The planned development in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling can bring support from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by Pittsburgh media," according to the news agency "Metro News" of West Virginia.
The week will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, the country where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Senate's Republical candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has remained behind according to polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a scholarship in the poll," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Cupa Ryder 2018: US team showed readiness to fight while keeping alive by directing the garages to Sunday
After three consecutive seasons, the remaining four for the afternoon, could be what this Cup Ryder needed.
This red light is a totally created sportive concept, but a concept where players really believe and never more than in such a race.
So where can we say that it's feeling now?
"They had a six-point cut, which has now gone into four, so we can say that it has been created to some extent a kind of red I believe," Jordan Spieth said while closing the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of four points ahead when it remains in play and twelve points.
As Spieth states, Americans hope that the risks are in their favor and have many things to encourage, especially the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day where they took three of the four possible points.
Spieth was cruel from the beginning of the dances to the tomb and was leading his example.
The party’s brothels were added as he came round, entering the golf course with an easy hit to bring the match into balance, when he and Thomas were first two points below two rounds.
His easy-to-do award winner in the 15th group was expected by a similar brochure, which shows that he believes that the American team is still not out of line.
"You just have to work hard and worry about your fight," said Spieth.
All the players are gone now.
18 holes to leave a trail.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the history of the Ryder Cup.
The two strange, but devout Europeans have realized four of them and cannot survive.
"Molywood" was the only couple who didn't get a joke on the minimum afternoon of Saturday, but they also avoided the jokes on the minimum Sunday morning and Friday evening and nine Sundays in the morning.
These results and the way it seems that their energy flows towards the enthusiastic crowd and the anesthesiology reinforces the idea that they are players to be able to do tomorrow and that there will be no other known player than Fleetwood and Molinary to defeat a possible European win, while the sun lies on "Le Golf National".
Maybe two at the same time in different groups.
However, declarations for a European triumph are still early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made it very easy for Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-morning games, when he married Alex Noren.
A point on the minimum and two seconds below set the Spaniards and rowed into a cave where they had no chance of getting out any more.
On Sunday, however, no one will be there to help you get out of your cave.
The four and two games are so amazing to follow them closely because of the interaction between the two, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and how a strategy can change there.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead to the end, but these four sessions have also shown that the US team will still be attacked even though some people, especially the states, have decided to do so.
Europe heads 10-6 as it moves toward the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a major advantage on the final day of Cyprus Ryder since it has come out of four and two games with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspiring couple Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari headed the race with two victories against a Tiger Woods who were in difficulty to increase their advantage at four points in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who was offered to take the trophy that was lost in the Haseltine two years ago, dominated the weak American team in the early morning's match, bringing it into the 3-1 series of results.
The American team showed more resistance to the four games, winning two matches, but they could not minimize the difference.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 individual Sunday matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European first player to win four points on the radar, while he and Molinari, named 'Molliwood', after one sensory end, are the second two in the history of the Ryder Cup that win four points in their four open matches.
After sending Woods and Patrick Reed to the fourth game, they combined quite well together in order to enable a weak Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechambeau with even more dramatic performance 5&4.
Woods, who had hardly held two meetings on Saturday, showed a huge series of explosions, but he has already lost 19 of his 29 matches in the four and two games and seven rounds.
Justin Rose, restated for the four-morning match, returned to partner Henrik Stanson in the game with two, and received a loss of 2&1 from Dustin Justin and Brooks Koepka - held in the first and third places in the world.
Europe had nothing to do with it on a beautiful and fresh day in the south of Paris.
Three times professional winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas decided the difference between Americans and two points on Saturday.
They took a brave victory 2&1 against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four matches and later returned to enable Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4&3 in the two matches after they lost in the first two rounds.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team turned the result after a difference between four points in individual games, although Fury's team needs only a comparison to keep the trophy.
However, since he was the second best player for two days, a contestant on Sunday seemed to go beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it won't hit 'no way' in a way that won't win the faith
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations that sanctions continued on Saturday, were deepening the United States' lack of confidence, and the country would not give up in any way by its nuclear weapons in a uniform manner under such conditions.
New Yong Ho told the annual body from around the world of the General Assembly that North Korea has undertaken "a significant measure that shows good will" last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and rockets, assessing areas where nuclear tests were developed and predicting that it will not increase the reason for weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we see no response to this from the US," he said.
"Without faith in the United States, our national security will not be self-sustained, and in these circumstances there is no way that we can single ourselves first."
While New shared North Korea's usual complaints about Washington's resistance for a split "phase" phase for the nuclear warming process in which North Korea would be valued for the gradual steps it has taken, its declaration seemed important because it did not exclude the same nuclear carnation, as Peniani had previously done.
The new was referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump in an interview held for the first time between an American president in charge and the North Korean leaders in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim was forced to work towards "the nuclear blackout of the Korean Gaditarian" while Trump was charged with guaranteeing North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought an official end to the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States has stated that Pennsylvania should initially be fired from nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to impose international severe sanctions on North Korea.
"The US insists that the 'carmatology of nuclear weapons' be initially carried out and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their objective in a critical way, even in opposition to 'declaring the end of the war'," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can confuse us is dreams in the sun of people who are uninformed about us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions is explaining our disbelief."
New did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, a statement that the US leader stressed earlier this week in the United Nations.
Instead, the minister introduced three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae in the last five months and added: "If I were to go into the issue of nuclear warming, it would be South Korea and not the US, the nuclear warming process on the Korean peninsula would not have come into this situation without further delay."
Nevertheless, the tone used in the New speech was quite different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly, that the U.S. territory's decision under the flag with Korean-Northern rockets was disastrous after "Mr. Devil" Tromp called Kim "the rocket man" with a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year that the North Korean would "disappear completely" thanked Kim for the cure shown in taking steps to heal, but said there was still much work to do and that sanctions should continue to be active until North Korea carries out nuclear war.
Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three or five months -- that doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Penia for business measures.
However, US Secretary Mike Pompeo said to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council should continue strongly and without delay until we complete the complete and final verification of nuclear destruction."
The Security Council has unanimously set up an increase in sanctions for North Korea since 2006, in an effort to end the financing of Penny's nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Rei to the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Penny again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not gone so well.
He left Pennsylvania in July saying he had made progress, and in just a few hours North Korea demanded that he have done "the mafios style request."
North Korea was forced to meet Moon this month to crate a radio area and also a nuclear complex if the United States will undertake "dependable measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "exact measures" he sought were a security guarantee for which Trump was forced into Singapore and moved towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn how to relax enough
A new course at Harvard University this year has included all students to sleep more, in an effort to combat the culture of the 'machos' study through the use of caffeine from these 'the pay'.
One academic observed that university students number one in the world often have no idea when work comes to more basic things than how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and Grave, prepared the course of lectures, which he believes is the first such in the United States.
He was inspired to take this course after giving a reference to the effect that sleep has on the student.
"At his end a girl came to me and said to me, 'Why is this what you are telling me now, in my last year?'
She said that no one had spoken to her before about the importance of sleep--what impressed me,' he said to 'The Telegraph'.
The course, included in the program for the first time this year, explains to students the essential elements of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general director of university medical services, said the university decided to present this course after he found that students were seriously deprived of their sleep for a week.
The course of an hour involves a number of responsibilities.
On the other hand, there is a vision of a conference room, where students click on coffee beans, potatoes, athletes and books so that they can explain the effects of caffeine and screening and how athletic performances are affected by lack of sleep, as well as the importance of the routine of hours spent in bed.
On the other hand, participants are explained as a view of sleep for a period of time to increase the risk of heart attack, obesity, depression, and cancer.
A field map, with impressive icons, further encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know that students' contributions will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know -- as you have the right to know, the healthy effect when you choose to drink."
The culture of pride that you spend 'a pay night' continues to exist, he said, adding that modern technology and pressure on students are constantly growing, meant that dreaming was a constant problem and growing.
The assurance that you have taken enough dose of sleep, of a good quality, must be the 'secret weapon' of students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid weight loss, because the vision of sleep leads the brain into a cold mode, making them feel constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old California student of physics and chemistry, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course, after having participated in one of his hours of study last year in Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and had inspired him to return to a course for the entire camp.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all students of post-university studies to complete a similar programme before competing institutions join them.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students set an hour in the summer that when they have to go to bed, also when they need to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light coming out of the electronic screens and LED lighting, which can trigger the biological flow of sleep out of work, which leads to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Go against Gerard's boys · Global Voices
Rangers took another attack as visitors because Dolly Menga's hit gave Steven Gerard's missing 1-0 in Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was trying to record his first victory from the triumph of the month of February 4.1 in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused the second loss in 18 Gerard matches as a trainer, leaving his team eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership, team Hearts.
Menga noted seven minutes before completing the first part and with a decision of the Rangers team that seemed completely powerless to compare.
While Rangers now falls into the sixth place, Livingston ascends to the third and is right after the Hibernian for Golash Differences.
Rangers may expect more stress after their opponent called Callum Spence was treated for a head attack after being hit by an object with a distance away from the visitors' typhoes.
Gerard led eight changes to his team, which passed through Air in the middle of the Betfred Bay.
Holt, on the other hand, entered the same 11th field that hit a Hearts point last week and that he would be pleased to see how his well-organized team kills opponents everywhere.
Rangers may have dominated the soil maintenance, but Livingston created more when he had it in possession.
They should've noted only two minutes from the start of the meeting, when the first time that Menga gave Scott Pittman to the door-to-door guard by Allan McGregor, he didn't take advantage of it by shooting the ball outside.
A long cross from the beating by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, just shot him out at the back of the door.
Rangers took control of the game but seemed to expect more than they really believed in their game in the opposite area.
Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a penalty after a hundred hours of play while he and Steven Lawless were shot, but archaeologist Steven Thomson did not hear the Colombian complaints.
Rangers arrived at two hits at the door in the first part, but Ibrox's former-porter Liam Kelly didn't worry about Lassana Coulibaly's head hit and Ovie Ejaria's forceless.
While Liv's first bullet in the 34th minute may have been contrary to what was seen in the field, no one can deny that they deserved only the pride they showed.
Rangers had already failed in the long - term service of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher hit the ball towards Scott Robinson, who kept peace to pass through Menga and to label it in a simple way.
Gerard worked in the rest of the parts as Coulibaly replaced Ryan Kent and this change as little as it did not give an immediate effect while the anesthesitor followed for Morelos, but the ambassador Kelly fled his position to block it.
But Livingston continued to make guests play as they wanted, where Lithgow and Halket followed each other for a long time after.
The Holt team could extend its head in the final phase, but McGregor stood firm and rejected Jacobs before Lithgov jumped out of a ball from the cannon attack.
Ranger's replacement, Glenn Middleton later claimed during the game for another penalty, while he was upset with Jacobs, but Thomson also allowed the advantage.
Almanac: Geiger's Size Spokesman
And now a page from our German "Sunday Morning: 30 September 1882, As today 136 years ago and IN AVAZHDIM... the day the next physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a technique that eventually led to the production of what is known as Geiger scale.
A major stage of science since then, Geiger's scale has also become the main stage of popular culture, as in the 1950 film "Cronado's Walls," with a picture of non-professional scientists like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, "What the fuck is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger scale used to track radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you set these limits, you can actually hear the effects of atoms released from radioactive activity in minerals."
Evans, "Don't tell me, I'm really listening now."
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the spell that keeps his name continues to live.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system "distinguish" evil cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "distinguish" evil cells and kill them.
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize evil cells as part of treatment
Method includes the removal of immune cells from a patient, changing them into a laboratory
They can "drive" a protein that is very serious in many types of cancer and then reinject
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with certain types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify harmful cells observed that cancer in the veins had disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes the removal of the immune cells from a patient, changing them into the laboratory so that they can ‘drive’ a protein that is serious in some types of cancer called HER2, and then reinjecting these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the National Institute for Cancer in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show us that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "encourages the growth of some types of cancer," including cancer of the liver, of the kidneys, the muscles and the backbone, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar phase of the release of immune cells from patients "to teach" how to detect cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West appeared in a Pro-Trup tube, holding a cape with the MAGA inscription, after its SNL display.
It doesn't matter.
Kanye West launched protests in the studio during a broadcast at the "Saturday Night Live" show, after a disappointing interpretation where he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would be candidate for this post in 2020.
After interpreting his third song for that night called "Ghost Town", where he was holding his head a cape that wrote "Make America Great", he came to speak with our strong opposition to the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
"How many times do I talk to a white person and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I'd been worried about racism, I'd be out of America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL began its presentation with a parade that was in the role of Matt Damon, where Hollywood star came to play the witness of Brett Kavanaugh in front of the Senate's Judicial Commission on sexual assault charges raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not transmitted, Western harsh speech records were loaded on social networks by Commissioner Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock's trying to dance with the West with that post or not.
The West also complained to the spectators that he had spent a difficult time in the backyard because of what he had set in his head.
"They hurt me in the back.
They told me, 'we're going out on the stage with that capel in our head.'
They hurt me!
And then they tell me I'm finished," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
"Do you want to see the money?" said he, "I put my hat on my head, because this shows that no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try love."
His comments were received at least twice by the viewers and SNL members seemed to feel embarrassed, reports Variety, where a person said to the newspaper: "All the studies came to a close."
West was called a late substitute instead of Ariana Grande, whose former lover, Reper Mac Miller, had changed his life a few days earlier.
West surprised many people with the interpretation of the song "I Love it", dressed as the shower Perrier.
The West was supported by the head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who posted on Twitter: "For one of the most curative spirits: FALEMINDERIT OF THE BALLE TURME."
But emission moderator Karen Hunter posted on Twitter that the West just "was alone and this is extraordinary."
"But I choose MOS to reward someone (by buying music or clothing or by supporting his "art"), for whom I believe you are ashamed and who spreads the ideology that is harmful to my community.
While he's free.
So are we," she added.
Before the show, the singer announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was already "the dream I had known before as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist who's changed his name and followed the tracks of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper's boyfriend, Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion also the legend of later music Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist known as Prince.

Game of Thrones, Kit Harrington, the god of masculinity toxic
Kit Harrington is known for his role as a soldier in the character of Jon Snow, in violent series of medieval fantasy "Game of Thrones".
But 31-year-old actor has hit male hero stereotypes, saying that showing such roles in the screen makes young boys realize that they should act as hard to respect.
Speaking about 'The Sunday Times Culture', Kit said he believes that 'something' has gone wrong' and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity at the time of #MeToo's movement.
Kit, who recently married his actor's colleague at "Game of Thrones", also 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that he felt 'too important' to solve this issue.
'I personally feel quite important about this issue for the moment -- where have we been wrong with displaying masculinity?' he said.
'What have we learned to men as they grow up, about the problems we're facing now?'
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the excessive male characteristics shown there.
He continued, 'What is born, and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and what is taught on the street, making young boys believe that they must act in a certain way to feel men?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time - how do we change this thing?
'Cause obviously something's gone wrong with the young boys.'
During the interview, he also admitted that he would no longer cheer on "Game of Thrones" after the series ended at the end of the next summer, saying that "peace and horses have come to the top of the dog".
From November, Kit will participate in a resurgence on 'True West' scene by Sam Shepard, which is the history of a film producer and his brother's gay.
The actor finally showed that meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he's got from "Game of Thrones".
'In this product I found the woman, so we can say that this show gave me the next family and determined my life from now on,' he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the sentimental interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantastic-scientific series of winning 'Emmy' prizes.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/Sida: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected throughout the country, health authorities say.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases have been transmitted through sexual relations, showing a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV virus spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who take the HIV virus in this way said that it had gone zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexualism was de-criminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that it still highlights discrimination against LGBT people.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have shown that 70-90% of men having sex with other men will eventually marry women.
Most of the transmission of the disease occurs because of insufficient protective measures during these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV-treatment medical barriers as part of the effort to address this problem.
Maxine Waters believes that the data of the GOP senators are shared by the staff members, saying these are "hazardous lies" and "conspirative theory"
US representative Maxine Waters claimed on Saturday that a member of her staff had posted personal information from three American senators on the list of lawmakers in Wikipedia.
Democracy from Los Angeles reported that these claims were being made by experts and online pages "of the right extreme".
"A lie, a lie, and only an absurd lie," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The information is reported to include addresses of the home and phone numbers of Utah's Utah South Carolina Senators Lindsey Graham and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
The information was displayed online on Thursday, posted by an invisible person at Capitol Hill during a hearing session of the Senate panel for sexual misconduct against the candidate for the High Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The flow of information came shortly after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh.
Some of the conservative pages, such as 'Gateway Pundit' and 'RedState', reported that IP addresses identifying the source of the publications were linked to the Waters office and took data from a Waters staff member, reports Hill.
"This false claim is totally false and a big lie," continued Waters.
"My staff member - identity, personal information and security that has been compromised as a result of these false and distorted claims - has been in no way responsible for the decline of this information.
This false claim is totally false and a big lie."
Waters' declaration immediately faced online criticism, including former secretary for the press of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This is done out of frustration," Fleischer wrote.
"This means that she does not have the right temper to be a Congress Member.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, he doesn't have to be nervous.
It doesn't have to be a provocation.
The accused's motives should not be raised in the minds.
He must be peaceful and peaceful."
Fleescher seemed to be comparing Water's reaction to Democrats' criticisms of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of having shown himself nervous during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is attempting to take Waters country in the middle of the mandate, also posted his statements on Twitter.
"Great truth, if it will be true," he wrote on Twitter.
In her Waters statement, her office had signaled "delegating authorities and law enforcement institutions on these false accusations.
"We will ensure that the authors are discovered," she continued, "and that they take legal responsibility for all their actions, which have devastating and dangerous effects on everyone from my stage."
Review of the film "Johnny English Comes Again" - Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
It has made it possible for every new film with British influence to be seen for hidden messages related to the subject of Brexit and this finds its implementation and in the revision of the Comedy-Accommodation Scheme "Johnny English" - which began in 2003 with Johnny English" and with the return in 2011 with Johnny English's "Directive".
Will this Satisfying Comedy remove the obvious lack of connection with the new national possibilities in the export field?
In any case, the face-to-face character of the country, with the face as a serpent and in view of Johnny English's behavior, has been authorized to confuse things for a second time -- his name, which shows more than anything else that he is a broad chemical creation that is spread out for territories where it is not spoken English, but that frequents Chinese.
Of course, he is a secret agent of the mina, who, despite being oddly claiming to appear as a magician, has a little of Inspector Clouseau, a little of Mr. Bean's character and a portion of that guy who only contributed to the release of a sound in the "Chariots of Fire" song, in the opening Olympic Games ceremony - London 2012.
He is also based on the man of mystery, travelr and international atkinson, who once played on television ads that are now forgotten by Barclaycard, leaving the country in chaos wherever he went.
There's one or two fun moments in the prize of this movie.
I liked him very much when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in a middle parsmour, and the helicopter’s speech was gradually spread into his helmet.
Here is the gift of the physical comedy they perform atkinson, but humor seems to be empty and sometimes too much, especially when the 'serious' films like 007 and the Unmixed Mission have entered a few comedians as ingredients in their films.
Humor seems to be directed to children more than the number of Johnny English’s adults and credulous events are not so creative and are focused on voiceless movements, the same as what Atkinson does in Bean’s character.
The permanent theme as well as in this film is the fact that Great Britain is in serious danger.
A cybernetic hacker has been infiltrated on the British agents' super-secret network, discovering the identity of British land agents and has led the agent into the task -- unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last chance for a prime minister who looks like a pontific and ready to fight, who is already suffering an extraordinary political apathy: Emma Thompson does better to realize the character that looks like Teresa May, but there are not many texts in the scene that she can play.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every active spy is compromised, so she will have to rely on someone who's retired.
And that means choosing yourself Johnny English, who was now employed as a school director in a high school area, but who unhesitatingly taught you how to become a secret agent: there's a nice scene here, because English is offering a spying academy in the form of rock school.
English calls again in Whitehall for an urgent meeting and is rescinded with his ex-husband, multi-year-old Bugh, who is again playing by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, associated with a nine-year-old captain, in the role of a high-school girl, where Vicki Pepperdine has used a little mistake about this role.
So Batman and Robin did all the things back in Her Majesty's Secret Service, they're back in action, meeting with the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is enthralled by a billion-dollar attractive technology who claims to be able to solve the difficulties of British computers: Jason Volta, a link played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their ridiculous, ridiculous smiles: masked as cameras, they set up a beautiful French restaurant; they cause chaos as they enter the luxury exit of the Voltage; and English is completely confused as they try to use the virtual Realty assets to identify themselves with the inner parts of the Volta's house.
All sequences usually become for the final stage, but regardless of joy and excitement, everything seems a little like a movie for children.
It's pretty moderate.
And as in other movies, Johnny English, I couldn't think: isn't the British film industry a role for Rowan Atkinson to adapt to his talents?
The Laburist Party believes that there is a plan for Britishs to work four days a week but to pay for five days
The Laburist party headed by Jeremy Corby is considering a radical plan that would make the British work four days a week -- but pay for five.
The party reports that the heads of companies want to cut themselves by using the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) for employees, giving them an extra day of rest.
We would see that the workers would enjoy a weekend with three days of rest — but by continuing to take them home in the same suit.
The sources said the idea would "suppose" with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the country into the favor of the workers.
Walking in a week with four days of work is an idea that is shared by the Syndicate Congress, as a way workers benefited from the economy in a different way.
A high-level source of the Laburist Party said 'The Sunday Times': 'Before the end of the year a policy change is expected to be announced.
'It won't happen immediately, but a week with four days of work is an ambition corresponding to the party's failure to balance the economy in favour of employees as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party.'
The Laburist Party will not be the first to share this idea, where and the Gelber Party has been run for a week and four days working during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, this ambition is not currently supported by the entire Laburist Party.
One member of the Laburist Party said, "A week and four days' work is not the party's policy, and it's not getting any publicity from the party."
The office in Hije, John McDonnell, used the last week's Laburist Party conference to share his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to pass the power by "anonymous directors" and "beneficiaries" to public service firms.
Chancellor plans in summer also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not take away all their shares, because the labor government can run a 'birth' with the reasoning of actions considered to be a breach.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and to create the All-Inclusive Property Fund to pass on to 10 percent of the private sector company capital, which means an annual dividend paid up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy shows at "60 Minutes", if FBI investigation on Kavanaugh can change their mind
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raises questions if the finding of the investigation bureau could affect a Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview that will be broadcast Sunday, the emission correspondent "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his college from South Carolina.
"I'll tell you, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said that when I went to the hearing session, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I got her on the phone after this happened, so when the charges came up, I said, "Did you do this?"
He was determined and clear."
Nevertheless, Graham’s vote seems to be stuck in the rock.
"I shared the thought of Brett Kavanaugh and the change would only make some bomb accusations," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly rejected him," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"Of whoever she mentioned could not verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see anything going to change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has done anything to put poverty in its place?
This week, New York will host the "Global Citizen" Festival, an annual musical show that contains a large and exciting list of stars that interpret and also have a mission that is so exciting; to end poverty in the world.
Now, in his seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will wait for thousands of people at the Great Lawn Park to enjoy not only the interpretations of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to be aware of the real purpose of the show, to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of lawyers, which hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
In order to benefit from a credit card for the show (except when you want to pay a VIP ticket), participants must meet a number of obligations, or "activities" as voluntary work, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way that would help raise awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been when they've stayed and 12 years to achieve their goal?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a concert really work to convince those who ask for this intervention, or is it just another case of what is known as "click activation" -- people who feel they're making a real change by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported that more than 19 million "actions" have been registered by its supporters, giving them a boost to different objectives.
It is said that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to declare political commitments worth $37 billion, which is said to affect lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 claims and declarations as a result of the group's actions, where at least $10 billion has already been distributed or secured as funds.
The group estimates that the funds provided so far have directly affected about 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main masters include "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership of investors and implementing agencies centrally in the United Kingdom, committed to "encourage children to grow with their full potential," promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help put an end to corruption in this country, after receiving more than 4700 "circulation" from Global Citizen activists.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world like you, we can turn social injustice of abuse into a memory of the past," the ambassador's team "The Power of Nutrition" told him at a live concert in London, in April 2018.
The group also said that after launching 5000 actions to call on the United Kingdom to improve food for mothers and children, the government declared funding for a project, "The Power of Nutrition", which will affect 5 million women and children who need food intervention.
In an answer to the most common questions on their website, "What makes you believe that we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen answered: "It will be a long and difficult journey - sometimes we will be and fail.
But as every high citizen's right and as anti-participation movement before us, we're going to go out, because we're stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the actors who will interpret this year's show in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. can use the sea for "blockage" to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
"If necessary" Washington may rely on his Navy to prevent Russian energy spread across the market, including the Middle East, has revealed the US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner's invitation.
Zinke claims that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially where it is operating at the request of the Syrian government — is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to provide it with energy as they do with Eastern Europe, the southern European boat," he said.
And according to this official, there are ways to deal with this problem.
"The United States has the ability, with our Marine, to ensure that the coastal roads are open and, if necessary, to block them, so as to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was directed to participants in an activity developed by the Energy Consumer Alliance, a non-profit organization that has identified itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's cuts to Iran's Russian treatment, realizing that these cuts are practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is a little bit of the use and replacement of fire extinguishers," he said, while referring to Russia as "a fraud-free fish" with an economy dependent on fossil fire extinguishers.
The declarations come after the Trump administration has undertaken a mission to increase exports of natural gas bound to Europe, thus replacing Russia, a much more free option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's administration officials, including American President Donald Trump himself, are trying to obey Germany to withdraw from the North Stream 2 journalist's "inappropriate" project, which, according to Trump, has turned Berlin into a Moscow's "slave".
Moscow has consistently expressed that the 11 billion-dollar North Stream 2 project, which is supposed to double the existing greenhouse capacity to carry 110 billion cubic metres, is a clean economic project.
Kremlin argues that the fire-fighting of the project by Washington is simply made for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the same idea that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to select the supplier," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with American Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. attitude has provoked opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to this project.
The main organisation for industry in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a lot of problems when a third state intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempp, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "think seriously" if she will apply for presidents in 2020, Masaçusets' senator says
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "think seriously" taking part in the race for the president after the election in the middle of the mandate.
During a meeting in the city of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would accept the candidate.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and regulate our destroyed government, and this includes the decision of a woman on top," she said 'The Hill'.
"After 6 November, I will take seriously the candidate for presidents."
Warren hit President Donald Trump during the siege in the city, saying he "is taking the place in the wrong direction.
"I'm terribly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren knows about her criticism of Trump and his candidate for High Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a petition Friday, Warren said, "I'm sure we need an investigation from the FBI before the vote."
However, a Thursday survey showed that a large part of Warren’s voters do not think it should be candidate in 2020.
Eighty-five percent of Masaçusets' "possible" voters said the senator should not apply, according to surveys conducted by the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Political Research Centre.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidate.
The survey showed that former Governor Deval Patrick was pleased with the greater support for candidates, where 38 percent supported a possible candidate and 48 percent opposed this candidate.
Other high-profile democracies discussed to compete in 2020 include former president, Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would be officially appointed in January, reports 'Associated Press'.
Sarah Palin quotes Trak Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump's club
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after he was drafted into the army in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with a family violence incident
"What's going on, what's going on, what's going on after he's back, can be linked to other families that feel the spread of PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers return," she told participants in a tunnel for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said her son and others are fighting, "they come a little different, forced, thinking if they get due respect for the soldiers and the other soldiers and other soldiers, for what they gave the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with family violence after an attack on a woman, after a family violence report and detention while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a police department spokesman in Wasilla.
18 states, D.C. support opposition to a new asylum policy
Eighty states and the Caribbean are supporting a legal objection to a new American policy denying the asylum of victims who have been rescued from criminal groups or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 countries and the circle deposited an explanation document as a friend of the court in Washington on Friday, in support of the change in asylum policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the defendant on the Grace case against the session that the United States of Civil Liberties has deposited in August against federal policy has not been found.
She said her partner "and her violent boys members of the band," abused her, but the US officials denied her asylum request on July 20th.
She was banned in Texas.
State lawyers who are supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as producing a high number of asylum applicants in the United States because they are countries with problems with gangs and domestic violence.
A new asylum-search policy in the United States, issued a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed immigrants without documents to save violence in the family and apply for asylum.
The General Prosecutor of the Caribbean, General Karl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "inspires all decades of state, federal and international laws."
"The federal laws require all asylum applications to be judged according to the specific facts and circumstances of the case, and such a measure is opposed to this principle," said the friend-of-the-law report.
Further lawyers argued in the report that the ban on the entry of immigrants had damaged the American economy, saying that their risks were to be businessmen and to "provide the necessary burden of work."
General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions, ordered immigration judges in June not to be subjected to any more victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Azili is available for those who leave their country because of fear or persecution based on race, religious faith, nationality or belonging to a designated group of social or political obedience," the session said on June 11th, on the day of the political declaration.
Azili has never thought to ease all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate Efforts to Save in Palu while the balance of death is doubled in a line to be saved
By the way of survival, the situation was the same.
"The situation is quite tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, while keeping her little sick son at an evacuation center in the ruined city of Palu.
"Ambulance brings bodies every minute.
There's no clean water anymore."
The peasants saw to be returned to their destroyed houses, carrying their dead bodies into the water, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals damaged by 7.5 balloons have been hit.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who has broken the corridor and the shed, are located in the Military Hospital outside Palu, where patients are being treated in the external environment because earthquakes continue to occur.
His eyes filled with tears as he recalled the violent earthquake in the hotel room in the fifth floor of the hotel that separated him from his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was pushed under the walls," Haris said 'Associated Press', adding that his family had come to the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife was crying and asking for help, but then she stopped.
I don't know what happened to him and my kid.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of 'dangicm' with 'progandistic advertising'
A week after China's official newspaper posted a four-page advertisement on a daily American promotion of the common benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread its propaganda.
US President Donald Trump, last Tuesday, referred to the supplement with China Daily's page in the 'Des Moines Register' - the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa - after he accused China of attempting to intervene in the US Congress's elections held on 6 November, a charge rejected by China.
Trump's allegations that Beijing was trying to intervene in US elections noted what US officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in Washington's campaign to increase China's pressure.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a top-up trade war that has seen a comparison of tariffs on one another's imports.
Chinese and American experts have said that China's foreign tariffs in this trade war were destined to attack exporters in such countries as Iowa, which has supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former governor for a long time in Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an opinion published in the 'Des Moines Register' Sunday, Branstad wrote that, "China is already rebutting this attack by putting propaganda advertising on our free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is being helped by the American joyful tradition of the free word and free press setting up a advertising with the pay in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in newspapers on the streets here in Beijing, there will be a lot of voices against and you will not see any real reflection of the different ideas that the Chinese may have for China's worrying economic tractor, since the media is under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most widely distributed newspapers in China, was denied the offer to publish his article," regardless of whether he told him what the newspaper was.
Analysts warn that Republicans are voting women before the elections in the middle of the mandate after the Kavanaugh scandal
The more the main figures of Republicans are solidarityd and protecting the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, prior to some allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will face a severe response, especially by women, in future elections within the mandate.
Emotions for this topic have been high, and many republics have publicly declared that they want to continue voting for the candidate.
These things can't disappear," Grant Reeher, professor of political sciences at the University of Siracuza 'Scholl School Maxwell said 'The Hill' for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he was questioning Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation and that this would be enough to calm angry voters.
"The cities won't forget what happened yesterday--they won't forget it either tomorrow or November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a top-level national adviser and spokesman for the progressive 'MoveOn' group, said Washington D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters sang 'Nintor is coming!' while demonstrators in the Senate corridors while the Republicans in charge of the Judicial Committee decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's bid regardless of the evidence of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, said 'Mic'.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach May," news page Stu Rothenberg, a independent political analyst, said.
"People are saying it's already been at high levels; that's true.
But it can be even higher, especially among unannounced voters in the peripheral and among young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although not pleased with the president, usually don't vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the High Court's candidate, analysts suggested that there would be a serious reaction if the Republicans continued to support this candidate.
"It has changed into a co-laden attack for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former head of the National Committee of Republicans, at the beginning of last week, according to 'NBC News'.
"It is not only with the vote of the committee or the final vote or if Kavanaugh is to be set or not in the bank and the accused, it also does so in the way that the Republicans have dealt with this issue and in the way that the woman has been treated," said NBC News, Guy Cecil, U.S. President of Priorities, a group that helps in selecting Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided by those who believe in the wake of Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with this latter having a little higher support.
A recent survey by 'YouGov' shows that 41 per cent of respondents believe in the accident or with the possibility of Ford witness, while 35 per cent say they believe in the accident or with the possibility of Kavanaugh.
Also, 38 per cent believe that Kavanaugh, possibly or otherwise, has lied during his witnessing, while only 30 per cent say the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's insinuations, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations presented by Ford as well as the other accused, Deborah Ramirez, reports 'The Guardian'.
Last week, Ford witnessed before the Senate's Judicial Committee, under oath, that Kavanaugh attacked him at the age of 17, while he was in a state of shock.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed his genital organs before her while they were at a party during their study in Yale, 80's.
World Network Creator Plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the World Network, is creating a company that aims to revaliate Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built from the open source platform of Berners-Lee, called "Solid".
'Solid' allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons are allowed to have access to a particular information.
In an exclusive interview for 'Fast Company', Berners-Lee joked that the goal after 'Inrupt' is "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said about this innovative company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create "save their personal data on the network" or a POD.
It can include contact lists, list items to do, music lists, and other personal and professional tools.
It's the same as having available on a browser and at the same time Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify.
What's unique about keeping personal data on the network is the fact that the user is totally in the hands of what kind of information will access.
The company calls it "personal power through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the executive director of the company, John Bruce, is to bring together the necessary resources, processes and skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a secure platform purchased by IBM, some developers hired to work on this project, and a voluntary coding community.
Starting from this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications using available tools on the Inrupt web page.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google whether they should present or not a total change where all their business models are completely over during the night.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post published in 'Media' on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission "is to provide trade energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new network built in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Network Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network independence.
Even if it is based on Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Global Network Consortium, the Network Foundation and the Institute of Hapura Women.
"I'm very optimistic about this new age of the network," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Victorian Church during World War I for the Clergy · Global Voices
The only church that has won a Victorian Church during World War I as a warrior has been remembered in his country, 100 years later.
Lower Colonel Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 1918, in the Bellenglish and Lehacourt attack.
However, he was killed by a rapist four days later and never heard of his winning the highest British military title.
A memorial stone was presented by his two kidneys in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the kidneys, Michael Vann, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the memory was exactly 100 years from the heroic act that gave his grandfather the medal.
According to 'London Gazette', on September 29, 1918, Undercoloneli Vann directed his battalion through the channel of Saint-Quentin "through a thick cloud and under the cover of bullets from the fields and mitralosses."
He then rushed to the fire line, and with a "great threat" led the battle forward and caught one of the weapons in the field, and only killed three persons from the opposing bodies.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German snowman on October 4, 1918 - less than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions "are something he can never achieve but something that really looks modest."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, decided by a post-paradise choir, which was directed by the Brentwood Imperial Youth group.
Michael Vann said that "it was quite honorable to be part of this parade" and added that "the value of a real hero is being shown by the support given to many people."
MMA fans stayed all night awake to follow Bellator 206, but instead saw "Derkuzen Pepa"
Imagine, you've been awake all night to see Bellator 206, and then you're taking the chance to see this main event.
The exhibition from San Jose contained 13 dormitories, including six dormitories in the base package and will show in real time during the night on channel 5, in MB.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, viewers in Britain were surprised when the transmission changed to show Derkuc Pepa.
Some remained disappointed after staying awake all night until the first hours, especially for this attack.
A fan on Twitter described this passage from the struggle in a visual film for children as "a bad joke."
"It is the government's rules that determine that at 6 a.m. that content was not appropriate to it and should be passed on to a programme for children," said Dave Schwartz, the vice-president of marketing and communication in Bellator, when asked about transmission.
"The Pepa Dwarf," yes.
Bellator's president, Scott Cooker, said they will work on programming to include and viewers from Britain in the future.
"When I think about retransmission, I think we can solve it," said Coker.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning, tomorrow and we won't be able to solve this problem until Sunday with our hour, so Monday with their hour.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, there were many messages surrounding them, and none of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen next time.
We're going to do the show with 5 matches in six places -- as we usually do -- we're able to give more about the fans and maybe we've crossed the line.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'lower' about his sexuality
Olympic explorer Tom Daley says that he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality — but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
24-year-old said he didn't understand until he went to nine-year-old school that "they were all like me."
Speaking of the first program on Radio 4 of 'Desert Island Discs,' presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he raised the voice for the rights of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said that after becoming a parent, he thought less about winning Olympic medals.
The lasting presentation of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, has been resting for a few months because it is sick.
Acting as a person guided in Laverne's first program, Daley said that during his growing age he felt "inferior" to others because "it was not acceptable on the social side to like boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, those feelings of inferiority, and the fact that I felt differently, have been the real elements that gave me strength and strength to keep them."
He wanted to prove that he was worth "something," he said, not to disappoint everyone when they heard of his sexual orientation.
Twice winning the bronze Olympic medal, he is already an activist of the high-profile LGBT profile and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to legitimize homosexuality.
He said he came open because he felt happy that he was able to live openly and without consequences and that he wanted to give others a "hope."
Three times the world's campaign said the fall in love with a man - American film producer Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 - "I got unprepared."
Last year, Daley married the Oscar prize winner, who is 20 years older than he, but said the difference in age was never a problem.
"When he experiences so many things at such a new age" -- he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone at the same age who had experienced the same low-sickness.
The couple became parents in June, a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "all perspectives" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, everything I thought was 'I'd have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son holds the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with cancer in his head.
Daley said that his father did not admit that he would die and that one of the last things he had asked was if we had tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be on the first line.
"I can't tell 'you won't be in the first row," he said.
"I was holding his hand as he received the breath and only after the breath was taken and changed his life for the first time that he was not innocent," he said.
The next year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life -- to kneel before the local public in the Olympic Games, it had no better feeling," he said.
Also, this inspired his first musical choice -- Proud by Heather Small -- that has associated him during preparations for the Olympic Games and continues to cause mornica.
Desert Island Discs is delivered to BBC Radio on Sunday 4 at 11:15 p.m., with British time.
Mickelson, out of shape, left on table on Saturday at Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th fight at Ryder Cup, but he will have to change his shape so that he doesn't turn this historical moment into disappointment.
Mickelson, who is the 12th time that he participates in this event, a record of this himself, which is organized every two years, was left on the table by Captain Jim Furyk during the games of dissidents (fourballs and Foursomes).
Instead of being at the center of the action, as has usually been for the United States, five times the winner of the large titles passed the day by supporting the team and working with hope that he would leave behind the concerns.
Not among the players with the fairest hit even when he was at the top of his career, 48-year-old is not a suitable player for Le Golf National's complex field, where long and difficult areas do not leave room for wrong shootings.
And if it wasn't enough for just the fear of the field, Mickelson, Sunday, in the ninth battle, will face the British Open campaign, Francesco Molinari, who has formed a team with beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win their fourth match this week.
If the Americans, who have four points less, before the start of the 12 rounds, are going to start rough, Michaelson's game can lead to decisive results.
Hatyk expressed confidence in his player, even though he could not say more than that.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a sword strike, threw my hand into my neck and told me it would be almost tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has great faith in himself.
He's in the Famous Hall, and he's made a lot of contributions for these teams in the past week, and for this week.
Maybe I didn't think he'd have two fights.
I had thought more, but in the end it turned out that way and we thought it was the solution.
He wants to be in the field, like anyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will record Nick Faldo for the player with more presentations in Ryder Cup's contests.
It can mark the end of his career at Ryder Cup, where he has not been at the height of his individual performances.
Mickelson has 18 winners, 20 losses and seven comparisons, although Furyk said his presentation brings value to the team.
"He's a gazmo, sarcastic, tough, he likes to attack people, and he's a fantastic boy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I also think the younger players were happy to meet him this week, and this was fun to see.
He gives more than just games."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big head can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that the considerable headway ahead of the last day of the games in Ryder Cup can be transformed into an inconsistencies.
Danez made his debut in the battle of 1997, in Valderrama, where the team with Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead against the Americans and closed the tournament with a very close difference, 1411⁄2-1311⁄2.
"It reminds itself that we had a big head in Valderrama; we had a big head in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram where we won but with many difficulties," said Bjorn, who was photographed after not winning 5-3 in the 'Class 2018' Friday and Sunday to head 10-6 in the 'Le Golf National'.
So history tells me and everyone on that team that it's not over.
Tomorrow we'll go with the last march.
We'll go there and we'll do the right thing.
Nothing's done until we get the points in the table.
We have a goal, we're trying to win this trophi, and here's our focus.
I told him all the time, I'm focused on the 12 players we have in the team, but we're aware of who we've got the best players in the world."
Happy with the performance of his players in a tough golf field, Bjorn added: "I don't want to rush into this phase.
Tomorrow we'll face another 'serving'.
Tomorrow they see individual performances, and that's something else to do.
It's fantastic when you're in the field with a partner, when things go well, but when you're alone, then you're testing your full capacity as a golf player.
This is the message you have to pass to the players, tomorrow you have to give the best of yourself.
Now, forget the partner after he has to go and give the best of his own."
By contrast with Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will hope that his players will perform better individually than with partners, where only Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas will take three of the four possible points.
Furyk himself has experienced two major returns on the last day, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn before losing what is considered "Merculia in Medina" by the European team.
"I remember every word," when he asked how he had motivated his players during the last day of Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999.
"We have 12 important struggles tomorrow, but we must have a good start, as we saw in Brooklyn and Medinah.
When I get down to one end, I put a lot of pressure on the average.
We set the training based on this, and we'll get the boys out of the order we believe is best, after you know it, we're trying to perform a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has the duty to launch the performance and will face Rory McIlroy in the main battle, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fletwood and Ian Poulter with European players who take their positions in the first half of the order
"I chose this group and in this order that I believe it covers all the way to the contest," Bjorn said about his next election.
Addition of the new German battle
The new German Navy fleet must have been sent in 2014 to replace the wartime wars of the winter war, but it will not be until the next year because of the problem systems and too high costs, local media have reported.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main new "Baden-Wuertemberg-class" freighter, has been driven to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper "Die Zeit" which quotes a military caller.
Godia had to join Marina in 2014, but the problems after transmission damaged the ambitious project's fate.
Four vessels of the "Baden-Wertemberg-class" recommended by the Navy in 2007, will serve as the replacement of the old "Bremen-class" frigates.
The knowledge will include a powerful ball, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft rockets and steel detection technology, such as a reduction in radiation detection, red infrared and acoustic waves.
Some of the other important characteristics include longer maintenance periods - should be possible for new brakes to be removed for more than two years from the country’s ports.
However, further delays mean that recent technological struggles - which are said to enable Germany to reflect foreign power - will be old at the time they come into service, wrote 'Die Zeit'.
F125's F125's party came to the first page last year, when the German Navy officially rejected the ship's proposal and returned it to the Blohm & Voss's maritime office in Hamburg.
This was the first time that Marina turned a ship to her construction worker after her delivery.
There was little information about the reasons for the return, but the media in Germany mentioned that they were a number of "big bugs in soft and hardware" that made the ship useless during a war mission.
The problems in the programme were particularly important in the Baden-Wuertemberg-class ships because they will be operated by a crew of 120 mariners - half of the staff of the old "Bremen class" fleet.
It was also discovered that the ship was too high, which reduced its yield and limited Marina’s ability to further improvements in the future.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tonnes is believed to be the weight of ships of the same category as used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to the physical features of the problem, the cost of the whole project - including the training of the crew - is also becoming a problem.
It's said he's got a figure to leave without a word of $3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - from €2.2 billion that was originally predicted.
The problems encountered by the new frigates become especially important after recent warnings that German marine power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee in the German parliament, admitted that Marina was "killing the proper ships to move to another country."
The officer said that the problem had been added over time because old ships had been removed from use but were not replaced with new ones.
He said unfortunately that none of the new Baden-Wuertemberg class frigates would be able to join the Navy.
The National Trust Watches the Night's Secret Life
A new research being developed by a company in the dark areas of Scotland is aimed at discovering how night lakurs used land to hunt for food.
It is hoped that new discoveries will shed new light on the conduct of flying alone and will help safeguard activities in the future.
A study by scientists in the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual night walkers and soprano pipistrelles as well as the caffe ears and daubenton lakes in the Inverwe gardens, in Western Ross.
Special registration equipment will be placed at key points throughout the area to monitor night-care activities throughout the season.
NHS and volunteers will also conduct field studies using hand detectors.
An analysis of the sounds that will be performed by experts for all records will determine the frequency of the night’s noises and what each species does.
Next, a report and a map of their home will be drawn to give a detailed overview of their conduct.
Rob Dewar, a natural defense adviser to NTS, hopes that the conclusions will show which habitats are most important for night-carers and how they are used by each species.
This information would help to determine the benefits of local administration, such as the creation of flowers, and how the trees are kept for the night turtles and other related species.
The number of nightly refugees in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has decreased dramatically over the past century.
They are under threat of construction and development that affect the soil and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and heating can also pose a risk, as shown by rising letters or chemical components of construction materials, as well as attacks on domestic animals.
In fact, the night's spiders are not blind.
However, because of their practice of fasting during the night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to holding a waiting attitude.
They use sophisticated navigation techniques through sounds to accurately define insects and obstacles during flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important fields and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is very seriously affected by nightlights.
There are ten trained experts who conduct regular studies, language inspections, and sometimes include rescue programs.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserve in Scotland dedicated to the nightly lakes in Threeves, Dumfries and Galloway, which serves as a home for eight of the ten species of night lakes in Scotland.
The administrator of these reserves, David Thompson, says this country is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threaves we have a great area for the night's skiers," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all the right habitat.
But there's still a lot of things about the nightlights that remain unsatisfied, so the work we do here and in other countries will help us understand more about what they need in order to develop."
He stresses the importance of carrying out night-care checks prior to the performance of property maintenance tasks because there is the possibility that the sudden destruction of a home can kill up to 400 female and young women and thus engulf the whole population of a area.
Nightlights are also protected and their killing, assault, and anxiety or destruction of their speech is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrrell, a Scottish worker at the Night Lacuries Protection Trust, encourages people to become part of the relief team.
She said, "We still have much to learn about our bats at night and many of our species, we just don't know how their people are moving."
Ronaldo rejects the prosecution charges while the lawyers are preparing to accuse the German magazine
Cristian Ronaldo said the charges against him are "false science," saying people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to challenge the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published these accusations.
Portuguese and Juventus Sulmour has been charged with the appointment of an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
On Friday, Der Spiegel reported that he was later alleged to have paid her $375,000 not to talk about the incident.
Speaking in a video live in Instagram, directed 142 million of his followers, only a few hours after the publication of these claims, Ronaldo, 33 years old, considered the reports "false teachings."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What she told you today, false news," said the camera five times the winner of the Art Cup.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but this is part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is going well," added the player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldos' lawyers are preparing to accuse "Der Spiegel" of these accusations, which they have called "impossible reports of doubts about private life,".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "the moral dimensions of the value corresponding to the seriousness of the decline, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is reported to have occurred in June 2009, in a corner of Palms Hotel and Kazino in Las Vegas.
According to documents presented at the Clark District Court, Nevada, after meeting at a club night, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have gone to the player's room, where he is claimed to have abused him in the year.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo went to hell after the alleged incident and said "99 per cent" he is a "good boy" lying in the balsam from "a percentage."
The document says that Ronaldo confirms that both of them have committed sexual intercourse but that he was with the presence of both sides.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and had photos of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to a decision outside the court because she was "crazed by the court" and was concerned that she would be "publicly tortured."
34 years old says she's now trying to get the deal back because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to the connection with Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, and this summer passed to the Italian giants of Juventus in an agreement of 100m euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "will forever repent" of losing the status of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "will be forgiven forever" if it loses world leaders' status in the production of cars after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "an alarming" that Toyota in the United Kingdom had told the BBC that if Britain was to leave the EU without an agreement, the company would temporarily stop production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on the border, in the event of non-contractual exit, would cost the loss of jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, which produces the models Toyota Auris and Avenis, sold nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other European Union countries.
"In my judgment, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's administrative director in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in MB, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have voiced fear of leaving the EU without agreement and of how the intermediation trade will work.
For example, BMW said that after Brexit would close her Mini series factory for a month.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers refer to as the risk of a supply chain in the case of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line works on the basis "immediately as soon as the recommendation," with every 37 minutes coming from suppliers from the MB and the EU, for cars with orders.
If, on 29 March, the MB leaves the EU without an agreement, there may be delays within which this industry can lead to delays and lack of shares.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep the inventory in her factory in Derbyshire more than one day, the company said, and to slow down the production would stop.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's 'Chequers' plan for future EU relations "is specially built to avoid these border controls."
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the moment to also take advantage of this opportunity," he said for today's program on BBC Radio 4.
"The data, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, show that we must be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain."
Toyota could not determine how long it would stop production, but in the long run, warned that the increased costs would undermine the competitiveness of the factory and would eventually lead to the reduction of the jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and who is the top U.S. union officer in the factory, said that members are increasingly concerned: "As far as my experience is concerned at the time these countries close, they don't come back.
One government spokesman said, "We have set a ambitious and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be resumed, says the White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with general prosecutor Rod Rosenstein can "be up for a week" after the war continues for the High Court's candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, said the White House Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's electoral interventions, ties between Trump's and Russia's auxiliary staff and the possibility that the president has banned justice.
The discussion whether Trump will download or not to replace the general prosecutor with the task, thus putting Mueller's independence at risk, is something created for months in Washington.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein took into account the position of a candidate to record talks with Trump and the possibility of the president's discharge through the amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied this news.
But last month, he went to the White House, among the reports that he was near delivery.
Despite the prospect of Thursday a meeting with Trump, which took place at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said "would prefer" not to download Rosenstein, but after the meeting he added to avoid an explosion with the hearing session held by the Senate's judicial committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh, further stressing the full vote in Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was present today at Fox News Sunday.
When she asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "There's not yet a date, it can be this week.
But, let's see, and I always like keeping the press up to date."
Some journalists may object to this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Moderator Chris Wallace raised the question why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences did not come as a result of the discontent with TV journalists," although she said, "I will not deny the fact that they draw attention."
Then, she lets you know that direct contact between Trump and the press will be increased.
"The president realizes more quality assurance sessions than any other president before him," she said, adding, without mentioning: "We have seen these figures."
There will continue to be a press conference, Sanders said, but "if the press has the chance to ask directly to the President of the United States, then this is much better than you talk to me.
We're trying to do this often, and you've seen that we've often done it over the past few weeks, replacing press conferences in cases where you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in the open session or at a press conference with important personalities.
Individual press conferences are rare.
The president may have explained the reason for this fact, during this week in New York, where he made a controversial exit and in some strange cases, before journalists.
Health Secretary wrote to EU workers in NHS Scotland about the fear of Brexit
The Health Secretary has written EU posts working in NHS in Scotland to express gratitude on behalf of the country and the desire to stay even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Scottish MPs, has sent a letter, after they have stayed less than six months from the EU's departure from the EU.
The Scottish government has already taken over covering the application costs for permanent residence status for EU citizens working in public services at local level.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations for the removal of the MB from the EU have continued, approaching the decision of an old age.
However, the MB government has also intensified its preparations in the case of an unaccompanied scanner.
I know it's a long time of concern for all of you.
For this reason, I wanted to stress how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
EU colleagues also bring valuable experience and skills that grow and improve the work of health service, increasing the benefits of patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home's waste and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is subjected to an emergency surgical intervention after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie's protector signed an immediate surgical intervention following the head injury on Saturday, in the 31-27 loss against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported The Tennessee newspaper, Mike Organ.
Tennesse State Rod Reed trainer told reporters that the damage happened just before the first part.
"He came to the aisle and fell there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen to the aneurysm before they placed it in the barrel and sent it for further examinations.
A Tennessee State official told WSMV Chris Harris in Nashville that Abercrombie had completed surgical intervention at Vanderbilt Hospital Center.
Harris added that "there's still no details about the type/skilling scale" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the damage happened.
Abercrombie, the second year's student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He carried out five interviews on Saturday before he left the game, bringing it to the total number of interventions during the season.
Foreign nationals will pay the highest dust tax when buying a property in MB
Foreign nationals will pay the highest dust tax for the sale of a property in the MB, and foreign currency will be used to assist the innocent in accordance with the new Conservative Party's plans (Tory)
This move will neutralize Corby's success in attracting new voters
Amount of money will be applied to those who do not pay taxes in MB
The treasure department expects to collect up to 120 million GBP per year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will pay the highest dust tax for buying a property in the MB, and the money will be used to help the innocent.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corby's initiative's success to attract new voters with promises to offer more sustainable shelter and to "sit down" people with high profits.
The money tax will apply to individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in MB, while foreign money will support the government's initiative to combat the lack of housing.
This extra fee - which is added to the current wage tax, including the increase in the level of the wage presented two years ago for the second house and for the property purchased for rent - can go up to three per cent.
Thesari's department predicts that this move will group up to 120 million GBP per year.
About 13 per cent of the last property built in London is sold by people with extra MB location, resulting in price increases and making it harder to find housing by buyers for the first time.
Many of the country's rich areas - especially in capitals - have turned to "fathomic cities" because of the high number of foreign-national bloggers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in pay tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of maintaining high prices by buying land but not putting it into use, and called on the lady. May remove her hand from the doors for durable homes, with a view to settling "British storm with property."
Mr. Corbyn has proposed some exciting reforms for building, including control of the roof and removal of "no reason".
He also wants to give more power to advice on building a new home.
Mr. May said, "Last year I declared that I would dedicate my prime minister's mandate to the restoration of the British dream -- so, for a better life for every new generation.
And that means settling the problem of homes.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build a life here.
However, it is not right for individuals who do not live in the MB and foreign societies to buy home more easily than British employees.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has made something too difficult to achieve, and injustice to orphans is more real."
Jack Ross: 'My biggest ambition is to train Scotland'
Sunderland trainer Jack Ross says "his greatest ambition" is to become Scotland's coach at a particular stage.
Scotland, 42 years old, is experiencing the challenge of raising the northern-lindor club, which is currently located in the third place in League One (third category), three points away from the head.
He came this Friday at the Light Station after returning St. Mirren to the Premier League of Scotland last season.
"I wanted to play for my place as a player.
It was once presented to representative B and only so," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
"But, as a child, I grew up seeing Scotland many times in Hampden with my father, and it's something that has always attracted me.
However, this option will only come if I'm successful in directing the clubs."
Ross' predecessors to the Sunderland direction include Dick Advocates, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyt and Paulo Di Canio.
Aloa Athletic's former coach says he's not concerned that he's following the steps of these big names in such a big club, after he's previously rejected offers from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"For the moment, my success will depend on the fact that 'I can return this team to the Premier Law?'
Given the structure and environment of this club, we believe it has its place in the Premier Law," he said.
"It's not a simple task to go there, but I'd see myself as successful only if I can get the club back to Premier Law."
Ross's only three years of career as a trainer after a period as a trainer assistant in Dumbarton and a 15-year period at Hearts leading stage.
Then he helped Alla develop a higher category up to the third round of the cup, as well as transformed St. Mirren from a club near the category down to the champion's winners next season.
And now, Ross says he feels better than he's ever felt during his career as a player to Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"Perhaps there was really a turning point," he says, for taking Alla's direction.
"I really believed that training was the right thing for me, more than being a player.
It seems strange because I played well, made a good life thanks to this profession, and enjoyed some good accomplishments.
But being a player can be difficult.
You have to have a lot of things, every week.
Now, I'm experiencing a lot of stress and pressure from work, but training seems to be the right thing.
I've always wanted to train and now I've been doing something like that, and I've never been so good and so much as my whole life as an adult."
Full interview can be heard on Sunday, in Sportsound, on September 30, on Radio Scotland from 12:00 to 13:00 BST
According to a study, perfect time "to drink a beer" is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave has increased local revenues in difficult situations in Britain, but has increased pressure on restaurant drivers.
The data show that sales in local and color groups increased by 2.7 per cent in July, but in restaurants the prices dropped by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at the CGA, who applied the data, said: "The constant sun as well as England's participation in the World Cup was expected to have the same trend as the circle, where local sales increased by 2.8 per cent, while restaurants recorded even higher decline.
I went to restaurants with 1.8% in June, and it was even more appropriate in July.
Bars and locals with major activity in the supply of drinks recorded the best performance, with higher increases than the reduction of trade in restaurants.
The main locations of food supply were also known as the result of the sun’s climate, although not as significant as restaurants.
Looks like people just want to get out for a drink.
Bar and local drinks sales increased by 6.6 percent that month, while food fell by three percent."
Paul Newman, a free time analyst and friendliness at RSM, said: "These results confirm the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales in the informal market, the trend and impact of important social or sports events remain the main factors.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to experience difficulties, although a decline in sales by 4.8 percent per cent per year will have a particularly heavy burden, considering the constant cost pressure.
The longer and hot summer could not come at a more difficult time for food operators and time will show if the more moderate dry temperatures will bring much more peace."
The total increase in sales in local and restaurants, including those on average, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the launch of markets.
Coffer Peach's index of industry sales monitoring, for the color and restaurant sector in MB, collects and analyzes data from 47 companies, with total turnover of more than 9 billion GBP, and is a point of industry reference.
One out of five children has secret figures in parental social media
According to one study, one out of five children, some of whom are not over 11 years of age, have secret figures in the social media that are hidden from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 nine-year-old students showed increases in Insta's "false Insta" profiles.
This news has increased the fear of sexual harassment
Nine hundred percent of students said they have a "primary" count that shows parents.
One out of five children, some of whom are not over 11 years of age, is opening accounts in social media that use adult media.
A survey of 20,000 nine-year-old students showed rapid increase in Insta's "false Insta" profiles - related to the photo distribution page, Instagram.
This news has raised the fear of pornography.
Nine hundred percent of students said they use a clean "primary" account that shows parents, but they also have private accounts.
A mother, who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, discovered that a teenager urged others to "get drunk."
The UK Digital Avarences study and the Headmasters and Headmasters Conference (HMC) of independent schools revealed that 40 per cent of the group from 11 to 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them admitted that they had hidden figures.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are trying to create social spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be "a voice of athletes" on the Atlantic coast in Scotland.
Elid Doyle has been elected on the Atlantic Coast in Scotland, in the executive post of this governing body, during the annual meeting of the general assembly.
Doyle is the most decorated Scoceze athlete and champion and leader Ian Beattie described this decision as a great opportunity for all sports leaders to benefit from its extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Elid enjoys massive respect in the athletic community in Scotland, MB and in the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit extremely much by making it part of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm eager to serve as an athlete's voice, and I hope I will contribute and help in the direction of sports in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 - foot [200 m] and 400 - foot [400 m] race in the 1996 Games, in Atlanta, with four Olympic gold medals in total and a regular expert in BBC, lost the ability to run after a temporary Islamic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered an attack.
I can't go.
The doctors said that only time will tell him if I'm gonna heal and how much.
I had to work hard, but I was able to recover completely, and I learned to walk again, and today I am making weapons of destruction!
Thank you for encouraging messages!"
An announcement of the bomb that compares mothers to wolves lowers public opinion
A company for the production of iron pumps has shared public opinion with a commercial that compares mothers who respond with thieves.
To launch the promotion of what is considered "the first pump of ice in the world without noise and which can be worn," the society of consumer technology products, Elvie, showed a generous music video to advertise the freedom that this new pump gives to mothers who need to express themselves freely.
Four real mothers dance in a steel bar filled with bar, under the voices of a song with the following text: "Yes, I do, but I don't even have it" and "If you hadn't noticed, these aren't dry, it's my stomach."
"The pumps, the pumps, the beans, the pumps, the pumps, the cheese."
However, advertising, published on the Facebook page of the firm, has caused online debates.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many of them expressing that it is subsidized by the cold industry.
"The use of thieves to advertise this product is a very weak decision.
Just like us, they have to remain "regulated" and "lind" to produce milk, just that their "birth" takes from them a few days after the birth," someone wrote.
Elvie's game pump is placed inside the recipes and does not fall into the eye (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Traumatically traumatic for the mother and the child.
Why don't you use it to advertise a chicken pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "What kind of unsympathetic advertising."
Others supported the advertising, among which a woman admitted that the song looked "to laugh."
"I think this is a generic idea.
I'd have bought one if you'd still feed the kid.
The pump made me feel like a wolf.
The advertising is a little crazy, but I saw what it means.
This is a generic product," someone wrote.
Another commented: "This is a generous advertising directed to mothers who use the pump (often at work or in toilets) and who feel "loss."
This is not a advertising that appreciates or condemns the cold industry."
At the end of the video, the women's group shows that they've all been dancing with the "fly" pump placed on the tape.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the fact that many women who use chicken pumps are said to feel like wolves.
However, Elvie’s pump is unred, with no wires or tubes, placed in the refrigerators, and kept the women free to move, kept their babies, and even went out while they were using them.
Ana Balarin, partners and ECD (Creative Executive Director) in Mother commented: "Pompa Elvis is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a courageous and provocative promotion.
By making a parallel between the women who want to express themselves freely and the sweets, we wanted to take note of the use of the pump and the challenges they face, as well as in a fun and similar way of expressing the extraordinary feeling of freedom that gives the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump gets out on the first page.
During the week of fashion in London, a mother of two children appeared in the stylelist Martha Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children have been forced into silence in a camp on the Texas border
The number of disabled immigrant children has increased even though the number of months in the border has remained relatively the same, partly as the consequences of the rhetoric and rigid policies presented by the Tromp administration that have made it difficult to send children to their support.
Usually, most of the supporters have also been immigrants without documents, and they have been afraid to risk their stand instead of trying to apply for a child.
The crisis increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults of the same family would have to give fingerprints, and these data would also pass on to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Immigration and Dogan Agency, testified before the Congress that the agency had arrested ten persons who had applied to support the unexploded massacres.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 per cent of arrested persons had no previous criminal record.
"About 80 per cent of the individuals who are the sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegally resident and a large part of them are foreign to the former criminal.
So, we're still following these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
According to construction workers, trying to speed up child data, officials presented new rules that some of them demanded to appear in court within a month from the time of the ban, not after 60 days, as the previous standard was.
Many of them will appear before immigration judges through video conferences and not physically, in order to argue their demand for legal status.
Those who do not qualify will be deported immediately.
According to construction workers and reports received from the system in recent months, as long as children remain disabled, it is more likely that they will feel anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent or attempts to slow them down.
Supporters say these concerns are more serious in view of a greater environment like Tornillo, where, because of size, there is a greater risk of ignoring signs that indicate a child has difficulty.
They add that the transfer of children to the city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good-bye to friends can cause trauma that many of them already face.
Syria seeks US, French and Turkish forces to withdraw immediately
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulalem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has already taken place in the eighth year.
Moulalem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces are staying in the Syrian country illegally, with the assumption that they are fighting terrorism, and that "they will act with them in the right way."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said during the assembly.
Moulalem insisted that "wars against terrorism are almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions of others have been expelled from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "to fight in this holy war until we have cleansed all Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and from "unlawful foreign forces."
The United States has about 2000 bodies in Syria, which primarily train and advise Kurdish and Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the territory of this war - torn country.
As for the refugee issue, Moualem said that conditions are good for them to return, and accused "some Western countries" of "expressing irrational fears" that forced refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They are policying a matter which must be entirely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide assistance in rebuilding Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral area in the latest wave of rebellions in Idlib has created the opportunity to proceed with political discussions.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement avoided an attack on the large scale of Russian-based Syrian forces in this province, where three million people live.
However, Moulalem pointed out that the agreement had "explain instructions" and expressed confidence that military attacks would mark the activists, including the fighters from Front Nusra related to Al-Qaeda, who "will be defeated."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to call soon the first meeting of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to map a post-war constitution for Syria and expand the path to elections.
Moulalem predicted conditions for the government's participation in this committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "in relieving the concerns of the current constitution," and warned that there was no intervention.
Why Trump will win a second command
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will be resolved in 2020 except for cases where, as many people hope, liberal views, accusations and scandals put an end to his presidency earlier.
In what would surely be "the most dramatic foundation of a president in history!"
So far, there's no sign of the binding of the viewers.
Since 2014, the number of viewers during the peak hour has doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and nearly 1.6 million in MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has a mean viewer of 2.4 million during the peak hour, of 1.7 million years ago, while the MSNBC program, "The Rachel Maddow Show", has reached the top of the channel rating of 3.5 million viewers during the evenings with major events.
"This is a fire, to which people withdraw because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, director of the ABC drama series "Designed Survivor," which tells the history of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scowell, an old comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
It brings to mind a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
Why did she ask her?
He answered, "Because you make me laugh," Mrs. Scowell told me.
There are fun values in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe V. Wade if immigrant families can join and the health of the global economy.
The opening is a luxury that only privileged observers can face.
However, if he finds himself after six hours looking at a panel of experts discussing the use of "peaceful information" by Bob Woodward in his book "Fear," the hand-cluttered cotton jacket of Paul Manafort, worth $15,000 ("a proud dress", said The Washington Post) as well as the implications of Stormy Daniels's life-long descriptions, for Mr. Trump's anatomism, then this goes beyond being a informed citizen.
At least I'll never see Super Mario in the same way.
"A part of what he does and makes it look like a 'reality show' is that you eat with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and founder of "Pawn Stars," related to the actors who circle and unexpected day developments of the Trump program (debates with N.F.L., commendations for Kim Jong-un).
You can't leave an episode until you're back.
When I went to Mr. Fleiss this week, the time was with the sun and the temperature outside was 80 degrees, outside his house in the north coast of Kaai, but he was hidden inside, seeing MSNBC, while registering CNN.
It was not possible to leave, not while Brett Kavanaugh would face the Senate's Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court of First Instance.
"I remember when we carried out all those crazy programs in the past and the people who said, "This is the last beginning of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss said.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money outside the private sector focuses on the fast pace of the Congress's elections
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania area is facing a drop in cash, as a result of the reorganization of the electoral areas that require two officials to run for the same post.
This recent reorganization in Pittsburgh's peripheral areas has established democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won the post in another area, in special elections, last Friday.
Lamb is running against another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12-year-old zone of Pennsylvania, which has been replaced by the 17-year-old area.
This new distribution of maps came after the decision of the High Court of Pennsylvania, which, in January, stated that the old areas had been designated in an unconstitutional and unjust way in favour of the Republicans.
This race, in the new 17th century, has also fostered a strong commitment to the financing of campaigns by the party's main funding bodies, the Democratic Committee for the Conference of the Parties (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republic of the Fussats (NCRC).
Lamb became a popular name in Pennsylvania after a victory with close results in the special elections usually followed in March for the 18th election zone of Pennsylvania.
For more than a decade, he was held by the Republicans and President Donald Trump won this area with 20 points of difference.
Political experts see Democrats as easy favorites.
The US takes into consideration to penalize El Salvador for support to China, later withdraws
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already met Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had owned a hotel in Panama until partners fired the Trump's management team.
State Department officials decided to leave the heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the latest sales to be unknown to Taiwan," department spokesman Heather Nauert said during a statement early this month.
But the penalties were considered only to El Salvador, who received some $140 million assistance from the United States in 2017, including for the control of drug addicts, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included reductions in financial assistance and restrictions imposed on visas, would be difficult for Central America's country and for its high levels of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings have progressed, North American and Central officials are sending a high-level conference focusing on security and economic well-being to follow a similar meeting last year, an action that was considered to be opening up money in efforts to prevent immigrants from going to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held, giving them every opportunity to impose sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has planned to hold a speech at the conference, which is predicted in mid-October, a sign that shows the importance of the administrative cost of this meeting, diplomats expressed themselves.
And three American envoys return peacefully from El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without strong messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House official for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to talk about internal discussions, with whom to maintain theironymity.
Their explanations were confirmed by an analyst at the administration, who also spoke, seeking the right to anonymity.
History
The event of the order expected to occur could be the Special Prosecutor's report by Robert Mueller for possible prohibition by Mr. Trump, for which there is considerable evidence in public data.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller is transferring his investigation to verify if during his campaign, Mr. Trump has co-operated with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If Congress changes country, Mr. Trump will have to give the bill before this body, at a time when he is ready to appear again before the voters, and perhaps he may face an independent jury.
These are many if, and I don’t want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s disappointment or that of his counterparts in Europe is inevitable.
All of us, from both sides of the Atlantic, must make choices that will affect how long the conflict will last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to crush the state against Hitler, if the West had resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The lines of history depend on these turning points, which speed up or slow down the slow path of democracy.
Currently, Americans are facing some of these turning points.
What would we do if Mr. Trump was taking over general prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the investigation dates to Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein has not been in a difficult situation since this newspaper reported, over the past year, that he had suggested hearing the president's secret, as well as speculating that he is not fit to remain in office.
Mr. Rosenstein said The Times article wasn't right.
"How do we answer if the new investigation requested by the F.B.I. for Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if it is confirmed in the High Court regardless of allegations based on sexual assaults and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the next elections for a Congress that will consider responsible Mr. Trump?
If we fail these tests, then democracy will face a long winter.
But I believe we're not going to fail because of the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Hebrew woman from Czechoslovakia, who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that hosted the embassy residence where I lived.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to celebrate the Sabbath on the table containing the swastika symbol (the broken church).
Having this heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Ranger's player, Graham Dorrans is an optimist in the face of Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, Rangers waited for Rapid Vienna knowing that a victory in front of the Austrians, after the resurgence in Spain against Villarreal, earlier this month, would put them in a favourable position to qualify in the G group, the European Law.
A wound in the neck did not allow the confused Graham Dorrans to make the first presentation this season in the 2-2 vs. Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use it as a force to achieve larger things.
"It was an important point for us because Villarreal is a good team," said 31-year-old.
"We went into the field believing that we could get something and come up with a point.
We may have noted it eventually, but in general, I believe that comparison was a good result.
Maybe they were better in the first part as we showed up in the second part and we were the best team.
Thursday, it will be another big European evening.
I hope we can take three points but it will be a difficult struggle because they have achieved a positive outcome in their previous fight, but with the typhoes that support us, I'm sure we can go ahead and get a positive outcome.
Last year was very difficult, due to the traumas and changes in the club, but now there is an optimization factor in this team.
The teams are good, and the boys are enjoying this. Training is good.
I hope we can move forward, throw the last season behind bars and succeed."
Women suffer less as a result of the fear of pension benefits
Although the students had a clear idea of how we wanted family members to care for them, few spoke to them about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationalwide study said they spoke to their husbands about the long - term expenses of care.
Only 10 percent responded that they spoke to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it," said Holly Snyder, the vice president of society for life insurance, Nationwide.
That's where we have to start.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not previously show them your wishes.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how to benefit from care, since these choices may be an important factor in determining costs.
Also take your financial adviser: The advisor can help you find a way to pay your expenses.
The long-term care financing options include a traditional care policy, hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-sustainment through your assets - for the time you have money.
Prepare legal documents: Avoid legal battles through an authorisation.
Take a health care prosecutor and appoint a trusted person who will monitor your health care and ensure that experts act in accordance with your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
Consider, too, the receipt of a prosecutor for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions in your name and will guarantee the payment of bills if you cannot do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer the questions about allergic and medicinal products?
Prepare a written plan with these details so that you will be ready.
"It's not only the financial aspect in the game, but also who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medication will you use?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare this plan."
A person is shot several times by air soldiers in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times by a windmill as he goes home after having spent the night out.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area, in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the throats, stomachs, and hands.
Police officers declared this to be a "accident act", which took place about 02:30 BST.
The victim doesn't see the attacker.
The conclusions received do not pose a threat to life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Medicines and Foods in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and famine that struck the Indonesian city of Palu, declaring officials as the number of dead is expected to grow.
With the communications networks outside the function, the staff of the assistance have not been able to obtain information from Dondria's Regengen, a region in the north of Palu, which was near the earthquake epicenter with 7.5 waves.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after this disaster.
Below are some facts about Palu and Dondria, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of the central Sulawesi, which is at the end of a short drive to the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants, in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it fell from the earthquake and the famine.
Donderia is a regenerative that extends more than 300 km (180 km) along the coastal coast of the island of Sulawesi.
Regenca, a smaller administrative region than the province, had a population estimated by about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and fishing are the main economic activities of the province, especially in the coastal region of Dondria.
Nickel output is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Moroval, on the other side of Sulawesi's coast.
According to the Disaster Management Agency in Indonesia, Palu and Dodrea have been hit several times by food in the last 100 years.

Sarah Palin's eldest son has been arrested on the charges of family violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of Alaska's former governor and candidate for president Sarah Palin, has been arrested on the charge of aggression.
According to a report submitted on Saturday by Alaska's state police, Palin, aged 29, by Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested as suspect of family violence, bans of family violence, and resistance to arrest.
According to the police report, when a woman he met tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he received the phone.
Palin is being held at Mat-Su's pre-trial building and is holding a guarantee in the form of unrated bonds worth $500, KTUU reported.
According to reports of this network, he was presented to the courts on Saturday, and when he was asked about the presence of the crime, he said "it's absolutely innocent".
The palace is faced with three broken down by category A, which means it can be held up to one year and it's worth $250,000.
Also, he is accused of a category B breakdown, which is punished with one day in prison and $2,000 in fines.
It's not the first time the criminal charges against Palin are raised.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
This issue is currently being considered by the Veterans Court in Alaska.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, bans on reporting domestic violence and armed robbery during the incident.
His beloved had claimed that he had hit him with a fist in his face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups after linking her son's violent behavior with PTSD (post-traumatic stress syndrome) as a result of the service in Iraq.

Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for the suspect of the terrorist attack on NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York but seek death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been given for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, Saipov, aged 30, is assumed to have used a Home Depot-based truck to carry out the terrorist attack on a road for bicycles along the western highway, in lower Manhattan, crossing the cliffs and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must confirm that Saipov has killed eight victims "with a paramedic", and that he has caused serious physical injuries "with a paramedic", according to a letter of intent to seek death penalty, foretold in the south of New York.
According to a document of the Court, both cases can be sentenced to death.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury accused Saipov of 22 murders, including eight charges of murder in support of organized crime, charges often used by prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack has been the result of "a considerable and proposed planning," the prosecutors expressed, describing the way the crime is executed by Saipov as "missible, cruel and immoral."
"Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, injuries and loss of families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erly, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pannucco," says the letter.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the southern part of New York City criminalized a death sentence.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers, but eventually he was sentenced to eternal imprisonment in September 2009.
Last time the death penalty was used in a federal case in New York, it was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy and spying on the Soviet Union two years before the Cold War.
Both of them were executed in an electric race, on June 19, 1953.
According to the documents of the court, Saipov, with the Azerbaijani nationality, did not express repentance during the days and months following the attack.
He has told the investigators that he feels good about what he has done, the police reported.
According to the record, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to do the attack after the ISIS video on his cell phone.
The police said he had also requested to install the ISIS flame in his hospital room.
He said he's innocent for 22 days.
David Patton, one of the public lawyers representing Saipov, said they are "very disappointed with the decision of the prosecutor.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty and not to accept the sin associated with eternal imprisonment without the possibility of appeal will increase the trauma caused by these events to all persons involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously called for prosecutors not to seek a death penalty.
The Conservative Party's MP says NIGEL FARGE should be put at the top of Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today, during a protest at the Conservatives conference, that it would 'mobilise the people's army'.
Former leader of the UKIP said politicians should be "sustaining the pressure" of Eurosceptic people - after one of those Members Theresa May suggested that he should be at the top of the negotiations with the EU.
In March, Conservative Commissioner Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the MB's 'will be out' if Brexit's secretary would be Mr. Farage.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to join her group is taken into account by conservatives for the EU's position, who joined another protest in the city against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is making it difficult to implement the compromise plan reached in Switzerland, among attacks from those who want to stand or leave the European Union, as well as from the EU itself.
The Aliaths insisted that it would try to reach an agreement with Brussels regardless of harsh reactions - and would force Eurosceptics and labourists to choose between its package and its cassettes.
During the Largim march, Largim, Mr. Bone said he wanted to cancel the Chequers deal.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should come to the top and give him responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he were in the head, now we would be out,' he said.
Mr. Wellingborough added: 'I would support Brexit, but we must abandon the Chequers deal.'
Expressing his position against the EU, he said, "We have not fought in the world wars to be subjugated.
We want to map our laws in our country."
Mr. Bone left the suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely false.'
Conservative Andrea, who supports Brexit, was also in the march and said to the journalists: 'I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'Checkers' agreement is not supported by the general public, the opposition will not vote, it will not even be supported by our party, and by activists who fill the streets and vote for us.
Please, leave the checkers and start listening.'
In a message directed, Mrs. May, she added, 'The ministers hold the job place in cases when they keep their promises.'
Mr. Farage said during the march that politicians should 'feel the pressure' if they are thinking of giving up the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
'Now, this is a matter of faith between us -- the people -- and our political class,' he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that we're not gonna let you do anything like that.'
During a message directed to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: 'You both owe our political class, which is near Brexit's resignation, to feel the pressure.
"We are mobilising the army of this country's people who gave us victory in Brexit and we will not stop until the United Kingdom is independent, proud and self-government."
In the meantime, they marched to Birmingham before holding a two - hour tunnel in the city center.
A small group of activists held a panel where Conservatives wrote against Brexit, after this group was shown at the end of the week.
Laburists' support, Lord Adonis, ironed with conservatives about the security problems they had with a "social application" at the beginning of the conference.
'These are the people who tell us they can prepare the TI systems and the technology needed for 'Canada plus' for open borders, for free trade with Ireland,' he added.
'It's totally a farm.
There's no such thing as good Brexit," he said.
Warren plans to 'consider carefully' the possibility of candidate for presidents
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has stated that it will "consider carefully the possibility of candidate for presidents" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the democratic senator of Massachusetts spoke about her future during a joint meeting, held on Saturday in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a continuing critic of President Donald Trump, is candidate for election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-director of the Tromp campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
She's been at the center of speculation that she can run in front of Trump in 2020.
The held meeting on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the voters according to the joint format, since the time Tromp came to the top.
One of the participants asked him if he was planning to vote for the President.
Warren replied that the time has come for "females to go to Washington and regulate the corrupt government, and this includes the decision of a woman in the head."
Arrested a person for killing the LSU team player, Wade Sims
The police in Baton Rouge, La., reported on Saturday, that he arrested a suspect for the murder of basketballist Wade Sims on Friday.
Dytheon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested about 11 p.m., informing the Department of Police at Baton Rouge, during a media conference.
The police had published a video on Saturday, Friday, asking for help to identify the person who showed up there.
Sims, aged 20, was shot with a gun and killed at the South University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims changed his life as a result of the gun wounds caused in his head," said on Saturday for 247ports, chief of Murphy's police, J. Paul.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and shot Simpson.
Simpson took the question and admitted that he was in a position, held his gun, and that he had shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and sent to the police department in the eastern area of Baton Rouge.
Sims, 6'6'' long, played 32 games, 10 of which as the title, last season, with a mean of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 tops on the battle table.
Russia's big price: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team guidance gives Sebastian Vettel victory
Since Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the guidance of the Mercedes team" would play a significant role in this regard.
Bottas started from the first place and almost "guested" Hamilton after protecting his position in the first two guards and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Wettel was the first to make a stop and left Hamilton to guarantee you "traffick" at the end of the car group, something that should have resulted in decisive results.
Mercedes stopped a jiro later and positioned after Vettel, but Hamilton went to the top after some maneuvers that forced Ferrari's pilot to leave behind behind a double move to defend himself in the third floor.
Max Verstappen started the race from the last row and at the end of the first round on Saturday, on his 21st birthday.
Later he was in the main part of the race after not changing the tires to get a quick finish, and Kim Raikcone passed by on the fourth.
Eventually, he stopped in January 44 but failed to improve the pace of the remaining eight-year-old by leaving the fourth country of Raikconen.
It's a hard day because Valtter did a fantastic job all weekend and showed a real gentleman I've been through.
The team has done an extraordinary job with these positions," Hamilton said.
Very Lowly Use the Body Language
President Donald Trump ironized Senator Diane Feinstein during a meeting on Saturday, in connection with her stand, that it was not the person who "selled down" Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, for sexual assault.
During a speech at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the testimony given by Ford before the Senate's Judicial Committee, but said what was happening in Senate shows that people are "lawful, wicked and dishonest."
"The only thing that can happen and the beauty of what is happening in the Senate during the last days is when you see the same thing, when you see people who are indifferent, lawless, wicked and dishonest," he said.
"When you see publications out of secret and then people say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, were you the one who put the letter in the store?
Remember her answer... did you get your document-- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't take it out."
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't, we didn't," he said, imitating the senator.
In July, Feinstein was sent a letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford, and the document came first in September - but Feinstein denied that the information had come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't take her story to the store," Feinstein told the commission, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it secret, and I kept it as she asked me."
It seems that her denial was unacceptable to the president, who commented during the debate on Saturday evening: "In my opinion, the guests really left to wish.
Maybe you didn't do it, but I've never seen the weakest finds before."
In defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, which has been accused by three women for sexual misconduct, the president stated that the Democrats are using alleged accusations to achieve their goals.
"They are determined to regain power at all times.
They don't care who's hurt, who's going to get power and control," Mediaite reported as saying by the president.

Francois Bouchard compared for Dundee before Lucas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals to ensure victory.
This was the third loss of the season, in the League of Elite, for Adam Keefe's faith, which last night came back from disfavor, to defeat Dundee 2-1, in Belfast.
This was the fourth battle between these teams, this season, with three money won by Giants.

Air traffic controller lost his life ensuring that hundreds of people on a plane escape the earthquake
A air traffic controller in Indonesia is being honored as hero after he lost his life by ensuring that a plane that held hundreds of people safely will fall.
Over 800 people lost their lives, and many others have been declared missing after a great earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a famine.
Strong waves continue to worry the area, and many people have literally stuck in the city of Palu.
But, although his colleagues continued to rescue him, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower that was rolling down at the Palu's airport "Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport".
He stayed to ensure that the flight of the 6321 Batik Air, which was on track at that time, could begin safely.
Then he got out of the traffic control hole when he thought she was hiding.
He lost his life later in the hospital.
Australian ABC News reported that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We prepared a helicopter from the Balikpan in Calimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, he lost his life this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"This news cuts our soul," he added.
In the meantime, authorities fear that the number of deaths may reach thousands, while the local disaster management agency says that entry into the cities of Dodrea, Sig and Butong is limited.
"It is believed that this number will continue to grow, as there are still many bodies under the letter, while others have not been able," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
The waves that reached up to six feet [6 m] have destroyed Pallane, where on Friday a deadly mass ceremony will be held.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering supplies and aid.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said for "Sky News": "Ambulance brings body every minute.
There's no clean water.
The mini-markets are always locked up."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Red Indonesian Cross is urging to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can take more."
Indonesia's President Joko Vidodo arrived on Sunday in Palu and directed the country's army: "I'm asking you to work day and night to do all your evacuation duties.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes earlier in Lombok, where more than 550 people lost their lives.
A plane crash in Micronesia: "Air Niugini" now says a person has lost after a plane crashed into the chain
A plane headed by a plane that was deployed into the Gulf of Micronesia has now declared a missing person, having previously declared that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from a floating plane.
In a press release, "Air Niugini" said on Saturday afternoon they are not finding a passenger.
The airline stated that it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators in an effort to find the person.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
The local boat helped save passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water by trying to get down to Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials said that seven people had been associated with the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in a stable condition.
The reason for the delay and the effect of the events remains unclear.
The U.S. Airline and Marines said the plane landed in the boat after it didn't reach the track.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the bridge.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane dropped very low.
"This is an extraordinary good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that through the water that had reached the level of the betel, he and others managed to reach the exits of the plane’s emergency.
He said that the birds were panicking and screaming, while he suffered a mild blow in his head.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors who were working on a ladder there helped save them, using a boat with air to transport people to the shore before the plane crashed about 30 meters (100 feet) below water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have lost their lives in the airline deployments registered in PNG in the last two decades, but "Air Niugini" was not included in any of them.
The analyst builds the night's chronology when a woman dies
On Saturday, the prosecutor presented her arguments in the trial of a person who is accused of being burned alive by a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlet testified for several hours as an expert in the field of data analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used the phone data to rebuild the unsub, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night that this last changed his life.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett stated that he had received the location data from several cell phones that indicate that Tellis was with Chambers on the afternoon of her death, this fact lowering his previous claims.
When the data revealed that his cell phone was in the same place as Chambers during the time he said it was happening to his friend Michael Sanford, then the police went to talk to him about it.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When you asked the prosecutor if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that night was in Sanford's truck, the last one said, "he's lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another misunderstanding is Tellis' statement, which said he had met Chambers about two weeks before she died.
The phone tables showed that they had only one week they knew each other.
Rowlett said that shortly after the death of Chambers, Tellis had deleted messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," said Hale.
For protection, it is expected that he will give the signs of the morning and the evening.
The judge declared that the jury would make the decision that day.
The High Breed: What's a lot of sensitive hips?
A group of hips with three members seeks to challenge the negative views of this class by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that the hip is far from its source of political messages and messages that dealt with social issues.
They want to return to the original and make it known again to their conscience.
In MB, a performance of artists such as The Fugees and Common is noticed, unlike artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another man with color?!
I came from New York to pick up the couple for leaving work, after getting the "racist" message.
A father from New York accused a couple of discrimination on leaving the job, after receiving a wrong message from a mother, who complains she was "another colored person."
The couple have denied that they're racist, considering the accident as "dangerous."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her concern when she discovered that the new daughter, Giselle Maurice, was a colourful woman, at the time she appeared on her first day of work in 2016.
"YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, A OTHER OF ME WOMAN," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in the message.
However, instead of sending her husband away, she sent Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to New York Post, after he realized her fault, Plato-Flaxman, "felt in circles," said Mrs. Maurice, reasoning that their current African-American daughter had done a poor job and that instead, she wanted a Filipino.
Mr. Maurice was paid for her only day of work and then sent home with a "cock in the pocket".
Now, Maurice is putting the two for compensation for leaving work, and she's looking for compensation at $350 a day for a six-month period for which she was employed, though without contracts.
"I want to tell them that they don't have to do such things," she said on Friday for The Post, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have rejected claims that they are racist, saying that Maurice's departure was the right thing to do, because they were afraid they could no longer believe them after they had offended him.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racist," said co-founder Joel Plasco for The Post.
"But will you leave the children in the hands of a person to whom you have been shown repentance, even though it is wrong?
Your son-in-law?
Tell me."
In view of the accident as a "dangerous," Plasco said that he and his wife had brought up a child two months earlier and were in a "very difficult situation."
"Can you blame someone in this situation?
It's not a positive thing to do," added Plasco, investment banker.
While the case has gone to court, the public opinion has quickly denounced the couple in social media, criticising their conduct and logic.
A new letter shows that Paddington’s publishers were afraid that readers would not create links to a gold mine
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book came in, said about this letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of a person who reads it for the first time before it was published.
We feel a great pleasure now that we have seen the extraordinary success of Paddington."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before being inspired by a small irony to write the book for the child, would be disappointed if his work would be rejected, adding that 60 years of publication of the book, last year after his death, contained "satisfaction and happiness".
As for Paddington, whom she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of success.
"He was a quiet person and I didn't hug," she said.
"Padddington was so real that it was the same as having a successful child: you feel proud of even though it's not exactly your success.
I think that's how he looked at Paddington's success.
Even though it was his creation and imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington's character."
My daughter was changing her life, and I was obliged to say good-bye to her by phone.
After the birth, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors were trying to save their lives but without results.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me that it was very serious, that he didn't believe he would go out," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Ned that told me she would die within two minutes and I should say goodbye.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications that had given her doctors to keep her heart at work were losing her effect and getting out of her system slowly.
She's been dead a while ago and now everything's going to happen.
I was obliged to sit down and wait, knowing that this was happening.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I should've shown you strong."
In time, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, complaining about the child's loss, flew into a plane compared to other passengers -- who were unaware of what she was experiencing.
"No one knew it," she said.
"I kept my head down, and all the time I was hungry.
It's hard to explain, but during that flight, I felt a great pain for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
The women who keep the cold post letters to prevent the killings in the water
Two women who have lost loved ones as a result of suicide are working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted letters with inspiring messages in a stream at Wells as well as telephone numbers that can call them for support.
Miss Davis was 13 when he started suffering from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old, living in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a "excellent" smile.
"Everyone knew about his smile.
People always say his smile wipes out every room."
However, he quit his job before he changed his life, after it happened "in a really dark moment."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mr. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there will be a domino effect."
Mr. Davis created the letters, "that people know there are people who can help them and who can talk to them, even with a friend.
Don't sit alone - you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been my friend, Davies lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt sad, depressed or anything else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, I noticed the change in behavior.
He was extremely sad on Christmas day -- when the children opened their gifts, he didn't see them and he didn't do anything."
She said that his death was a great tragedy for them, but that they should repent: "It's something that destroys the whole family.
We've been destroyed.
But we all have to go ahead and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh depends on the fate of the family after the beginning of the FBI investigation
"I thought if we could give them something similar to what you wanted -- a limited investigation in time and in object -- maybe we could conduct a little harmony," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was "distributed" between many obstacles of opposers.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
Their flight is all due to time.
The elections for Congress are only 5 weeks away, on November 6th - if the Republicans fail, as is expected, they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to elect the person they want in the highest court.
George W. Bush has called the senators, urging them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What's going to happen after the FBI released her report?
It will be voted in Senate, where 51 republics and 49 democracies are currently in existence.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could collect at least 50 votes in Senate, which would allow Deputy President Mike Pence to put an end to this situation and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
Number of deserts in North Korea under Kim's leadership
The number of islanders in North Korea has decreased since Kim Jong came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawyer has declared.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Ministry of the Union in South Korea, has stated that there have been about 1127 deserts last year - compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the main factors were stricter controls between North Korea and China as well as higher rates required by human beings traffickers.
Penny didn't make public comments.
Most of the deserters from North Korea are subsidized by South Korea.
Seoul has declared that more than 30,000 people from North Korea have passed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
The vast majority are heading towards China, which has the highest length of the border with North Korea and can pass it more easily than the Cmilitarized Zone (DMZ) between two Koreas, which is protected from much force.
China considers the islanders illegal and not as refugees and often resurfaces them with force.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved emotionally over the past months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pennsylvania, and their talks focused on the late negotiations for denuclearization.
This meeting came after a historic meeting in June, between American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore, where they agreed, in general, to work for a Korean gun-free gaudy.
But, on September, North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress up to that time.
"Without faith in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in these circumstances, there will be no chance that we, in the same way, have the first charmatism," Mr. Rey said during a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historic," and says he is not worthy to serve in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the Representative's Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court's "historic" letter Brett Kavanaugh and expressed that because of his temper, he was unable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments on Saturday, during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't think that if a woman had ever brought so, people would say 'historic'," said Pelosi about her reaction to the witness of Kavanaugh before the Senate's Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh categorically denied the charges that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his presentation, Kavanaugh was very concerned and in some moments nearly screamed or "take his mouth" when he spoke about his family and the years of the university.
He accused democracies in a way that was expressed before the committee, calling charges against him "a gross and coordinated attack on his image", organised by liberals who were incensed by Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi expressed her opinion that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, after she showed his prejudice to the Democrats.
"I think he punished himself with those statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi refused to answer the question whether he would try to give Kavanaugh a motion of disbelief in the case of his accession, and in the case that the democracies win most of the countries in the House of Representatives.
"Let me tell you -- if he's not telling the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he's unqualified not only for the Supreme Court but also for the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently the court at the Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi added that, as a democracy, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's decisions against the Law on Compulsory Care or on the Roe case against Wade, after he was considered a conservative judge.
In sessions for his accession, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would enforce the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not time for a historical and uniform person to become a member of the court and wait for us to say "how good!" Pelosi said.
And women have to take advantage of it.
This is a fair verbal attack, the whole month of the year that it breaks out, and it can't bring it to an end without crying.
"We cry when we're unconscious," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual.
She went on, "It helped me a lot, a woman who worked in a leading position, which expressed that she was also crying when she was anatossed, but she had a style that she used to say, how often she began to sing, to say to the co-ordinators, "You might think I'm sad and then I'm crying.
But in fact, I'm bored."
And then she kept talking.
And I thought that was a brilliant idea."
Lots are a way to express anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of an old job, in an office where men were superior to men, where at one point I found myself crying from an uncontainable ink, was the moment when a larger woman caught a finger -- a cold manager whom I had always had some fear -- and added to the stairs.
"Never let others see you crying," she said.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sorry, and they'll be glad they're going to bother you."
Patricia Schroeder, a democratic member of the Congress from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential candidates.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart found himself in the middle of an extraordinary relationship on the boat of a ship named "Monkey Business" and pulled out of the boat, Mrs. Schroeder, himself angry, realized that there was no reason why he would not even want to run for presidents.
"It wasn't a well-balanced decision," she said, laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was a more candidate.
Someone called it "Borebarda and Seven Georges."
Since the campaign was in its last stages, it had remained after the fund-raising, so it was claimed that it would not be guaranteed if it was not able to collect $2 million.
But it was a tough fight.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to the men, gave her only $250.
"Don't they think I'm getting some water?" she asked herself.
During his speech that he would not develop an official campaign, she was so excited — thanks to the people who supported her, the anger with the system that made it so difficult for the collection of money and the segregation of voters instead of delegates, and the hatreds with sexism, so that she was killed.
"It looks like I've had a nervous crisis," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
"It looks like Kleneex was my sponsoring company.
Do I remember thinking what people would write on my gravestone?
"What's that?"
US-China Trade War Advantages for Beijing
The first conflicts of trade between the US and China were devastating, and as the war is far from over, a confrontation between the two countries can make a long-term advantage for Beijing, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning at the beginning of this year, setting a tax on Chinese export capitals, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most sensitive move was that of this week, when the new tariffs cost 200 billion dollars worth of furniture, effectively taxing half of the goods entering the United States from China.
Pekinin has been arrested every time "naturally", finally setting a rate of between five and ten per cent over $60 billion.
China has been driven to return to the US with the same currency, and the second largest economic power in the world is not likely to be delivered quickly.
Dissemination from Washington means surrendering to their demands, but for China's President Xi Jinping, it would be very embarrassing to publicly surrender before the US.
However, experts have said that if China plays as appropriate its letters, the pressures arising from the US trade war can support China in a long-term way, in order to meet the interoperability of these two economies.
"The fact that political decisions, fast-acting both in Washington and in Beijing, can cause economic downturns in each of these countries, is much more dangerous than what is seen outside," said Abigail Grace, a researcher and associate at the research center for new American security, which focuses on the Asian continent.
Syria is 'gat' for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking at the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions on the ground are improving.
"So, the situation in the country is much more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Already, there are all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to their country, from where you have to be removed because of terrorism and the same economic measures that affected their daily lives and well-being.
The UN estimates that about 5.5 million Syrians have been displaced from the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
About six million others who still live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulalem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the ruined state.
However, he stressed that the country would not accept assistance or assistance provided by the countries sponsoring the rebellion.
Europe wins Ryder Cup trophy in Paris
The European team has won Ryder Cup's trophy 2018 after losing the US team with final results 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has already lost 6 rounds of fighting in the European territory, and it has been winning this battle in Europe since 1993.
Europe resumed its course after the Danish captain’s team, Thomas Bjorn, reached 14.5 points that they needed to conquer the United States.
U.S. Star Phil Mickelson, who was a player who became more difficult during the tournament, brought the first hit into the water and closed the 16th group with three more languages than the level set, losing the fight against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player, Molinary, was great in all of his rounds, making 1 out of 4 players who have achieved the score 5-0-0, since the current format began to apply in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was captured by the 5&4 player with the lowest ranking in the European team, Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
Player number one in the world order, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 of the English Ian Poulter, who could have played at his last finish of Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who played in eight Ryder Cups, became the most successful European player of all time on this tournament, with 25.5 points in career.
" Normally, I don't cry but today I can't keep myself.
It was a hard year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and trusted me.
I'm very, very happy we took the coat off.
Success is the team, and I am glad I saw the opportunity to help them," Garcia expressed quite excited after the team winner of the European team.
He went through the words of his fellow countrymen, John Ram, who defeated 2&1 American golf legend, Tiger Woods, in direct challenges, Sunday.
"I feel an extraordinary pride by the soldier Tiger Woods. I've grown up seeing that player," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his struggles in France and now has statistics 13-21-3 during his career at Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics from one of the biggest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles, ranked second after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has struggled all weekend to get the ball in the right place, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high calibre golf all over the tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing presentation, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought hard.
There were some moments during this paradise when we pushed pressure on the European team.
We fought hard.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players played pretty well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with PGA in America as well as our Ryder Cup committee and we'll go ahead.
I love these 12 boys, and I'm proud to be the captain.
We've got to get the hat off.
They played better than we."
