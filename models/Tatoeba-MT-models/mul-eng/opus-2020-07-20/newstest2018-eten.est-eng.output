In Estonia and Spain, four members of the Kemerovo Group were arrested.
The postmaster held police officers in Spain under the name of Slava Gulevići, a leader of the group of Kemerovo operating in Estonia, who is known as Slava Kemerovski in the criminal world.
Gulevish, arrested in Spain, was sentenced to imprisonment at the trial.
In the morning, the court also handed down three suspects arrested in Estonia.
According to the suspect, the action is carried out with the members of the Community named Kemerovo, from 27 to 57 years of age, who are primarily involved in drug abuse.
In the province of Mijas, in Spain, the alleged leader of the criminal community was arrested.
In Estonia, three men were considered suspicious, one of whom was collected as a criminal Community leader, and two were members of the criminal community.
The data collected indicate that the tasks and roles of the criminal community were clearly excluded.
The purpose of the criminal activity of the Community was to take action against drug abuse and thus serve criminal profit," commented the Head of Criminal Procedure, Public Prosecutor Vahur Verte.
"We are not surprised that there is an increase in the circle of suspects in this crime area," added the prosecutor.
This has been done with people who have also been subjected to the interest of law enforcement agencies, and some of them have been punished for drug abuse.
Blood stressed the importance of cooperation with Spanish colleagues throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become common to us, and this week's operation shows the success of cooperation," said prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Service, said that the budget for arrests had been examined for almost half a year.
"The first half of the long-term work is being carried out, and at the same time we have been holding back doubts about the crimes in Estonia and Spain," he said.
It added that the Central Criminal Police officers were an aid in maintaining in Spain.
For years we have had good contact and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and civil card.
These arrests are a series of messages to criminals that we will also get them from another part of Europe," Leis said.
The information gathered so far indicates that suspects may continue to commit new crimes in their absence, so the prosecutor asked for them to be detained and the court approved them.
A man in Spain is waiting for his birth in Estonia.
In this criminal context, the goods, vehicles and cash are arrested to ensure the confiscatation.
The criminal proceedings will be carried out by the Central Criminal Police Office and will be conducted by the State Prosecutor.
In 2005, the Tallinn City Court heard Slava Gulevitch's trial and sentenced him to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevish was considered to be a second man in the Estonian criminal world following the defeat of the lord Nikola Tarankov.
In the early 1990 ’ s, Gulevish, from Cameroon, rose in the fall of Estonia when he began to deal with the pressures of the press in Tallinn.
As a result, he paid taxes and prostitutes to various hotels and demanded a fee from businesses.
International co-operations, confiscation of proceeds and enforcement of judgments confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the last judgments of eight convicted persons who were convicted of a criminal offence in Dikajev's criminal territory of EUR 80 000, or of the nine persons against which Igor Aleynikov was convicted in 2006 of a criminal offence involving illegal trade in secret and trafficking in human beings in East and South Estonia.
There is approximately EUR 71,500 for confiscated criminal income.
In these criminal cases, police officers have made every day exchange of information and evidence with foreign colleges and, where necessary, work together in any Member State of the European Union.
The Civil Rights Group prevents travel to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned Missouri of the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the State party.
The statement of the Group states: "The NAACP travel note issued on the territory of Missouri, which will apply until 28 August 2017, calls on all African-American passengers, visitors and Missouri to be in the whole country, particularly cautious and extremely cautious, taking into account the recent serious events of the whole race, which have taken place over the country and also here."
According to NAACP, the Group was planning to issue travel aid to Missouri as recently as possible, making it more difficult to combat cases of discrimination, as well as the fact that the objectives of the State party's collection targets are not quite the same.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They are being subjected to teeserva because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," NaaCP President Rod Chapel told the history of The Kansas City Star.
"We've never received a complaint so close before."
This is the first such warning that the organisation has issued for the US country.
The group referred to such events as racist massacres of black students from the University of Missouri and Tennessee, 28-year-old Tory Sanders' death.
Sanders died at the beginning of this year in suspicious circumstances after he was taken from the country by a gas raid and was taken by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, it refers to a recent report by the Chief Prosecutor of Missouri that shows that 75% of the cars of black car drivers are stopped in the country with a higher likelihood than that of whitehounds.
"The note is meant to make people aware and to warn their family, friends and colleagues of what may happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be ready to take part in or inform relatives that they are passing through the country."
On the basis of the latest data from the FBI information programme on hate crimes, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015 which is based on the number of similar crimes in the country as referred to in paragraph 16.
Travel management is also a response to the new law of Missouri, which makes it difficult to appeal to the court of the company for discrimination in the search for life or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued earlier travel comments on Texas and Arizona after these countries adopted immigration laws which forced local people to be subjected to the violations of immigration, as ACLU said it would increase racial profiling.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs normally provides travel assistance to other countries, but has recently begun to use this measure in response to certain internal laws and trends in the United States.
Hepatitis: What can each know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis may have been caused by five different types of hepatitis A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses are calling for the paycheck to burn immediately.
However, there is chronic hepatitis B and C, which may continue to develop for the liver, or the liver for the spinal cord, and for the liver.
Kulo Kutsar, an epidemiologist, says that acute liver disease is common in all types of liver problems - fever, fatigue, vomiting, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headaches, redness of the urine, muscle pain, skin pain, skin and skin problems.
The most recent outbreak of disease also results in the popular name of collaquium.
In children, hepatitis may be transmitted without a disease.
The different types of taxable income can be determined only on the basis of laboratory data.
No hepatitis can pass into chronic hepatitis and walk for decades without being infected, which means that a person may not know anything about his or her dangerous disease.
Hearing Kutsar produces different forms of hepatitis and describes their range closer.
The hepatitis A virus spreads from disease to human beings and nourishes us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, by sex, by touching people’s exits to the hands and hands to food, clothing, objects, mouth, and the use of drugs.
Family members and caregivers of the Hepatitis Hepatitis group, people with chronic liver disease, people with diabetes, men with men who are sexually active, men who are drug addicts, travelers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis A.
Vaccination may be avoided in vaccines, in particular it is recommended that vaccination be given to many patients and patients at risk of hepatitis A.
It is also important to meet daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands before eating all the fruits and vegetables.
Hepatitis B virus spreads in the presence of human blood, injecting drugs, tattooing, analgesics, use of blood-skinned agents (spams, radiation devices), doloric veins, hepatitis-free sex, and hepatitis-free breast-feeding.
The risk groups of hepatitis B infection include injecting drug addicts, infected human sex partners, sex partners with men, pregnant mothers, ill-treated family members and caregivers, blood and other health professionals, rescue workers and police officers, and visitors to countries with high hepatitis B disease.
In order to prevent hepatitis B, it is possible to vaccinate people; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people belonging to the risk group and in addition to chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B are: prevention of the use of foreign hygiene and manicure tools, other surface and injection needles, tattooing and freezing and the use of condoms in case of pregnancy or sexual risk.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is a part of the national immunosuppression plan and free of charge for children in Estonia.
Hepatitis C virus spreads into the human blood in combination with human blood, injecting drugs, injecting, injecting, swallowing, using blood-skinned agents, in doloric veins, in hepatitis-free sex, and in case of hepatitis/vascination.
The risk groups of hepatitis C infection include injecting drug addicts, infected human sex partners, male sexes, pregnant mothers, sick family members and caregivers, health professionals, rescue workers and police officers, HIV victims, and visitors to countries with high hepatitis C disease.
The prevention measure for hepatitis C is: the prevention of the use of foreign hygiene and manicure tools, other surface tools and injection needles, tattooing and cooling and the use of condoms in case of pregnancy.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D causes hepatitis D virus that increases hepatitis B virus presence.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection occurs with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in chronic hepatitis B patients.
Hepatitis D virus spreads in encounters with blood and other physical agents, contaminated with insulins, constipated pathogens, and rarely infected mothers.
The risk group D of hepatitis is chronic hepatitis B virus inhibitors and non- people who are not immune to hepatitis B.
The effective prevention is vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, which protects people from hepatitis D infection.
E hepatitis virus spreads across the national-regional road with gorillas and food, including low-heated animal meat, fish and amarpes, dodorivere, contaminants, and contaminants.
Travellers may be affected by high E hepatitis infection in countries.
The prevention measures for E hepatitis are to meet the hygiene requirements: pest or disinfect hands after taking a toilet, before preparing and eating after the disease.
Trees and farms should be slaughtered before consumption, avoid the consumption of low-fated meat, fish and seaweed, eat only safe food and avoid the use of drugs.
Although the last round tried to push the four-fold Olympics across the border, 34-year-old Farah found strength and won 26.49.51.
Farah didn't think long after she finished with her husband, Tanya, and the children.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
It was wonderful to be with them," said the newspaper Farah.
In London, Farah is planning a 5 - foot [5,000 - 10000 m] gold medal.
Everything is possible if you believe in it.
In spite of the book, Anne-Marie O'Connor quotes "Dadam's gold. Gustav Klimti's masterpieces, Adele Bloch-Bauier portrait" as an outstanding story of one of the births of the artists, notes the deeper end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century in the culture of Vienna.
But it's a more comprehensive history.
To avoid the price of an up-to-date information service, a more tighter theme will allow you to gain more influence in the portrait book.
There would now be just two books between a single page: Gustav Klimti and his country's story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, described in the "Dadam gold" on his map, and note the most extensive and widest historical history of the Jewish and German occupations in Austria with its consequences.
The first third of the Bible is the medium - growing culture of Vienna and who has reached Austria itself, at least it may be difficult to imagine how more than a hundred years ago, living in Ringstras, or how all of you had to return to the capital of the city when Klimt entered.
The concentration of culturalists in one wealthy city in Europe was high and a book bearing the name of a well-known feeling even more grammatical culture.
For example, the fact that Sigmund Freud was operating in a town where there was no drug use and was the European highest level of suicide, created without giving anything to development.
Or perhaps, however, every parallel surface view adds color to the culture of the early 20th century in Vienna.
Visit to the Union of the Councils
In the last decades of the 19th century, a large number of Jews had grown in Vienna, making it the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
By the middle of the century, every tenth of the people of Vienna was Jewish.
Adele’s parents were also new immigrants in Vienna, but by the time Adele opened her marriage two times for the Czech sugar union with Ferdinand Blochi and Klimti for the lands she heard, her father had already had a large bank in the Habsburg empire.
But Adele didn't give up all that glamorous life she belonged to.
When you look at the "Dama Christmas" it is hard to believe that this great lady of socialism and dreamt of traveling from the Council Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to tell his wife that she had been told by Klimtil, he was the last hottest artist in Vienna.
At that time, the order was paid 4,000 kroner, and the price of the house was reduced to a good location.
The fact that some portraits were suspected of master's loving model did not cause sugar magnat.
As for Adele, the only sure fact is that a model and an artist’s close relationship continued to last.
Anne-Marie O'Connor--"Always.
Gustav Klimti masterise, Adele Bloch-Baueri portraitree special story", Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Just before the start of the work, Klimt had gone to Ravennas San Vitale on a basilica, and the researchers believe that the brilliant mosaics seen there as the emperor of Theodora gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adele as a mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Daim gold" in Vienna in 1908 and about the same time (years 1907-1908) was born in another golden country.
The similarity between two women in the art industry has not been observed.
How's Hitler related to the lake?
"I think I owe my friend Klimti to make his work available to the public," wrote Adele Bloch-Bauer a few years after leaving the artist (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wanted their family to go to the museum.
Six years before the death of Klimtil, Adele had prepared another portrait.
She also asked her husband to leave her two portraits and four Gustav Klimti to the Austrian National Gallery.
She gave birth to her cousins Maria and Louise.
A year after Klimt had finished "Austria Mona Lisa", he had tried to reach the 17-year-old Adolf Hitler Academy of Fine Arts.
Although Hitler’s subsequent anti-Semitism is sometimes considered to be the reason that the professors of Judaism did not accept him into academia, none of his explorers were actually Jews.
In any case, Maria had changed her assignment to Austria Gallery by 1939, and it was important to find meaningful work for the Nazi party from the wealthy Jewish churches of Vienna.
Hitler’s personal art reserve also had some work at Adele’s home, but not Klimti’s own.
Sixteen years after the Nazi art movement, the 10-year dispute between the Austrian Government and the Bloch-Bauer's origins began.
Here it is only noted that if the "Creation" is seen in Vienna in Belvedere valley, then Adele Bloch-Bauyert depicting "Dami in the valley" should be seen driving to the New York Neue Gallery.
And before Viini's driving, he read the above book.
Even if you're looking at Klimti's work I don't plan to go, because at least my emotions were confused after the book was closed more than $135 million for the country and model of Adele Bloch-Bauer around.
So not as much as portraits, rather than a generation of history - and a very moving story.
Significantly, in the events, it facilitated the orientation of Bauer’s seed from the beginning of the Bible.
The 17-year-old farmer in Canada was very close to Estonia's record
In the event, Gold was very close to the personal record of 200 m of the movement itself by climbing 2.16.62.
Tippmark is born in 17-year-olds from a week of membership when the Canadian junior masterminds received 2,16.58, Priit Aaviku will exchange the new blog.
Gold came to the last, maybe in 10 years, the A-final.
At the end, he crossed the distance at 2.15.76 and reached a total of seven places with a new powerful tidbit.
From the Estonian record (2.15,13) Alina left Gold to settle for over half a second.
In Estonia all the time forward, Gold rose third, and his fresh personal tipping mark is the fifth result of all the time in Estonia.
The young future generation of adults in Canada is still started in 100 m, 200 m and 400 m and in 200 m and 400 m complexions.
Last week, Toronto was held at the junior master’s competitions in Canada, and Gold made a successful start there too.
He won 200 m free of charge at 2.03.22.
It was thus quickly taken from Estonia by the end of 2008.
More quickly than gold, in Estonia this distance has only been dreamed of by the Estonian recorder Elena Partõka.
The life in Canada was still won by proksmedel 100 m in liberation with a great personal record and a new Estonian passenger ticket 56.66.
For example, his older brother, Kurt Ly Alnek, has dreamed of this distance only a century earlier.
He reached his personal tipmark at 100 m in circulation by sending a letter of communication to the interval of 1.03,69.
Half of the distance was reached at all seven times when we reached the end of 2.17.31.
Gold is currently running the Estonian guest's dining table at four different distances.
President Trump is going to rest, critics are beating teeth.
The holiday time is in hand - it also means a surprise to US President Donald Trumpil.
However, since Trump has already taken the first day of vacation, the critics are already on fire.
USA Today and CNN have a 17-day vacation at the president's plan in the home golf club in Badminster, located in New Jersey.
Although the president's holiday started last night, Trumpy's opponents have already taken the floor for a weekend.
They're sending Trumpy too often to rest.
On behalf of the President, it is customary to take a weekly shift in the fields of Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
At the museum, Trump has no longer spoken in his 196 days of office.
For example, George W. Bush was able to stay at this time for 67 days, but Barack Obama was less than Trump, but only 21 days.
But it's hard for Trumpy to forget.
A few days after the president's appointment, Trump said he had "60 minutes", that for long vacations his agent would not stay long, because much more is needed to be done.
He also announced three years back from bad Barack Obama's vacation.
The current president wrote toona on Twitter: "While Obama is at rest, he plays golf, walks in parties and jockeys, and then the ISIS reporters will run away."
The 17-day golf club's visit to the White House officials is not exactly some entertainment.
It is officially referred to as a job vacation that does not include Trumpil's time or other mental activities.
In addition, there had to be another reason for the rest of the work.
The name is changed in the western condition system of the White House and therefore the entire staff had to leave.
The Ovaalkabane and other presidential premises are also located in the west.
"I don't think any of you would like to be western in August if there are 38 degrees and no conditioner," said the White House spokesman Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the president would continue working during the holiday.
From where President Trump's going to spend 17 days, you get a brain video.
Blogging critics from Facebook don't get a candidate to the government office if you don't like voters' criticism
Our country's father knew so much about the lack of media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for history to try to wipe him out from politics until he came out of politics.
Criticism, of course, upset him.
But he wasn't forced to expose his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said that "freedom of speech can take away from us and, in the dark and in the dark, can lead us to the slaughter of the Lamb's Lambs".
It brings me to Maryland's Governor Larry Hogan, who must be hard to see to be more like Washington.
The Hogans have blocked and deleted at least 450 people who published their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And at the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU appealed to him for trial.
The Kuberner officer pointed out that he was very brief and that the comments on the water were covered by the responses in the style "Who cares?".
"It's all Facebook," said many.
But it will.
And it'll do a lot when it's dealing with a man like Hogan.
It is amazing to see that it is an overcrowded democratic country with a popular sovereign power.
Its percentage of approval is in the country's 50 coppers better than in the other place.
Hogan is not an unintended reactive tumor.
He has led the country in a firm manner and has remained firmly established by his principles.
In addition, he has used the main tool in dealing with his constituents in some way with Facebook, for example, after the first time after the chemical treatment, you have a cold head on your skin.
It is therefore a public forum with official marking, which manages the salaries of the taxpayers' dollars, to block the people who visit them in an inappropriate and ultimately dangerous way.
President Amelia Chase protected The Washington Post's interview with the governor, claiming that blocking comments was nothing but moderation.
But it's too easy to paint a picture on the web of online mobiles, explosives or angered people.
The Post spoke to several very people who blocked Hogan.
And that's just what they're really people dealing with their chosen leaders. Teacher, business owner and pastor, not Internet trolls.
They all said that their comments were boring, over-examined, and not even stolen.
The pastor wrote a Bible in his post, stressing Hogan’s Catholic faith.
A lawyer from Maryland from Bowie, Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, was not angry, but very angry.
"I tactfully commented that I have been disappointed because he has not responded to anger and other recent news," he wrote in The Post's commentary section.
"However, I do not like the idea that when a courageous person comments on the same subject, some immediately appoint it as a collective effort, instead of acknowledging that the act is a lot of concern to citizens."
What the Cuban official called a "crowded gang", the others would call it "public support".
Facebook time allows messages to be easily adapted by blocking simply criticism or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than the old one, where workers were sent out to do the same, to collect records with critical guides, to burn them or to punish the protesters, and to force them to disappear.
But that's exactly what's going on right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first official to be criticised for the arrest of Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trumpy has stolen Twitter users who have blocked him from Twitter.
One of the first significant decisions on this subject was made last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris decided in Alexandria that the presence of the Board of Supervisors in the country of Loudoun was a breach of the first amendment to the Constitution when he blocked the vote on his Facebook page.
Kentuckys also visited ACLU Facebook and Twitter after the use of Matt Bevinit (R).
It shouldn't be that hard.
During Washington, there was a similar impact on taxable mail costs on the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, four times the number of newspapers and anonymous writers pushed his way of governing.
And even then, Washington had to be hit by anonymous trolls.
People wrote to newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belarus, and Portius, making decisions in Washington.
According to historical documents compiled in the framework of a project for the collection of the main books of George Washington, he reviewed the cabinet under petitions that criticized him for his position on the terms of friendship, trade and shipping agreements concluded with Britain.
But he didn't force them to move.
Freedom of speech, opinions and discussions are the beginnings of our country.
And right management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty looks forward to the relaxation of Renaissance Clubs at home
The last European representative, Ronan Rafferty, hopes for the rest of the home territory during the next three days, when East Lotian Renaissance Club golf courses take place on 25. Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Hemisphere, which was in the Archerfields nearby last year before the last round before Paul Eales was brought down, has approved a new event place and will play the role of the club’s founder and director Jerry Sarvadi instead of the tournament.
"As soon as the Renaissance Club was built, and now we see how the club with this company is completely out of sight," Rafferty said.
"The players see the race in their best form, it's in a cold state.
Jerry's done a great job at this place.
He's a golf player in the middle of the game, and he's feeling threatened here.
This enables the train to be presented in a great way."
England Eales is looking forward to the first time she will be able to protect the mastermind, although a man has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"It makes a very special feeling," said Southport pessimist player.
"I couldn't protect my Extramadura Open title because it was taken a year after my winning contest calendar.
It's magical to come back to this place.
It's a great place to play golf.
I remember memories of last year, my wife and I had a special victory last year for Sharon.
It was a very special time, which we will always put in our hearts."
On the home page, Gary Orr is also back to the competition, which joined the European tourism industry at the beginning of this year when he reached 50.
It is his first company in Scotland after his participation in the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"The home to play is always a little more meaningful," said a man in Helsinki Orr.
"You can do well, but you also feel extra effort.
I've enjoyed playing again, and I've shown a pretty good golf game.
I'm happy to go through things."
The trip is accompanied by the winner of the former Masters tournament Ian Woosnam and the tour of the travelers Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Captain Orr and former Ryder's cousin Sam Torrence are two months of the contest, the rest are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmour and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free and car parking is paid to one passenger car with 5 glasses and two or more passengers with 10 glasses.

Poverty and death in Indonesia in gold mines
When Bardina Dege prepares dinner, he doesn't use a plate.
He's using the pot very rarely.
In Indonesia, the province of Papaua, the province of Panai, in the capital of the province of Enarotali, lies in the home of the house of the house of the house of the house of the household of the native language of the Batad, which is called the local note.
Within half an hour, the injured person will be taken from the fire and given unspoiled skin by his hands.
Degei is sitting on the other side of the floor without the furniture and is also doing his daily household chores, for example, washing the sand from the nearby spring of heavy water.
The role of the walker will be filled with a room without covering it.
Since she is the younger of her husband’s four wives, she has not been appointed to care for any field.
Polygamy is normal here.
However, working late may be dangerous for most of the visitors, and many of them are working hard, and there are still soldiers here.
"Don't let anyone move after who's five o'clock in the evening to go around," he says.
It is a rare sight to live in Papa in the country of the Maya. It is with the former Dutch colony, which was joined by Indonesia after the end of 1969, in which 1026 elderly people were forced to raise their voices in the eyes of the common forces.
The movement of the Dutch superpowers moved rapidly towards the Government of Jakarta, which keeps the region under its strong control, with the removal of external writers and human rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into the Papua and the Western Pope, so that the island of Papua New Guinea remained in the eastern part of the island.
To reach this destination, you need to fly 90 minutes from the province's capital from Nabires to Nabires and then cross the five-hour drive to the train.
There's no joint transport.
About 19,000 live villages are made up of trees surrounded by bamboo branches and densely lined clay jars that have been transformed into various tones.
Very few Indonesians have taken up the technology here, regardless of the journalists, and have not gone to almost any foreign country.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the popes of the Mee Pago worshiped the divine name Uga Tamee.
I also made other changes.
"We haven't used to wear such clothes," says Degei, referring to his colorful hand with a combined turban, a dark flux, and a sharp leg.
"Before we put it in the body, we only put it on the floor."
The pope is Indonesia’s poorest province, where 28% of the people live below the poverty line and the statistics on child mortality and literacy are one of Asia’s worst.
But it's also an Indonesian gold mine.
Of the 100 km from Pania, which is about 153,000 inhabitants of New Jersey, there is the world's largest and most successful car rental in Grasberg, which belongs to Freeport McMoran, a company operating in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Freeport claimed about $3.1 billion in gold and silver worth.
In addition, Papaua can be encouraged with consumer goods, which is estimated at $78 billion.
But these injuries are the source of pope's suffering, because they constitute a powerful place for the Indonesian warship.
A 2005 study of The New York Times showed that Freeport would pay approximately $20 million for local military and military personnel from 1998 to 2004, including up to $150,000 for one leader.
The efforts of the pope to ensure greater autonomy threaten this gold and make it more attractive.
Since 1969 more than 500,000 popes have been killed by human rights activists and thousands more have been raped, tortured, and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
In the Asian Human Rights Commission data, the mass killing of genocidal gensitis occurred during the 1970s in the Magistrate countries of Papaua.
Last year alone, more than 3300 peaceful protestors were detained in the Indonesian police area.
The 2016 report "We all lose" in the main area of Birsbane contains evidence of events that have taken place last year, such as court proceedings, torture (in particular, violence and the provision of electricity) and the use of peaceful media.
"The number of victims is hard to read, as such incidents occur every week," says researcher Andreas Harrison of the Organisation Human Rights Watch Indonesia.
The cruvids are still stronger than ever, as the papal natural resources have caused new inflows from Indonesia.
83% of the population in the province of 3,5 million are Christians, but democracy is changing because from the Indonesian nation-runs of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi, the island has become a Muslim economic migration.
The domestic crops of the region are sold in wheat and cornfields with gado-gado, which is served together with the landscape.
The locals can't fight them.
"Migrands began to sell cana and farmers on a traditional local market," explains 24-year-old Abeth You, who worked in the province of Jayapura.
"The papal papal papal ma'ds are losing their market share."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, allowed his 2014 election campaign to deal with their inequality and human rights violations in the Papua.
The last tree was won on its way by Jakarta, presidential pope, 29 of the 27 electoral district, including Panai.
But the pope has changed very little, and locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken, as in 2014, we voted by Jokowi in the hope that he will fulfill our hopes regarding the restoration of justice," you say.
In fact, Pania was in a state of distress two months after the fall of Jokowi in his office in the Netherlands.
On 7 December 2014, 11 children in Enorotal were singing in the end of the day when two Indonesian soldiers appeared from the darkness.
The children who met told them they were supposed to sneak in.
According to the case of local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers voted on their vote and later married with four soldiers.
In the words of the attackers and the attackers, soldiers cut off the children and beat them with their fists.
Then one of the soldiers shot a child in the ass.
One child, 16 - year - old Julianus Yeimot, was so excited that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the election committee was set to burn down the building and the next day again.
About 1,000 young Papaua men, women, and children gathered to a football club in front of the local police department and the military command center to ask for justice.
They wore Jerusalemal janitors and presented Pope John Paulus with an impressive waiting dance, which took place around and was accompanied by a bird song.
Some of the protesters began to attack the police and the military.
In the wake of an earthquake, an order was sent to the soldiers via internal radio. "If more than three times the people are protesting, let them go," said the official document, which has seen the magazine TIME, but which is not issued to local media outlets.
The city of Kego Koto in the city of Enorotal in the old town of Jeremaya (56) felt threatened and called on to maintain peace, asking to go home with the people.
Nobody wanted to hear it.
"When I turned around, I was shot in the middle of a wheelchair," he said to the magazine TIME in his original colors on a wooden wall.
Kayme still doesn't know who was a gunman, but she says that the moon came down from the soldiers' tracks.
"There was a lot of courage in the crowd," he adds.
A local man, Alfius Youw, was able to shoot him three times.
"I went to him and examined his body, to believe that it was with him," exclaimed the newspaper TIME in the spring of John, who uses only one name for many Indonesians.
"I thought he was dead... I kissed him."
The chief police officer Yotje Mende told the reporters that his ships only returned the security of his department because it was attacked.
"We have to protect ourselves when we are threatened with murder," said Commissioner Pudjo Sulistyo, president of the Pope's Police in 2015.
"It's a question of life and death."
Human Rights Watch data killed five young protestors and were severely injured.
The next day, Jakarta arrived in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Jokowi Jayapuras held a church talk in which he declared his compassion for the victims’ families and allowed him to deal with the wrongs he had committed in Papua.
"I want to solve this case immediately so that it will never repeat again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he established an external judicial mechanism to address human rights crimes.
But almost immediately followed excuses.
"Most of the crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the early 1990s and early 2000.
The point is that we have dedicated ourselves to solving these crimes, but we must follow a certain process," he said.
On June 5 of the magazine TIME Jakartas, but Wiranto took his words back, saying that he had no intention of creating a Papapas mechanism to deal with complaints.
Instead, he said, "Everything will be resolved by law."
Wiranto, who has been charged with crimes against human rights in relation to more than 1,000 people died during the 1999 self-determination referendum in East Timor, said that 11 of the crimes against human rights had already been resolved in Papua, including in Panama.
The families of the victims adopted such claims with suspicion.
"I have been heard four times over the last three years, but no progress has been made," said John.
"I'm tired."
He says years later, there's still fear.
"I'm afraid," she says.
"I'm afraid the army will punish me, I'm afraid I'm being shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed his opinion that the Panai people are afraid of this exchange speech.
He said he got a gun from the military after he had helped four victims to kill.
"After the slaughter of dead bodies, the soldier came to find me," he says.
Fire's not over.
On the second day, Indonesian police raided the visitors of Pania in the neighboring region of Deiya.
One man was killed and 17 was injured, including children, when he went to a speech between the director of the hotel and the construction company, who refused to bring a known man to the hospital.
This 24-year-old Ravianus Doww, who was caught trying to catch a fish, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry visitors protested at the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the visitors ended up with police stones that the last of them responded to the arrest warrants.
But locally, the mobile Brigade (Indonesia Military Police) started shooting at the people, killing one person.
"We were in great pain, we were afraid of getting paid," said the 29-year-old Time Domingu Badi, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the introduction of infections.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
Deajai Parliament has called on the police to take responsibility for the matter and to withdraw the police's mobile Brigadier from the area.
Pania has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of the proposed development will result in the disillusionment of the meme, multitude, Denmark and the Dama kingdom in the Middle East.
Many of them have joined the Free Pope's Movement (VPL) forces that protect the rights of the pope in its own words by organizing attacks and humanitarian attacks in the event of the Indonesian soldiers.
Some VPL speakers are from Spain, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In response, in the wake of the war "protecting the sovereignty of the State" in Panya over the last few years, thousands of people have been arrested and detained voluntarily.
Some of them will never appear again.
The Pope is known as the Panyas "for the tragically forgotten."
Poverty is a source of anxiety.
The small rice sold in Enorotal is too expensive to buy locally.
The lion is not available.
People grow all their own food mainly potatoes, as well as some fruit and vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women who are able to care for four or five bathrooms.
They usually take care of the majority of the injured family, the rest sell on the local market.
Ten potatoes pay only 10,000 Indonesian meals (75 cents).
Over the course of time, economic imbalances have been strengthened between the fuel pipelines and new migrants who have been fully reached by the opening of new airlines from the Nabire airport.
These small jobs, which are available, are better for educated and able migrants.
There is still a lack of capital or necessary skills to maintain a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying, because there is no job or money here," said Panaii, President of the Council of Youth, John Gobai.
Disfellowshipping keeps the world’s eyes away from the pope.
In addition, there are severe restrictions on foreign media.
At the beginning of this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basil Longchamp were sent out from Papapa because "they did not follow the relevant customs", although they had been given a rare film license.
The President of the Human Rights Watch Asia Division, Phelim Kine, said that Jokowi's election permits to lose transparency and development restrictions on reporters.
"In Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, the most peaceful provinces in the east and the reporters from Western Papua are threatening the new dangers of visa refusal and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of a glimpse of the journalism means that international pressure to the Indonesian government is severely restricted to the pope’s relatives.
In March, the six Pacific states of Tonga, Nauru, Belarus, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands encouraged the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate "a number of widespread crimes" in the Papua, including the shooting of Panai.
These countries have also historically supported the VPL.
The press president of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Arrmanatha Nasir, called on the grouping charges, saying to the newspaper Jakartas: "The democratic regime and the freedom of the press are still in force in Indonesia, so that the evidence of cases against human rights would be difficult to refute."
Local people want more foreign governments to pay attention.
When the Dutch official delegation visited Jayapurat on 4 May in front of the nation's human rights envoy Kees Van Bari, the local people who were present at the meeting stopped, but to be anonymous, the source of the message they wanted to leave, asking: "We want freedom."
New presidential elections take place in Indonesia in 2019, but the pope does not believe that they are voting again by Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the shooting of Panai," said President Hobai of the Council of News.
He wants to explain to Jokowi that in addition to the constant threat posed by the Panai people to the threat of deadly war, they are alarmed by Nigerian education and health services.
In Gobai, the people of Panai, like the other popes, must pay their vow to Jokow, which he must pay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite threats and threats, Paniai's families were allowed to continue their final symbolic resistance to the country against the police force and the military base.
Knowing that justice never fails, at least those responsible will not be allowed to forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," said Yacobus with a broken leg.
"What else can we do?"
I've already come from the plane of Dubai Torchi. I've already been down the second time.
A world’s highest standard of living in Dubai was built on the railways, pushing hundreds of people to flee from this 337 meters high and 79-curricular buildings.
This is the second loss of income, which has been reduced by the highest rate over the past two years, which is called events in Torchi, or in Tõrvikutornik.
The building has been evacuated, none of the damage has been reported and no direct damage has been reported.
"We slept and woke up on the fire alarm and on the people's crew.
We walked down the stairs and spent about 10 minutes on the 50th floor to get down," said a resident named George.
According to the Dubai Civil Protection Officers, the firemen had destroyed the camp about 4 o'clock in the morning (00 o'clock in the morning) and burned the buildings.
The government said that they are working in the name of insurance of capital damage.
This exchange can also raise questions about the safety of materials used on the surface of high-speed materials worldwide.
The study conducted after the 2015 fall of the Torchi Board found that the most harm was the extraordinarily decorative panels and isolation panels of fascists.
The British police have said that they believe that the isolation of London Greenfell Tower and the fascist panels could contribute to the rapid spread of the virus that killed about 80 people in June.
See: They probably get real sales products from their phones
There is plenty of time for technology professionals, as telephone manufacturers will then publish their new models.
In the summers, Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium came to sell, and in the winter there are new hot phones waiting for players.
According to Tele2, Kristjan Seema, the director of the market and sales company, describes today’s innovative design, eyeglass mirror, 4K-servicing screen and universal processors.
The technology world in Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also come to the front of the Estonian new telephony sales table.
In the past, it is possible to provide additional emergency loadings, auxiliaries, higher quality cameras, and greater water and tortoises.
He added that on the basis of the hearings, it is already possible to make assumptions and predict four models that are likely to govern sales tables today.
These four nuttelephone-telephone-telephone-telephone-telephone-telephone-telephone-telephone-telephone-telephone-telephone-telephone-telephone-telephone-telephone-telephone-telephones are still available in the autumn of this year.
Remoted iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should be reached in mid-September.
You know, what the new Apple model looks like and what it can do is spread a lot.
If iPhone 7 did not significantly differ from iPhone 6s, it is expected that the new model will be completely different from the previous one on the 10th birthday of Apple.
It is mentioned in four colors: black, white, red gold and chrome.
One element of the new design is probably the screen that covers the entire phone screen, the door button is lost, and the mirror is built into the screen.
Apple's designer JohnnyIve requires a new iPhone model to look like a glass.
In that case, it has also been reported on the ceramic version of iPhone.
In addition to the eye-candy scanner, the driver-free loading and even better quality camera, A11 processors can be expected.
I'm sure it's an unexpected phone call for a year.
Danger model Galaxy Note 8 pre-emption starts on August 23.
There's been a lot of rumors about what new Galaxy Note 8 is going to look like.
Of course, more than one entrepreneur has been thought of, and S Pen allows even greater functionality.
There should be two cameras on the phone, one of which is an elevator and the other with a tighter view of the TV.
Now no one knows what two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, this Samsung's first test, which is definitely comparable to iPhone 8 for quality.
But we'll wait until August 23rd.
Although Nokia has been selling three nuts in front of Nokia 6 this year, it is still missing their flagship - Nokia 8, which is already presented on 16 August.
We expect immediate 5.3-inch cross-sectional screens and surfaces of Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processors and opposite acutes.
In the case of nokia, it is also mentioned the aluminium body and the significant level of water and tolding of IP68.
In comparison with Samsung, Nokia has a new model of two back cams that the optics produce company Zeiss.
If Sony is sure that he has had the XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that there are at least two nut phones that have even more innovative functions in the near future.
We're waiting for a new phone that's kind of more durable than XZ Premium, but at least with the same good or better camera.
Sony's new model is speculating that this screen is at least six months old.
As a result, we can already see the right head because traditionally Sony has published his deep flag at the International Technology Centre IFA, which takes place this year from 1 to 6 September.
In the case of telephony transcripts, Trump complained about payment for the Mexican border
The Washington Post published the transcripts of telephone calls between the U.S. President Donald Trumpy and the Heads of State of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, Trump telephoned the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to end the public preaching that he did not intend to pay for the rent.
The President of the United States spoke to him about the public execution of the wall, saying, "You can't tell the press."
Trump set up his presidential campaign to build a long southern border wall and waterway in the United States to make Mexico pay for this project.
The transcripts were also published in his first speech with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who reveals the subtle exchange of ideas.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement by which the United States of America takes refugees headed for Australia is "neglectful", "neighbor" and "room". He said that the agreement made during Obama's government would be remembered as he has offered refugees from the United States to re-establish the United States.
The storm ended, informing Turnbull that "the day was the most unpleasant word of the day."
The National Court of Justice did not hold a debate on the complaint of OÜ MRP City Linna, where the city of Tartu withdrew from the offer of the bus line from July 2019 to 2029.
This is an order that rejected the offer to the Tartu bus project, since the offer did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtin, director of the City Law Office of Tartu.
This is the period from 01.07.2019 to 30.06.2029.
The MRP City Lines appealed to the Court of Justice of Tartu.
The national court has not taken this procedure.
Even though many social media lament that the weekend’s program is disrupting their evenings and the whole city is full of fans, there are many who do not say any bad words about a long-term festival on the beach.
I've even been positively surprised to have been so clever in trade!
I didn't see any shame or failure.
I've even seen the departure," says Parnas Laine.
"It's good to come, be, and feel the joy of Pärnus, who's as cold as the rest of the winter," he adds with joy.
It's been a long time since the beach was empty and it doesn't bother.
When he was in the center of his life, he still heard that music was playing on the beach, and now music has not reached his home.
"While I hope to hear," he says happily.
And Agnes, who is in the middle of the night, says that it’s better for Pärnu’s wedding - it’s good to be with local shopkeepers.
In addition, he rejoices that there have been so many outbacks.
I don't care about your wife.
Of course I don't live on the beach anymore, but it's good that the beach is alive.
And it's good that the people are moving, and it's been three times," says the woman.
For the first time, it must have been worse.
"Then maybe there were complaints," he thinks.
But the music that takes place on the beach is a common practice for the Swedes.
"This weekend is a very good promotion to our small town," says Harri, a Parisian.
Love and love didn't break his lifeblood.
But for what?!
We should all be together.
To think about how better this international relationship would be.
You don't have to choose music from a man.
It doesn't matter, even if I live near it.
"Good people can keep together and there's no harm," he says.
The visitors who came to the village are smart in his word.
"Of course they've gone a little too far, but young people are young and master God - let's go, but be human and we can do it!" he says.
At this time, seafarers have traveled to some place, whether near relatives or familiar ones.
"Even though the festival has a positive effect on the lives of the guests, such fun likes it," says Pärnus, who walked with the children of China.
Also, his family and festival music did not interfere, even though last year it was much longer than today.
Last summer there was a lake on the other side, so we heard more.
We live out of the city itself, that it actually takes quite a while away from Pärnu's lake," he says.
Pearson will reach another 3000 jobs and reduce dividends to restore the company
British education company Pearson has rightly said that it will reach another 3000 jobs and reduce its average rate of 72% by launching a business-threatening Chinese restructuring programme.
The waste of jobs, combined with the high likelihood of the action by John Fallon, will be added to the 4000 officials lost during the previous restructuring in the end of 2018 and early 2019.
In May, Pearson announced the plan to reduce the costs of another 300 million dollars (394 million US dollars) under the Third Cost Reduction Programme to try to restore a business that has been made more rapidly due to the transition to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell last month’s share in Penguin Random House to its partner company Bertelsmann, said that their expectations for the year had not changed since sales income of 1 % increased by 2,05 billion dollars in the first half of the year.
On Sunday, the summer sun will continue to shine
In Estonia on Sunday, the summer season with the opportunity to have a good time will be a summer, and the winds will be very strong.
At night there will be an explanation in Estonia.

Kabul: NATO military force
The first bomber attacked officials in Afghanistan, headed by Kabul, killed one NATO soldier and wounded a number of others.
In NATO's statement, five soldiers and a translation were injured.
In the absence of confirmation of local communications, three civilians were killed in an attempt to kill the city in the Qarabagh region.
This bombing is the last of the acts of violence that took place in Afghanistan this month - on the other day, more than 30 people were killed in the Herat massacre.
On the first day, a suicide bomber killed nearly two people in the territory of Kabul.
NATO statement stated that a four-day explosion occurred when a joint patrol attacked the Afghan army with "the same oil-contained gas."
According to the statement, all of them are injured in a stable condition and are treated at the U.S. military camp outside the airport of Bagram.
Correspondents say that the growing power of the Taliban and a group known as the Islamic nation (ISIS) is a serious worry for the forces in Kararabagh in NATO Bagram.
UN data have killed at least 1662 civilians in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, some 20% of them in general.
At the end of July, Autopom killed in Kabul mainly at least 30 people in the Pacific region.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On 31 May, a large bomber killed more than 150 people in the middle of the country - the most deadly result of a war crime in the country since the United States struck the United States as soon as possible in the year 2001.
This violence emphasizes the uncertain security situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump considers whether to increase the number of US forces involved in the military and police.
The respondents claimed that the suicide reports in Kabul in recent weeks have led to the same public confidence crisis against the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
Following the withdrawal of the EPA, the decision to continue the suspension of the definitive Regulation was adopted
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) repealed the decision to speed up the adoption of the Obama-Time Regulation, which obliges the parties to limit their emissions caused by bone gas, one day after the 15 States filed a complaint to the Agency for its conduct.
The EPA notified its decision to continue on the third day after "with the action to determine the content of the stock 2015", saying that it would show the Agency's commitment to cooperation with the countries.
"We believe that we must engage in dialogue with our partner countries and listen to them," said EPA leader Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Prutt had notified the EPA's intention to avoid the determination of ozone-depleting substances measured in different parts of the country in order to determine where this level should be reduced to a strict air quality standard by one year compared to October 2018.
The 15 main democratic parties, together with the Colombia Round, made an action on the second day, saying that this decision was illegal.
President Donald Trumpi's Government has tried to reverse several environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama.
But these efforts have resulted in resistance to democracy and natural protection groups, which have increased the impact of pollutants on human health.
The EPA web site says that entering into the room "may reduce the working capacity of the lungs and increase the risk of respiratory disease", for example, in asthma.
A German sailor can come in.
In Germany, pigs and pigs may be arrested, as strong winds threaten the European Union's level of second production, Bloomberg writes.
Today, it can be said that weeks before the arrival of the harvest, the seed that is meant to be a fig tree can only be eaten by animals.
"The quality of theirs is far worse than mine and worse than in 2015," said Agravis Raiffeisen, analyst Bernhard Chilla.
Today, up to 40 percent of German beef can be eaten twice as much as usual in Agravis.
Germany's agriculture as well as their European colleagues have today been affected by any kind of air.
First of all, the cold was too cold.
Then came the cold spring, which in June replaced the heat lamp.
In July, Germany destroyed the drought, which has continued in August.
Many eyes have been turned to North-South Germany, where the wind prevents the arrival of Christmas.
Only five percent of the lead has been used so far.
Most of the region has not yet benefited from the achievement, informing the local partner, Ceravis.
"This is a very difficult day," said Ceravese's grandfather, Frank Deckert from Rendsburg.
Consistency in all possible areas of Finnish internalisation
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the mexican codes, because through the great clocks, the comparative views of the Saima camels are reached in many (life) rooms.
Each step begins with the effort of our fundamentalists to create perfect (energy-saving) homes as well.
In addition, the use of wood and wood is valued by the Finnish forest centre for the manufacture of building and finishing materials, furniture and furniture.
Remarkable approaches and nucities solutions are found in the mesmes, both the builder and the (house) designer.
It is obvious from this point of view that the combinations of black, white and yellow stocks, if they are complemented by forests and restaurants, can be very pleasant.
Good ideas will be made fast for another week, because the Mass will last 13 August.
Needles and urdipots tend to be tested frequently in this area.
In the evening, at the bottom of the afternoon, the weekend festival was held in Baltic and Martin Garrix gave himself everything to be remembered as the last event.
During Garrix's appearance, the people were really turning around - the song, the dance, the dance, the prelude.
When Garrix finished, a common mass was lit from the coast of Pärnu across the city.
We'll bring you a gallery where there's all the pictures we've been looking for in the weekend in three days.
You must be some of them, too. Find yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss possible opposition
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to be at the peak course in order to respond to the most complex poximachi in the near future up to 66.7 kg of potassium category, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were at the ESPN office in Los Angeles in separate rooms, until Garcia, the winner of the World Boxing Council, followed the corridor on the other side to greet Lomachenkot, the World Boxing Organization’s closed chain champion.
After the end of Garcia's single decision, the winner of the first quarter of the world's winner, Adrian Broner, is on the Saturday at Showtime, the two winners are on the front page of the battle table.
Garcia stretched out her right hand and said, "How you doing, champ?
I'd like you a favor."
Lomachenko protects his sword against Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 19 o'clock in the ESPN.
When several photos were taken, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that there would be a "real measurement" between combatants.
"I'm a former prisoner," said Garcia.
"I moved up for Broner [about 63,5 kg], but I'm not that big.
I'm 63,5 pounds small.
I'd like to move down the stairs.
And he has to move over the light rock [61,2 kg] and then we can fight.
The fuck wanted to do that.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko's consent.
"The world needs this fight."
The climate raised the question of whether this should be a balance. It is part of his strategy that he wants to take Lomachenkol down to the end of this year in 61.2 kg class to make it possible for the next meeting of Garciaga (37-0.30 knots), which is equally interested in combating the fight against George Linarese and Luke Campbell's motorcycle after the winner of the small-scale title fair held on 23 September.
"The view of the struggle could be costly, as the fans have wanted it to meet," said Garcia, later saying that he is open to fighting any channel that offers the best financial package.
"We are fundamentalists.
No other name can be taken as much attention.
Whenever they're ready... "
Garcia said he's gonna have to be a "hard fighter" Lomachenkot, and he can go and look at his bike on Saturday.
Lomachenko, however, was very kind when he thanked Garcia, saying that from his mind he saw three masters from Riverside "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted to stop it."
Garcia said that it was his goal to show flexibility and then put it to work.
Both confirmed that they knew how much pressure to push each other grows.
"It is a struggle that awaits realization.
No other answer is so much attention and attention.
I'm more than willing to do work on that name," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the best fighters and Mikey is just that.
That's a good fight."
What world events are being carried on in Estonia?
The police and border guard (PPA) has extended and issued a record of more than 13,000 residence permits to third-country nationals who are officially travelling to Estonia to work, to study or to attend their family.
For example, if my husband decided to grant an interim residence permit to 6702 abroad, this number was 4928.
Officials cannot say how many immigrants will finally remain in Estonia, but such an analysis will be made in the Ministry of the Interior.
Ten years ago, about 500 Ukrainians went to Estonia in the year, and in the past few years, this number has begun to reach almost 2000.
The number of applicants for residence permits grew dramatically during the Ukraine crisis - in 2014 the age of 1087, 675 years ago.
Statistics show that in Estonia, the largest number of Ukrainian citizens increased to 850 Ukrainian citizens over the past.
"The Ukrainian community has been big in Estonia all the time, and because of the difficulties in the country, it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where society and many families are already ahead of them," said Prime Minister Christine Rammus.
The majority of Ukrainian citizens who had been granted a temporary residence permit were even greater than the number of citizens in Russia, although during the last decade the most important residence permit has been issued.
When Ukrainians come to work here, the citizens of Russia are after their families.
"In view of this historical Russian society, they probably also have the biggest family ties with the people living in Russia," said the Helsinki Maasing Immigration Service.
"Where Estonia's citizens have moved to live, after Harjuma there is an immediate East-Viruma", he added, adding that about 40 percent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
In 1696, I was granted a temporary residence permit to a citizen of Russia, who is also a record.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wanted to extend their residence permit decreased further.
"The gap is due to the fact that instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been required to stay in Estonia permanently," explained Rammus, president of the Ministry of Interior, who has said that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonia has remained stable for years.
A new residence permit for Estonia will be available to foreign nationals who have lived here for at least three years in order to stay in Estonia for the last year.
This aim is to promote the modernization of people.
The long-term residence permit, for example, is expected to last five years.
The new residence permit has probably also reduced the extension of the old residence permit.
For example, I was granted a residence permit to 146 Ukrainians who have been working here for at least three years.
The Ukrainians can now change jobs and the Estonian state will no longer be able to determine whether the wage criterion has been fulfilled.
This residence permit was granted as a popular residence permit - still valid passport owners (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
A total of 23 American, 12 Egyptian, 18 Georgian, and many Chinese people were allowed to live in Estonia for the purpose of living in 1968.
With the first half of today, the total number of such applicants has already been 1269.
For ten years, it has been surprising to have received from Nigeria, whose citizens are one more active applicants for Estonia's residence permit.
When three Nigerian residence permits were issued in 2007, I received 200.
We're going to learn from Nigeria in these universities.
Estonia's high schools are still popular examples among Georgian, Chinese and Turkish.
The number of citizens in India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased dramatically thanks to the studies.
They also apply the rule that where the community is established, it will be easier to approach others," in the Annex to Rammus.
Over the past ten years, two people have traveled to Estonia, for example from North Korea, as well as many from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If about 6,000 third-country nationals are granted a residence permit per year, it is approximately 0.46 per cent of the total population.
Even if we think of the citizens of the European Union, the gap remains about a percentage," Maasing commented that there are actually few numbers.
A total of 14,822 people were interviewed by the Statistics Office in Estonia, but 13,792 were released.
This means your sister's been spending the second year of her release.
Most foreign and foreign students are Estonian citizens, but most of them are refugees.
As a result, Estonia’s foreign population was reduced to 2000 people.
In particular, the Estonians travel between Finland and Estonia.
Momma Couture's prince sexesesides owes to satisfactory, thievery and thievery
However, Maria Tammeoru has a history - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream of the goods in the museum for hours and admire the old clothes and clothes.
If you're doing something wrong, you'll do research and learn about it every day.
It's a discovery!
Mama Couture's glamorous world may show some lifestyles, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide for yourself how much money you have in your life!
I've got a friend who's full of all the salts I've created in my leather coat.
Because it's not his fault that he doesn't live in Hollywood and doesn't go to the red baby every day, he wants to wear them the most beautiful clothes and hang them!
You can live your own life in a unique way!
The artist does not recognize the gap between the events and the festival's birthday.
That is why it was planned to bring high - tech structures in Estonia, between forests and forests, to people whose style is not often reached.
For example, Mother’s collection was presented on the Motel of Võrus, South and Pärnu, where the 45 Royal Delicate filled the whole day.
In Tallinn, it's usually taken in, it's taken out of the closet, but there's a lot of emotions, there's more, there's a bravavo, it's standing up, they want to thank you.
Most of the audience came to renew, but now they're Mama Couture's fans.
If you're beyond the expectations of people, they're inspired!
And I like the feeling that I'm with my molo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o.
We had a 50 - foot - long [50 m] red light, a whole day full of beautiful clothes, as if they wouldn't end up!
Mary also does not recognize the need to present the creation to the supersail supermodel, and she happily brings normal women to the valley.
I often invite my own customers to the bathroom - they've always come with joy.
It's such a wonderful experience, you can keep on the wall in a wonderful way!
I'm so sorry that I've never seen my performance myself, I've always been behind the table to give the most hopeful perfectionist move on things.
My nose wouldn't allow me to look around on the floor quietly.
Mary is the kind of molder who does not only want to fulfill the role of representation, but at all times.
I've got a studio in my bathroom, most of the collection I do myself.
I like the whole process you play with details.
I'm never far from my creation and I'm not afraid of work.
Design is not limited, including stylists, logistics, organization, organization - everything has to take place on the day of one temperature woman.
That these hours of work must still be great for the fanatics.
I can't tell you when my workday ends, it's just a day full of joy for me!
I'm still very excited - it's like an endless happy day: I'm doing something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and even more complicated.
How many times have it been said that my clothes have magic - they make themselves a prince.
The lovely blue satiries that Mary's heard over the talent have remained the signature of Mama Couture to this day.
Martin Müürsep from the sons of the U18: Estonian subroutine gun now turned against us
It's too bad. The old man's got his head.
The first thing I saw was that we couldn't get our table.
And when the board comes in so big, nothing to do," commented Estonian U18 Corpsballs 61:75 to the United Kingdom our only NBA played corvball, BC Kalev/Cramo abistrainer Martin Müürsepp.
The response took 28 bullets from the attack and received so much more attacks.
We were also not prepared for their aggressive protection or attack, that song.
Many English attacks ended in three to five seconds, and we couldn't build up protection.
They were able to hold each other, but we couldn't combine.
It broke the team's legs.
The response was better done at home.
On the basis of the wall assessment, Estonia had to make more tactical mistakes in order to remove them.
Finally, we had zero bugs, but you've already got a few quickscores.
The ambiguity and the sharp move that was our weapon on the subsurface now turned against us all.
Today, we had no power against their aggressiveness.
Mürsep took care of Kalevis, Mattias Tassai.
The tournament is generally able to tell good news about the whole team, which has been a single striker today.
I'm sorry you've already met with such aggressive resistance.
He's been on his own all the time and played out today, but he seemed tired - he's wearing a pretty big weight.
But he did some beautiful movement I've seen in the trainings before," in the annex.
Heavy numbers: in the case of the deuces, the EM tournament has dropped with less than 10 points...
The U18 age class did not only go to the EMI B-division Corvball tournament in Tallinn, but they started over in Dublin.
And the Estonian game of Poolaga played better in the field of anti-corritory.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter, it was 9:49, or just the last ten minutes, that took the opposite foot from the gas station, and the production period was 16:16.
Both the first and the second Friday, Eesti 4, the third, 1st point...
On this occasion the Estonians first met with two minutes of four of the first two pieces, but then 25 points of the game passed, one third in, and then 21 points in the...
Maybe in about half an hour, one of 47 whiskers was killed.
In addition, 2 points came from four freedoms.
The pallet was a reasonable number at this time, 12.
At the end of the game, Poland was 33 and Estile 13 percent (68/9).
Estonia has begun with two losses, the opening day came to testify to Portugal's 83:56 improvement.
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to add supplies
Today NATO's 1st permanent miniming team has been transferred to Tallinn for a planned port visa in order to complement ship stocks and prepare for future applications.
During the voyage, ships make preparations for the sea and give crew members the opportunity to rest for a couple of days.
After the visit, NATO ships into Estonia to carry out a number of exercises and to be ready for future search for historical explosives.
"The participation of the Estonians in NATO units and their local cooperation training in water is well reflected in our integration with the Union forces," said Captain Arto Reinmaa of the Overseas Operations and Planning Division of the Overseas Division.
Since 29 June, NATO's 1st Permanent Mission of Latvia is headed by Captain Gvido Laudups, who took over the task of seremonial grouping over Estonia by Captain Johan-Elias Seljam from the country.
The LVNS Virsaiti, which also operates the group’s leadership, is designated for the Group’s flagship of Latvia.
This half-year is also part of the composition of the international unit of Estonian seamine leader Sakala.
One of the four groups of NATO's ships underway is a permanent unit of preparation of NATO 1's first air traffic controllers, which may be sent to various world locations within five days of the alliance.
On August 4 - 13, the memory of the Pirita monastery will be restored to a place 13 years ago in the Birgitta Festival, invited to live by the Maestro Eri Classics.
Today's Birgitta Festival, Tallinn Philharmona's artistic leader, Risto Joosti (36) says to be beautiful, powerful and unpretentious.
Risto Joost: My listeners arrive in the opera world classes "Traviata" and "Tosca", the ballet responses from "Boleros" to "Karlssonini" are also not planned for their own production, which, in this case, Joseph Haydni's wonderful oratorium "Years" was released by the same international team of creatures who in 2015 brought the Pirital valley to Haydni to the second master's "Looming".
There's a lot more to Birgitta Festival than just concerts and theatre events.
It's bigger than any music theater in its usual form.
It's a festival whose pleasure takes power and never let go of it again.
Because the experience gained by the listener in this superior and secret environment makes the insatiable and human beings in a way that is impossible to describe.
Resto, you're the first year of the Birgitta Festival's artistic leader.
Didn't Maestro Eri Class look a little larger?
Of course, since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Kla, there has been a lot of help.
He directed me through my entire school list and supported me at the beginning of the management list.
Maybe just thanks to that, I'm gonna have to keep her job.
The different class has injected the Birgitta Festival team so much of a favor and of course it's all over me too.
It was great to join a team that knew exactly how things were going.
It's just that Eri's great heart also gave me the strength to go on with Tallinn Philharmonic in Birgitta Festival.
And here I am and I can start!
What could make the audience present at the festival what special offers?
We have an artist from England, Latvia, Lithuania and a surprise will be presented in the museum with the first ballet written by Astrid Lindgrin.
It's Karlsson flying.
And one of the bad news is that the author of this ballet is Lätt's hero, Juris Karlson, who said he wanted to write it.
I think he's already got a dependent character in Karlsson from the kid.
Rasto, how are you doing all this?
Thanks to my support, I'm sure.
Such work requires a support system and a lot of love, and I'm happy about it.
And I've noticed that my personal emotions don't depend so much on other people, as much as I do on myself, or how I go against every new day.
And such a conscious attitude, a positive attitude, and actually laughing at yourself in the morning, made me significantly more happy.
Especially now this week, when there are the most important samples, I have been particularly practicing it and it works.
After laughing, the brain activates and increases performance.
It's not just a dictionary.
I don't think people still know half things about their body that the universe offers to them, but that's what everyone will find out.
Right now, it's an important moment in your hand.
Do you have any ritual before you hit the steering wheel?
Still, clothes have to be changed against the most comfortable.
It's just a little bit more personal.
But in general, yes, I don't have a chance to clean up before the big show or do a little trick.
In fact, I like to have an active relationship with people, even before the start of the driving force.
But come back to the Birgitta Festival, here's what's to discover not only a great opera and a ballet friend!
Look at the favorite videos with Risto Joosti!
New results were published for the assessment of the age of Swedish asylum seekers
A test was carried out in Sweden by asylum seekers during which their age was evaluated medically with a new approach. The latest results show that more than 80 percent of the tests were evaluated as older than 18 but not all of them do not believe in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Court of Justice (Rätttsmedical Network) initiated tests at the beginning of this year.
The tests were created to assess the ageing accuracy of the asylum application following the criticism of the Swedish Migration Agency (Migration Network) that they had not been able to accurately determine the age of several sub-Saharan refugees.
To date, the Migration Network has submitted 680 cases and the Court of Justice has issued a total of 2481 test results from mid-March 2017 to 31 July 2017.
Eightty percent (2002) was evaluated as an 18-year-old or older, and in 25 cases, the Court of Justice assessed that the test "may be 18-year-old or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that a person is "probably younger than 18".
Tests shall be used only if the age of the person is below the mark.
According to Johan Göransson, who worked at the Institute of Juvenile Medicine, the results are consistent with the preceding six properties.
"We don't see much difference in the previous six months' statistics, the numbers are quite consistent," he said to the newspaper The Local.
The fact that most of the cases were evaluated as older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The institution issued the results of the May 581 test and said that in 442 "there are references to the person being 18 years of age or older".
But when historian Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of these 581 tests, it was clear that in 243 cases, a person had claimed directly that he would get 18 this year.
This method of evaluating age medical age, which is conducted by smarter X-rays and genetics MRTs, which are then allowed to be analysed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticised in some circles.
One of the doubts is the Karolinska Institute Endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work assignments include the assessment of people's biological density in order to clarify whether they passed the standard of puberty earlier or later.
"I've had reason to think about it and I don't think that the measurement method currently used should be used.
The definition of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say exactly, we shouldn't pretend we can," he told the historian Metro.
But Johan Göransson of the Court of Justice Institute defended the accuracy of the tests: "It can generally be said that the risk of abortion as an adult is small.
The biggest, perhaps around 10%, is the risk if a person is under 18."

20-year-old left-winger Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debut in London's MMil by getting a total of 67.37.
Orel was a young MMI female prostitute, and a happy woman confirmed that she was looking forward to fighting medals in the future.
The crew went well, and I got a good experience.
With the first test (64.80), I immediately took my mean score, and on the second (62.80) I risked too much and on the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear," Orel said after the contest.
I'm looking for my men, and I'm so glad I found it.
Anna Maria Oreli MMI ended the Debt at the 18th floor.
He's not upset about Orel because he's already training himself through the TTU station.
"I'm hurt," he said to the little one.
In London, the Olympics were almost full of people, did Orel find people around or could she throw herself out?
I knew it, but in a positive sense.
Everyone says it's giving it to you - that's right!
If you fight yourself, you can try it.
Orel confirmed that the MMI will remain at peace with the Debud and is waiting for many more good competitions: "I came here with the last result of the 32rd anniversary, I finished at 18.
It's a very good result.
I'm 20 years old, and MMil is the only one who reads.
I'm taking a good experience, and a few days I want to fight on behalf of the medals.
West Virginia Kuberner informed of the partnership
From the Democratic Republic of West Virginia, Governor Jim Justice announced that he would switch the parties on Thursday evenings with President Trump.
"I like it or not, but the democracies walked away from me," said Kuberner Justice.
"Here I tell you, having prayed earnestly and thought deeply... today I tell you, Westerners, that I can no longer help you as a democratic conqueror."
At the gathering, the throngs rejoiced.
"So you'll get rid of me tomorrow," added Justice.
"Treenina, I'd like to tell you that it's time to play another game."
Trump had promised a great deal of information when he was first gathered in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which is the only billion member state in Forbes data, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he belongs to five countries, and he is almost the same as his father.
His value is about $159 billion.
At the same time, the Committee of the People's Republics (RNC) announced on Thursday evening that the "Cuberer Justice's partnership would be a series of steps towards a democratic party which would rather prevent the country from becoming better than working on its behalf".
"Of the 15 cyberspaces and control of the lowest number of countries over history - the knowledge of cybersynthesis Justice is simply the latest talk to the party, which is directly guided by and cannot find positive and consistent messages," said RNC in Ronna McDaniel in CBS News.
No wonder there's a lot of people there, too.
Ummet, at the medical office at Weekend, said last night they had to share a lot of plastics.
The villas and bars are main, except for the pools and the simple swimming pools.
Of course, headaches, headaches and headaches.
As a result, visitors come to the festival with false stone pressures and so the problems come.
Girls have also had to help some of the more vulnerable visitors - there have been some panic attacks, and there has also been one bullet in the leg.
And we've also done bugs if a man has made a hand or a fingertip.
We'll do the least of these things out here, the bigger we get into the hospital.

Coe thanked the Russians for their sincere apology for the Doping Canal
In his statement, Sebastian Coe, an international army officer, thanked him for the "Fourth-day sincere apology" for the Doping Canal, but once again, it is no time to allow the country's sport back.
Dmitry Shylakhtin, on behalf of the Russian Länder, said at the IAAF Congress that his country had the right way of fighting and that he was sure to fight against doping.
He asked for forgiveness "from all the light bulbs that have been pushed off the gold and silver medals in the contests".
In spite of his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of leaving the competitive framework established in November 2015 after the World Anti-Discrimination Agency (WADA) report found evidence of State-supported doping in Russia.
"I think it was a very good answer today, a very good presentation," IAAF President Coe told the journalists.
"The Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russians also acknowledged themselves that they had very difficult times and that they were doing everything they could to reorganize the Union."
In addition, Coe said he was pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its prevention.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and is taking place, but the Congress supports the proposal of the Working Group that it is not the right time to take Russia back," Coe said.
"We have to do everything possible to normalize the situation in the next few months.
We have always come from the principle that we want to separate clean sportsmen from the corrupt system," he added.
One of the nine Russian lighthouses that meet the strong criteria of the IAAF are engaged in the fight against light-emitting in London as neutral sportsmen.
The head of the IAAF Working Group, Rune Andersen, said on the first day that Russia is no longer responding to a number of prevention criteria.
Following a proposal to the IAAF Council, he announced to the journalists in London that the controls on doping are still insufficient and that trainers who have been denied the exemption are still free to work.
The revolution of electric cars significantly alters the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and the losers?
Less than the fact that the electricity revolution changes significantly from fuel to infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market.
Although complaints like Glencore can say that they win and lose from one another, smaller complaints firms do not help.
Glencore is currently serving in coal and oil, but in the time of the electric cars, cobalt, lithium, vass, aluminium and nitric acid are growing.
This year, the United Kingdom, France and Norway have increased their contributions to the distribution of electricity vehicles, which allow for the decades to prohibit the sale of new vehicles using fossil fuels.
Sestab has already known Volvo that they are planning to release from the internal combustion engine and Tesla will bring the next Model 3 electric car to the market.
According to the Bloomberg New Energy Finance projections, electricity cars have already been sold for more than two decades than oil-producing cars.
"It's all going to change in some metals," said the capital Economics raw materials analyst Simona Gambraini Bloomberg.
We have already seen a great impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, whose demand has grown over the years.
In electric cars there are about three times more heavy than usual, reported Glencore.
There is still a need for even greater weight in loading stations, so the price of Exane BNP Parbas increases by around five percent by 2025.
The growth of the demand for electric cars means additional lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese requirements.
Glencore will be able to gain from the rising trend of electricity cars from the low cost and from the world's largest cobalt producer, predicting the Jefferies Group.
This company is estimated to be another winner of the power generation of electric cars in Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is responding to a trend that has already changed.
Today, 70 percent of London's metal bars have been high.
The result was 37 percent.
Also, the weight has increased by 14 percent, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore's share increased by 20 per cent in London, with an estimated overstatement of Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billton and Anglo America.
On the part of the consumers, companies such as Recyclex and Campine have to adapt to a new era.
The most basic end-use is the gas and diesel engine starters equipped with aqueducts.
Electric cars are used for the use of lithium circuits.
"This is a serious risk to the gas demand, given that another demand may be found to be overcome by a reduction in demand," said the Bank of America Merrill Lynchi, director of the metal market analysis Michael Widmer.
The impact of the trend is still not noticeable in the view of further price fluctuation.
More than 17 per cent of the industry's industry's industry's industry is now costing the best of the metal.
Investors see problems for metal in the long term.
"I'm not sure it's so bad for the pig, because the oil keeps regular cars in competition," said herwig Schmidt, a metal acceler firm in Triland Metals.
If the requirement of a pig is broken, it will take place slowly.
Maybe it'll happen about ten years later.
However, the stricter emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid vehicles, which depend on the medium-sized auctions developed during the start of the engines, will be assessed by the international research organisation and by the team.
Slight metals such as aluminium are replaced by steel, as the easier the car gets to drive with less electricity.
This has already been explained as an additional 1.6 million tonnes of aluminium demand by the year 2013-2016.
This represents 2.7% of the world’s total production of aluminium.
This trend is probably getting worse, Widmer said.
Aluminium has now increased by 13% because the increasing demand for car manufacturers has led to market deficits.
Terase producers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding works with General Motor to use nanotechnology for the production of black cars.
Also, ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are trying to develop a more flexible soil to resist aluminium.
"Sustaining space should be the answer to this development," said exane BNP Parbas analytic Sylvain Brunet.
There is some progress in Europe.
The end of the oil year may also bring suffering to the platinum.
I heard about half of this expensive diesel engine catalytic car catalytics, reported metal refinery to Johnson Matthew.
"Many of today's raw materials such as oil and platinum are not likely to be a major demand in the future," said Natix's raw materials analyst Bernard Dahdah.
This does not mean that the raw materials become less important, but their importance changes within 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers believe that the continued requirement for diesel hybrids is still valid.
Uncore's leader Marc Grynberg said that in 2025 more hybrid cars were constantly being sold.
The large expectations of the platinum producers in the 10-year perspective are toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos developed on the water cycle, which depend on the platinum to produce water from electricity.
However, this technology has not yet been commercially justified.
"There seems to be a clear waster on the road to electric cars," said Exane BNP Parbasis from Brunet.
The German car manufacturers became involved in a large rehearsal in July, since the Stuttgart court banned the use of diesel in Mercedes-Benzi and Porsche.
How the Financial Rules of the Football Stock Exchange affect the transition of Neymari to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unencumbered use of European legislators do not prevent the worldwide transition of Neymari from Spain's football license to the Paris-Saint Germain Paris Club in Barcelona France.
Whatever the consequences of UEFA, the governing body governing the European game and whose power is to ban the participation of the Presiding Masters in the tournament, Paris is only waiting for Saint Germain.
The UEFA Financial Regulations (FFPs) for the game of the game set up in 2011 mean that the PSG must at any time prove that Neymari's transition has been financed without undue damage.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million (262 million) only to buy out its contract and Neymari's wage will be extended to $10 million a year.
Here are some financial aspects of the transfer to the Neymari France club.
The PSG has no doubt the possibility of recruiting Neymari and adding such money to its vast reform, taking into account that the team is funding a family that manages the Katari energy crisis.
Clubs are allowed to spend hard to recruit players, but they have to balance this legal income source, which enables them to get out of the football field.
The FFP was founded by Michel Platini after he was elected UEFA President in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that succeed in seeking great debt are actually engaged in fraud and risking a discount if banks or owners should resign from support.
From 2011 onwards, instead of the debt of the FFP clubs, it focuses on monitoring their losses.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich used first in 2003 in Chelsea's - buying a potential club and then making large expenses to make the team better change and create a global brand - is harder to implement.
From the current three-year evaluation period, which will last until 2018, the clubs may incur losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And although Platin was subsequently removed from the Presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Alexander Ceferin, has still dedicated himself to preventing excessive consumption.
"The FFP has certainly not died and we will continue to strengthen their rules without any doubt," said The Associated Pressle Andrea Traversso, who is UEFA's FFP supervisor last week.
Although the PSG paid the Neymari transfer debt as a whole, it is possible for them to distribute that amount for the purposes of accounting purposes as part of the entire duration of the contract.
The five-year agreement was concluded by Neymar, so it is possible to show the transition over the next five years as a sum of EUR 44.4 million in the next five years.
For the first sentence of the FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, together with Abu Dabel, received the most severe punishments with Manchester City.
The PSG estimated a fine of EUR 60 million (now $82 million) which was reduced later to EUR 20 million, and the club demanded the limitation of the Masters' Supreme Team for the period 2014-2015 instead of normal 25 for 21 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that may try to plan over regulatory financial institutions, talking about their income over companies related to the property of the club.
A catalytic company may sponsor PSGs, but if the value of sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered as an official income.
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of the support for Qatar Tourism Authority PSG had been exceeded.
It has been said that a certain part of the Neymari PSG service may come from Qatar through the 2022 World Tourism Management Committee.
However, PSG and Qatar in 2022 claim that Neymar could be sent to world power stations and claim that the UEFA regulatory authorities could easily reveal such a manoeuvre.
The penalties previously imposed on PSG mean that UEFA is still more prudent in relation to any attempt to eliminate rules.
People are aware on Thursday that UEFA has not previously discussed the transition to PSG Neymari.
They spoke with The Associated Press on the condition that they will ensure theironymity because they are not allowed to discuss the situation in the PSG.
The latest published reports show that the PSG has benefited from over EUR 10 million in the period 2015-2016 at around EUR 542.4 million.
Data from the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that Neymari's arrival will have a good impact on sponsorship, trade and tracking.
The club expects at least 30 per cent growth in the conclusion of the contract.
In Spain too, having clearly been affected by the departure of one of the largest football matches, Neymari tried to prevent the transition, claiming that PSG would break with this FFP.
"It is a clear "financial doping" case with the club and the state," La Liga said to the Spanish historian Javier Tebas AS, pointing out that PSG belongs mainly to Qatar.
Arsenali, manager of Arsene Wenger, who belongs to the U.S. sports club, shares La Liga’s concern that the country is funding the club.
"It is the consequence of property rights and it has completely changed the whole football game over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"If the club belongs to the state, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of the game because the country may have other ways or interests to represent such a large player's country."
In Norway, Norway’s oil company has a good tradition to place pictures of those who have gone beyond their limits and have been inspired by others, writes trip.ee

Today 50 years ago: Orcanian storm in Estonia, which swept out of the houses roofs and roofs.
The storm of the century, which occurred on 6 and 7 August, caused great damage to the West, Harjuma and Raplama, in particular.
In Estonia, during those days the wind was more than 30 m/s.
As my old man walked along one side of the tree, he tried to support them with his hands.
Everything was dark and cold, like the world.
Back then, the houses had already been destroyed, recalled the interview given in 2002 by elderly Sister Linda Kurova Haapsalus in Estonia.
Linda's husband saw how his seating time came to an end.
But what do you still support with trees where you can resist such a storm?
The sea came under the roof, from the roof, water came in," said Mrs. Linda Toona, Haapsalus Kalda, who lived in the village of Kalda.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and the fall of the railway perroon had flew 20 to 30 meters away, Linda saw most of the sharks only the next morning.
The local word for Paralepa was behind the trees in the ground, some completely long, some side.
Everyone seemed very tired, and the storm came through beautiful old trees of ragins and pragina like war.
In August 1967, West Viruma was not able to suffer more severely than West Estonia, but the damage was even greater, wrote the Viruma notifier in 2007.
The Haapsalu Losipark and Padise Park were dedicated to the land, but our and our parks were also severely damaged.
In Tallinn the wind was measured at speeds up to 35 metres per second, or about 130 kilometers per hour.
In Tallinn, Meriv district, on August 6th, one of the small placards cried out: "Mama, Mom!
Canads are airy and can't go down anymore," wrote the Viruma notifier.
During the storm, a building in the village of Viljandi was destroyed in such a way that it was decided to be repaired later.
The Augusttorm did not accept the constructions of the Turkish port of refuge which were no longer restored.
On 12 August 1967, journalist Red Tätt wrote that the cleaning of the towns and villages of the towns and villages is gradually advancing and that the inhabitants could be included in the repair work.
In Tormis, farmers were also severely subjected to agriculture, and the newspaper reported that "participative organisations must be both in the organization and in the agricultural sector as incentives and direction."
Orcanians may be reported if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The clean wind record in Estonia remains on 2 November 1969, when Ruhnul was measured at 48 m/s.
Only on the island of the island was measured, so the measured wind speed could not be accurately recorded there.
The secret of clean souplars: other repairs and empty coastal world
The third winters also mean lower use of Tallinn.
"If there is no, then there are people on the beach, and if there is no, there are no people," says the seafarer.
In the North-Tallinna Stream, there's a lot of cracks on the beach.
They offer melodic competition on the low slopes of the tractor that will blow down the beach tripe.
In fact, the last seven centimetres are deep through the vessel, removing the sand from the sea prairie and people’s waste of rice: bottlenecks, cigarettes and others.
People still come on the beach, whether the water is hot or not.
If there is a beautiful appearance, there are people on the beach, and if there is no, there are no people," says Mr. Aleksandr Usov, Head of the Maritime Corps Administration.
The clock is 6.30 and the beach is running hard because eight people have to have space.
The belief is already four hours ago on the job.
After Stream, he keeps his eye on Pirate, Harku Lake, Kakumäe and Paljasaare Picakari.
The thresholds have been reduced.
Years ago, it was a lot more.
People are now able to evaluate what is done for them," says Usov, who has cleaned the stadium for 15 years.
Before it was so that if something new had ever happened, it was already over the next day.
Now we're keeping what's on the beach.
Pure Coastal Price
One of the biggest works in Estonia's coastal borders is the threat of sea evaporation.
For example, on the beach of Pirita this seafarer must be transported 400 000 tons.
"It's an incredible amount," says Usov.
The second major category is the cross, or all that people leave behind.
The half-kilometre of Stream is eight large pivot container needed to be emptied three times a week.
That's how it looks.
However, the colder winters have meant that the spring is less than fifteen.
The third type of waste shall be disposed of.
Most of them are children.
By this time, Usov's fleet has been excavating 10 model cars.
They'll be able to wait for the next frame of line.
"They usually come out more, but that's normal." I think he already knows that soon he will find them out again.
The children come to the beach and take toys to impress them in again.
The brush is stretched wide
Erica Scholler, representative of Haaberst administration services, acknowledges that tractor traffic is disturbing locals.
The wall, which lasts for hours as early as the beginning of the night, disturbs people living in the vicinity and.
But it's impossible on the day.
Once a month, the border must be crossed twice.
"If we don't do this, the city will punish us," says Scholler.
But the goal is similar to that of Pirate, Pikkari and Pärnu to get the current border under the quality of the international blue flag.
"There is much more work to do in Estonia than with Europe," says Scholler.
We've got more courage and strength, and we've got harder to fight.
But there are fewer dust in our neighborhoods than there are in Europe.
On hearing that it is said that in the beach, Martin, who lives near the shore of the Stream, will become an unsatisfied journalist and repair worker’s interview, exposing the current coastal sites.
Tomorrow, there's a painting on every side of the street.
The problem is with birds and dolls who have been bitten by pukits," says Martin.
Although it is difficult to imagine that people are able to change their old behavior patterns, Martin hopes that the city government will take something to do with garbage dumps and, for example, give them a chance to stop at least flying back there.
In general, however, Martin is at peace with the development of the Stream.
It's seen the city takes care of it.
It has become more pleasant with children's away from home, light and freshly asphalted roads.
It's never been so much that the wheelchairs were able to travel just one way," says Martin.
Artichokes found in Stroos: coins, only coins
A 40-year-old Dimitri has been used since the early mid-morning period, which is used as a metal detector.
He doesn't think there's anything precious in the future today.
The seas are not good enough for this.
"I've been doing this for years and haven't found anything valuable yet," Dmitri reports.
The horse-redukutin is a few euro coins, bottles, and even dangerous toys that later throw away in dust.
Usually, there's still coins.
"The gold, spices and other ingredients are not usually present," they say.
Bank of England maintains interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to be informed that interest rates remain at an even level, as strong economic growth and inflation is slowing down speculations about growth.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth remains a legacy, as incomes from third countries have put an interest in waiting.
The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policy makers voted in favour of keeping the 6.2.25% of the figures, and at least the members require an increase this month because the slow growth has weakened the strong growth.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank narrowed the growth forecast for 2017 by 1.7% and by 1.6% by 2018 and warned that the impact of stress on the incomes of the fatty areas is still expected to rise to nearly 3%.
At the same time, the Bank noted that the increase in the amounts is necessary for the management of the inflation from Brexit over the next few years and that the financial markets may need a higher rise due to the expected cost of loans.
Members also voted for a year after Brexit was released by the partial withdrawal of the marketed VAT package.
In February, the Bank concluded an interim financing scheme, which provides funding for banks, although it said that there is now a 15 billion-dollar bid, which has 115 billion-dollar loans.
In the Protocols to the Decision on the Qualifications, the Bank says: "The medium-term forecast of the MPC remains in force in the near future, as the difficult situation of real income in rural areas also continues to affect consumption."
On the basis of the figures, it was agreed that the reduction of inflation would require a "skilling of some financial policy" and a "major increase" in terms of market expectations.
Bors is currently predicting the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and the second rise in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any holes are ascetic and restricted.
The growth projections of the Bank for this year and next year are compared to 1.9% and 1.7% of the May forecast.
The estimate of 1.8% growth in 2018 remained unchanged.
After that, the price for the dollar and the euro was low.
Nearly 0.5% of US dollars and 0.4% of EUR 1.11.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent distortions in growth indicators, which have reduced the growth prospects for growth in GDP by 0.2% in the second quarter over the previous three months, over 0.3%.
The Bank says that growth is likely to remain in the third quarter at 0.3%, although this is going to be somewhat high at the end of the year.
The latest report on inflation gave rise to inflation and the rising wage of the poor in favour of the vulnerable, saying that the situation would be worse before the improvement would be even worse.
It was added that the monetary policy could not prevent revenue from falling within the next few years, but the three-year forecast was expected to be a significant recovery of wages.
Due to the low noise, the growing demand for British production also forces the economy, which partly compensates for the lower consumption of consumers.
The decision shall take effect one year after the reference to the EU’s sugary reference to be made in August, after 0.25%, which resulted in a sudden decline in noise.
It is likely that it will take four years to fully address prices and the economy.
Prior to the last decision of the bank, it was felt a growing demand for increase in the rate, as inflation had increased the stress in the densely populated areas; in July three policymakers demanded an increase in the rate of 0.5%.
Inflation fell by 2.6% last month, compared to June 2.9%, although the bank's statement was expected and in the next six months it was expected to rise again.
The bank said that too much growth was due to a completely weak noise compared to a 2-percent target.
Andreco, leader of mortgage shareholders Andrew Montlake, said: "In view of the recent decline in exchange rates, it seems that the mortgage market is becoming ever more competitive, as lenders lose jobs and hope to end the year positively.
The bar is particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are going to end because refinancing, often service and low rates have become more popular."
NHS has been reported in 10,000 people with HIV resistance
Since September, patients have access to the "transformative" HIV prevention treatment following a summary of the fight against whether NHS should be funded.
NHS England reported that national healthcare now provides an estimated 10,000 people with an initial three-year clinical trial (PREP) profile (PREP) - a tablet that is administered prior to an interval and has shown a high-risk reduction in the risk of infection compared to around 86%.
The NHS agreed to finance a clinical trial after the appeal court upheld the Supreme Court's decision of the previous year to pay for the NHS for PrEP, despite its claim that local governments should finance the medicinal product.
NHS Director of England, Simon Stevens welcomed this public action on Thursday as "new broad intervention", while the National Aid Fund (NAT) described it as "a turning point".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to start registering people. In October, more clinics will be available before the programme is launched in England in April 2018.
Pre-disease prophylaxis (PREP) is a treatment regimen for HIV that is taken prior to intermediate use to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in people with infectious diseases.
Taking PREP prior to the interval means that there are enough medicines in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines may be taken every day or at least two hours before and after an interval.
Homosexual men, transsolated people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and are not treated are among the eligible candidates.
Clinics identify suitable people who are willing to participate in clinical trial, including men, women, transsole people and those who are not receiving antiretroviral therapy for HIV-related partners.
People who live in England and have chosen to live there as a family may also register their participation in a local sexual health clinic in the programme.
The programme pays 10 million oil and NHS England signed an agreement to obtain medicines this week after the international procurement procedure.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the actual potential of PrEP in the collection of clinical evidence for which the medicinal product is intended and how it is used and implemented in a large picture.
Stevens said: "This new large-scale intervention should complement and enhance the broad and ever successful fight against the spread of HIV.
This is the next post of opposition over more than three decades in the struggle with mankind's greatest health problem."
Deborah Gold, NATO director, said: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PREP, if it is properly aimed at those who need it and belong to a risk group, offers an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people with HIV risk in England have access to a new tool that is individually managed and independent of negotiations with a partner, thereby improving many lives.
We welcome this information in warm air."
Terrence Higgins, director of the Higgins Fund, said: "It is now essential to ensure that a clinical trial across the country is quickly avoided and that no HIV risk group member will remain isolated.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial has begun, we are on our way to protect more than 10,000 people who are at risk of contracting HIV.
Minister of Public Health Sharon Hodgson said: "The beginning of the PrEP's clinical trial has been very welcome and very late after six months of slowing down and closing government legs.
Evidence shows how significant changes this medicine may lead to HIV prevention and life-threatening toxicity to the end of the spread of HIV.
This clinical trial will lead us to a closer understanding of the advantages of PrEP.
Now it is important that a clinical trial take over the country as soon as possible in order to protect people who are HIV-infected and to bring us closer to the spread of HIV in society."
The electricity price increased by 12% in Estonia, but Latvia and Lithuania declined.
In July, the difference between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania's price regions decreased by EUR 1,94, compared with EUR 7,71 in June, Elering reported.
The main reason for the price differentiation is the injury suffered by the Leedu-Ruois Community.
In Estonia, the average electricity price was EUR 34,33 per hour in the previous month, and prices fell by 12 per cent compared to June.
Latvia and Lithuania reduced the price of five per cent from the hour-to-hour of EUR 36,27.
In Finland the price was EUR 34,17 and the system price of the Nord Pool was EUR 26,37 per megawatt-hour.
Prices rose by 12% and 7%.
Between Estonia and Finland, the electricity moved 75 per cent from the previous month to Estonia and 16 per cent from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining one per cent of transactions between two countries did not take place the following day.
Between Estonia and Latvia, electricity moved 99 per cent from Estonia to Latvia, and 73 per cent of the hours spent in the full transfer capacity.
According to transactions made on the last trading day of July, Nasdaq OMX on the market in August may constitute an electricity exchange rate of approximately EUR 34 and EUR 37 per hour on September.
The price of carbon dioxide for electricity production fell last month and transactions amounted to EUR 5,04-5,47 per tonne.
Living high - semi-regular and nucated designers have transformed this small Earls Court card into a room home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a church treasurer, changed his large Knightsbridge home in 2014 to the Earls Court court.
It lives on Queen Anne Terrace's first round, and the fact that Joanne has not packed her house together and continued to rent the card is an honor to the new design.
"Before I lived it with a former resident in Knightsbridge on a much larger surface," said Joanne.
"I was looking for something that would be equal to my offer price.
I was shown this by Earls Court, and there were similar high levels.
I fell in love with it and made the same day offer."
Since the first visit, it has been a total of 93 square metres.
At first it was a one-bedroom and a complicated move to reach a flat - bed table. Joanne wanted to add a leather room and a half order to use high beds.
"I wanted high beds, big windows, lots of light.
These were my demands," he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi Notting Hills from the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to use 3.8 m high floors and create a house that would not be just a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The law was not high enough to add two spaces to each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create a semi-regular order to stand.
Erfan was supposed to be getting closer to the matter of nature.
"The metal construction is quite complex," he explains.
"We're trying to reorganize the rooms, so they're going to be placed on each other, without being disturbed.
It wasn't just building a platform, but we used the ground construction so that the height of the upper and lower space would be right."
This regulation enabled Erfan to create a room on each other with two full-scale rooms with a lot of dramatic elements.
In half of the course, a glass of light from the old retrouvius window will be opened to the glamorous living room below.
The gold furniture, silver details and retro-reflective Serge Mouille's light-pressure room style.
The use of arrows plays a role in adding the theatre, space and lightness.
On both sides of the short corridor, the mirrors have been added to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, you will remember the second room with a mirror.
At the entrance, the mirror offers a place to all Joanne's restaurants and glass requirements.
If not used, a debt will be added to the debt to close the kitchen if it is not used, causing the imagination to move from the floor.
There's nothing new about the pools that gather.
In this kitchen, however, there is a unique fact that doing is with the opening door of the garage type.
"There went a little projective," explains Erfan's dream, inspired by patriotism.
"There's an objection, so it's going very easily when it's up."
Thanks to the use of the room and the kitchen, Joanne now has 16 extra meters, an additional bedroom and a better cardboard.
"At the end of the day, there is a treasure of what you sell - or what gives value to the treasure," says Erfan.
"The cooker will start up in the shape of a room and make calculations by pushing the floor to the surface."
Here they have been able to raise the floor by using quality materials that add flexibility to space.
"Materials are what you're dealing with and which will help you build emotional ties with your home," Erfan says.
"You don't love the power supply on the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make our hearts wake up."
This shows that a good design and an increased area will help to make some of the normal cortex something amazing.
In fact, they may cause a desire not to leave, as happened with Joanne.
Dane Jensen is a coal miner in Chicago, who fights with his colleague after an official attack.
It shall not be counted other than the amount of the money earned, which shall be forgotten by any ethics.
A man sees his wife and three children only in the morning and in the evening.
In the first half of the film, I kill myself with the idea that it's a version of the "Caradmajja" business world - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's speaker is the same.
As the film goes on, it will become less a cross-border element, and the morale of filmmakers is becoming increasingly apparent.
For life-threatening experience, a major son’s illness can be reduced.
Now there must be a choice between work and family.
The son of an architectic son who sleeps at the walkway of Chicago makes great buildings think of really important things, such as faith, goodness, love... without even having to worry about the calamity of two towers.
After the third stage where the son opens his father's eyes, he feels that filmmakers have gone from the public to be sure to be caught, because even the worst thing to do with the heart of the viewer is not able to keep the pears back in the sight of the beloved little boy’s suffering.
When a son falls into a coma and his situation seems hopeless, the father will finally understand his work on morality and do good work for an older man.
Now, in my own mind, I'm sorry - if the film is happy, then I'm premiering my transparency after the film's coffee, but if I'm hungry, at least one surprise can be appreciated by the scenarioist.
For a moment, there's a doubt that there's no coffee left - when your husband calls Dane from the hospital, and he's gonna blow his ass off the corridor back.
However, the son has been miraculously healed, and even though his father has just lost his job, it is also positive, as it is now time to deal with the family.
I can also get a good sense of myself - I can predict the end of America's drama!
The real au gift is well-constructed, all the elements needed for this are available.
You can laugh, laugh, showcases are good and moral beauty: money is not the most important thing in life.
This movie's coming in really good.
The Trumpi new staff member plans to limit the media consumption of the president.
The others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can handle it.
In that case, he'd be the first one.
Politico writes that the new staff member of the White House plans to limit President Trumpin's power of information, including news, in the hope that it will keep the surplus in balance.
Here's reporter Josh Dawseylt:
"When John F. Kelly met with senior officials on his first day of work, he brought out the issue of the removal of President Donald Trumpi White House, which he was planning to resolve to get bad information in the hands of the President.
Kelly told the officials that the information should be passed on to him, whether on paper or at meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he shared good news with him."
Kelly's diagnosis seems completely logical, but others have tried it and have failed to track Trump's media consumption.
President Trumpy's relationship with television is expanding for decades, and even now that he's in the White House, he's never lost his television attentions anywhere.
"If the candidate Trump was innocent after a poor media interview, it was appropriate to show him that he was treated in an honest and honest way in the trial," said former campaigner Sam Nunberg to the Policy in February.
Politico Tara Palmer wrote at the time that "the six former campaign worker said to have to take control of the Trompi Twitter attacks when ensuring that his personal media consumption also contains a stable and grateful song".
All right.
But the idea that Trump's use of Twitter has ever been "controlled" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don't know that the Tromps would have been more insulated without their intervention.
We can't seem to know about the secrets that Trump did not post.
If he was able to save himself from evil, or several times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trumpy from making permanent no-one.
Part of the problem lies in the fact that people in the White House, made up of competing clicks, try to promote their own interests by sending Trumpil material that supports their world views, but it is not always possible to be trustworthy.
In May, in the context of the whole process, Politico wrote a recommendation to the President to provide strategically-questioned information on the value.
One example described by reporter Shane Goldmaker is the following:
"The advantages and advantages of the Trump drop say that Trump may react to negative pressure, especially with harmful effects on the informants, in a explosive manner, by taking their original disclosure as evidence.
This was also the case at the end of February, when someone handed a copy of the Internet procurator Charles C. Johnson's website to GotNews.com, which accused personalizer Katie Walshi of being a White House's "source of information".
There is no difference that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of his denial or that he has not provided any specific statements or that he has also made false accusations in the past and has taken them back.
Trump read the articles and began to come up with Walshi."
Goldmacher added that the current staff member of Reince Priebus and White House's director Rob Porter "was trying to establish a system for managing and documenting the documents available to Trump".
How did that happen?
Kelly's trying to do exactly the same three months later.
Perhaps he will become a more effective leader of Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his aids are still struggling on behalf of the impact.
These unchanged factors make Kelly a very difficult mission.
The musicians who come from the north of the country are not allowed to be present to the rock.
In the middle of Tallinn, many abroad go to music.
Those with whom we met in the morning testified that they were playing in the old town without the permission of the city government.
For the first time, we found at least three songs of music from the Viru warehouses, which had taken the same lot of dogs with us.
It was clear that the musicians, with their bravado and silver garments, were enthusiasts, who would spend a few hours at the market.
Despite the inconvenience, the only woman in the community played with a rhyme story, while one man at her side was invited by three joggles and the passengers near her.
The third man was sitting beside them on one side of the porch, and he burned a glass of reddish - red wine in his heart.
Their three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the passage of the nation.
Bob, who played the orchestra with Noemi and the ball, said that today’s players are musicals both for fun and for money.
The purpose of the event was to gather the Pilate ship on the same night on the same day that day in Finland.
On the question of whether they were allowed out of town for music at an old age, Noemi and Bob broke their heads.
First of all, we didn't know.
Second, we will never stay in one city for more than a day or a few days, and usually allowed for a month or so.
It doesn't make sense to pay for it," explained Bob.
When we hit Viru again about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women are at the musicians and they're going to leave.
The team was happy to try to reach the Viru center of the railways and dogs.
Today, three and a half young people, one of whom was playing violins, the other clarinets, and the third was playing with an electronic keyboard.
"We are here to offer people pleasure to distribute music and joy and to serve money for fuel and living," explained the trio piano Mivosh.
In Mivoshi, they are aware of the need for permission from the municipal government to appear.
"Of course we don't have it," he said laughing.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there's no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we'll go to another place, but we have to try," he added.
Estonia Bank purchased EUR 149 million for debt instruments under the euro area public sector funding programme, and the central bank debt portfolio increased by EUR 4.36 billion.
The Central Bank shall not publish more detailed information on purchases.
The President of the Estonian Bank, Hardo Hansson, has previously explained in response to the Member State's dispute, that the Eurosystem central banks' contribution includes three different purchasing programmes: covered bonds (covered bonds), secured debt (ABS) and public sector debt (PSPP).
The Central Bank shall buy from the market together a debt document to encourage investors involved in the debt document to invest money in another.
The impact of purchases reduces the production of low-risk assets and it motivates investors to take greater risks.
In general, each central bank purchases its government debt documents under the public sector’s debt register programme and does not purchase other countries’ debt documents.
Since the Estonian State has not issued a debt document, the Eesti Pank will make it within the quota allocated to them.
The central banks shall also make deposits in countries where the supply of debt instruments corresponding to the purchase is limited.
Estonia Bank shall, in general, purchase a debt document from the European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank.
Estonia Bank will purchase debt documents under the reserve programme from March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering was also called, but in June 2016, Eesti Bank was no longer buying Elering.
The euro area’s central banks will be purchased by the Finnish Central Bank from June both Elering and Estonia.
The sequences separate the curve and repeat the "Millions Range"
Some of the most powerful inhabitants of the West Midlands have been caught back in a violent confrontation with determined runners, who have separated the fortress from the fortress to win back the remaining ones of their villages.
The events have set up a 20-year-old park in the "Millions Range" near the village of Solihul.
They have returned with the army of horses, children and vehicles after they were thrown out of there by the sea, without letting themselves be confused by the trappings they stole to prevent their entry.
The tactical group found a weak spot in the protective borders by pinging their vehicles through the remaining parts that had been left to the leg.
The poor people have broken the Solihull Authority, saying that the Authority is "useable in dealing with the problem".
One anonymous resident said: "They were there the first night after their exodus from Bentley Heath, where they ended up with rocks.
They must be ashamed to act because they are used to deal with the problem.
The events were there, they were going to leave, and now they're back.
They came last night, probably even more today."
He added: "The Burmingham Parliament knows how to deal with such things by purchasing long barriers to the protection of its parks.
I live on the Streetsbrook road and I'm not happy that I have to continue to pay the tax if the office can't even prevent such things."
One local resident who also wanted to stay anonymous said, "It's ridiculous.
This time, the number has grown and the noise has even been seen in the bird's memory."
The representative of the Solihull Assembly said: "We are aware that the streetbroke road is an unauthorized area in the vicinity of the country, and we cooperate with the Solihull police. We are implementing the necessary legal measures to enable them to move as quickly as possible.
The collection of evidence is very helpful if as many local residents as possible are aware of any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police, calling on number 101.
This will help create a picture for the trial if we present the case to them."
The Weekend Festival also visits all others, Minister of Culture Indrek Saar, who is pleased to have been able to bring true world top names in Estonia.
To the question why it is so important for the Estonians at the Weekend Festival, Saar answers that this should be asked of all those who enjoy the festival for three days.
Küll, however, is convinced that Pärnus has come to Pärnus with real actors in his area.
"In view of the level of artists who have been able to bring Estonia home the absolute names of this musician - this is often not happening in our country," said the Culture Minister.
What are the artists at the festival, but what is the most famous of them?
I think I'm relatively old-fashioned and I'm probably one of the most experienced artist Armin van Buuren who was standing up last night.
According to his platform movement, all of us have ever been turned on our own feet," he says.
But he still brings out a number of names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our Estonian agents are also ours: starting from NOÄP and they can read the whole line.
In fact, the concentration of known names is very high," he says.
Look at the higher of the night video!
The audit updates car manufacturers at the centre of the crisis up to 850 000 diesel vehicles
The day before the audit report, BMW said it would offer more than 350 000 software to vehicles.
According to BMW, the company believes that "there are more extensive options than vehicle restrictions", referring to European cities, including the BMW in Munich, which has been considered for the prohibition or restriction of diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that it will update three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel engines.
No company described these activities as refusal.
European car manufacturers have been advertising the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to help comply with the rules on CO2 emissions.
However, the gastric oxide separated from the diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and may cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of equipment installed for the neutralising of diesel emissions is increased for car industry, making it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitively.
At the same time as Germany's car manufacturers are under thorough investigation, the Government of the Union of the United States of America is also accused of sending powerful car manufacturers and of withdrawing comments on the problem.
Enterprises are trying to avoid the recurrence of Volkswagen's errors, which, in spite of the use of fraud devices, were able to adapt the emissions model to the regulations at the time of the vehicle testing, but were slowed back in normal driving conditions.
Several of the leaders of Volkswagen have been accused in the United States and others have been investigated by both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
Last month, former head of the unit of the Department of Audi motor development in Germany was arrested.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and therefore is not protected from being issued and may be brought to trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi Germany committed a criminal review of Volkswagen, where the authorities charged the installation of the Audit System with a view to eliminating the requirements of the European emission levels by extending the approach that had previously focused on the United States.
The involvement of the audience in the study may be a large hope for Volkswagen, which generates a disproportionate share of the use of Volkswagen.
Estonian schools are named 20 000 euros for the European Union flag.
The Ministry of Education intends to buy Estonian schools on 1 September to mark the presidency of the European Union.
A total of 105x158 centimetres shall be obtained from the 570 educational institutions of the European Union Treaty.
The lamps are intended to be exposed in the internal spaces, which must be made in a high-quality printing technique in the internal spaces with an hour’s approval, shall be replaced by the ERR’s new port.
The Lipuvarda page reads: "A commitment to Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union in Estonia.
The estimated cost of 570 litres shall be EUR 20 000 at the price of the Ministry of Education, or one flag shall be EUR 35.
The murder of a journalist highlights a growing danger in Mexico
The workmen of the week are usually gathered on three days to look at plans to review the latest cases of organised crime, corrupt officials and drug gangs in Sinaloa.
But today they have gathered to discuss their own safety in a personal tragedy.
They're told that it's important to change their routine.
Two parents are discussing what seems to be a danger: to bring the children to the office with them, which was the target of the Grammar in 2009, or to leave them home.
The security experts have written three words to the longing in front of the room: "enemies", "neutrals", "unionists".
They ask the reporters to provide the names of each batch without any proof, enough memory and inner sense.
In the interest of government or cartels, the full list of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists is suspected of being a threat to the recovery of the government of Mexico.
Since the resignation of President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012, at least 25,589 journalists have been subjected to attacks and threats under national protection and have been killed in at least seven countries during this year.
Among the most recent cases are the author and inspirational source, Javier Valdez Cardenas, associated with Riodace.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his many books on drug abuse.
His absence gives deep sense, although his location may be perceived at all the Riodoce building fassad, a large picture of the centre of Valdez with the letter "Rightness" and two 30-day reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, support the T-shirt, which has been painted with his smiling face or a unique pancake bar.
The meeting will take place less than two months after his death. Reporters discuss common trauma, feelings of nervousness, sleepiness, paranoia.
Although a separate national court was established in 2010 to deal with the case of journalists, only two cases were brought before the Court of Justice of the Protection Committee.
As in the case of killings related to the annual trade and organised crime, the number of thousands increases, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to trial.
The operation of Riodoce continues to reflect the violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is still more dangerous.
Without the killer's data and justice, Ibarra's meeting on security is of no great benefit.
"Very bad it's time to get pregnant here at the meeting," he says.
"Until the reason is unknown, you're all alone."
Valdez left the country at the head of the Riodace office in Culiacan on May 15th.
He managed to drive just a few quarters before two men stopped his red Toyota Corrolla and forced him out of the car and shot him 12 times.
The armed man drove Valdez into the car and did it close to April.
Valdez was 50 years old.
His wife and two grown children left him.
The members of the Culiacan are freely available.
But Valdez's theme is mainly only visible.
Since the arrest of Guzmani last year and the release of the United States to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the most bloodiest outlaws of the war, as rivals are fighting after the power struggle.
There is no difference that Sinaloa’s people are left each day with a few people or a couple of people or a couple of people, or that the dead are separated from the so-called two - time monasteries of the drug churches, which are larger than many of the homes in which they live.
Let us remember for a moment that peace refers to when a valuable port and a seaport country with the remaining fishing routes in the United States leads only one map.
Despite all of this and the fact that Valdez was clearly aware of the risks involved in his work, Riodace’s co-chair and president Ismail Bojorquez (60) felt guilty that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that killing was promoted by two errors.
The first of these was the release of an interview with the children of Guzmani and the battle-fighting cartel named Damaso Lopezi in February.
This book could even hate suspicious members who bought all copies of the issue as soon as they arrived in the journals.
The other was that Valdez was not forced to leave his country for his own safety after an incident in one of the same history events.
Valdez was a legend in both Mexico and abroad, and his execution is seen as a turning point against journalists in Mexico.
He had lived so long that his friends and colleagues thought he was always there.
In 2003, he worked as a veterinary reporter at Noroes, when he joined five colleagues to create Riodace, selling 50-dollar shares.
Bojorquez said that Sinaloas "was impossible to deal with without a drug problem".
The newspaper had long been filled with feelings of guilt and sincerity and increased sales and advertising.
The reporters were pleased to publish their powerful research without fear of censorship and readers in the press, from which they were able to read stories that no one else had to review.
Eight years after Riodace was set up, the newspaper won its prestigious prize for Latin America's reflections as the prize of Maria Moors Caboti.
In the same year, Valdez, the Journalists won the award of international press freedom as the International Committee of the Protection of Journalists (AKK) for their freedom to follow anyone where it leads.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to go on living," he said when he adopted the AKK assessment.
Earlier in October, he told a telephony TV interview that the retail trade is in Sinaloa.
"You have to take a job that comes with the newspaper office's second chance is to play crazy.
I don't want you to ask me what I did in front of so many dead people or why I didn't tell you what's going on."
Riodoce collects Valdez, a musician who played like a bull, a friend who distributed emboss and tips, teachers who knew how to live.
They supported his routine.
He always sent his wallet.
He left the office on the road to the El Guayabo bar and always sat on the same floor.
Now they're asking if his routine has made him vulnerable.
His death has also caused them to doubt how to do their best and stay alive.
"They don't like you leaving their women, their children, their legal businesses, their secret landfills used to transport drugs."
"These things didn't work out," said Bojorquez.
As a result, even in the best of times, there is a strong self-assessment and self-sustainment.
Trust your instincts.
If it's getting suspicious, keep away.
Riodoce, director of the Andres Villarreal, says the problem is that "the bomber can be deceived... and that's what happened with Javier."
He and others say that in Sinaloa there are no more old rules, just as they are not in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerreros or other countries that are the result of the conspiracy of fraud, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the area where Riodace's staff were assembled for safety training, mobile phones were no longer allowed; some days before this, it was revealed that only the funds sold to governments were used to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
Two police officers in front of the house were looking for relief from 40-kron heat.
The government has appointed them to oversee the Riodace office, which is located in the fourth district of Culiacan in the neighborhood.
Some reporters wondered whether these police officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers who were self-contained by the Cubans themselves.
A number of months have passed since the reporters have moved to major places where control is in the hands of de facto drug addicts.
Riodoce discussed three basics this week's issue this week.
One of them was the murder of former boxer Julius Caesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a clear history of the government's spending money on the copper mine.
And one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants in the district of the prosecutor's office robbed a group of people.
Having received any official information about who was stolen or how this happened, it was therefore prudent to take note of the time when it was time to write what everyone in the city knew about the restaurant was a place of remembrance of both the drug dealers and the authorities.
The rapporteur was informed from public documents that the restaurant was registered on behalf of a policy that belongs to the existing Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all political alliances almost throughout the previous century.
In recent times, a number of IRP cybercrime has been accused of corruption in the context of a wide range of cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write the previous incidents in the same place, including how the son of Guzmani, who was carrying El Chapo, came from military records.
A few months earlier, readers would have looked for Valdez column to get information about the human race from the best sources.
"We'd already know what happened before," said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose bodybuilding has served him as El Flaco.
"Now all the channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez's office has been arrested by the police and the officers who protest against the killing of journalists, and the employees have received something they have never been able to wait for activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez called a couple of times, and the next morning he called the local prosecutor's office to express his opinion after the next journalist.
Salvador Adame died in the western part of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
It has been found in the dead body, and the official says it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests.
Journalists have become more and more voices throughout the country and criticise organized protests on the customs and buildings of the phrase "SOS press".
On that day, President Bojorquez is absent in Washington, trying to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.
On the day after the death of Valdez, in the trial with the Sinaloa governor, Ramirez accused the officials of kidnapping the journalists and killing them of the truth.
After that, he asked that he be moved by the government’s activities to others, worried that his anger had affected his objectiveness.
Valdez has repeatedly said that Mexican journalists have organized crime, co-accused government officials and any society "restricted".
He wrote in his last book "The Narcissives" that not only kill drug dealers, but also do so under the authority of politicians and security forces organized in the field of crime.
The Media Channel Supervisory Group, Article 19, held more than half of the press attacks on police and public officials last year.
"Mexican you're dead because you want to be blind," said Ramirez.
The blues are clearly affected by vertigo.
No one remembers the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macia's death in the northern border region of Tamaulipas six years ago.
He was found dead with a letter that was probably written under the maple of Los Zetas: "I'm here for my reporters."
In addition to his damaged head, the computer keyboard and the keyboards were released.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, for example, by historian El Norte in the northern border region of Chihuahuas after their correspondence with Miroslava Breachi in March.
Others continue as did the historian El Manaa de Nuevo Laredo after their leader's murder in 2004.
In 2010, journalist Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly mentioned drugs maps with the guide "What do you want from us?".
Some journalists have paid off from their homes or even from their country.
It's a tough decision.
It's hard to find jobs and they still have to keep up with the dangers.
And sometimes they are followed, as happened apparently by the photograph of Ruben Espinosa, who was killed with four women in 2015 in a Mexican resort three months after Veracruz's page.
Those who remain in position and continue to work have to take a day-to-day shift in risk decisions.
Ibarra, who ever wanted to be a minister, admits that he is afraid of being a drug addict.
"Mexican is on the way to hell and that's why I'd report it," he said.
In the middle of a recent train, when the latest number was already broken, the Riodoce operators sat in front of the office on the walkway and cut off the oil as soon as they started to vibrate all the phones.
There were 19 confirmed figures in the future exchanges between rival forces and security forces in the Mazatland district.
The war continued on and on, just as many of the folders found in the region were allowed to leave.
On the other hand, use the new mobile phone on the website of Riodoce.
The next day, there was a need to change.
The siriens were moving through the next round of future exchanges in the region.
Bojorquez was hiding from police officers who were watching to see if they were guards.
If they were scared, they didn't show it at least.
The historian, under the massive portrait of the founder, where his central character is to see the whole Sinaloa, worked with Riodace's staff following him.
"How can you think of closure at all," said Bojorquez, "when the same day Javier was killed, asked the trainer to get him to report to today?"
Dinosaurus used a protective colour to avoid enemies
At first, it looks like a picture, even though it's pretty scary.
Researchers have now published the first findings with regard to the undisputed presence of Canadian cavern, which has been so well preserved that stakeholders have described it as "Mona Addis Ababa".
This was so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that the skin covered with her hair was reddish and her past was somewhat "skinned".
The newspaper Current Biology, published in the report, described the existence as "a better preserved substance of the substance, which has never been found" and as "one of the best dinosaurs in the world".
In the case of fossils, it is made up of a new type of nodoxiety that lives in the middle of the crisis, 110-112 million years ago.
It's incredibly good to keep the raw materials that describe it as "very significant".
This plant-based plant has been best preserved in the National Geographic data on this type of fossil that has ever been found.
It was found on 21 March 2011 Shawn Funk when he complained about Suncor Millenium in the search for Fort McMurray near North Alberts Canada.
He found something that didn't remember the surrounding stone, and decided to look closer.
The open fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
The following six years were worked on the creation of 2500-year-olds (1100-km) of land.
After all this mess, the outcome is finally ready for public production.
"If a little eye drops, you can almost believe that he sleeps," said author Caleb Brown, a director at the Royal Tyrrelli Museum, where the presence is exposed.
"It's going to be one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - dinosaur Mona Lisana."
In his skin studies, he found evidence that this planter, who is also covered with spices and remembers a moving tank, was likely to be significantly endangered by meat-based dinosaurs.
With strong roots, the dinosaur used red and white protective colors to protect itself against insects, and developed a protective technique called resistance and used equally by many animals today.
This enabled experts to say that dinosaurs were better fed into the environment and to avoid enemies, since larger dinosaurs probably held him in pursuit.
It was a 110 million - year - old nudity family that first reached the new May and is now visited at the Royal Tyrrelli Palontology Museum.
The facts have now been examined and referred to it by Mark Mitchell, a laboratory based on Mark Mitchell from Boreaopel, who belonged to a team that spent more than 7,000 hours trying to expose the animal to danger.
Thanks to its amazingly good preservation, Dr. Mitchell and the international research team were able to document the shape and size of the animals in the body.
They discovered a method of protection that was developed in the country of origin, which means that the removal of the presence of the party was worse than a surrender.
Although the alert has been opened, it will come as a surprise, since Borealopel has a mark greater than that of animals living with the alert today.
This angers the fact that the dinosaurs were actively chasing other meat-based dinosaurs to make evolution preferable for life-saving techniques instead of preparation.
But most of the animals that use today’s resistance - such as snakes, snakes, or rabbits - are getting a lot smaller and more vulnerable, which suggests that the nodusus had to be really difficult to survive.
"Surely the powerful pursuit of dinosaurs hidden with great and strong tendencies shows how dangerous the cricket could be more prone to dinosaurs," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds of the species showed uniformly that the skin of the dinosaur was red.
The researchers continue to study creation to find guidelines on this life, including the content of its shell, to explain what the creature was in his last breath.
They believe that the dinosaur died of a fever, reaching the sea with a flood, where he was clearly in front of the ocean floor.
At that time Albert had the same soybean as now in South Florida and the seas and oceans were probably far from the interior than at present.
"This nodosaurus is truly significant, since it has been completely covered with Finnish skin, yet it has also remained a three-dimensional form, preserving the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"As a result, the animal appears almost the same today as the cricket.
In order to rebuild this, it doesn't have to use a lot of imagination - just kicking eyes and it seems to be just sleeping."
The crisis was the time when the Earth took on two frozen legs of meat-based dinosaurs - theropods.
Although all these kings of Tyrenosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealopel, some of his terrible ancestors might have been tempted to pursue it.
These include Acrocanthosaur, 38 feet (11.5 m) long and six tonne-weighted collet.
Researchers whose recent findings have been published in Current Biology believe that Borealopel was threatened after death by the sea and that it was altered in mummification.
The event opened on 21 March 2011 Shawn Funk when he complained about the Millennium in the search for Fort McMurray near North Alberts Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best that has maintained a taste in the world, including skin and tastes, and it is a comprehensive combination to the tree.
These properties were averaged 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
Out of this debt, two 20 tons of gold went out.
Researchers believe that it was a plant-based plant that was caught with prey through the current West Canada, until it was overawed by the threat of this open sea.
However, the marine dimension of the dinosaur has helped to preserve its tastes in detail.
The remains of this particular property have been so well preserved that the heads of the long dinosing of the Hungarian molluscs continue to suffer from skin cramps.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic magazine: "Selline's survival is as complex as the threshold.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
Stirred hairstyles continue to be designed to create toys located on the back of the shirt.
The best front is open on his side, and the way he's headed is above.
I can read his dreams."
How did one of the activists find the answer to the question, "Who are they today?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell received a full shock.
The last day after New York's trip, he sat by St. Louisian Airbnb on the street, passing on Facebook.
He was on his way to his high school post.
There was a book saying, "Police killed a 18-year-old boy, and he's still alive today."
He was confused about why no one else had posted this information on his campaign, so he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
The user's postage with the Pidem with @TheePharoh has been repeatedly distributed on his journal.
From the district of St. Louis, a rapper sent a real sword to Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who killed a white policeman in Ferguson.
He posted a photo of Brown's life from the body that was released tonight, staying there for four hours.
"It's crazy," thought Ferrell himself.
But death was nothing new to him or his community.
He put his phone away, but later that night he saw a resurgence that announced this time of people's gathering at Canfield Drive.
He took photos of police officers and torturers and of the man who claimed to be Brown's father and still kept the book "The Ferguson Police killed my unarmed son!".
He was looking at the real village where the police were standing in front of a group of protestors.
In the second video, another cop won his word and screamed, "I'll kill you all... animals."
Ferrrell remembers how he got himself thinking, "It's impossible."
"It's not the kind of murder we've been practicing and what we could call typical."
I felt some horrors right now.
I was angry, and I woke up."
He saved the flight and drove home the next day.
When he was 23 years old, he went to his six - year - old daughter and decided to drive two of them to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrelli and Ferguson for the next three years is the central theme in the new documentary "Whose Streets?" ("Who do you think they are?"), which will appear in the film on August 11.
It is a story of the survival and the protest, love and loss, the strength and commitment of the people who live in this community and who meet the requirements today.
When Ferrell and his daughter, who had a small dress and a suitable crown head on the side of Ferguson, again discussed the subject that had come to them this morning several times before - the experiences and living conditions of the blacks.
"Do you remember when I taught you how black society had to fight for their rights?" she recalls herself asking.
"We're driving now, Ferguson, because the police killed 18-year-old boy and that's not true."
"I couldn't take him with me," said Ferrell later.
"What's going on right now is... in the past of the completion of the event.
He needs to know it and see it and grow in its center.
He must learn about activism and organization, and he must also know the different characteristics of the Black Sea experiences and living conditions and what we must do in order to be free and free from them.
Even if I succeed in raising him so that he does not personally experience racism, he does not differ from some other black girl.
I feel like I'd make him a coward if I'd protect him from this world."
The first stop they made when they arrived in Ferguson was the South Florissant road - the police department on the road that had received a certain cargo warehouse, where activists were waiting for new police officers about Darren Wilson, who had not finally been charged with the charges.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined the local businessman who produced the raw materials.
They gathered the pages and helped the protesters share them.
For Ferrelli, a new type of activity began to take shape slowly.
"My activity changed completely after 9 August," he said, noting that when he was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, he was the President of the Union of the Middle Ages and focused on food justice and health-related inequalities in black communities.
"I had no organizational experience.
It's all just gone away."
A few weeks later, Ferrell met with a film associate, Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said that he and film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farr wanted to just document what was happening.
Ferrelli's eye asked: "Are you trying to document or find a story that can be used?"
Theological scepticism was due to the reading of the number of cases where people - often white people - come from society and try to understand its pain and resistance.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We have heard that the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson is not heard and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already broken his hands with Deputy director Damon Davis, a regional artist who was known for his activity in connection with death sentences.
His involvement changed the project to cover Ferrelli and six other locals, who filmed the "Whose Streets" team after Brown's shooting years later.
"There's no one talking about us or us in this documentary, but we're talking about ourselves," said Davis.
"It was important for me to imagine how these people were made, because I am. "
Although the goal was not to focus on Ferrelli's experience, it was to show that the movement was not "directed by the artist, but in the community meeting", as Folayan said, the film was the most open part of him.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" is extremely personal aspects of Ferrelli's life, such as love and marriage to his wife.
"I felt as if I'd been down," said Ferrrell, laughing at the first time he was ready for the city store.
"While I realized that doing this work and humanizing black people must be accompanied by some vulnerability."
More and more, Ferrelli’s story emphasizes and re-emphasizes the role of a middle-class homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three leaders of the movement who were thinking about social media in 2012 following the murder of the Black Rabbit Trayvon Martin are gay #BlackLivesMutter.
"In the leading role of black homosexual women have kept movement in general," said Ferrrell, "and that's just because we have to keep fighting on several tracks.
Blackish homosexual women must bear all this burden."
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement actually keeps black-headed women alive and many of them are black-haired homosexual women".
He also argues that "the struggle is not a matter of the type of creation of equal opportunities" - Ferrelli is not selected as the center of the film because of his identity.
"He was a man with the right energy of the air," he said.
"Although it is not a coincidence that he was directly in the border area, because he is a blackish gay woman living in such places.
His energy is possible through the screen."
At the same time, news cameras have disappeared from Ferguson, but racial ties between society and the police are still fragile.
During Ferrelli's term of office, the sentence for blocking the land shall continue for 2.5 years.
He describes the social policy environment in the region he calls home, simply "a free-of-charge".
On the other hand, he still has to be an important mantra, which he has eaten since he went to today's people three years ago.
"Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
Our duty is to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We don't have to lose anything except our homes."
7 tapes how to get over the base after Weekend
Some of the toughest men will find a way to get help from the gypsy to what's going on, too.
Or they're going to say, "Very stupid, stay clean."
But it's just avoidance and good health.
What can you do to make you feel better and get the best money you can get out of here tomorrow and tomorrow weekend?
Yes, it is.
Under and after alcohol, after a big meal in the morning... or if possible instead of alcohol.
Since the body loses alcohol when it needs a lot of water, it must somehow be recovered.
With water, the body is also threatened with mineral substances, and the septape is a good drink of mineral oils.
Since the pressure is very common, it is especially good if the product is free of charge or simply gasated.
Go walk.
I'm sure it's not going to pay the ground to move the trees to the old tree - it can prove to be a devastating lie.
But a simple walk will help the body remember what it feels like to be alive.
The smoothing and excretion of the stomach is the most urgent way to complete it.
Give the body the energy back to its levels and carefully.
If you're going through this part of the morning, I'm sure you don't want to try to load a big fat breakfast.
For example, start with fresh milk, which contains vegetable juices that are easily marketed in your body.
If the southern area is already healthy, you could try a chicken, for example.
And I've seen it later.
No, no, no, no, no.
This diuretic frees your body from the last water.
As already said, water and honey are your friends.
Don't contribute to painkillers.
If you take a painkiller at night to prevent painkillers, your pay must be made in addition to alcohol with paracetamol or ibuprofen and thus lose your power.
That's how bad their pay is even more and will continue to be worse.
In addition, painkillers do not stay in the body for a long time.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, don't do it completely empty - it'll upset your so-called stomach.
Or if you don't take the partner, you can get through with yourself.
It smells like walking, but walking doesn't get orgasm.
But apart from too active temperatures and reverses, physical effort should be measured during the bottom.
You're kidding.
Have fun with friends and associates, make simple jokes and laugh friendlyly as well as others.
A smile and a smile may not be a good time, but it certainly is a pleasure to find out the consequences.
Once again, it's over there!
The professor of Northwestern and Oxford University staff are looking for a suspicious murder
The police say that they are looking universally for the professors of Northwestern University and the staff of Oxford University who have been suspected of finding the death of men from one Chicago lottery card.
According to the country's court documents, on the first day of the day, arrests without the possibility of arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathemi and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were held guilty of their alleged murder by Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
Document data killed 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau after repeated seizure.
According to the warning issued by the Chicago Police Department to the community, death penalty was announced on 27 July.
The police got their phone calls and found a victim who had a lot of tortoise.
Officials said Cornell-Duranleau was a witness to the death and the investigation of a murder was carried out while the police actively sought two suspects.
Lathem has been working as a co-professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
The vice-president of public relations at the University, Alan K. Cubbage, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem is now temporarily removed and has been prohibited from entering the cities of the University of Northwestern.
"It is now with a criminal investigation of the competent authorities and the University of Northwestern is working with researchers," said Cubbage.
Warren is a senior assistant to the Oxford University Finance Department.
The representative of the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail: "We have been in the community with the British police and prepared to assist the US investigation authorities in any way possible."
In addition, it was stated in a letter that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to be released.
Anthony Guglielm, head of the Chicago Police Communications Department, recommends that the suspects exercise their powers with great intensity.
"The police have a idea where they live, but we do more intensively with the definition of the exact location," said Guglielmi.
In Guglielm’s words, doubts help to seek both local, regional, and national authorities.
Guglielmi said that the police had received a phone call from Grand Plaza's district administration, who had just received a ruptured guide, that the court no. 1008 had done something.
According to police reports, it was possible to take a look at it.
It is not clear whether the event itself took place on July 27.
He said security cameras confirm Lathem and Warren's stay at the hospital.
"We believe Professor Lathamil and the victim were related," added Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza Governing Body sent a letter to the residents: "Police is currently working with the explanation of the history of events and the victim's fate and examining various motives, including the possibility that this was a family tradition."
Old companies that help your companies avoid getting to Uberik
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of the workers in his e-commerce company, but the issues had been raised.
The answers were often indefinable, used or, even worse, exposed.
And even if he allowed to ensure anonymity, some workers did not trust this process.
"This system was simply not orderly and objective," said Errett, who leads 75 workers in San Francisco's hair care products selling e-commerce company Madison Reed.
So he called outsiders to help.
More importantly, there are new types of human resources firms that help businesses to explain what their employees are feeling.
In developing and licensed software that is sure to measure the integration of workers, they enable companies to make out interviews, to take on specific team and demographic groups, to provide workers with anonymity and hot line of complaints and, in some cases, to allow translators to go through C-tape leadership and to turn directly to the board.
"Now there are tools such as Strava and Fitbit, which are meant to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, co-author and executive Redwood City Idufirmas Glint, whose software analysis tools are used by companies to measure the integration of workers.
In other words, he's been getting through three years when he's been using Glint, much better than what his employees think and feel.
In addition to emergency investigations and discussions directed to specific teams, this company's warm map provides an overview of the most complaints in the departments and the lowest aid available to it by allowing it to explain the reasons.
The companies have come to understand that they must remain in the course of their working culture, so that they do not change to the next Uberik, which has been mixed in scandals since the former employer published a blog post, which described the deteriorating environment where those who promised to take the word were punished.
For companies such as Glint, the desire to have an overview has resulted in a business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance authority may be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, in line with financial technology statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
In the same year, Uberi's reputation of doubt grew as a result of interest and activity.
Convercentil has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered himself as a client.
Like Glintki, Konvercent allows companies to send adjusted pulse surveys, to collect confidential responses in real life, and to look at the problem areas of heat maps.
This provides anonymous message indicator, which allows workers to be informed of the inadmissibility of behaviour.
And if the manager is concerned, the complaints will go directly to the board.
"The public opinion has been drawn up by the regulatory authorities," said Konvercenti's founder and director Patrick Quinlan.
Quinlan said that if it is considered that the company treats its employees badly or behaves unfairly, the company may have serious consequences in that regard, such as consumer fraud, the departure of workers and the courts, even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant owner with more than 25,000 employees at 500 jobs, has spent more than a year in order to ensure that employees are aware of the rules and activities and to offer a convenient way to contact the corporate headquarters.
If the employer wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find the company’s main telephone number or email address, submit an official complaint and expect it to be taken seriously.
This was often a shocking and infamous process, said General James Vitrano, who said that there was no good way to monitor employees' complaints.
Now, when the company uses Convercent, it is possible to identify and deal with problems such as discrimination, harassment or misbehavior practices that have not been reached by former leaders who have been active in other cities or offices in the countries.
"I have the opportunity to get closer to the classic 360-kron experience of workers," said Vitrano, who is head of the Ruby Tuesday Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our components against the conflicts of the work force."
Quinlan said that companies began to take a much more serious approach to ethical behaviour, values and inclusion of workers in 2002, or after the loss of hearing company Arthur Andersen due to ethical infringements in connection with Enron’s scandal.
But only when "social media became a trap", the companies realized that they could not prevent their black fish from publicly swimming on the web.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour, people used the strategy as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, taking a temporary fee from the company for the use of their products.
This is in business terms and the possibility of granting the risk capital to investors who have been in favour of both companies of the former.
In February, ten million dollars were financed by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital of 47 million dollars.
Glinti invested $10 million in the Bestemer Venture Partners in November, increasing the company's capacity to grow to $60 million.
Such investments shall not be surprising if they take into account the relationship between enterprises, culture and venture capital.
More and more studies show that today's workers expect more from work than ever before.
In competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, there are high wages and interest in projects that are solely on the market.
Workers want to know that they are accepted and valued and that they dedicate their time to companies with a positive mission.
"When people are happy in business, they feel that they are heard and that the work they are doing is a source of satisfaction, they are more dedicated to the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, Vice-President of the Section for the General Benefit and Experience of Workers in LinkedIn, which uses both the Convercent and the Glint.
Investors benefit when their portfolio companies go well; companies go well when workers are dedicated and involved.
If third-party analytical tools allow to increase the commitment and inclusion of workers, there is no wonder that these support is available.
Data on the inclusion of workers is important for workers in the work culture.
However, these data have been used if the company's monitors do not engage in any of them.
In fact, if the company asks for feedback from its employees, it may cause expectations for changes to occur.
And if changes do not take place fast enough or not at all, it may lead to fraud and reduce staff involvement.
"If you asked 4,000 proposals, you must be ready for the 4000 negotiations," said Cotter International President Russell Raath, who has seen how companies make mistakes by supporting too much data collection.
"Because if things don't end up, the workers think, "Did you actually hear me?
Are you taking care of it?
And if you don't care, why should I care?"
In other words, Madison Reed, who is currently conducting six studies with employees, has been able to implement the measures on the same day as Glint reported the problem.
And after receiving feedback from workers who had failed in their decision-making pace and quality of treatment, he was able to reorganise and offer communication training in a number of companies to deal with problems.
In Ruby Tuesday, however, new data on workers are collected and it is hoped that in a long-term perspective it will bring together the long-term industry industry of the workers, known for their high-performance flexibility.
"If you have not dedicated yourself to ensuring transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose clients, you lose companies."
The main focus of the Euro area is Baltic: income increases rapidly
While the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic Sea, the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the entry of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes a reference to the report of the European Central Bank.
Since 1999, the Central Bank's overall economic output has exceeded expectations in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
Progress is a low debt burden, rapidly improving institutions and a business and free market friendly policy.
"The Baltic States, together with Slovakia, are in small euro area countries where the purchase of real-SKP for people has significantly increased to the EU average," the Central Bank said.
Although the aim is to make the overall economic production of people in Western Europe more prosperous, in 2015 the total production of the Baltic economy was on the average of 2/3 15 countries that belonged to the European Union before the 2004 enlargement.
The low wages have taken the ballast to look for a better wage abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in positive light and the economy is growing today, the local population is not quite enthusiastic.
According to the Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of Latvia's and Lithuania's population was estimated to go very well or better in their economies.
The Czech and Polish authorities considered this to be much less than half the economy in their countries.
NCAA's decision to cancel the trends in two days will change the days of Brunsy
It is almost 23, when the UCLA football team stops talking in a new exercise room located on the team’s university campus.
Some of them have fallen from the back of their hair, revealing their training gear from the first day’s effort to the hip.
For most of the team, these minutes of power are spent in the middle of the day.
Players who participate in the race will be able to learn three hours back in the course of the final exam before returning the next morning at 6.30 a.m. to the Wasserman High School.
"The next three days have been a real challenge for them," said coach Jim Mora a little before the second day.
In fact, the NCAA decided to cancel the trainee's burden twice a day, which has actually changed their days longer - at least until the end of the exams, in order to get one half.
For this reason, three of the first UCLA trainings were updated at 19.15 a.m. to fit players into such a close period.
The transition from two training days means more than one training days - the beginning of Bruins training year increased by nearly a week before the previous season, and for the first time during the month of Mora six Westwood.
They have up to 20 August planned 18 trains before the formal preparations for the opening of Texas A&M in September are launched.
Mora says she's from the NCAA regulatory change, although it adds another agenda item to the players' close schedules.
"They have three or four days of heavy burden and this is a serious challenge," said Mora.
"And they are troubled about this, because they are young men of old.
I believe that when the Saturday comes and we have more time, it's really a bit."
When the camper is finished, UCLA will turn trainings into closures, which is not really a simple task, taking into account their challenges in the vicinity of the parking lot and the centre of Luski, the higher class of hotel, which has already been able to pass through the protective network around the city.
From this week's exchange, hotel players in Bruns, but Mora acknowledged that problems can arise from the time of free rooms.
"Let's plan security," said Mora.
"It's a real place of concern and it's not too much to think that people can rent a room and then film a training.
If you have a record of training, you can do a very good deal with it.
But we're using the 8th parking lot.
Let us make the best use of ourselves.
I'm trying not to worry about it.
We've got a plan.
As a result, the Savisare-Ivanova electoral union, Christina Ojulland and KRES, which were set up by the Reform Committee, created by Maria Kaljust, created by the Association of Powers for Our Tallinn and the Partners to show the business electoral union of Tegus Tallinn - it appears that the electoral union created by the initiative of the parties is now part of the local elections of at least as much as the individual.
But the Tibus are read in depth, and the question arises if they are all given enough to be given to all the corrupt voters.
Who's staying with Savisare?
If Edgar Savisare's support team has decreased slightly, it may be possible to imagine the events organised by his election union.
One member of the national community, some of the advantages and current medium-sized and many unknown faces - can this be a Union of elections?
And can the reason why some Savisare's sponsors and friends avoid candidates in Tallinn may be found to be that the Spanish 'Savisare List', which is the top priority of corruption and corruption, is to be found to be effective?
The music video film that was filmed by the municipal government to the Russian populace, which is part of the old Lasnamáe City; and in any sense, the main prime minister of Jüri Ratas has to avoid the noises and noises that have been hit by the road - is this the first time that the Central Bank is seeking the voice of the 16- and 17-year-old voters who are admitted to election camps?
Let's just wait for the idea of a young election campaign from other groups.
When Canal 2 or TV3 is looking at a viewer from August to August instead of the first entertainment device, there are two choices: agree to continue to see only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and France24 channels or to create a 10-month television operator.
It is also true that those who initially enjoy free telecoms are generally happy, but in the end, they also pay for television and advertising.
The most impressive music, the famous crowd, and the flag left for the people, are the greatest musical festival of all.
But if you don't want to get part of it yourself, you have to find out that instead of spending money, you're gonna have to go to the house and get some rest for the partyists.
Washington changes the rules of the Green Card
Media aliens stress President Donald Trumpi, who says that there is a new US immigration plan that changes the rules of the Green Card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants per 50,000 people per year, stricter rules for the acquisition of temporary jobs and restrictions on family planning.
The new rules have been tabled by the Liberals and the President supports them.
The legislative initiative is going to discuss the Congress in two homes.
"This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars of money for taxpayers, as it changes how the US produces green cards for citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce the deficit and will replace the current programme.
The new application process will benefit candidates who speak English and who have financial resources to support themselves and skills that will benefit our economy," said Trump in the US media release.
The Siberi set up a town, retired back to the country.
Jevsejev Anatoli continues to be a tradition of the ancient Maana Seas.
He works from house to house 150 miles [140 km] along the Mana’s coast along the Cuva River as a gold car guide.
It's hard work: two months from now without rest days 12 hours and then only ten days at home and again.
Over the course of three years in Artel, Anatoli has seen gold once.
"There's a hard time: there's a way in in there's a reasonable check that wine doesn't bring along, and out there's a way that gold doesn't take it," Anatoli says.
In conversations with Mare Piho in Haiti, a local set of Jaan who has told her much about the memories of her family in Siberia.
The historical culture that still remains in Siberia is also going to influence home-sets, as it is simply so liberal, considers the most far-reaching set that has studied the Piho Mare.
His first investigation trip to Siberia lasts 30 years.
During this time, he has walked there 14 times and lived there together for a year.
How many sets were still exported to Siberia at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries to get the land?
That's an unsolved question.
I'm saying 8,000.
I took this out for the case of seven men in Siberia who have thought about it.
It's hard to say, because that was a group of up to 30 people, but the passport was given only to the man.
The passport was given to only one, but she had children, sisters, and wives.
Look how big this territory was here!
It was a number of times greater than the historic Setom.
It had to be learned, to manage in some way.
They came here as farmers, but their lives changed because they were in areas not only related to agriculture, but also to the sea (petroleum), coal mining, industry.
For example, many hundreds later went to work in the city of Krasnojarsk-45 (thereby building the power of the Councils to build the Uranium Corps - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did these bees form a vast majority of the population in the region?
Yeah, they lived with compatriots.
In addition, the tradition of marriage and polygamy remained a long one.
Seven-to-eight children were normal.
How much different the culture of Siberia's sects and what difference does it make to Mother's?
They're different, even though what was brought here was ever the same.
They brought a lot of people together.
They also made (peoples) themselves, but they always changed what was produced and what was done here.
Climate change had a strong impact on traditional clothing, as it is even colder here.
The changes have been made.
For example, the meat was salted, but it was just frozen here.
Where are the islands of the Siberian statues and what life is there? / Graphic: Alari Paluots
The connection between mother and mother was spiritually strong, and this was considered very important.
It seems to me that now it's going to give Setumaa back there, it's going to affect them.
These girls who have lived here as a family have heard amazing stories.
In view of the people of the Estonian Senate delegation who came to Haiti early in July in the days of the Kingdom of Seto and lived in the homes of J. P.
What's left here is disgusting.
"The tapala is a great place to come and go, too, because the city has a great place to live: in the railway station and on the road to the countryside," says the Taipalt from the operas of Reigo Tamm.
The city is no longer just a military base, we have a lot of nature, a place of sport and culture, and the pitch is going to be everywhere.
Killing is a tip-top city!
There are a small island across the city across the White Sea, where casuals are accustomed to holding a janitor.
"It doesn't look like it's beautiful in a row," recalls Reigo.
Anyone who does not fear cold water will be able to swim in the river, because the sea is full of sources.
I've been there in the spring, it's gonna be perfect!
The river can be seen in the sky, and simply make romantics - the water can flow in the eye and think about life and will.
I've been walking there with my brides too.
The Oberiant Tamm, after all, has gone between three and three o'clock in the afternoon, practicing his ariads: "That place is beyond the city, no one will be against you when you tell your stories."
"It's amazing to see the Tapel, but there are also health-care providers, where it can be carried out, and now, for example, to play discgolfi - golf is made, cats can borrow from the sports center," says Reigo.
The old professionals are going there with their kids, but I haven't been there to play yet.
I think Mr Rasmus Kull should be invited to the table, because he has experienced a discgolfing game and has a long existence.
He'll pay me back!
Reigo and Männikumämä was a long-term solution to the obsessive childhood of the current operasolist.
At least for hours.
There's been a lot of hypocrisy, hypocrisy, and you've got to do with my life.
No mention of broken bones and joints.
"The whole centre is now full of buildings, all of which is becoming unconscious," Reigo says.
Killing an old and tired vaccinated vaccine is a very attractive place to play fun.
I'm glad that in 2012 R.A.A.A.M. leader Mart Meos took my idea and came to make a professional svet theater with his theatre.
Although today's theatre time "Aleksei Karen" has just passed, on 11 August there is a railway "Ellusioning" when an old van is moving around in the 1980s.
"August 11-13 is the days of the town of Tapa, which has prevented the opening houses of the vassal building from being opened and there is a series of cultural events, including public events," says Reigo, who recommends visiting the city on that very day from 91.
The museum has been on the small side of the house on May 1, 1994.
"The house is small, but the exponents are very good and infoful," says Reigo, who is full of the history of the town of Tapa, most of which focuses on the railway and the war.
Reigo remembers that when Tapal passes all the recommended places, the grass goes to a long distance away, but luckily, little coffee is filled.
"We have so good restaurants and meetings that sometimes it makes you feel like you're out there," he says.
The trained and young soldiers who came to Tabele spend a lot of time in the pubs, sitting there is a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and in your home country, but the environment is such an international society together.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories about French or American people.
Soldiers, yes, we're moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal telephony
On TV BTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal telephony in Greece.
On August 1st, the police arrested a group of people who were also two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but now the investigation is under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the TV channel BTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased free circulation restrictions and are already imposing a severe fine on all those who remain in a place of rest which is not provided for.
The controls will continue throughout the clock.
According to the Ministry of Justice, the penalty may be fixed.
Dogs teach dogs walk on the lambs.
After a year, the Himalayas will have to give the dogs their "learning material" back to their dog - probably the dogs who have been taught by dogs have already been bitten by lions.
Today, dogs in the country of Hiiu have injured lions three times, totaling 23 sheep and injured eight, writes Hiiu Leht.
I had only three, 124 years ago.
With murder, there are also data from the environmental agency that the Hiiumaal has not produced a dog breeder and that the Hiiuma hunting council has found that two dog breeders have been identified on the island this year.
On the first day of the night, hundreds of Emmas made a visit to Kabuna by 15 lamb and injured 18 remaining lamb.
On the early morning of the third day, the dogs of Rehelja visited the country by a lion and violently attacked the others who had come to attack.
Rules for the handling of genetically modified agricultural crops must be clear
The Ministry of Agriculture sent a proposal for a genetically modified environmental law (GMOVS) and an amendment to the legislation on plant protection.
The amendment excludes the creation of a separate database for both genetically modified (GM) agricultural sites and operators, using the register of plant health.
In addition, the obligation of a GM farmer to enter into an earlier agreement with a person engaged in a radio accident shall be amended.
Although there is currently no genetically modified agricultural culture in Estonia, there is a need for clear rules for the integration of genetically modified and unchanged crops.
This is at least as long as Estonia has not decided to be free of GMO," said Sigmar Suu, director of the Department of Plant Health of the Ministry of Agriculture.
"At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be objective and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burden associated with both the private and the public sector," in the Annex to this Regulation.
The draft legislation repeals the provisions relating to GMOVS' location and operator data collection and processing training, lays down the requirements for the operation of the GMOVS and the start of economic activity.
In particular with regard to the measurement, the GM farmer shall be replaced by the present obligation to inform the GM of the undertaking for starting the growth of the GM agricultural culture with the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement before the start of the growth.
The draft legislation is sent for coordination to ministries.
All interested parties have the opportunity to present their views to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the information system and, where appropriate, to present their opinion.
The proposed changes affect, in particular, the persons, machinery and the Agency operating in the field of plant growth.
The European Union, including Estonia, is allowed to grow only one GM agricultural culture - May MON 810.
However, no Estonian agricultural producer has yet been interested in the growth of the GM agricultural culture.
The reason is that there has been no malformation in Estonia, a European remnant of which is resistant to MON 810.
It is also developed in southern regions, and it is not suitable for our climate conditions.
In 2015 and 2016, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has commissioned studies to reveal potential GM crops in the various suburbans, maize and soybean varieties growing in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds were not included in the network and as a result of the study, it was concluded that the seeds of the species of rabies, maize and soybeans in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms.
In the past, it may be concluded that there is no known genetically modified agricultural culture in Estonia, and it has also been confirmed that there has been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester Uniteds green Nemanja Maticu in the form of "geneuse"
Jose Mourinho believes that the Manchester Uniteds have colored Nemanja Maticu's face "geneity", after the middle-aged singer Sampdor made his debut three days ago.
40 million yells for Chelsea's winner started in Dublin, the last summer of the game before Uefa Super Cup Real Madrid won 2-1 on the second day, declaring the memory in the protection role, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were released on the battlefield.
But having left behind the Blues' summer tour in Asia, Maticul was desperately in need of a massage, and he was only 45 minutes away. This must certainly be done before the beginning of the spring of the Premier League.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, genius thinking -- he has football toys," said Mourinho.
"Let's help him get the form on his first chance."
Like Matic, Aviva started at the beginning of the season with the other new colored Victor Lindelof and the Roman Lukaku and Murinho began to easily replace the man who started his union.
The Independent announced this week that Mourinho still wants to paint three other football players, but he confirmed that the club has already done "a great job", concluding agreements with three of its four priorities.
"I am grateful to the club that they were able to realize three of the four," he added.
"I'm even happier if they can make four, but they've seen very hard for me."
Next time, the son of a soo-boy got his foot on August 1st and that's in Muhus.
The data provided by the resident citizen of Särves, Mat Martinson, reached the first round with the sender, and this crew is already flying around, has left and joined the Mullutu-Surlahe with a large housing gathering.
This is because Sårvez is no longer a fruit tree, he writes in the voice of the Islands.
On that second day, relatively late to cure the wounds, the sender received another lame son and this one on the island of Muhu.
Martinson said that the installation of the senders is actually an international project that leads to Aivar Leiito and Ivar Ojaste.
My mind was provided with one of my cousins named Mati GSM at Särves Turjul.
"His actions are all visible on the Internet: how he went to Spain in winter, back in time came to the German and Polish border and then came to Saarema," said Martinson.
The British explorer allowed you to install your own microkib to access your home and car with your hands.
The first person in the country to be installed was the British inventor, who was placed in a microchip so that he could just open up his profit, get to the office, and even drive the car.
33-year-old Steven Northam is allowed to install a small kibi between his desk and his name form and now offers this service through his company BioTeq to businesses and individuals who want to change their lives more easily with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson in the Royal Hospital of Hampshire, in Winchester, Hansis, to ensure that the installation procedure is in line with medical standards.
Technology is similar to a microchib installed in cats and dogs, and the procedure will take up to 30 seconds.
Northami's company also exchanges the doors of houses and cars to combine them with a bicycle, asking for one of the 300 bottles.
This marriage of one child's father has installed technology for now, both at home and in his car BMW Z4, which runs when he's in the role.
The White House exposure paid thousands to taxpayers
According to military documents published by the TIME, the White House decided to fly a sea helicopter last month to pay $24,000 for a South-Weapon-payer company that marked America’s production last month.
The green and white color Sikorksky VH-3D, known as the president's flight to Marine One, was the middle of the event announced by the American construction programmes in the White House on 17 July.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and White House senior officials reviewed industrial products in their rounds from all 50 countries.
The helicopter built by Connecticut was exposed together with a fireplace from Maine, a fireplace from Wisconsin and a coffee shop made in Mississippi.
According to documents issued by the shipper Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House army requested that the helicopter be placed in the airport or 36 hours prior to the arrival of the "unusual" helicopter in the south-east.
"I knew that you would be aware of this because it is extremely important with the company under consideration," said HMX-1 commander the day before the event in his e-mail address, the commander of the seaman in the field of aviation.
The message indicated that the helicopter would arrive on the south side of the island on July 17th at 7 a.m. to 15 a.m. and will remain there until the same night between 18 and 21 a.m.
The fact was added that if the departure from the White House was to take place, it would be necessary for the rest of the working hours to be returned because of the restrictions on working time.
The original aircraft team was at the helicopter during the operation and the emergency safety team remained close to the aircraft for almost all of the time it stayed on the ground.
It was not possible to read from the documents provided to the newspaper of TIME whether or not you had to go to the end of your period.
The Hatchi Act prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents show that in the HMX-1 study, the given event could break this provision.
"We asked if it violates Hatchi's law, and we were told that it's not wrong," wrote the commander.
"You don't seem to have a choice," answered the commander's commanding officer.
The White House declared the "America-made" company to be an official event and the Hatchi law would not cover it.
But even official events are political undertones.
At that time, the President supported the efforts of the health care reform during the Senate discussion and thanked the Government for its efforts to keep the rules.
The use of a vehicle known under the name Marine One or Air Force One for political input is no new phenomenon.
The Presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them as a pure photosenic is unacceptable.
In February, Trump took note of his first campaign in Florida Melbourne, and his Twitter account is covering messages that hurt the way his predecessor used the flight of his president.
"Valgel May is very pleased with the proposal "America made" which has been represented by products from all 50 countries that have been prepared from American materials for work," said Mr. Lindsay Walters, vice-president of the White House.
HMX-1 teams make frequent attempts around Washington and on the south side of the island to use the bottom of the White House of President of the United States with a centimeter.
When Trump was at the beginning of July in Germany at the G20 summit, the HMX-1 White House hosted 58 testing.
According to the official, the aircraft was considered to be among the standard for those months of training in the "America" aircraft.
On that day, the helicopters of the Eskaadri flew for another 11 hours for "non-presidented support missions".
According to the White House, no other company's exposure to this company is obliged to pay the cash.
According to the representative of Sikorsky, the company was not involved in the organisation of the subsidisation of the helicopter on the south coast.
HMX-1 does not keep the exact costs of the president's flight budget documents and the precise costs arising from the event are difficult to explain.
However, according to the 2017 economic year estimates, VH-3D is a compensation amount of $24,380 for flights.
The documents of the Escaadry marked the distance from the port of Quantico from the coast of Virginia for 30 minutes.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using a helicopter is very low.
"The calculation of the cost of taxpayers on the basis of priceable remuneration rates is very exhibitable," Walters said.
"These estimated remuneration rates include staff, care and many other non-recurrent costs taken into account for annual appropriations."
According to the 2015 RAND study, the remuneration rates of the Ministry of Defence do not include staff costs, but they cover costs related to fuel, maintenance and contracts.
White House former president Sean Spicer protected the use of helicopters during that time.
"The idea of Asia is to show this week something prepared in America," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud that they are contributing to our national security and that there are likely hundreds if not even thousands of people whose work depends on it.
And I think that just like most American classes, we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, where so many Americans have seen extremely poor.
So, of course, it's right to raise it."
It is not clear whether Trump was missing on the south-east corner of the company during a round trip with a helicopter or not, but he was sitting on the side of the train.
In the White House he turned to the representatives of Trump Sikorsky, throwing the music products of foreign media companies over his private airport.
"I know Sikorkskyt very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
Grit Shadeiko - through the whites to attain peace and joy
In 2011, MMil Daegus killed Shadeiko for the last time, over 800 m, and from the stadium he was taken to the kandaram.
Just before that, he had received a zero in the university in China.
In 2012, Helsinki's EMI was injured in a fatal injury, but in London, it received a debitolim at point 23 of 6013.
However, the failure continued.
After the opening day 2013, Moscow MMil received an award in Estonian record charts.
Two years later he got to the MM in Beijing 15 and met the Olympic norm, but it was most of the way for the athletes to be disappointed.
The most difficult situation was that of Shadeiko only when he had not initially received a letter of resignation from the Amsterdam EM.
I'd just like to add one regular multiplicity at a time.
One time," at Shadeiko's place.
Even worse was ahead: a month later, his Olympics broke down because of Rios' journeys.
It's time to take off. - Do you want to keep up with the seven-year-olds?
Are two days of effort still worth all of this?
They thought for a while, but they found peace.
I got to think about it.
It's relatively hard to describe this experience, but I've been thinking that the past summer and Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Happily, it was time for you to take care of yourself and keep your head clean.
"I knew I wasn't going to put my house on the pill," Shadeiko says about his own self-cleanness.
I've got a clean man to turn around and go on with the new guy.
Trainer Anne Mayga said that it was very difficult to see the suffering of care, but he understood that especially the athlete must be able to get to the point.
He was so impressed by all of them.
It was hard to find.
"But Grit said he didn't give up and he wants to prove to himself what he's worth," says Megi.
Now there's some kind of peace in him.
He's doing it for his pleasure.
The arrest came back in May when Shadeiko stopped at Götz’s multiplicity at point 6280 of the new Estonian record.
In the high level of competition, he improved his personal tipmarking speed by about a meter (13.89) and during a record-by-time break.
Then the divers realized that this was not a rule of some sort of power, but it was the first to be removed.
He's been leading him for years, says Shadeiko is a model student.
He's ready for sports, he's good to train.
If something happens or is wrong, he'll say it right away.
He feels his body and trusts his feelings.
We have to get out of this.
I can't say exactly what to do, and we'll follow it.
A new approach has also been found at Shadeiko.
"I'm not the one who's doing the maximum train," he says and says that the most important thing is to get the right sense, because it also ensures a good outcome.
The Grandparents Make the Children Happy
Good emotions have also contributed to the happiness of the loved ones.
His former coaches, Maris May, and Sister Grete, have recently become a childer, and the multi-stakeholder has been re-enforced by the air-citizens.
"It's been very interesting," says Shadeiko.
One of the alcohols that gives up the brain's "training".
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is so sweet that he believes that wine can train his brain better than anything else in the world.
Sheperd is a neurotheist at Yale University.
His statement is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather about the "very active" wine taste process.
We put our brains at work to make wine taste.
Sheperd’s words do not actually contain the taste of wine, but the taste is how the wine stimulates the brain.
He compares the brain to the color of the brain.
"Love isn't wine, it's taste that makes wine taste," says Sheperd.
The things that still affect the taste of wine, for example, are our age, the seed, and even the soil that man produces.
Sheperd, of course, thinks that wine isn't enough to get full of juice.
"There's gotta be a lot stronger in action," he says.
If you take too much credit, the system's overloaded.
Too much wine burning can harm the brain rather than harm the brain - according to the 2004 study, people who drink more than three classes of wine, memory loss, balance loss and reduced spirituality.
10% of Estonian ICT staff receive less pay than colleagues
Personalisation company Fontes data show that 10% of Estonian ICT staff receive less pay than colleagues.
Ten percent of the salary is between men and women, writes the portal Geenius.
Fontese was involved in the ICT sector's lending study of 59 IT and telecommunications companies.
There were 8,577 officers under consideration.
63% of the staff were employed.
"While only 3 companies claimed that the wage gap is for the benefit of men and that the rest of the companies did not have the wage gap, in real terms, the share between men is 10% higher than the average of men per month and the average share of men per year is 8% higher than women," said Fontese analyst Ilmar North.
"Narcose" 3rd Advertisement button: Now that Pablo Escobar has gone, Netflix is located in the center of the Cali cartel
Despite the discovery of Pablo Escobar's killer in the second season of "Narcose", Netflix has not finished far.
The third and fourth hours have been approved by the service of transport, and the first of these have already been prepared with a advertising clip that is corroding the line with new evils.
In the third century, DEA turned its attention to the world's richest drug organization - Cali cartel.
They operate four powerful Christians under the leadership of "like Fortune 500", simply with stronger taxes on government and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is a folder leader, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (France Denis) is his son, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is a link to Mexico and Chepe Santacruz London (Pepe Rapazote) is operating in New York.
In the recently released release, Pedro Pascal looks back on Javier Penana, a businessman who is stealing legal aid from the United States and Colombia in the war against drugs.
Other new examples include Mattias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Wheelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcose will be opened on September 1st.
The UN says that Afghan women's democracy is a role in politics
On the third day, the Head of Mission of the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan said that elections could only be held by people when all members of society, including women, play such a role.
United Nations Assistant Mission leader Nicholas Haysom said that hundreds of women are candidates for local council elections, three are candidates as Vice-Presidents, and more than 30 per cent of the recently registered voters are women.
"The importance of women cannot be overemphasized," he said in a statement made on the third day.
Elections can really represent and be believed only when women are fully involved and are involved in the electoral process at all stages.
The elections and presidential elections of the local Councils of Afghanistan shall take place on 5 April.
Taliban has threatened the electoral process, which will be reduced by the transition period, where the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
This year's elections mark the first time that the power is granted peacefully to one democratically elected government.
Haysomi says that women have a strong role to play in the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
The data of the Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan contain 1.2 million women registered in the electoral board.
The joy of sharing makes all things urgent both to large and to small.
At the same time, there is always too little, but the train trains provide a good opportunity to combine meetings, games, approaches and weights.
And whatever a comfortable solution - wherever you are in the winter, living handys are always with you and come to mind without suffering their voice, "Let's train now too!"
It's a very good start with heating. It's usually a gold game or passing the coastal edge.
The hole is the beginning of standing in the shape of legs and ashes - who would like to take a photo of a carefully protected herd of pigs during the winter?
Immetrere is to use a child instead of a neck!
First of all, it is safe and comfortable, and the difficulty increases at the same time as the trainer's power.
The next couple can also make a lot of cake with big kids.
The child trains balance, reads times and feels the opportunity to relax and be important.
Larger children can make their own cake at the same time.
The size of the movement will be positioned by touching the ground and shaking the hands.
Keep your fingers straight, please hold the minimum correctly.
The child can read times and feel like a trainer.
The plan is supreme, but for the child, it's an unexpected constant exercise.
But it's easier to do!
Game plank: take a long ping column from which to swim through.
Actually, it's harder than normal, but it's much more fun to do when you get a friend to hand.
To add weight, you can stay on the beach, on the small market, and also walk around it.
In addition, you can write to the children’s trees, but this exercise offers fun for all children.
At the same time as the cancers in the veins, they get trimesters, poisons, and muscle fats such as the neck.
The child will lie on his feet so that his body weight will be divided in the same order and manner.
You can keep your hands safe.
Squeeze your legs and move them up.
The pilot can fly, enjoy, train balance and be difficult.
A small trainer's life is in extracurricular when he gets a small dance every night.
The additional report shall provide for the movement of legs.
Check that you're clearly in neutral position.
In children, brain cells are much more fun to do with pairs and plates.
Hand-made and powdered cake.
Follow the child’s safety, the fuel installation, and keep a clear neutral position.
Love and great fun for all the kids!
At the same time, the entire body was truly effective.

The Philippines spread the world, or Ülgkot, into the hearts of the Moufens
For the last few years, dried houses have been covered by ice creams, which have been obtained from their own products, which have to be cut off directly by the right windmill and which have been made available to the trademen, despite the fact that they have been able to avoid the price at the price of the heat.
It is likely that the furrowed goat is one of the things that has always existed and whose own has not produced special emotions.
It's just there and if it's not, there's nothing wrong with it.
Now, however, in the course of the real victory and the moefs, they have changed their weights of designers for winter months against simple clay houses.
In this case, it is not only with the banakot, but today it is even more popular today, and more brave women are going to the office.
However, there is a need to make it clear before it is clear whether such a soft look is still sitting or that the mark and the figure is still somewhat official.
In contrast, women have experienced true susceptibility from obscenities.
For example, by reading foreign moeblogs, the first thing to do is to see the moegurmen entering the local market in the first place in the holiday season and calling themselves at home, where there is a healthy holiday season in the sea, on the market, and on the streets with friends.
Some bloggers are so crazy that they buy a lot of cash from the market and sell them or give them to their loyal readers.
In this case, it is worth noting that there is a demand for readers so great that women (and men!) in the original world may have been given to one another in order to make some home a happy owner.
In some sense, such a mistake is also understandable, as it is rare to see these arrangements when it is possible to buy some of the most modest ones in the world.
Of course, cheap trademen have also found a simple financial service option here, and thus sell smaller luxury brands for some and thousands of euros.
Apparently, even more wealthy customers should not be aware of those who promulgating around some cheap homes.
For example, it is possible to buy Dolce & Gabbana more than thousands of euro-paying debt.
However, for the translation of the Caneli dictionary, it is possible to travel around EUR 6000.
Unlike most of the males, the males did not grow out of some large males, but their history grew far from the beginning.
Those names were evidently derived from the ancient Philistines, where they had been scattered without interference.
It is not uncommon to see the rustling of the houses, especially by the exhibitor and locals around them.
It is unlikely that the oil engine would have originated in the 14th century and would have ended with the normal exchange rate.
However, since the clay needs not to be as strong as the clay, it can be molded into patterns and other materials that make home more personal and thus more attractive.
For example, recently there have been particularly trendy houses, where colourful patches or skin crests have been painted.
In particular, the letter of appreciation may be sent to the exhibition director Jane Birkin, who had never seen the largest gold mined.
On behalf of his name, he agreed to go to all the possible clothing complexes and did not even have to go to Cannes' film festival.
Today’s population has no less role to play, but the fact that care for them is expensive and, unlike all other species of birds does not have to take care of them by special means, but things also take away water and a marked deal.
As with trends in trends, the brands have come out of a classic dimension with all possible translations.
For example, if you wish, you can call yourself an oliveapple or an olive tree.
At the same time, it should be borne in mind that a classic flower does not go from tree to tree, but it does.
So, what's a classic legend?
For centuries, it has been viewed as a classic view of a wooden house that commemorates its style, has been opened on top and has shorts, as well as glasses, hands.

A missing man was found on the island for three days
Aare left his home three days ago in an unknown direction.
Arare was on the way to the last contact last night, on the train, and the telephone positioning gave him a location in the West Saare Valley, a visit to Münnus, where he was searched with a helicopter to the heart and with dogs to the early morning.
Then his phone became empty and the man’s location was no longer possible.
The police continued their search this morning.
The police are thanking everyone who helped find Aare.
GMB leads to investment in McVitie's Glasgow factory
The company expects, under the guidance of the cookie manufacturer McVitie, confirmation of long-term production plans in the company's company Glasgow.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has failed to invest the Tollcross object in the future.
In the factory where Hobnobs and Rich Tea cooks and other products are produced, more than 500 people work.
McVitie's owner Pladis said they've invested in the object over the last couple of years more than 5 million laughs.
The workers and the head of the company were hired there, "the first to hear" when something changes in action.
In a letter sent to the company's objector, GMB Scotland turned to McVitie's request "to deal with concerns about the fact that the funds are not used to modernise production lines".
GMB's senior organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we can't get the object head clear about Tollcross's business assets and future investment plans makes our members more worried.
There has been a number of generations of families and workers are largely made up of local society and the population of the Glasgow environment, being urgently needed to ensure regular employment in the region where high employment is and manages social exclusion.
Therefore, Glasgow needs a company in the eastern part of its jobs, wages and well-being, as well as the growth of Brexit, the growth of its housing costs and the decline in production of its chronically growing production industry in McVitie."
The representative of Pladise said: "The Tollcross object leader received a letter from GMB Scotland last night, and the company answers him directly because we value the active relationship with the employees and the representatives of the company.
Two months ago, a regular meeting between Tollcrossesis and representatives of GMB was held, where several problems were discussed publicly.
We then discussed with the workers that, like all other companies operating in extremely competitive and unfair economic conditions, we look at our activities over - and this applies to all our companies and objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years we have invested over 5 million languages in the Tollcross object, most of which have gone into production lines and operations.
We fully understand the origin of the Tollcross as a production object and if any changes should take place in the operation of the object, the workers and representatives of the company are the first to hear about it."
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about coming to Neymar?
La Liga can regret her interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain did not give up trying to lure Neymar into his race, making him an offer of 189 million pounds. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago about this record theft?
This kangaroo approach has been opened as a summer pass and League 1 club is ready to clean up more than twice the current world record of surrender, which was set up in the previous season by Paul Pogba's return to Manchester Uniteds 89 million.
When the transition has been completed, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and at the same time the most highly qualified professional sportsman in the world, who will get over 500 000 pounds a week after paying the PSG.
Barcelona is known to be angry at the approach of both the way of approach and the free movement of Neymari, although the source of the nearby Catalan Presidency confirms that the club has been the best in keeping track of the football since its arrival in Santos in 2013.
But did the PSG president warn the football world about this opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in the conclusion of the agreement with Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif strongly warned all clubs who are thinking of buying some PSG's best player.
"I don't worry, because they know that if they touch some of our players, we'll fight them and get in touch with those players," said Al-Khelaif.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they're trying to make a deal with some of our players, they'll have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have fallen across this border because the Spanish club had previously shown interest in PSG-meaning Marco Verratt earlier this summer.
The PSG made it clear that they are not allowed to leave in Italy under any condition and that Barcelona can get back to its interest by losing one of its fish stocks in the form of Neymari.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build a bridge, not a border.
"Brexit is seriously threatening the gap between Northern Ireland and Ireland, the United Kingdom and Ireland," Varadkar, in his first visit to Northern Ireland, warned in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border tariffs have changed the possibility of free movement of current people and goods, Varadkar said.
"It's our vision for the future: building the eye, not the border," he stressed.
It would prefer to remain in the UK as part of the European Union and, as this cannot be done, to remain in the European common market.
It would remain free trade between the current Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
The second option to make the departure of Great Britain more attractive would be the creation of a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, the Prime Minister of Ireland explained.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said, "We could certainly have it with Britain."
This would be an alternative to returning to customs points that would include historical stagnation and political transition.
"Take care of trade, justice and peace," said the Prime Minister of Ireland.
He called Brexit "the challenge of our generation" and warned that this outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland's everyday life.
The Prime Minister of Ireland met in Belfast on a visit to the leaders of the main parts of Northern Ireland.
The first half of its triathlon passed by Mart Avandi: Ironman can pass by everyone.
Today, the largest triathlon festival in the Baltic Sea was held on the southern coast of the Baltic Sea, where about a thousand triathetes were located in more than thirty countries.
The distance of 70,3 miles was 1,9 km from the train, 90 km from the train and 21,1 km from the train.
On the other hand, the first triathlon of his life was successfully completed by Mart Avandi.
"I thought it was going to be complicated and eventually difficult," said the Avandi finalist.
Despite the difficulties, Avandi is convinced that the triathlon is actually a powerful head for everyone.
"Not the distance does not kill, but the pace kills," he said, pointing out that at the speed of power, it reaches the finish of each head.
Except for Ott Sepp, "It's all right with the fish, but the best can't swim."
The opening had already taken a train from February.
At first, four to five hours a week, but then it's already ten hours a week.
At 05:34:12, he arrived at the general meeting at 270.
Although Avand lost both Raio Piiroja (at 04:59:53) and Jürgen Ligile (at 05:06:37), he won the other so-called "prominent class" battles.
Last year, Tanel Padar lost Opendi with seven minutes (05:41:54), journalist Stan Teppan with 16 minutes (05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm for about an hour (see 06:31:53 and 06:45:18).
John Moldan at 3:58:27, the Estonians were the best Ivo Big Time 04:14:09.
Among the women who won the battle was Aunt Helle Frederick's time 04:24:01, but the Estonians, Maria Janese, who lost Fredericksen for about half an hour and got the time 04:58:58.
The opening went from 1.9 km to a long walk with 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water at 410.
