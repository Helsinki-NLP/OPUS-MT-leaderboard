Biker reacts quickly and prevents bruises
On the freeway, a traffic accident occurred between the power station and the mercenary, where a driver was easily damaged because of his rapid reaction.
Car driver takes a look at Biker
A 44-year-old car driver wanted to join the country's 1230 road towards Machtolheim, with its VW from Merlingen.
In this case, they passed the 24-year-old train driver who came from the direction of Nellingen.
When the collision fly away hand- and foot-brake
The biker still tried to excavate the pkw, but they still ran into the back of the vehicle.
By the strike process, the hand-and-hand and foot-brake were removed from the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to break down.
On the contrary, he was driving his motorcycle in the green stairs along the railway and allowed it to explode there without falling.
Becker caused bone injury
However, the biker experienced an injury in the leg and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 Ertehelper infected
After a Corona mass infection on a large community hall in the Netherlands Mamming, almost 500 people are under quarantine and cannot leave the operation anymore.
A security service monitors the exit ban.
In total, 174 senior assistants were tested positive on the Corona Regger Sars-CoV-2 during the series investigation, as reported by Landratesamt Dingolfing-Landau on Saturday afternoon.
"In order to avoid further expansion, we have to take this step to protect the people," explained Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Seven employees had already been infected in the operation - this was the case with the railway station.
In the operation, it is a large building hall, the floors, churches, coal and red beds - but the churches are only for litigators.
Mamming is a rural community with good 3300 inhabitants near Dingolfing with its great BMW work.
Bumeder called on the citizens to maintain peace: "It is a closed circle of people, according to our information."
Infected by non-infected employees, the area is now surrounded by an outhouse.
Green and SPD gave the government responsibility.
The two opposition groups proposed that Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet should monitor the accommodation of seasonal workers.
"This can be worse if local infections occur and regional lockdowns must be arranged," said Jürgen Mistol, the Greens' parliamentary director.
This is similar to the SPD: "We have already called for a special control program for farmers' farms with land-supply after the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof-Schlachthof mid-May," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"If the conditions of health at work and living conditions are to be checked from our point of view.
This is obviously not happening."
The explosion would have come "with orders".
Aidenbachstraße: Hazardous Street: 19-year-olds fall by Schubser into Gleisbett
In a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße railway station, a 19-year-old was attacked by a driver and dragged into bed.
Overendling - On Friday it came at the Aidenbachstraße train station against 16.15 a fight between two youth groups.
A passenger alarmed the police, who started with several flows.
The first findings resulted in the creation of a Municher (17) a 19-year-old to land.
The young man walked over the side of the road and fell into bed.
People from the group of the 17-year-olds had half to cut their throats.
There was no danger through a simple train.
As reported by the police, it then came back to the separations between the two persons.
The 17-year-old fled first by the tator, but his staff were able to be identified in the nearby.
In his father's presence, he went to police inspection 29.
The 17-year-olds are exposed to physical damage.
Report: Seehofer pushes on longer-term data storage
The preview data storage is currently in use.
However, after a media report, Federal Minister Horst Seehofer requires an extension of the time limit.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) requires an extended storage of pre-trial data after a media report - instead of the planned 10 weeks of a half year.
As the "Image on Sunday" reports, Seahofer Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) wrote a letter about a rapid change of law.
Seehoffer therefore wishes to strengthen measures against child abuse.
He held it to be meaningful, "providing the necessary adjustments in the law now", says the newspaper.
At present, the advance data storage has been suspended.
It is expected that a decision of the EuGH will be taken.
Seehoffer, however, has already wanted to make the amendments so that they can be applied as soon as possible in a positive judgment, which is further mentioned in the report.
A spokesman from the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it could only be verified to make sense of whether legal adjustments were necessary if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer had spoken with the Ministers of the Interior of the Countries already in June for a preliminary record.
NBA: Strip club for Clippers Star Lou Williams
Stop in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), the Los Angeles Clippers basketball professional, should have left the tournament quarter in Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a performance.
According to US media reports, he visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta tonight.
Williams, who should have given the visit according to the ESPN data, is again in isolation, is tested on Covid-19 every day.
His reason for the visit: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for these things.
The American writer wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (a different strip club in Atlanta, Am. d. R.) have the best Wings in the city".
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Sunday at Twitter that the NBA Williams had ordered a ten-day quarantine.
The Clippers Star therefore skips the first two official parties after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to play the Corona season.
Currently the best 22 men with training games are preparing for the season finals starting at night on Friday.
Söder is excavated after mass infection to the Corona position
München - Minister of Health Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a material for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be on our website alive.
The case in Mamming in the Dingolfing-Landau district has raised authorities and politics.
At the large community building, almost 500 orphans from several countries are currently working, and over a third have been infected with the Corona hierarchy.
The court is located in the middle of the Quarantine and is closed with a building.
No one can leave the land, food is delivered.
The good 3300 inhabitants of the municipality now offer free Corona tests.
Since the affected person had little contact with the local population, the Landsamt report that the infection had not spread beyond the court.
"Creation of conscience": Constituentness of Nantes’s Must-British Fireworks
"My mandate has been cooperative," said lawyer Quentin Chabert of the newspaper.
The defender added: "He regrets very much the acts, the state was a relief for him."
His mandate was "filled with consciences and very involved in the extent of destruction".
In the event of a trial, the man was sentenced to ten years in state service and a fine of EUR 150,000.
The Gothic Sankt-Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes was badly damaged during the night on Saturday last week at a fire.
The fire broke out in three remote places in the church.
Labour surveys raised the suspicion of fireflies.
The suspect who was now arrested had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
But after one day he was released again.
The man worked as a volunteer for the Diocese Nantes and was responsible for closing the cathedral on the morning of the fire.
Since there was no trace of violent intrusion in the church, he quickly entered the center of the center.
Discussion of the 50+1 rule
The former DFB President Reinhard Grindel recommended that we consider the repeal of the 50+1 rule.
"The German football should at least discuss, establish conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates full facts," said the basis of the "Image on Sunday".
He stressed: "For the union that can be threatened in the first Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work without: see Leipzig or Liverkusen.
In other words, the debate is not about whether it is forbidden to join associations that want to break into this Phalanx to facilitate the involvement of investors."
However, he doubted whether it was available in the German Football League to allow majority participations which are prohibited in the Federal Republic by the 50+1 rule.
"There remains a legal risk of attracting the Bundeslaga's economic position in a European single market," Grindel said.
The former DFB chief sees the danger that "the attempt to ensure more competition balance in the Federal League will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to further tension in the masterhood".
Even an equal distribution of TV sources will not have a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borisia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
So the differences are unique among the first three groups already.
The other 15 units have an average budget of 130 million," said the 58-year-olds.
In view of the past, it feels as if it is a bit of a joke.
"Unfortunately, it has given people who have noticed this error and have been hit by the press instead of me," said Grindel about the adoption of an hour that had led to his return in April 2019.
"That's done me very well."
The present value of about 11,000 euros had been received by a Ukrainian official.
"I have started a complication disorder, and it was right to draw the consequences," Grindel said.
"With the minimum hourly gift I've been completely transparent and arglossed.
Many in the DFB knew it."
He has never "made a hero out of the gift," the 58-year-old promised.
"This may be called naiv, however this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."

Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historic costumes tops Corona
Although the great Sause in the city was missing, visitors and artists enjoyed the Rakoczý-Flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, exhibitors and organizers: The Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy-Fest.
But: Even if the great parties in the city were missing, the human masses and program points such as Saale, Rakoczy ball or pitch, many came at the Corona-compliant alternative program at their cost.
"I think we've been able to spread Rakoczy-Flair," said cur director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, you go back to the beginning of the Rakoczy Festival, as well as to the history of the festival.
Atmospheric needs

She misses the masses of people who are not belonging to Rakoczy.
However, you do not have the usual program heights, all in front of the hall are burned on the freeway, as well as the historical fixture and the final fire on the sun.
"That's already bad.
The weather would have been super fit this year," she says.

"That's more intense, otherwise we have easier," she says.
The passenger company had to do less, even though individual passengers were on the road in the park.
"We very much hope that the Ritter Square will be re-found next year," says President Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of break 2021, a Rakoczy-Reitturner would also take place again.
28 Corona cases in Spanish double list Fuenlabrada
The Spanish football double-legislator CF Fuenlabrada is becoming more and more deeply involved in the crisis because of a Corona outbreak.
Since the Newling fled from the vicinity of Madrid despite the first Corona cases on July 20th to a game in the city of A Coruña, a deep flood follows.

He did not understand the rules of Corona set up by the football league, emphasised the son of the Spanish Primer Division, Javier Tebas, as reported by the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca".
Before the departure, there were four infected persons who were all isolated and did not cooperate.
Before the flight on Monday to A Coruña, all players and team members were retested.
When the man was already in A Coruña, he was positive with five or six other team members of the Corona test.
The game was said 60 minutes before the attack, Tebas Llanas said.

Radprofii Tony Martin: Career Forwardable
Time travel specialist Tony Martin is thinking about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - The seventh-time world champion, Tony Martin, is able to move on with his race careers.
"I just cut off the framework conditions with the team, how and in what form it might go on," said the 35-year-old French General Sunday newspaper.
Martin was currently appointed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had taken into consideration before the Corona break after this year.
In the negotiations with his team it is also about the number of rents, he said.

Previously he had stood up after a storm, and the first thought had been: "Quickly return to the wheel.
Today I think as the father of a little daughter: what would it be if".
The railway profession suggested that there were clear aspects to which he was increasingly difficult to deal with.
"But it was good for me to note from the time of Corona what I had in the race and how much fun he has made me."

Argentina is free from the offer of believers
The new requirements could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires shared with us on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," said one opinion.
"While 50 percent of the children live in Argentina in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term gains of our fellow believers."
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer viable under current conditions.
Argentina therefore calls on its private fellow believers to abandon some of their claims of approximately US$66 billion (about EUR 59 billion).
If there is no agreement, the country will re-enter the country's territory.
It would be the ninth payout in the Argentine history.
Finally, the creditors had asked for higher interest on state loans and changes to certain contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine Government is determined by its latest offer and is not ready for any further conditions.
Argentina is facing a serious financial and economic crisis.
The rate of inflation lasts more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts estimate a decline in economic power by about ten percent.
At the end of May Argentina had no interest problems of $503 million and was therefore spent in a limited payout.
Professional admission - not yet private
"It's going great" - this phase takes Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first day in the Notariate in Eggenfelden.
At the end everything went very fast: in mid-May Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will experience the consequences of Lutz Feller in the wedding note setting.
Six weeks later, beginning July, the promoted jurists took up the work, the normal day-to-day business runs long on full tour.
"I still have to come, however," she explains in a conversation with the Rottaller indicator and laughs.
Of course, the short term has not been able to completely reduce the food point of Regensburg to husbandly fields, reports the bourgeois dengolfinger.
Now whether she and her husband, who is a judge at the Land Court in Regensburg, are looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least your husband has been able to apply for a short parenting period to ensure the care of the two daughters (311⁄2 and 111⁄2 years old).
In order not to get out of Regensburg every day, they also have an evening opportunity with their parents in Dingolfing, says the 39-year-olds.
Awakening in the neighbourhood, you are of course the town of Eggenfelden for a long time.
When visiting a place with her family in the past few months, she re-defined: "Marriage is a really beautiful little town".
So she was more pleased that she had done the race in the election procedure for the free position.
Also in Dr. Stephanie Kramer's professional performance, her home at Niederbayern plays a central role: after the Jura studio in Passau, she spent her reference period and the second state exam in Regensburg.
After several stations as notarassessorin, including in Rehau and the Court in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in the subterallgäu and Regensburg - at this time she also studied the promotion in labour law - in 2012 she took her first place as notary in Rottthhammünster in the countryside.
In 2016 she went to parentheses, which followed the return to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken representation services in various notary posts.
If the place in Eggenfeld had been written out because of the imminent peace of Lutz Feller, they had seen the right time for the full professional return, the 39-year-old explains.
The team of her predecessors, who will take the holiday performance in the notary, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and has also prepared a compliment for the men of the office: "It's running great!"
The fact that she can leave here on a playful run makes it easier for her to care for the upcoming release of the private food point.
In matters of children's gardens, she has already contacted a local institution.
And she touches everything as she wishes, she hopes to be able to follow her Hobby here as soon as possible - and to get to know the most beautiful jogging tracks of the rotal.
BVB Plants for Ligastart with a maximum of 15,000 visitors
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not be filled at the start of the season in the case of a fans return at least 20 percent.
"Because of the distance scheme to be enforced, we are planning for the current status of 12,000 to 15,000 visitors," said Borusia Dortmunds, director of business Carsten Cramer, the "day mirror".
Normally, the Arena is located in the city of Reviers, at Bundesliga games, some more than 81,000 visitors.
In the past season, the BVB per party lost about four million euros in the spirit games caused by the Corona pandemic.
The BVB, responsible for marketing, digitalization and internationalization, hopes that in addition to the normal visits sites, some of the approximately 4,000 sites in the area of hospitality can be opened: "Of course, it is a defeat in the office if these admissions are completely missed".
In view of the ongoing Corona crisis, everyone would be "well advised to enter a stable page length first".
"If many companies are not going well and 6.8 million people are alone in Germany in short-term work, then the need for maintenance is limited," Kramer explained.
The Dortmunder Marketing Chief praised the BVB profile for its performance profile, which should contribute to overcoming the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their score has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in Merchandising on short work".
Winzige Wonder: Early Start in Life with a few hundred grams
Almost more difficult than a pack of butter, just once three bites of blood in his whole body: It was Gabriel when he was born - he was standing exactly 273 grams.
The Bub is one of about 400 springs that are cared for annually at the Grazer Children's Clinic.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a couple - like Gabriel and his brother Raphael and Michael - are extremely light weights with not even one kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and so early that neither long, nor Darm, nor muscles are fully trained.
Her skin is sometimes so cold that she could damage the electrodes of an ECG.
And they're so windy that they wear double-hull clothing and specially made mini-windows for them.
But not so small that they wouldn't be in voice - "and how," beautiful Berndt Urlesberger.
"Even if they don't, of course, cry as loud as big babies."
When the whiteboard is turned on
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The whiteboard as a stage still lived shortly before the start of the holiday the 9th class of the Sankt-Jakobus Gymnasium in Abtsgünden.
Player Julia Sylvester from the theater of the city of Aalen presented to the students and students the production of "The Home clothes" - and by video.
In addition, students and students were able to exchange with the actor and director Winfried Tobias about the piece and the performance.
The idea of the implementation format was born from the current Corona situation.
Professor Teresa Nar enjoyed the scope of the teaching.
Even if all participants were pleased at the conclusion that the direct encounter in the theater and stage room would still offer additional trips, you can also see the potential for contact in the theater.
"If we further improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game business," stressed Director Winfried Tobias.

In 1946, they won their first Oscar in the capital of To Each His Own.
The film was in Germany under the title "Motherherz".
Three years later the title came as the best actor in William Wylers "The Heress".
A lot of recognition was also given to you as a neurotic excensor in "The Dark Spigel" and "The Snare".
Daphne du Maurier introduced her to the main film director of her novel "My Cousine Rachel" in 1952.
The piece has been a worldwide success.
With her longtime friend Bette Davis, she played in "Weigenlief for a Body".
From the wedding with the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953) the son of Benjamin went ahead.

"Road to Timmendorf": Beachvolleyball: Thule/Wickler missed Finals at Comeback
The WM-seconds Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler passed the final at the Beachvolleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they submitted in half their national teammates Nils Ehlers and Lars flights with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).

Kalbitz draft confirmed from AfD - FDP speaks of "Fiegenblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is from the view of the FDP only a "feed sheet" and does not change anything in the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the law-extreme in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the top of the Eisberges of the radicals in the AfD," said the FDP-in-depth policy of Benjamin Streets of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
The Federal Court of Justice of the AfD had confirmed the conclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Bureau had decided most in May on Saturday in Stuttgart.
Kalbitz is president of the AfD Group in Brandenburg Country Day.
"If the AfD really did go away from its party, officials such as Björn Höcke and his attachment would have been permanently excluded," said Strasser.
"However, there is no political will in the AfD, because legal extremism is still part of the party."
Similarly, CSU Secretary-General Markus Blume said: "Andreas Kalbitz is now shut down, doesn't say anything and doesn't change anything," he said the "World on Sunday."
"There is a lot more to be said about how many franetic supporters are a law-extreme medium in the AfD."
Flowers suggest that the AfD will be re-countryed again in the future by less than five percent.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments have been numbered."
Kalbitz was one of the leaders of the official "flying flight" between the Thuringer AfD country and the Group's President Björn Höcke; the Constitution protects the flow as a "secured right-extremist effort".
In May, the AfD Bundes took Kalbitz out of the party.
On the basis of this, Kalbitz did not indicate an earlier membership at his party's entry into the prohibited "HDJ" and the Republicans.
Kalbitz is a member of the HDJ.
The President of the Left Group of Brandenburg's Landing Day, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Court of Justice has nothing to do with the character of the AfD: "The Wolf has only frozen credits.
The AfD remains a right-hand party whether with or without a calbitz."
Neither will the Federal Party be weakened by this decision nor the right to fly.
"The mannover of the Meuthen troops is transparent.
You want to take another look at the constitutional protection and try to get through the radar," said Walter.
"The AfD is not the spirit that she calls out.
A draft of resignation does not change yet," commented Mr. Erik Stonen, Secretary-General of the Brandenburg SPD, in the case of Kalbitz.
"He has been holding the AfD Country Alliance and the Group to this day to their right leader."
The legal representation of Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
On Saturday, he will be brought before the Federal Court of Justice in civil law.
Nordsee-Windparks deliver good 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year 11,51 terawattt hours of electricity was stored in the network.
This is well 21% more than in the same period of the previous year, shared by the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transfer of the North Sea Stream to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity network.
Other 2,22 terawatt hours (TWh) flow have been stored on the Ossetia, which is not part of the Tennet network area.
In total, the wind current from North and Oscee comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The winders on the sea thus make up almost 19 percent of the total wind current in Germany; these are about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind parks provide for higher production capacity
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy is based on higher production capacities, as new wind parks have gone online in the past 12 months.
If the 1270 wind-powered works in the North Sea were to run all at the same time with full power, they could generate censorship 6.7 Gigawatt Stream.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; it is said to be tenet at 7.1 Gigawatt.
By 2030, it will rise to 17 gigawattts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the development of offshore network connections," said Tennet-Director Tim Meyerürgens.
In reality, wind parks can also not extend their capacity to sea, but they reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day in this year is January 2nd, when the Nordsea Windparks created more than six Gigawatt Stream.
In the average, the North Sea windmills produce about 2.5 to 3.0 Gigawattt Stream, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could provide nearly seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by Leipzig's artist Christian Bold in the gallery of Gmünder Kunstverein.
That was almost a little anniversary for 130.
Birthday of Gmünder Kunstvereins: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works of Leipzig's artist Christian Bold broke the usual frame after the Corona break.
Many more art friends than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the president of the art company, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent delivered the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern corner.
North of the gallery was engaged by the "Sandtogether".
Freital: Windbergfest for Corona
The Windberg Festival will not take place this year.
The city of Freittal has rejected the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had visited this city festival.
"We have indeed not made this decision easy for us and, in awareness of how difficult it is economically for those involved, until the last minute," said Oberburger Master Uwe Rumberg (parteilos).
"But ultimately, we are responsible here for the health of thousands of people."
Because if tens of thousands had been streamed into the country and into the castle, minimum levels, hygiene rules and contact follow-up could not be maintained in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that they wouldn't have stayed much by a folk party.
In addition, the organisation and monitoring need would rise irresponsibly by a multiphase.
Rumberg was disappointed for the next year.
Then the city celebrates its 100-year-old existence, including the Winterberg Festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the day of the Saxons from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressur-Olympiager Value not to be hit in acrylates
Acrylates - The six-time Olympicser Isabell Werth was the excellent knight at the Dressur tournament in the Austrian acrylates.
The 51-year-olds from Rheinberg came to four wins on the weekend at four starts.
After she had won a great prize every Sunday at the Grand Prix Special and in the Church, she was not to be beaten on Sunday.
At the 15-year-old Stute Weihgleld, Werth spent his special day on the Abegglens against the Austrian ruler Victoria Max-Tourer.
In the church, the Germans also appeared on Quantaz on Saturday, 34 years ago, as their 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Tourer.
Werths Siegerpferd Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The world's most successful Dressurereiter is to establish the decade-old hangst in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz it was the first bridge at all.
The first tournament in Akleiten three weeks ago, Werth had won all the important four tests.
The last of the three international tournaments is planned there from 14 to 16 August.
Future More Flights in Worms
The Wormser University continues to run: The "DFS Deutsche Air Insurance" is a professor of Air Traffic Management.
A corresponding contract between the University and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was first concluded for three years and began in 2021.
With the professor, the possibility is to enable the study to begin not only in the summer but also in the winter semester.
So many students can be trained twice as many as before.
At the same time, the capacity will be equally charged both at the university and at the Air Safety Academy of the DFS.
The DFS will be consulted at the university in the establishment and occupation of the professors.
Since 2019 I have been attending the University
Since the summer of 2019, the first students in their training to fly to the University of Worms in the study Air Traffic Management.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far the experiences of the DFS are very positive, the benefits of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and lotena training is a key factor in increasing the attractiveness of the lotenbeam.
"In these times, the promotion is not easy for us.
However, we are determined that air transport will recover and grow longer and longer.
In order to be able to carry out our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified staff," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Schürle, president of the DFS business leader at the signing of the contract.
"For the DFS, the Foundation Professor is a secure investment in the future, which will provide the fleets with a broad, well-known knowledge base for the long term.
We therefore continue to work well together with the university and maintain our attractiveness as employers at the same time."
This also underlines Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, president of the University of Worms: "The Foundation Professor creates an important bridge between science and economy.
With it we would like to join the existing cooperation with the German Air Traffic Management DFS as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor Study."
The confidence of the German flight insurance is equal to the motivation and obligation of the University of Worms to further develop their teaching and research skills in the future fields of air transport.
In applying for the flights tomorrow, the University and the first Foundation Professor could place very special highlights and innovative focus on their students.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary of the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, stressed: "The University of Worms has a unique feature in air transport in the Rhineland Pfalz.
The current signing of the Cooperation Agreement strengthens the profile of the University".
Rescue servicer on the A 45
About 30 minutes the A45 highway was completely closed on Saturday towards Aschaffenburg, since after a traffic accident the rescue driver was in use.
A 76-year-old ran out with a Ford against 12.40 in the course of Alzenau-Mitte in the curve just outside and landed on the lead plane.
By the spring, the front bays were dissolved, the driver experienced slight injuries in the face and had to be taken to a hospital.
The injuries of the 72-year-old beifahrerin were provided by the Notarzt and the patient was thrown into a hospital in connection with the rescue switch.
But now the police are saying there is no life-threatening threat.
The damaged vehicle, where an injury of about EUR 2000 was caused, had to be removed.
Heil wants to examine other sectors by fishing industry
The Corona crisis brought the status of parts of the fishing industry back to light.
Law enforcement is just ahead of time.
But are they right - and will it remain?
Federal Minister of Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to examine other sectors in line with the strict rules against fraud in the fishing industry.
"We will be closed to the industry and then taken appropriate measures for the sector, if necessary," said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers have already warned to restrict labour contracts in general.
After the massive Corona outbreak in the northern Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Bureau wants to decide a law of Heil this Wednesday.
No foreign personnel should be allowed to use them for slaughter, torture and meat processing.
This should prohibit the use of contractors and employees.
Mr Ingo Kramer said: "Finger is away from a general restriction on labour contracts and employment, if he does not want to leave the economy entirely".
Work contracts, for example, for large areas of handwork, construction industry and plant building are the basis for their value creation in customers.
"The individuals' pleas cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban contracts everywhere in the German economy."
Work contracts are meaningful.
"If an industrial operation employs a trader to build a security facility, it is a very normal business contract."
The German meat industry is subject to a ban on contracts and leases alone in its manufacturing industry.
It would not be clear why, in the case of the distribution and packaging of cheeses, other work law should be applied in the future than in the case of Wurst, as the New Osnabrück newspaper (Samsday) reports in an opinion on the draft law.
At a ban, then, the consumer price would rise by 10 to 20 per cent per kilo and product.
A number of Eastern European employees from business companies worked in the industry after the results of a study of the NRW Labour Protection Administration in 16 hours a day.
Often they didn't have a break.
Loan was reserved for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often misable.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law had already entered into force for the meat sector in 2017.
However, through "strick constructions" they have been transformed.
"Now you have to be thoroughly raised."
The politician announced: "In the Labour Protection Act we want to decide at the end of July, measures not only concern the meat sector - for example, higher labour protection checks or clear criteria for Community accommodation".
The draft proposal includes amendments to the Law on the Protection of the Rights of Workers in the Animal Health and the Labour Protection Act.
Brandenburg's Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) has more extensive controls as necessary.
"I would like to be able to do more control in many areas of supervision: food control, animal protection, everything possible, for example animal transport," Nonnemaker said on Sunday in the RBB's "Brandenburg news".
However, more staff should be needed for more controls.
Three deaths at the end of ultralight aircraft in Germany
When an ultralight aircraft was fired at a multiple family home in Wesel in the German Federal Republic of North Rhine-Westphalia, three people were killed after the police said.
A child had been hurt easily.
Two other people were saved from the accident, said a speaker of the circle-leading Wesel.
In the crash site, a random screen was found, like the police.
The "Rheinic Post" reported on eye tools, before the crash, the aircraft was assembled with a helicopter.
At home, it's a single or double family home.
More details were not first known.
Comfortly run by Frankfurt Opernplatz
One week after the openings in Frankfurt, the upper part of the opera is also peaceful at night on Sunday.
Finally, a few thousand people stayed on the spot, but left it about 1 hour before the start of the stop.
The police had been using many officers since the early evening, and a larger police service was available throughout the city.
For the first time this week, from Wednesday night there was a ban on operating on the operating site, where it was a week ago.
Police had been attacked out of the crowd with bottles.
At least five officers were injured after police investigations, and several police vehicles were damaged.
The night of Saturday was also quiet.
Car overload: Young woman in accident at Bundesstraße 83 in Hofgeismmar seriously injured
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old was injured on Sunday at 13.25 a.m.
She was taken to the Clinic Cassel.
With heat cameras, the firefighters were looking for potential drivers.
According to the police on the Bundesstraße 83 in the direction of her apartment Humme, she was on her way when her car came out of the train for an unexplained reason and several times passed.
To save the disappointment, the fireman had to clear the roof of the Pkw.
Since it was not clear whether anyone else was in the car, the adjacent Maisfeld was searched by the driver with a heat camera.
The Drohnen staff from Warburg, which also works with thermal cameras, was also ordered for the person's search.
However, the use forces did not find anyone among the high maize plants.
The severe injuries were carried with the rescue car into the Casteler Clinic for further care.
Nearly 50 use forces of the Firearm Hofgeismmar, Humme and Schöneberg were present.
The federal street was closed for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin Master in Italy
Turin - After a successful door by Christian Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian masterhood for the ninth time in series.
The man around the fifth world football team made the total 36. Scututto of the history of the association with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday at the home game against Sampdoria Genua.
Ronaldo met 1:0 in the middle of the day.
With 83 points, Turin, which is no longer the last-founded former national player Sami Khedira, is no longer able to defeat two days before the season of the A series.
The table width between Milan is seven points back.
Juventus, despite optical overheating in the first half of his life, met Ronaldo for a free choice with the last action.
An example of Miralem Pjanic was evaluated by the 35-year-olds from the border directly with a flag committee (45.+7).
In contrast to the now offensive guests, Ronaldo was also involved at 2:0, after his shock Federico Bernardeschi (67).
As a result, there was no clear but decisive success.
The latte, which was cast in the 89. minutes, only Ronaldo himself should have had the right impression of the Torräger value.
"It is complicated to stay mentally and physically on ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are rare, and the moment changes very easily," said Coach Maurizio Sarri after 1:2 at Udine Calcio on Thursday.
In particular, the spiritual creation of his player was great, said the Juve-Coach.
Because of the decline, the tournaments had not been able to make the mastership perfect.
Finally, Juve had to consider, above all, the weakness of the competitors.
Because in the eleven parties before the game on Sunday, the Sarri men were only five wins.
Whether Ronaldo will still be king of torture is questionable.
Because during the Portuguese superstar up to 31 towers, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobil after his three-pack at 5:1 (1:1) of the fourth lazio Rome at Hellas Verona has already 34 hits on his account - as many as Robert Lewandowski urged to win the FC Bayern.
The current Juve-Profi Gonzalo Higuaín is the record in Italy.
The Argentina achieved 36 towers for the SSC Neapel in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "Old Lady" of the Italian football is waiting for the next title chance.
Juventus is at the end of the League Championships, however, on August 7th against Olympic Lyon, a 0:1 game plan is required to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o. round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would be expected to be the enemy.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car rentals
Stuttgart - All the crimes and court cases that have been threatened in spite of the fact that car drivers in the streets of Baden-Württemberg continue to gas: In the past year and in the first four months of this year, the police have already registered more than 250 illegal drivers in the south-west.
There are no comparisons for the years before, but the racers are making further work of the judicial authorities: In 2018, a total of 155 investigation procedures were conducted for illegal racing, 252 were already in progress until the beginning of June 151.
In the course of the race, it was less about organised events, as the Ministry of the Interior responded to a request from the Landday SPD.
In most cases, drivers would have acted against each other or they would have taken the flight before the police - it would also be shown as an illegal race.
German men between the ages of 18 and 60 are particularly interested in taxes.
113 Penalty of money - 15 times a week
Only in relatively few cases will the racer be exposed and also prayed for the case: According to the Ministry of the Interior, 113 penalties have been committed in total since 2018 and 15 sentences have been issued.
However, there are no percentage points that the number of illegal authors is actually increasing.
More than ever, other car drivers responded to the various tragic accidents and processes of the past years more sensitive than before and often showed up, a ministerial speaker said.
In Rasern, the bus is especially popular 8. The road is always smoothed by car drivers there to get a place and use the free route for a race.
In the past August, a dozen drivers were raised near Churchheim under the roof, three months before there were even 18 drivers on the A8 at Merlingen.
A81 is the most popular "Rinnstrecke"
On the A81, the police record even more rent than on any other federal car.
With a temperature, the racer will be tried to break out on the particular section between the angles and the gears.
The most highly priced and popular sports and luxury rosaries often have Swiss brands because the drivers are being reduced to race to Germany because of the high penalties for fast driving and car racing in neighboring countries.
For the SPD, the temperature cannot be reduced in a few ways: "With a general temperature of 130 hours, we would create this problem on the road from the body," says Martin River, the transport expert of the SPD Country Day Group.
"The chassis for Racer would be significantly higher if you weren't here and there were still legal miles of 200 hours and more on the way."
According to a statement or image campaigns, Rivera says less: "If anyone in such a way decides on all rules and not only his own life, but also the life of other traffic operators is almost at stake."
ADAC requires stronger police coverage
On the contrary, the ADAC is not able to say, "We are going to make sure that Racer does not break off the Tempolimites," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It will require additional and more stringent controls on the tracks concerned.
Not rare is the result of the high-tourish force measurements of pain and the following severe severity: from January 2019 to April 2020, three people die in the race, two of which are not involved in a night crash in Stuttgart in the city and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men were supposed to have delivered an auto race in November.
One of the vehicles came out of the street, ran against a garden wall, and stayed on the side of the 18-year-old trailer.
21 other people were injured during the race of the past two years.
However, severe penalties are not necessary in the view of Interior Minister Thomas Stroubl: "The legal need for action to punish illegal motor vehicles is not seen," says the Ministry of Interior's paper.

Number of work agency: 900 suspects on short-term use
Berlin - The Federal Agency for Labour (BA) is following its own statement of approximately 900 suspects of abuse at short-term pay.
"This is at more than 880,000 companies that have shown short work very little," said Daniel Terzenbach, the Executive Director of the "Frankfurter General newspaper".
At the beginning of the Corona crisis, very many companies had asked for short work, the BA had to react quickly.
The test usually lasts up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available to us in this so-called phase.
So we're going to look more closely at the conclusions.
I'm sure there'll be some more.
We are not ships there and have a long breath."
Signs of abuse often come from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, use the BA analysis tools to identify abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is prepared for a possible insolvent valve in the brain.
"Will there be more insolvency than in the previous year?
The estimates are different, but we are fighting for the case and are already training our employees in the labour agencies for processing insolvency claims."
The numbers are still inseparable, said Terzenbach.

The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, as the authorities reported in Linz.
More than 100 results were still out at night.
Many of the infected young practitioners are currently in tourism, but at least one holiday has been tested positively.

Several rescue cars brought them to a nearby hospital.
North Korea, border city according to Corona forecast
North Korea has so far seen a "lighting success" in its own actions to reverse the Coronavirus.
Now the country's first reporting a suspect case.
Because of a first official Corona accident in the country, North Korea has completely eliminated a large city from fear of a catastrophe.
Despite the strictest epidemiological countermeasures in the past six months, "the worst virus could have been included in the country", the state media reported.
For the region around the border city of Kaesong, the emergency has been postponed.
The Communist leadership calls out the highest alert level.
If the suspected case were to be confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the country in which it was closed.
Nordkora had not previously registered a single infection following its own data and described its reverse measures as "lighting success".
The data were confused abroad.
The symptoms of disease were subsequently identified in a "surrey" report, which passed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19th.
The person has moved to South Korea three years ago and has now returned to the border.
For the cross-border extension within the four kilometres and in most parts of the military buffer zone, there was no confirmation from South Korea at first.
However, according to reports from the National News Agency Yonhaap, South Korea has seen the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
Some people are being investigated for it.
In North Korea, on Saturday, due to the suspect's suspicion, the police office of the Workers' Party, led by Machthaber Kim Jong Un.
The "hazardous situation in Kaesong could solve a deadly and destructive disaster".
Kim has already arranged for the Friday as a precautionary measure, "Kaesong to block completely and isolate each region and region from others," continued.
The person concerned as well as all people in Kaesong who had contact with her had been put under quarantine.
The Party’s Central Military Commission should then investigate the "outbreak" and the conduct of the responsible military unit and, where appropriate, remove severe punishment.
There are estimated to be about 300,000 people living in Kaesong.
Stimulation before the Council: Eastern and Eastern protection are still ahead of the big summer break for discussion
"In addition to environmental issues, the members of the community will also vote on the construction plan for the Great Urban Development East project", which is now part of the urban press release for the next community meeting on Tuesday, 28 July, at 16.30 a.m. in the large hall of the Congress Centre Pforzheim.
In particular, the assessment of the eastern city will be discussed until the end of the dispute.
The majority of these are very close, and in each committee, they even decline to be present.
An appeal from the economy (building, real estate, trade and IT), which was developed from citizenship and then from management and community council, is now no longer prepared after almost ten years, has been criticised by the project against Reinhard Klein as "extreme parliamentary opposition", "non-speculation", "speculation" and "conscious fraud".
"All I want to know is better," said a boy who has belonged to the Council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim Civil List.
In fact, he would be after reading the treaties in this position: "I know what I'm talking about".
The rise will make it easier for the city to rescind for €8.5 million for technical advice from the city administration, which is convinced of its small existence.
The city will be completely different from the forecasting in the Council and on the side of the sponsors from the economy.
The city was designed by its own power and not by an investor: It was his plan B. One day after a small day, the FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also rejected the project, presented an alternative concept.
It is also essential to ensure that the technical council, the opening of the castle, the renting of the ex-thele for administrative areas and a smaller urban design in the ideal case with local carriers.
Play the central role of environmental themes
In addition, environmental themes will play a central role.
In this way, the Council will vote, inter alia, on the learning plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzhem population from health injuries, caused by road traffic, including a number of temporary reductions.
In a press release, the German transport club welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political authorities in the city are not guilty of doing so because they have only contributed to the massive increase in traffic and thus to the noise of the VCD.
The Council also agrees on the participation of the city of the Energy and Climate Protection Agency Pforzheim/Encrey.
In addition, the agenda for the accession to the State's Baden-Württemberg climate protection package, the renewal of parental contributions to urban childcare facilities, and the application for inclusion in the Smart City development of the Federation.
Citizens are welcome, but Corona protection measures must be taken.
Tim Roomman starts with a lot of delay in the new season
Tim Zimmermann starts with almost half a year delay on 31 July in his premier season at ADAC GT Masters.
Before the league of the super sports cars can take up the regular operation, the first tests will now take place.
In particular, for Zimmermann, his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 was better known.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from taking his first service in the new Lamborghini Huracan by Grasser Racing.
Under special hygiene conditions this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargener turned his first round on the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiums in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different than the Porsche from the presage," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go different into the curves.
But it has really made a lot of fun."
Roomman also had fun with Steinjn Schothorst, with which he will share his orange sport car in the GT Masters.
Despite his first 25 years of experience in GT sport, the Netherlands was able to help his new teammates in many things.
"I am not a beginner in motor sports, but every new series also presents new challenges with myself," says Roomman.
"Stein and I understand us very well, and we have also made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also issue his first race.
From July 31st, the 33 super sports cars will be hit by the noise.
A roomman who is one of the 15 serials, however, knows the route.
2015 he was the last guest in the motorcycle room.
"It worked fast and I had to get used to the street a little bit," said Zeppelin, who started for the Friedrichshafen community.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passports that you have to deal with optimally in order to be fast."
As soon as roomman is real, it comes out in two weeks.
"The teams, of course, poker a little at the tests," he says.
"At last, however, we are very happy and happy on the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the record of a hard-pressed calendar.
By the beginning of November, seven races were held.
The moment is that no visitors will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at Nürburgring, ex-formel-1 pilot Niko Hülkenberg will be caught in the GT-Lenkrad.
British Minister of Transport of Quarantane
According to press reports, the Minister of Transport of the country was informed of the decision by the British Government to send Spanish passengers two weeks after their return.
At the same time, Grant Shapps is currently in Spain on the holiday, while his colleagues have decided to take the action on Saturday.
Because of the increasing Corona numbers in Spain, the office in London is strictly the country from the list of countries from which entry is possible without a quadrant plane.
The new arrangement applies today, Sunday, so that Shapps will also have to return to Quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also introduced Quarantane measures for returnees.
But the arrangement applies to those who are only on Friday's holiday, only from Saturday, August 1st, and have not been introduced by night.
Spain still applies to Austria as one of the "safe countries" for which no Quarantine is required in Austria.
"Many ministers should have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarter of Spain will be attached to a holiday holiday," commented the Labour Officer Diane Abbot.
"But obviously no one's been able to tell Grant Shapps a decision."
Within a month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the release of the strict exit brakes, the number of infections in the country has risen again.
Virologists are primarily responsible for the nightlife for the new expansion.
Spain is one of Britain's favorite holiday countries.
The British Government is currently exempt from unnecessary travel to Spain, which is the exception to the Canaries and Baleares, especially popular in British vacationers.
To date, more than 272,000 infections have been recorded in Spain with the new Coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths.

Call Evacuated to warn
"Each Hurrikan is a huge challenge," said Abbott in the Houston Chronicle newspaper.
With a view to the storm storm in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and will be even stronger if it is thought that it will fall through a region that is the strongest area of Covid-19 affected by the state."
According to Johns Hopkins University, about 5,000 people died alone in Texas following the Corona pandemic.
Abbott called people who had to leave their homes to be careful.
They should practice, "which we used to do," not mistakenly, for example, the behavior of masks, said the Governor, according to the CBS sender.
It's important to keep all the distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms were also provided in some places.
In addition, it should be tested on Corona in note rooms.
First, damages were reported only from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Re-repetition of storm warning
With wind speeds of up to 150 km per hour, "Hanna" was reported to have authorities on the island of Padre Island immediately before the technical coast on land.
The tropenstorm was first exalted to the Hurrikan of the lowest level.
For the coastal section of Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm warning was first issued and was later re-arrived.
The authorities expected a deficit, while "Hanna" continued to move to the mainland and to support the north-east Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurrikan "Douglas" was on the night of Sunday with wind speeds of about 150 kilometres per hour in the direction of Hawaii.
However, the Hurrikan Center expected him to continue to give up.
The forecast should be on Sunday (the third time) near the largest Hawaiian islands - then as a storm near below the Hurrikan shell.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA was expected this year to be an overactive hurricane season following a May forecast.
From June to the end of November, with up to ten Hurrikans, which could become up to six very strong storms, the authorities had declared.
On average, there are six Hurrikans per year over the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
In view of the climates available and the higher water temperature in Atlantic and Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 per cent, which is a mean only 10 per cent.
US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government was closely watching the storm and was in contact with the federal states concerned.

Formula 1 requires a special rule to show her world master
Since the required number of continents cannot be threatened, the FIA must improvise to grant the WM title.
All U.S. racers were dismissed.
Current calendar will always be more specific
The calendar for the current formula-1 season is in progress.
Three more runners were added during the week to the Grand Prix, which was confirmed by ten so far.
In October, Nürburgring was to be carried out in Germany and the Portuguese Portimão.
In the first November, Lewis Hamilton and Co. fought at the Italian tradition line in Imola on the WM points.
This includes the 2020 race calendar after the current stage of 13 runs.
"We are pleased that we continue to make great progress in the completion of our 2020 plan," said Formula-1-Boss Chase Carey.
In general, in this extraordinary season 15-18 races are to be completed in the Royal Class of Motorsport.
In conclusion, Formula 1 wants to end its season in Asia.
The final run calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Media reports that were already officially posted in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December may still be available in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Rules require running on three continents
The regulation of Formula 1 requires at least three continents for the award of World Heritage.
Even if, as planned at present, only two continents are threatened, there should be a world master.
By means of a special rule, the FIA intends to issue the title under appeal to "extraordinary circumstances" due to the Coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional season start in Australia in March had to be cut short due to the ongoing corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not a subject.
In addition, formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Absence in Brazil’s Crisis · Global Voices
Because of the tense situation, the races in Canada, the United States, Mexico and Brazil will not take place.
"We are happy to be with them again in the next season," said Carey.
The statement of the US race was especially critical in Brazil: "The statement did not surprise us, but the reasons for it cannot be accepted," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
The number of infections in the São Paulo area was significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams, not wanting to travel to Brazil, would also not justify a statement.
The necessary security measures have been prepared.
Greta Thunberg: Bad view against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her encounter with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was in the famous lateight show by Stephen Colbert per video shot at a guest and was interviewed what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
The air conditioner Greta Thunberg was a video player for guests in a popular US-Latin show.
She spoke of, among other things, her struggle against the powers of the world.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "bad look" when she met Donald Trump.
New York City - In the past two years, climateist Greta Thunberg has been paying attention to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she talks in a well-known lateight show about her plans in the future and her encounter with US President Donald Trump at the UN Climate Summit last year.
Lateight Moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your mission and conducted a longer interview with Sweden.
In this they not only speak about their fight against climate change but also about their conflict with the world's powers.
"There are some things that have surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to put the focus away from the climate crisis," she said.
"All of organised Hass campaigns to smoke, just because a group of children is on the street," she said.
State leaders and leading politicians, who in social media are either spying on them or even trying to get them to move, find them "slow", as they show the reactions, "because they have no other answer to it".
It was particularly interesting at the end of the interview, when Greta Thunberg was addressed on a famous scene, in which she, President Trump, had a bitter look later.
At the UN-Klimagifel 2019 in New York, for which the Atlantic Activist was sailing, she was caught up with a strong look at the cameras and has been seen by countless people on the Internet since.
From the short clip, a GIF was created, thus an animated image, which eventually became one of the most commonly used images for Trump genius.
But what did 17-year-olds at this time think about the US Presidents?
In answer to Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she answered briefly and wondered: "To be honest, I believe that no further explanation is required."
With the sharp answer, the experienced satiriker Colbert had probably not calculated and soon disappeared laughing from the picture.
With her "How dare you?"-saying about the principles of climate protection, she had many in mind at the climate conference.

Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a back road: After an exciting climb with Fleetwood Mac, it was suddenly lifted up and then slowly resurfaced.
Now the Bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Generic guitarist, drugs-junkie, cult expert: The founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
If he had died peacefully at the age of 73 years, family members shared an official opinion on Saturday, another opinion would be announced for the next day.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton admired Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction from a "monumental loss" for all former and present members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the longest legendary band in 1967 in London, until today his famous instrumental hit "Albatross".
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") is like a trail.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a shocking rise - the band celebrated its greatest success but then without it.
It should have been given under other terms because Green wanted to spend all the profits of the group for well-being purposes.
He started to appear in large arms and with a big cruzifix.
Psychological problems should also have played a role.
Three years after the foundation, Green left the 1970 band.
It was followed by a social decline.
The bluesrock guitarist is under drug abuse and schizophrenia, as reported by biographies.
For a long time, Green was treated in the psychiatry.
During a large part of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He was going to live on the road for a while, working as a peacekeeper and spent a long time in an Israeli Kibuz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working family in the London city of Bethnal Green.
For years he has been interested in US blue musicians, such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At age 11, he learned the first guitar lessons.
At the age of 15, the teen began playing professional guitars and five years later the chance to be lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners on the stage.
Shortly thereafter he was hired as substitute for his Idol Eric Clapton in the Blues Breakers.
In the middle of the Blues-Boom, Green founded in summer 1967 Fleetwood Mac together with his Blue Breaker colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green protected the first number-1 hit in winter 1968/69 and catapulted it to the top of the British music scene.
But the fast rise soon showed his shadow pages: Green did not strengthen the media environment, his experiments with the drug LSD were always more extreme.
The life between music and search he later commented in an interview: "The worst thing that happens to me in my life is drugs - the best thing was to land a number-1 hit".
Toward the end of the decade, Green came in 1979 with a remarkable follow-up with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac therefore jumped without it in a new formation on a success path.
In 1977 her album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
In spite of various small solo results, Green did not have a larger comeback until 1996 with a group of friendly musicians again.
The British Daily Telegraph then spoke of a Rockstar who returned to the earth.
Free of drugs, Green released with Peter Green Splinter Group some albums until the band was dissolved in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blue legend - and with his soft sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
