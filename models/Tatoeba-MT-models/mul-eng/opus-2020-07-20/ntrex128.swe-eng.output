AM in Wales is anxious to "be like a puckon"
Some AM, members of the Wales National Assembly, are confused about a proposal to amend their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of Wales).
The proposal will be followed by plans to amend the name of the National Assembly to the Wales Parliament.
AM over the entire political spectrum is concerned about being generous.
An AM for Labor said his group was worried because "it's breaking with Twp and Pwp".
For readers who cannot walse: Twp means dumb on walse and pwp means bad.
An AM for Plaid said that the group in general was "missful" and has proposed other options.
A conservative waller said his group is "open" for the name, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context W is expressed in the equivalent of the U in English in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drawing up legislation on the name, said: "The final decision for which members of the assembly are to be called is so clear to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which had strong support to call the Wales Parliament assembly.
As regards the title of AM, the Commission proposed the Welsh Parliament Members (members of Wales Parliament) or the WMP, but MWP received the highest aid in a public consultation.
AM clearly proposes other options, but the problem of reaching a consensus may cause problems for Presidenting Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the change within a few weeks.
The amendment legislation also includes other changes to the way the collection works, including rules for disqualification of an AM and the design of the committee system.
AM shall vote on what they shall be called when they debate the legislation.
Macedonia implements a referendum on the change in the name of the country
On Sunday, the vote will be taken if they are to change the country's name to "The Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The populace is an attempt to end a dispute which has taken place for several years with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
The Act has long stressed that the name of the neighbouring country represents a challenge in its territory and has repeatedly protested against its attempt to become a member of the EU and NATO.
President Gjorge Ivanov of Macedonia objected to the referendum on the change of name and said he would withdraw from the outcome.
But the people's advocates, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change in name is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The hours in St. Martin's silence when the churches in Harlem are in trouble
"Old people I talk to say there was a bar and a church on every corner before," said Mr. Adams.
"Now there's neither."
He said it's understandable that the kids disappear.
"People are surrounded in other ways now for the time," he said.
"Just isn't like the area's living room anymore, your people go on a regular basis."
The current churches are concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not suffice as long as the leaders are waiting and that they will "bet or later they will be caught on the route again".
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartments with properties filled with people who do not help the remaining churches.
"The absolute majority of people buying apartments in buildings will be white," he said. "This will lead to the closure of all churches, as those who move into apartments will probably not become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white collections before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolisan Community 1870, St. Martin's one decade later.
The original white methodist assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation with a church nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black assembly led by pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a shoplift of stores on 125th Street, a shopping gang in Harlem, who refused to hire or transport black people.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but when Pastor Johnson's Assembly planned the renovation, they also built the clock.
Pastor David Johnson, the father of Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's, called the famous music game "the hour of the poor."
The expert who played the watch game in July had another name for it: "A cultural tax" and "an extraordinary historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world's first watch game played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the largest watch game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather did not replace St. Martin's.
The events of the last months at St. Martin's is a complicated history with architects and entrepreneurs – some that are attributed to the church’s academics, others of the Episcopal Foundation.
The Church Father – the governing body of the congregation consisting of the members – wrote to the Constitution in July and expressed concern that the Constitution would "try to transfer the cost" to the Church Father, although the Church Father had not been involved when the Constitution was instituted by architects and entrepreneurs.
Some members of the assembly complained about a lack of transparency from the constitution.
He's hurting 13 years of age who covers himself in California
In October, a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark who died after hunger in California on the first day of the summer season, according to officials.
The attack took place immediately before 7:00 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had spent half an hour with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and shared it with a group of others to get him out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy was just happy to have found a dog, but then he realized that the boy cried, "I've been bitten!"
"I've been bitten!"
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he noticed that the whole key had been locked up.
"I called everyone to get out of the water. "It's a shark in the water!" Hammel told.
The boy's flight to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is described as critical.
It's obvious what kind of hair it was.
The bathroom guard Larry Giles told the media that a shark had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been determined that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim had traumas on his upper chest.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours by investigation and security reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 haards in the area, but that most of them are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's entry into the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with similar beauty gifts with beauty specialists.
As part of a considerable push into the UK’s beauty market at £2.8 billion, which continues to grow despite the fall in the fashion and household market, the larger beauty gains will be tested in 11 shops over and implemented in several shops next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of the fast-paced attempt to fill the halls previously raised by TV devices, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's said they are thinking of double their beauty offer to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current offers from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get larger spaces with marked areas, such as in stores like Boots.
The store chain also launchs its botique brand so that most of the products are vegan – which more young customers require.
In addition, perfume seller Fragrance Shop will test status in two Sainsbury's shops – the first stand opened in Croydon in southern London last week and the second opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and trend to buy smaller quantities of food every day in local stores means that fast shopping needs to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, VD for Sainsbury's, has said that their shops will look more like prostitutes in an attempt to fight cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl with more services and products than food.
Sainsbury's has had Argos status in hundreds of shops and has also obtained a number of Habitats status since they bought both chains two years ago, which they say has increased the sale of food and made the acquisition more profitable.
The previous attempt to give the beauty and apothecary sections of the quickly bought failed.
Sainsbury's tested cooperation with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but the cooperation was closed after a discussion on how the revenue from the Boots sales would be distributed in the fast shop.
The new strategy will come after Sainsbury's sales of its apothecary business with 281 stores to Celesio, owned by the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million three years ago.
They claim that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an increased supply of luxurious skin care products, including brands like La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of Sainsbury's business, said: "We have given our beauty gains a new look and a new feeling to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in highly trained staff who can advise customers.
Our brand offers have been designed to meet all needs, and with an attractive environment in smooth places, we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way to shop."
Peter Jones "responsive" after Holly Willoughby pulls out of the deal at £11 million.
Dragon's Den-star Peter Jones is "responsive" because TV representative Holly Willoughby pulls out a deal of £11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not hide with their brand Truly, with leisure clothes and accessories.
Their activity has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
This morning's representative, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons The Star Peter Jones angry by withdrawing from their luxurious lifestyle brands in the last minute – to focus on their new agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “raising” at a exciting meeting at his business summit in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday when his new contract – value up to £1.5 million – included that he no longer focused on their brand Truly, with leisure clothes and accessories.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and double Willoughby's estimated assets of £11 million were expected.
When Willoughby, 37, announced that she was leaving Truly on Instagram a flight from Jones to one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was clearly Holly's primary priority.
It would be her long-term future for the coming years.
Her decision to get out of shock all those who were involved.
No one could believe it happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods that are ready to be sold at the high-quality apartment in Marlow."
Experts believe that this Morning representative's decision to withdraw could cost the company several million because of considerable investments in everything from kitchens and light to clothing and the risk of further delays in launch.
And it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Trebor's uncle Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Cap 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role as president in March.
The couple are semestering together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as "I'm a Celebrity" on ITV.
A source near Jones said last night, "We don't comment on his business."
Tufft talk "and then we became loved"
He was ashamed that the media would criticize him for a comment that some would consider to be "unvalued a president" and that he was so positive about North Korea's leaders.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a "new voice":
"I haven't given up anything."
He said Kim wanted another meeting after Trup dropped their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear weapons equipment.
But negotiations on nuclear weapons equipment have been ongoing.
More than three months after the meeting in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told the leaders of the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "responsive response" from the United States after North Korea's first downturn.
He noted that the United States continued sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his followers.
"It's going well with North Korea," he said.
"We were on our way to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a sovereign relationship."
He said his attempt to improve Kim's relationship has had a positive outcome – an end to rocket tests, free surrender and the rest of American soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to pray as a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this full-packed arena, we would have about 200 people here," Trump said and pointed to the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake damage in Indonesia, hundreds of doors
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lomboks had lost their homes, it was not listed as an exception, which was required for international assistance.
"In many cases, they have been very clear that they do not ask for international help, which makes it all complicated," said Ms. Sumbung.
Redeemed children collect a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear whether foreign personnel can work there.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesman for the Natural Disasters Agency, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to determine whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in assistance work.
In view of Indonesia's ongoing earthquakes, the country is still largely unprepared for the anger of nature.
It has been built in the Aceh tsunami, but they are rare on other coastal lines.
The absence of a tsunami in Palu, although a warning had been issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even under perfect conditions, it is a challenge to travel between many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics more complex.
A hospital ship that has attached to Lombok to deal with land-use victims is on the way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on the promise to improve Indonesia's narrow infrastructure in its campaign of election and has spent large sums on roads and trains.
However, the lack of funding has led to Mr Jokos' administration before the next year's elections.
Mr. Joko is also impressed by the four-pronged sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christians and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, rifles, and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge welcomed in the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a target in the 89th minute of Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea's target when his team was down with 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left and jumped a spark over the outer column.
The attempt went high over the target area to the top corner of the network.
Finally, the ball fell over Kepa Arrizabalaga's jump and got into the net.
"I just tried to get into a position to get to the ball and players that Shaq plays always forward as much as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante close and didn't think so much about it but just jumped."
Chelsea led with 1-0 after the first half following a target in 25 minutes from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striper held a passport back to Mateo Kovacic, spewed from the close middle and printed on Liverpool’s page.
Kovacic made a quick supply-and-go at the middle.
Then he got a sovereign park that led to Hazard in the target area.
Hazard jumped from the defense and got the ball in the net at the remote chair with a left footing park across Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool is fighting Napoli at the champions League's stadium at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy at 15:00 a.m. on Wednesday.
Chelsea is against Videoton in Uefa Europe League in London at 15:00 a.m. on Thursday.
Death figures for tsunamis in Indonesia rise to 832
The number of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia has increased to 832, according to the country’s disaster agency in the past Sunday.
Many people have been reported to have stuck in the holes of buildings that were planted in the earthquake of 7.5, which hit on Friday and blew up to six meters, said the Agency's speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was full of bridges from buildings that were planted.
The police arrest, 32 suspected of murder after the women were killed
A murder attack has begun after a woman's match was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44th year was found at 7:55 p.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder.
The police have invited people in the area who have seen or heard something coming forward.
Criminal Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "We are in an early stage of the investigation, but I ask everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead to see or hear anything suspicious about contacting us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a car camera to contact us because they can have information that is crucial to our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman who was found lived in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
During the afternoon, friends have friends who think they know the woman at the place to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police inform the victim's closest.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get in his apartment, but the police said no one can come in or get out of the building.
He was disappointed when he was told what had happened.
The residents of the building have been informed that it takes several hours before they can come in again.
A police officer told a man to treat the whole area as a crime scene.
A crying woman looked up at the place.
She says "it's so stupid" about and about again.
At 2:00 a.m., there were two police cars in front of the raid and another just outside.
A number of police officers stood before the dispute with a view to the construction of the apartment.
Persons with information are required to send a DM to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and indicate log 247 from 30 September.
Parliament's status of Cromwell's latest grain sacrifice on the re-writing of history
A blinding light would be poetic justice for his seeming destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society called Mr. Cricks' proposal for "frequency" and "test to write about history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was unlikely that the status of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be drawn into the ongoing debate on removal of states."
The iconoclasses during the English incarceration war were neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Phil Cromwell might have been offered for what his father Thomas did 100 years ago.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the view of the 1800s and is part of the history of a man who believes that many still should be buried.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more at the end of the 1800s than now, consider Cromwell to have defended Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case from the monarchy.
If this is a proper representation, it is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has no doubt affected the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known person who represents one side of the matter.
His companies as Lord Protector also deserve to be arrested and punished.
Killer Grieve Kills Bonds
A bond was attacked and killed by a grey on a market in South-West China, according to local media reports.
The man, only identified with his last name Yuan, was found dead with a brutal species and covered in blood in a path on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post in Sundays.
A gray-headed farmer is prepared to inject vaccines in greys in a piggie on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He is reported to have been transported with his cousin from Yunnan's neighboring province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The morning after that, the cousin found him dead and found out that the door to a nearby pigeon was open.
He said there was a big gray in the pigeon with blood on his mouth.
A legal investigation confirmed that the 250 kilograms of wheat had killed the bond, according to the report.
"My cousin's leg was bloody and twisted," said the cousin identified with his last name Wu to Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to eat his bites at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The Greeks who killed the bond did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the crisis had been locked in to avoid more attacks while the police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reported to negotiate compensation for his death.
It's rare to strike attackers, but it's happened before.
In 2016 a grey woman and her husband attacked their garden in Massachusetts and caused serious damage to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300 - pound [300 kg] grain pressed a bond in Wales against a tractor until his wife was afraid of it.
When a bond in Oregon was awarded by its 2012 Grispers, a bond in Manitoba to CBC News said that it is usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can work as a "catalysator".
"They're just playful.
They're breathing and they're very nervous, they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect," he said.
The rest of the Rosa Orc for a very strong rain to the south-west USA
It is expected that the Orc Rosa will become weaker when it is carried over colder waters at the north coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring a flood of rain to northern Mexico and the western United States in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind force up to 135 km/h, category 1, at five EST in Sunday and was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trail is formed over the Pacific Sea and transported east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches half of the Baja California as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical soft north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching urge to create a very strong rain in the South-West USA will occur in the coming days.
Locally, 2,5-10 cm rain will cause dangerous floods, floods and possible earthquakes in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to 5–7.5 cm rain per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5-10 cm rain is expected in some parts of South-West USA, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Contaminations are possible with rapid deterioration due to the spread of tropical rain.
It is absolutely not recommended that anyone give up in the growth of foot when tropical rain is expected.
Powerful rain can make canyons into exciting rivers and desert storms lead to strong local winds that blow around the sand.
The nearby trail of locally powerful rain to parts of the southern California Coastline.
It is possible to combine with a cm stream, which can lead to the flow of learning and taking paths.
It would be the first rain in the area during the accounting period.
Some skimmed tropical raindrops will approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain becomes more known later on Monday and Tuesday.
Powerful rain will be spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue during Wednesday.
October can mean intense temperature changes throughout the United States, when Arctic colds down but the tropicals remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature in short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in Central America on Sunday.
There are almost ten degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
During the coming days, the remaining summer heat will be re-examined.
Large parts of central and eastern USA are expected to get a warm start on October with about 30 degrees from Great Plains to parts of northern USA.
New York can get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about five degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows a greater chance of warmer temperatures than the average in Eastern USA during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people looked at Brett Kavanaugh's opposition
More than 20 million were looking at the catch-up of Thursday's witnesses from Brett Kavanaugh, named at the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual abuses that would have taken place in the 1980s, on six TV networks.
Meanwhile, political deaths continued and the normal shipment was suspended for the last minute of the peace – Arizona Senator Jeff Flakes's agreement with the FBI, where they were given a week to investigate the complaint.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that she was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh had touched her when he was full and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate witness and said he's absolutely sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers on Friday was higher than the 20.4 million of Nielsen.
They calculated average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available for other TV networks showing the audience, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble counting people looking at the office.
Comparably, there are as many viewers as for a football match in the final game or Oscarsgalan.
Fox News Channel, whose representatives have shown strong support for Kavanaugh's nomination, had most viewers with an average of 5.69 million under the long run, according to Nielsen.
ABC had most of the 3.26 million viewers next.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2,52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still high after the hearing.
Flake was focusing on the day of peace.
After the Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh filmed CNN and CBS demonstrators who screamed at him when he tried to take a seat with the Judicial Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down on the floor for several minutes while the protesters shouted at him, which was shown in the direct transmission of CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said a woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth about the country?"
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and before closing the doors, he said he would have more to say after hearing the committee.
The TV network sent live several hours later when the Judicial Committee voted if they would proceed to a vote with Kavanaugh's nomination.
But Flake said that he was only thinking about doing this if the FBI would issue the charges against the nominated one in the coming week, which the minority Democrats have been working on.
Flake was partly convinced by his friend, democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Its decisions had a great impact, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched a FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political players" around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "political players" on the future of Britain and to undermine the interest of the nation in an interview with Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May invites the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, along the front page of the newspaper, she continued her attack before this Foreign Minister Boris Johnson against her so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit and said that the proposal for the United Kingdom and the EU to collect customs duties was "completely reasonable".
The shooting of Wayde Sims: The police suspected Dyteon Simpson for the death of the LSU player
The police have arrested a suspect for the murder of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and put in the murder squad, said the police in Baton Rouge.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
The police found the glass jar on the spot and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After he stopped with Simpson, the police said he admitted he shot Wade.
His town was set at $350,000, according to Advocate.
The judge in East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a year of shots in the head and in the neck.
The police are grateful to Louisiana State Police for their space intervention, the police's state law desk, the Southern University police and residents in the area of the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "flight and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,98 meters long forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played the LSU bass.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's bass coach Will Wade said that the building was "crossed" and "chocked" by the death of Wades.
"You're worried about this all the time," said Wade.
Volcano asks for a drink over Mexico City
Assa from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern part of the capital city of Mexico.
National Center for Disaster Prevention warned in October Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the activity had been detected in the crater and the registered 183 emissions of gas and gas during the course of 24 hours.
The center discovered several women and children.
Social media images showed thin layers of ice on windscreens in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano, 72 km south of the capital since a earthquake in 7.1 hit Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police kill with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the killing of self-esteem demonstrators with the police while thousands of people participated in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catholic police vote on sex.
A group of masked separatists who were held back by the demand police threw eggs and colored powders on them, leading to dark dammmols on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Victims also broke out later in the day and the police used their guns to stop them.
For several hours, self-determination groups called "never forget, never forgive" while the Unionists called "long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor damage caused by the protests, according to local press.
The tribe is still splendour in the region, which lasts one year after the referendum, the first October that was considered illegal by Madrid but was rejected by Catalan separatists.
A overwhelming majority voted for independence, but the participation was low when most who were opposed to the section voted in favour of the vote.
According to the Catholic authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent concentration camps when the police tried to stop the vote at elections in the region.
Self-determination groups campaigned during the night of peace to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
However, the demonstration took place, but another route had to be taken.
The electrician Narcis Termes, 68, participated in the separatist protest with his wife and said that he no longer believed that Catalonia would become independent.
"In hell we experienced one of our best hours.
I saw my parents crying with joy over voting, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal profit in the regional elections in December, Catalan parties who are self-sustained have found it difficult to keep the driving force up in the year, when many of their most well-known leaders live in self-defence or are in expectation of their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who played the protest in support of the police on his cell phone, said the conflict had been halted by policies on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
In October, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catholic leaders who have been in custody since the end of last year, announced that he is thinking of candidates in the election to the European Parliament for the next year.
"Candidacy to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the defeat we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man caught after driving into the house
Three men – 33, 34 and 39 – have been arrested after a car was drove into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent, about 7:30 p.m. on Thursday.
Criminal Inspector Bob Blemmings said the grids and the building itself were damaged.

Many give Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Mengas first goal for Livingstone guaranteed profits
Livingston shocked Rangers and condemned Steven Gerrard to his second loss of 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Mengas' strike proved to be the difference when Gary Holt's page was divided into two with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's page has not yet received a prize in Premiership this season and meets Hearts, with eight points more, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers Rapid Vienna welcomes the European League on Thursday.
Livingston extends his profit line to six matches – the main coach Holt has not yet experienced a loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances against two visitors
Holt's law should have taken the lead long before they set their goals; their justice gave Rangers all the possible problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but let his performance cross over the target, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot the board after he jumped in to measure Craig Halket's ignition cross over the target.
The house was pleased to let Rangers play before them, when they knew they could attack in certain games.
And that's how the decisive goal was made.
Rangers gave up a free park and Livingston used an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson cooperated to give Mega a chance, which made goals from the middle of the target area.
In that situation Rangers had dominated the ball, but the defense of the home was unhindered and the target guard Liam Kelly was left largely in peace.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was rejected by Ranger's target guard Allan McGregors' feet and Lithgow shot a board from another of Livington's determined games.
Crossings were constantly introduced into Livingstone’s target area and were handled without problem. Two criminal requirements – after Halkett’s challenge to the exchanger Glenn Middleton and one for the hand – were removed.
"Fenominal" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alaskar Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Fenominal display and result for Livingston.
Each one was unique and continues to exceed the expectations on the way up.
Their style of play and staff have changed dramatically since they returned to the upper level, but Holt deserves the honor of having galvanized the layer since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was unique and led a well-organized defense, and many held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on a healthy foot.
But Rangers lacked inspiration.
They've had their hours under Gerrard, but they didn't live up to the standard.
Their last ball didn't have to – they just opened the door once – and it's something of a wake-up clock for Rangers, which is in the middle.
Erdogan receives a mixed welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, the sun and blue sky (29 September) were set when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany – to repair the relationship between NATO allies.
They have become obsessed with human rights, freedom of expression and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new Moscow.
The city has the world's largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed that they prevented 25,000 spectators from being gathered outside the mosque for security reasons, but many attachmentors were gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators — many of them Kurdish – also heard their voices and condemned both Erdogan's police and the German government's decision to welcome him to Germany.
The bilateral protests show the split views of a visitor who is considered to be a hero of some German Turks and are condemned as one of the leaders of others.

Long larynx prison: Six guards injured in mult
Six prison guards have been injured in a high-security prison for men, according to the Prison Office.
The disturbances broke out on HMP Long Lardin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST in Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialized "tornado monitors" have been called to address the concerns, involving eight prisoners on a plane.
The guards were treated in a position of pain in the face.
A speaker for Prison Service said: "In particular trained prison personnel have been sent to handle the current incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those behind this will be brought to the police and will be able to increase prison sentences."
HMP Long Lardin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the director of the prison was treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October in hell, the police were called to prison to deal with serious concerns where staff were arrested with Billions of Billions.
The Orcene Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with overheating (with dry areas can benefit)
It is rare to experience tropical low pressure when Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen in the beginning of the next week when the remaining energy of the Rosas is rising above the rise in the western United States, with the risk of sudden flooding.
National Weather Service has already issued warnings of sudden flooding for Mondays and Tuesdays in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and bring rain late on Monday.
National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "Tio Tropical Cyclones have maintained status as tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an Orc within 65 km from the Arizona border."
National Hurricane Centers latest models predict 5-10 cm rain, with isolated quantities up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rome in Arizona.
Other parts of the mountains in the South-West USA, including central Mounting and Great Basin, are likely to reach 2.5-5 cm of rain with a risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas without risk of sudden flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Transfusions are very serious, but some of the rain is likely to be beneficial as Southwestern USA suffers from dryness.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, about 40 percent of Arizona's extreme dry, the next highest category, reported weather.com.
The body of Rosa will first be transported over half of the Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa, still with energy in the sun's morning with maximum wind power of 135 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is transported north to 20 km/h.
The storm flows on the cooler waters of the Stilla Sea, which calms it down.
It is therefore expected to be a tropical storm in Mexico on Monday or evening.
Parts of Mexico may be very raining, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
"Average 7.5–15 cm rain is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm", reported weather.com.
Rosa will then be transported north over Mexico as a tropical storm and now the Arizona border early Tuesday as a tropical low pressure, which will then be carried through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The greatest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is a very strong rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the rise in South-West USA," said National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and floods in the desert, as well as earthquakes in mountain terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four shots for attempted murder
Three boys in the ton and a 20-year-old have been arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with knife years in Somerset.
The teenage boy was injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, about 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and the situation was reported to be "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old arrested during the night in Radstock area, the police in Avon and Somerset said.
The police are asking everyone who can have filmed what happened with the cell phone to get on.
Trump says Kavanaugh "lead, elacheten, ilkan" from the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the indifference of the Democratic Party and scandalous tactics," Trump told his supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "leaded by the elachet, Ilska" from the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the convention on Thursday and gave a strong and unfeeling witness to Christine Blasey Ford’s complaint that he had sex with her several decades earlier when they were teenagers.
He also witnessed before the Congress on his claim.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliantness and quality and courage" at Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judges Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of our most competent legal senses, a jurist with a first-class history of serving the public," he said to his supporters in the public in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the vote of Republicans in the coming midterm elections.
"We are five weeks from one of our most important choices in life.
I don't apply, but I do," he said.
"That's why I go around and fight for sovereign candidates."
Trup claimed that the Democrats were trying to "stand against and prevent".
The first decisive vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place on Friday, according to information to CNN from an assistant to an senior Republican leader.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number increases
At least 384 people, however, were swept away when giant waves broke against the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities in October.
Hundreds of people had been gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when up to six meters high waves broke against the beach in the sky and drowned many to a safe death and destroyed everything in its way.
Tsunamine came after an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami came yesterday, people stood on the beach instead of running immediately from there, and they fell victims of tsunami," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster agency BNPB, at a meeting in Jakarta.
"Tsunami was not alone but slept with cars, stocks and houses. It killed everything in its way," said Nugroho. He also said that Tsunami had been transported to the open sea up to 800 km/h before the coastal line had been struck.
Some dressed up in a tree to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
The photos released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, brothers are destroyed and have collapsed and a Moscow is surrounded by water.
Aftershalv still killed the coastal city on Saturday.
The circle of earthquakes was known in an area of a population of 2.4 million.
In a statement, the Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology BPPT said that the amount of energy released in the enormous earthquake on Friday was 200 times as large as the nuclear bomb released at Hiroshima in the second world war.
The city is located at the end of a long, small roof, which may have made tsunami larger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the destruction as "abstaining" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
Dead victims were found under the bridge of destroyed buildings, he said, and 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and the damages could be even worse along the coastal line 300 km north of Palu, a region called Dodhia, which is near the epicenters of the earthquake.
The communication from Dodhea "was completely lost without any information," Nugroho said.
"It lives over 300,000 people there," said the Red Cross in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can be much worse," they said.
The Agency was criticized in October for not informing the presence of Tsunami against Palu, but the authorities said that the eggs had been covered during the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man is listening to the surveillance in a built-in franetic warning about tsunamis for people on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water falls against the beach and sweeps away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami have resulted in a vast flow of electricity that has broken all the communications around Palu, which has made it difficult for the authorities to deliver.
The military has started sending your cargo flight with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated persons are still in great need of food and other needs.
The city's airport has been opened for the aid operation and remains closed for other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in tsunamis in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Workers from the World Vision in Dodhea have gone to Palu where they are looking for protection in the field outside the office, but they saw destruction along the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
"They said they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Aid groups have launched the bitter aid work, but some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, needs and workers from abroad may be used only if an exemption permit is issued after a disaster.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a regional disaster," said Aulia Ariani, a speaker for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the authorities say it's a national disaster, we can launch international aid, but that status has not yet been identified."
When the second night came in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of peace, relatives and friends of missing persons were still hoping that their close and dear ones would show themselves to be the miracles that lighted the dark natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was saved from a clock.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been standing under a bridge for two days with her mother’s body scattered around.
Gendon Subbandono, Indonesia's national flight trainer, had trained two of the missing screen flights before Asian games, which were completed in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others who were standing at Roa Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandidi, were his students.
"As the screen saver, I have a personal emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told us that the hours after the flight, he heard that the Roa Roa Hotel had crashed, he sent the message WhatsApp to the Palu participants who participated in the beach festival.
But his message only got a gray book instead of two blues.
"I think it means that the messages were not delivered," he said.

Kanye West: The rapper exchanges its name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West exchanges name – to Yes.
He announced on Twitter on Saturday and said, "The truth that is formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, he was called Ye for a longer time and used the nickname as title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change comes before his involvement in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new Yandhi album.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande in the program, who introduced "sympathetic reasons" according to the programme's Creator.
Ye is a summary of the current professional name of West, but he has also said that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'du'," said West earlier this year when he talked about the title on his album with the radio value Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means 'the end', to only Ye – a reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is like a mirror of which we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappers who's changed his name.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, previously co-operated with the West, has previously written his name with and without links and sentences.
Mexico AMLO challenges not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's recently elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to use the military against civilians when the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody violence against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Trops fired the gun against a peaceful demonstration on the street in October 2, 1968, and killed up to 600 people during a time when left-handed student movements broke down in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has insisted on supporting young Mexicans with monthly contributions to students and by opening up more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to crime.
The United States should double the AI funding
Now that China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the USA should double the amount they spend on research in the field, according to the findinger and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment will follow that several parts of the US government have made the statement about AI, although the United States does not have a comprehensive AI strategy.
China presented its plan in full with the aim of leading the AI innovation before 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States and we are looking for the next break in the AI," said Lee.
A double large budget can double the chance that the next major AI trade is made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published earlier in the month of Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, is a VD for Synovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies – Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that hit the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later he was in charge of Microsoft Research and was VD for Google's Chinese division.
Lee mentioned earlier technology competitions from the U.S. government, such as Robot Challenge from Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what would be next to be able to identify future observers.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get credit from the government, Lee said.
"It's not China who takes the academic leaders from us, but the companies," said Lee.
In recent years Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed leading personalities from the university to work on AI.
Lee said that new immigration policies can also help the US with AI innovation.
"I think the green cards should be offered automatically to doctors within the AI," he said.
State Council in China issued its development plan for the next generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation provides loans to people on academic institutions such as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations spend money on researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the United States Defence Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and the academic world, and Vita House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF currently invests more than $100 million per year in AI research.
American legislation to create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not made any progress in several months.
Macedonian People's Republic Of
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether the name of the country should be changed to the "North Republic of Macedonia", which would solve a number of years of old conflict with Greece that has prevented the country's attempt to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of its neighbours in the north constitutes a requirement on its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would undermine the identity of the Macedonian majority.
President Gjerge Ivanov has said that he does not think of voting in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has led to doubts whether the 50 per cent minimum participation required to be considered valid will be achieved.
The question on the vote in the referendum is as follows: "Are you for NATO and the EU members with the approval of the agreement with Greece?"
But the candidates for the change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is worth changing if it makes Macedonia, one of the countries formed when Yugoslavia was split, can join the EU and NATO.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, for that means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not binding, but enough with Members in Parliament have said that they are thinking of following the outcome to be considered decisive.
The exchange of names requires a majority of two-thirds of Parliament.
According to the State Election Commission, no irregularities were reported at 13 p.m.
But the participation was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I vote for my children's debt, we are in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in the Macedonian referendum on the country's change of name, which would open the way for membership in NATO and the European Union, in Struca, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a small scene and placed chairs in front of the hall set up by those who vote in favour of the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go with the head in the air, not moving through the back door," Kavardarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of a Euro-Asian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, a NATO member would lead to the necessary investments in Macedonia, which is more than 20 per cent unemployed.
"I believe that the absolute majority will vote yes, for over 80 percent of our inhabitants are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said when he voted.
He said that a "Yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future."
According to a survey published in Monday by the Macedonian Police Research Institute, between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters were voting in the referendum, which occurred during the minimum participation required.
According to another survey carried out by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 per cent of participants wanted to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them thought yes.
In order to take account of the vote, 50 per cent of registered voters plus one vote must be taken.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious backlog for the Western-oriented government's policy since it passed in May in hell.
Look at: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero takes over all Bridgeton's defenses to achieve goals
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling won Brighton's prize in Manchester City's 2-0 prize at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England in Saturdays.
Aguero made it look easy when he set his goal in 65 minutes.
The Argentinian striker got a step from the middle end at the beginning of the sequence.
He jumped between Brighton's three defenses and went out on the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green trees.
He took around a defender and jumped from several others at the edge of Brighton's target area.
Then he pushed a pass to Sterling to the left.
The English guard used his first park in the target area to give the ball back to Aguero, who used the right foot to beat Brighton's target guard Matthew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the network.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola to the journalists.
"We talked about playing for 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were sure he was making the target right now."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial takeover in the Premier League.
The target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside Brighton's revision of that game.
He sent out a fine shot along the left side of Leroy Sane.
True took a couple of shots and led Sterling to the outer column.
Sky Blues forward jumped the ball into the net immediately before it got out of range.
The city meets Hoffenheim in the champions League at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 on Tuesday.
The player wants to play against the Rockies
Nationals have been eliminated from the final game, so there was no reason to force one to start.
But the competition focused Scherzer wants to fall on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only about Rockies, who is at a match before Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, still has a chance to finish the game.
Rockies got a wild card place with a win of 5-2 over Nationals on Friday night, but is still out after his first division title.
"We're playing about nothing, but we can get a chance to shed rubber in the knowledge of the atmosphere here in Denmark with the public and that the second layer would play at a higher level than any other layer I would meet in the year.
Why wouldn't I want to be there?"
Nationals have not announced their beginnings for Sunday, but according to reports, they are voting against letting Scherzer fall under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who would make his 34:e start, burned in the bullpen on Thursday and would fall on his normal holiday.
Washington's right-hand boxer is 18-7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 inputs this season.
Trump keeps numbers in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of the vote of Republicans in the coming mid-term elections.
"Everything we've done stands at the game in November.
We're five weeks from one of our most important choices in life.
This is one of the great, great ... I don't apply, but I do. That's why I go around and fight for sovereign candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see a homey, homey group of radical democracies, you see what's going on here and now.
They are determined to take back power whatever is required, you see their vanity, their folly.
They miss who they have to hurt, who they have to drive over to take over power and control; that's what they want, power and control; we're not going to let them get it."
Democrats, he said, are fighting to "stand up and stop."
"You've seen it in the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "greek and jealous and stupid and false."
He referred to democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, who is in the Senate Judicial Committee, which is accompanied by a high order from the observers.
"Do you remember what she said?
'Did you close the document?'
'Eh, uh, huh?
No, no, no, I'm waiting for a... 'It was really bad body language, any of the worst body language I've ever seen."
The lab is no longer a broad church.
They don't tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was almost surprised.
In spite of all the latest in a series of MPs from Labor that will hear that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way when she was faced with anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not staying with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on the security of the nation, on Europe – ironically similar substances that Jeremy criticized earlier leaders.
The Communication on the Meeting with Nottingham East Labour on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be welcome and productive".
During most of my eight years as the Local MP Labours have the GC meetings on Fridays have been exactly that.
But now, unfortunately, many meetings are not that, and the promise of "friendly, prudent" policy has been forgotten long ago, if it ever started.
It has become increasingly evident that divergent views are not tolerated within the Labour Office, and each view is judged on the basis of whether the party's leader accepts it.
This began soon after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues I used to think had a similar political view that I expected to make a complete revolution and take positions that I would never have had in mind – whether it was the security of the nation or the internal market of the EU.
Every time I speak publicly – and it really doesn’t matter what I say – it’s following a series of social media headlines that require me to be rejected, criticising my policy and saying that I should not even be involved in the Labour.
And this isn't just me.
The fact is that I have more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments directed against me are mostly political.
I commend the professionality and determination of these colleagues when they are put in front of a stream of seismic and racist practices every day but never give up.
One of the biggest discrepancies in your policy is the level of abuses that are now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Labor should promote a culture of tolerance.
But in fact, we are no longer this broad church and with every misinformation and change in the electoral rules, the party is becoming ever closer.
I've been given a lot of advice in the last two years about flying under the radar and not being too straight, so it's okay.
But that's not why I became politicians.
Since I went to the lab as a school 32 years ago, caused by the failure of the Thachers government, which literally got my primary school classroom to fall together, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – both at the local level and as government ministers.
I've never touched my political views, and that includes the latest choice.
No one in Nottingham East can somehow have been confused about my views on the police and the subjects I do not hold with the current leadership.
To you, as a promoter of the strike on Friday, I just want to say that when the country goes to a Brexit that will damage households, activities and public services I don't understand why I would not want anyone to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party.
But my first message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my election – both the Labor members and others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of fear of rejection or political convenience will prevent me from doing what I think is best for all of you.

Age 38-17 Melrose: Dispersed Ayr on top
Two tests in the last minute may have denied the result of an announcement, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderful tenent's Premiership match.
They're on top, the only broken side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defenses, as well as their ability to take chances, which gave the homemeal the profit, and trainer Peter Murchie has all the right to be happy.
"We've been tested under our matches so far and are still undecided, so we're so clearly happy," he said.
Robin Christie from Melrose said, "You deserve it, they took better chances than we."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead but a golden card for Captain Rory Hughes, who was released by Warriors for the match, let Melrose let the figures speak and Jason Baggot made an unconverted attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's leadership with a punishment, and at the end of the first half he made a point and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a lead on 17-5 in the break.
But Melrose got a good start on the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
It was then waited a long time after a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was the bar of the plan, and after the reboot the Ayr led again with a trial from Stafford McDowell, who was converted by Climo.
Ayr's acting Captain Blair MacPherson then received a gold card, and Melrose again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of severe pressure.
But the home meal came back and when Struan Hutchinson got a gold card to have taken Climo without the ball, McPherson made a touch down from the punishment line outside the Ayr's mouth.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after the reboot, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent on the way to the flanger Gregor Henry for the fifth attempt of the home map.
Still Game stars look ready for new careers in the restaurant industry

The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the BBC popular series, which he writes and plays together with his long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
Dun has announced that the next ninth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to plan before life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, he is VD for Affiliated.
The actor refused to comment, but a source on Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan would be involved in Glasgow's "flower restaurant industry".
"The Sea belongs to us": Custody Bolivia hopes that the Court opens the way to Stilla Sea again
The seamen patrol a wide-covered tally for the fleet in La Paz.
Public buildings have a sea blue flag.
The base of the fleet from the Titicacas River to the Amazon bears the motto: "The sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to restore it."
In coastal Bolivia, the memory of the coastal line lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 1800s is still strong – and it is also long after sailing back on the Sea of Stilla.
This hope is higher than in several decades now when Bolivia is expecting a decision from the International Court of Justice the first October, following five years' consideration.
"Bolivia has the operation, an agreement of unity and peace, and expects so clearly the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Court will judge for the benefit of Bolivia's demands that, after years of illegal discussions, Chile must negotiate with Bolivia to allow them to have their own exit to the sea.
The decision of the month is also of great importance to Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, who is facing a controversial struggle for re-election next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Sea," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is amazing that the Court judges for Bolivia's benefit, and that it would not change much even if it does.
The UN Court of Justice, based in the Netherlands, has no right to assign Chilean territory and has provided that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision is notified only six months after the final arguments indicates that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert at international law.
And in the last four years, it may have hurt more than promoted Bolivia's chances.
"The question of access to the sea has been covered by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
She claims that Morales' aggressive rhetoric has fallen on Chile's remaining well-being.
Bolivia and Chile will soon continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so after this.
The two countries have not exchanged Ambassadors since 1962.
Before this President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in Haag, did not consider the decision of the Court of Justice to have been taken very quickly.
The Monday will give Bolivia "a unique opportunity to start a new relationship with Chile" and a chance to "stop for 139 years of mutual advantages," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – used the question of the sea as a political crisis.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Stilla Sea," he said.
"The conclusion is a chance to realize that we must move forward from the past."
North Korea says nuclear equipment requires trust in the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that the nation will not undermine its nuclear weapons unless they can trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the two rival leaders.
His comments came when US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to be on the border to solve the death rate for nuclear weapons diplomats more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a "demand dream" to continue sanctions and US protests against a statement that the end of the Korean war will soon overtake North Korea.
Washington suspects before joining the speech without Pyongyang first launching significant nuclear weapons equipment.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a summit.
But there is widespread scepticism against Pyongyang's really thinking of making himself out with a weapon-arranged channel that the country probably sees as its only chance of guaranteeing its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for other summits between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion exhibitions discovers the latest line huge main subscribers on the way to shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or totally block the sun, we have the right thing to do for you.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have discovered an offer of necky, oversized headbands for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which mixed the stylons on Paris fashionvecka.
Amazingly practical hats have taken over Instagram these summers, and designers have sent their huge creatures on the catwalk.
The first creation of Valentinos was a superabundant bee with a five-footed hazelnut board that completely took over the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included yellow-bred watermelons, a carrot hat and even ananas – but they are not intended to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also discovered a selection of different masks, in low time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had co-psyched lips and resembled rather Hannibal Lecter than skin cover.
One creature looked like a wet coat with snorkel and thick mask, and another looked like a dirty glass strip.
And if you continue the enormous courage you have, you're lucky.
Mode experts predict that the huge horses may be on the way to shops near you.
The oversized hats will be immediately after La Bomba – the semi-trailer with a 60 cm board that has been placed on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural brand behind the incredible attractive hat that has taken over social media sent out another great creation on the catwalk – a semi-seasonal pool that was almost as large as the model in the bath suit as it was in it.
The raffia vassal in terracotta, with raffes and a white leather glove, was outstanding in the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris fashionvecka.
"I look forward to seeing large hats and beach bags in the store next summer," said the familiarist Luke Armitage, "and the designer has had such a big impact that it was difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language Skills for Global Citizens · Global Voices
The independent schools of Scotland maintain outstanding academic results and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, which is only enhanced by individual and collective progress in sports, art, music and other social engagements.
With up to 30,000 students in Scotland, the schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education, their chosen careers and their role as global citizens.
As a training sector that can design and implement adapted learning plans, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and demand subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it's going to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it's going to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s test results show that languages are at the top of the list, with the highest approved results in independent schools.
Together 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received A in the final Higher Grade test.
Data collected from SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 per cent of students who studied Mandarin received one A in High Grade, and 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as determining skills as children and young people without doubt will need in the future.
Languages such as subject choice are now considered as important as natural science, technology, engineering and mathematics at educational levels in independent schools and beyond.
A study carried out by the United Kingdom Employment and Skills Commission 2014 showed that employers of different reasons had difficulty in filling their services free of charge, with 17 per cent being attributed to a lack of skills in languages.
With this saying, language skills are increasingly needed to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more future jobs requiring language skills, these skills are needed in a globalised world.
Regardless of the choice of career, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have adopted another language.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 adults in Britain published by YouGov 2013, 75 percent replied that they could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation in it, and that French was the only language that came up in a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
That is why it is so important to invest in language education for our children.
Being able to speak several languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance of finding meaningful employment in the future.
In Scotland, each school will learn different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach in languages considered to be the most important for Britain before 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose between free schools, with teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish self-employed schools strive to provide an education environment that will prepare children and get them with the skills needed to succeed regardless of what the future holds.
In a global economic environment, there is no doubt that language continues to be decisive for the country's future, so that it needs to be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered as "international communication capacity".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You need to do it.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Lakersdebut on Sunday in San Diego
The waiting is almost over for fans who look forward to seeing LeBron James make a debut for Los Angeles Lakers.
Laker's coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play on Sunday's first season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he plays has not yet been determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reports Mike Trudell questioned that James will probably play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' sex sex scheme.
"I don't need sex at this stage of my career to be ready," he said.
Trips West Virginia campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump's first campaign event tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five planned meetings in the next week, including events at places where he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Waiting for a confirmatory vote of its candidate to the post of the Supreme Court, Trump intends to build support for the coming mid-year elections, as the Republicans are at risk losing control of the Congress before the current elections in November.
What time is Trumps West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trips Wheeling, West Virginia campaign event is scheduled for 19:00, Saturday evening, 29 September 2018.
You can view Trumps West Virginia-rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to be absent this week from the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was inspired by complaints about his sexual abuse, with a expected delay of the vote from the Senate to a week while the FBI's investigation of the case is under way.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help the Republicans get some meat on their legs before the November elections.
Thus President Trump said that these five meetings in the coming week aim to "attach volunteers and supporters when the Republicans try to protect and increase the majority of the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of the Congress is so important for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the Hexican campaign period," said a speaker for the Trump campaign who would not be named Reuters.
The night's event, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can draw fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw attention to Pittsburgh's media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent units in 2016.
Trup is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has studied the opinion studies.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to you to try to give him an increase in his opinion studies," says Simon Haeder, a state scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is fighting to keep the hopes of life in front of Sunday's singles
After three isolated sessions, the parties on Saturday afternoon could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup.
The moving pendulum of the moment is a fully developed sport concept, but something that players really believe in, and more than ever before competitions like these.
So, what moment is this about?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so we carry it as a little moment I give it," Jordan Spieth said when he finished for the day.
Europe has the advantage of, of course, four points in advance with twelve more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have a little wind in the cell, but they have much to be encouraged by, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and came home three points of four.
Spieth has been washed from tea to green and is a good example.
The winestrope was worth more when his round continued and he dropped a decisive spot to take the match four all-squares when he and Thomas had played after two after two games.
His poem that won them the match of 15 met with a similar stream, with the conviction that the American layer is not yet out of the game.
"You really have to dig deep and worry about your own match," said Spieth.
That's all these players have left now.
18 hell for victory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cups undisputed story.
Europe's outside, but it's four of four, and now nothing goes wrong.
"Molywood" was the only couple who did not make a bogey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
These performances and public reactions confirm that they are players to hit on Sunday, and there are no more popular players who could come home with a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
In particular, both at the same time on different halls.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process short with Sergio Garcia, the morning's fireball hero, along with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in front of nine dropped the Spaniard and the Swedish in a hole they never even came close to hanging out.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you out of the hole.
Fyrball and foursome are so fascinating to look at closely due to the interaction between the couple, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and how a strategy can be changed at a moment.
Europe has played better than it did until now, and has taken a major lead before the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA has had a fight like some, especially on the US side, had doubts.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 in Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a strong advantage on Ryder Cups the last day after coming out of the Saturday's football and foursome match with a 10-6-leader over the United States.
The inspired duon Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led two victories over a legendary Tiger Woods and came home all four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Björn's European law, which fought to keep the pocal that they lost in Hazeltine two years ago dominated an American law that never really started during the morning football with 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in the foursomes and won two matches, but it wasn't enough to win.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 single maters to keep the poker.
Fleetwood is the first European player to win four points in row while he and Molinari, baptized at "Molliwood", after a sentimental weekend, only the second pair is to win four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cups history.
After crossing the Woods and Patrick Reed in the fireball, they hit an exhausted Woods and American Rocky Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5 & 4.
Woods, who fell through two matches on Saturday, showed a sample for one hour of the brilliant, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 matches in fireball and foursomes, and seven of them in row.
Justin Rose, wanted to go down the train in the morning and return to partner Henrik Stanson in foursomes to a 2 & 1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - bound one and three in the world.
Europe did not have the whole way, but it was a pleasant blue day in the southwestern part of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the lead mark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They came home victorious with 2 & 1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a fireball and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in a foursome after losing the two opening halls.
Only two times in Ryder Cups history has a layer come back from a four-point basement in the single maters, but Furyk's page needs only one undisclosed result to keep the poker.
After having been the next best in two days, it may seem like a receipt on Sunday can be difficult to get through.
North Korea says they'll never fight alone without confidence.
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions extended their misdemeanour towards the United States and it was not possible for the country to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation's annual General Assembly that in recent years North Korea had taken "a major step towards demonstrating its goodwill", for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, demune the installations for nuclear tests and promise not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we see no corresponding answer from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there will be no chance that we will unify ourselves first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a step-by-step division in stages of nuclear power that would lead to the reward of North Korea when it took a gradual step, his statement seemed significant, since it did not reject a single nuclear solution as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between a sitting American President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work against "the development of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first disarm his nuclear weapons.
Washington has also given no thanks to negotiations on facilitating serious international sanctions against North Korea.
"USA insists on "development first" and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its purpose by force and even by "declaration of the end of the war," says Ri.
"The idea that sanctions can get us on our knees is a dream of people who lack knowledge about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our mystery."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leaders highlighted earlier in the United States during the week.
Instead, the Minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months and admitted: "If the party in this issue of nuclear weapons had been South Korea and not the United States, the Korean semi-weaponship would not have come to such a death."
However, the tone of Ri's number was dramatically different than last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's future ability to reach the U.S. state with rockets was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "racetman" on a suicide mission.
In one year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, commended Kim for his refusal to take measures to combat, but it said that much work still remains and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is killed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time for this and said that "if it takes two years, three years or five months," no role."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, however, told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The maintenance of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue with force and without failure until we realize a complete, final, verified reduction."
The Security Council has consistently reinforced the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to undermine the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri in connection with the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times a year already, but his last trip was not going well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made. However, North Korea accused him a few hours later to put in place "aggressive requirements".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to demolize a missile facility and also a nuclear core complex about the United States adopted "compliant measures".
He said Kim had told him that the "recording measures" he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and moved against normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has been given to all doctors to improve their sleep habits in an attempt to fight the growing macho culture to study with caffeine-filled "dungs".
An academic study found that students at the world’s leading university are often unintended for the very reasons for taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course he considered to be the first in his life in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after discussing the effects of sleep failure on learning.
"At the end of it a girl came up to me and said, 'Why don't I know this until now, during my last year?'
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me, he told her about The Telegraph.
The course, which was organized for the first time this year, explains to the students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, and improves their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University of Health Services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The long-term course includes a number of interactive data.
In part of the course there is a picture of a student room, where students click on coffee cups, gardens, coaches and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by the lack of sleep and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another section, participants will learn how long-term sleep failure can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students directly.
But we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," Professor Czeisler said.
The stolthe culture of "divine" still exists, he says and allowed modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that sleeplessness was a growing problem.
To ensure that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - also to avoid stress because sleeplessness puts the brain in cold conditions and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler draw up the course and have read one of his courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course was an eye-opener and inspired him to campaign for a comprehensive course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all doctors to complete a similar study program before starting their studies at the high-performance institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting up a alarm for when to stand up and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "white light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can make you turn around to the day, leading to breathing problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengas targets lower Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another loss today when Dolly Mengas stroke sent Steven Gerrard's odd page to a 1-0-down in Livingstone.
The Ibrox page was out after taking his first victory on the road since February 4-1-triumf on St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's law delivered Gerard's second floor in 18 matches as manager to leave his team eight points after Ladbroke Premiership Leader Harts.
Many hit seven minutes ago and Rangers never succeeded in comparing the result.
While Rangers now falls down to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third place and lies behind Hibernian in a different direction.
And there may be more problems on the ground for Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a main year after an object was thrown from the outside end.
Gerrard made eight changes in the semi-final at Betfred Cup.
The other side went with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and he would have been happy about his well-skilled game the opposites every time.
Rangers must have dominated it, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
It should have been targeted for two minutes already in the game when Mengas' first pass was released by Scott Pittman to Allan McGregors's goals, but the midfielder missed his great chance and shot outside.
A free park at the depth of Keaghan Jacobs was then reached by Captain Craig Halket, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the back of the chair.
Rangers took control of the match, but it seemed to be more hopeful than faith in their games during the final third part of the match.
Alfredo Morelo must have known that he should have been punished when he and Steven Lawless were colliding, but Judge Steven Thomson took off the Colombian's offer.
Rangers managed to make only two targets in the first half, but before this Ibroxmael Watchman Liam Kelly took easily to Lassana Couliballys Nick and a thin park from Ovie Ejaria.
Lewis opened the door in 34 minutes must have gone against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their traitor deserved it.
Again, Rangers failed to handle Jacob's firm situation.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher came up with Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple conclusion.
Gerrard acted at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the exchange gave almost immediate effect when the outer ball hit Morelos, but the impressive Kelly jumped from his line to block the attempt.
But Livingston continued to get the opponents to play exactly the type of game they think about, with Lithgow and Halkett who blew up long fit after long pass.
Holt's side could have strengthened his leadership in the last phase, but McGregor was well able to prevent Jacob before Lithgow jumped outside the corner.
Rangers' translator Glenn Middleton had another rare demand for punishment when he was arrested with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: Founder of Geiger Counter
And now a page from Sunday's almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, a discovery that so little led to the maniac called Geiger measurementr.
Geigers have become a foundation for science since then and are also prominently involved in pop culture, as well as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, with the main role in the seemingly unsanitary coypoke researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man, "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these sensors on you, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that are absorbed by the radioactivity of the minerals. "Evans:
Evans said, "Yes, it's popping now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63-year-old day.
But the discovery that bears his name continues to exist.
New cancer can learn the immune response to "see" cancer cells
New cancer can learn the immune defense to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccin teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method means extracting immunity from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then see a protein that is common to many cancer forms and then re-inject.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various forms of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to feel cancer again, saw their ovarian cancer cells disappear in more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immunity from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that is common to many cancer forms called HER2 and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and thyroid cancers, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immunity from patients and "learn" them how to treat cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by carrying a MAGA cap, after his SNL presentation.
It wasn't that good.
Kanye West was invited out of a studio during Saturday Night Live after a slow presentation where he promised US President Donald Trump and said he himself would apply for the post of 2020.
After performing his third song for the night, Ghost Town, where he had a Make America Great Cup, he ran against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to a white person, they say, "How can you think about Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd have moved from America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon where the Hollywood Star made a look at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony board before the Senate's legal committee on the allegations of sexual abuse by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not sent, the recording of West's exhibition was loaded on social media by Commissioner Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether Rock tried to drive West with the investment.
West had also regretted to the public that he had been betrayed backstage for his main subscription.
"They motivated me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out with that cap."
They moved me!
And then they say I'm sickly," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to also fall low?" and said he would "put my supermancape on, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go on?
Test with love."
His comments locked more holes at least two times from the public and employees from SNL seemed generated, reported Variety. One person said, "It was a death test in the studio."
West had entered as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West disturbed many with its appearance of the song I Love it, dressed in a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who questioned: "For one of the bravest souls: TACK FOR YOUR STAD ON THE MOBEN MOBEN."
But the speech showen's worth, Karen Hunter, questioned that the West was simply "be yourself and it's very wonderful."
"But I chose INTE to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") that I believe is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
We're with her, let her.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the creature known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's track, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper colleague, Snoop Dogg has called Snoop Lion and of course the deceased musician Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Judgment for attempted murder after cutting a knife at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old was charged with attempted murder after a man was shot at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The event happened in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The reply is expected to be found at the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the prosecution authority.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington Fights Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his swordring role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent media fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the player, 31, has said negative about the stereotype of the macho hero and says that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they must be thin to be respected.
In a speech to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something has gone wrong" and asked how to handle the problem with toxic masculinity under #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his roommate in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31 admitted that he felt "gang strong" to take the issue away.
"I personally feel quite strong, right now -- where have we gone wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"How have we raised men in view of the problems we now see?"
Kit thinks TV can partly be responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to its very masculinity.
He continued, "What's inflated and what's taught?
What do you learn on TV and on the streets, making young boys feel they have to be in a certain way to be a man?
I think it's really one of the big issues in our time - how do we change it?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview, he also acknowledged that he would not do any Game of Thrones followers when the series came to an end next summer and says he's "he's ready for the field and horses".
Since November, Kit will play in a replay of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently discovered that he felt that meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife thanks for the series, so it gave me my future family and my future life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, which Kitt character Jon Snow loves in, in Emmy's winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14% of the population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been killed in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only during the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases were transferred through sex and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV is spread rapidly through certain parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, said the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people from year to year.
HIV infection through association is an acute issue in the Chinese HBT community.
Homosexuality was criminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against HBT persons is said to be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men having sex before or after marriage will marry women.
Many cases of infection are due to insufficient protection in combination with these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to personalize the data of the GOP senator, due to "hazardous lies" and "conspiration theories"
American Congressman Maxine Waters condemned on Saturday the claim that one of her employees had posted personal data on three U.S. senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles-Democrates claimed that these claims were spread by high extremism sites.
"falses, lies, and more apostate lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The released information contained address and phone numbers for Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was received online Thursday, by an unknown person at Capitol Hill under a Senate panel, about the allegations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The team came once after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the entry was associated with Water's office and sent information about a member of Water's staff, reported Hill.
"This unfounded claim is absolutely false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"My staff - whose identity, personal data and security have been staged as a result of these false and false claims - was not in any way responsible for the reading of this information.
This unfounded claim is absolutely false and an absolute lie."
Water's speech was quickly criticised online, including from Vita Huset's former press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This report is adjudicated," wrote Fleischer.
"This means that she has not had the temper to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they don't have to be angry.
They can't be sad.
They shall not question the reasons of the applicant.
They must be calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to try to compare Water's reaction with the criticism of the democracies of Judges Kavanaugh, who criticized for having been angry during the day of Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who applied for the removal of Waters in the middle of the term of office, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Dear truth," he said.
In his statement Waters said that her office had warned "applicable authorities and crime-fighting forces for these misleading demands.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their acts that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees."
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again - powerless spy parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for Brexit's meanings in every new film with British accent, and the same seems to be true of this replay of the latest Johnny English action comedin - a series of spy parodes that was shot in 2003 with Johnny English and was relived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the waters become satisfactorily bad for us to become the new export of the nation?
In any case, the competent Johnny English has received his license to become a customer for the second time - his name signals more than anything else that he is a wide-ranging comic book for the bio-public even in non-English countries.
Of course he is the sharp secret agent, who, despite his familiar demands on smiothieglamour, has received a small bit of Clouseau, a gnutta Mr. Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony to OS in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads that create chaos where he is still going.
There's one or two nice moments in the latest JE film
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medium suit and when the rotor sheet struck his helmet for a short time.
Atkinson's speech for physical comedy is shown, but humour feels quite low and artificially excessive, especially because the "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comedy as an ingredient.
Humorn feels as if it's adapted to children instead of adults and for me, Johnny English artificially did not get the same discovery and focused as Atkinson's studio film bravades in the role as Bean.
The constant current substance is now that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the UK's super secret web network of spies, revealing the identity of all British agents out in the field, to the agent in the great disillusionment of the service - an extremely small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last street for a prime minister who is a pompous and hard-working figure, who is already suffering from a complete collapse of his political popularity: Emma Thompson does his best with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but the manual does not offer much to work with.
Her informant informs her that when each active spy is taken, she must use someone who has retired.
And that means the emerging Johnny English in its own high person, now employed as a teacher in a well-being institution, but who offer informal lessons in art to work undercovers on the side of it.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an acute meeting and reunited with its former long-lived sidekick Bugh, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an underprivileged, a jolly-hockey-sticks role where Vicki Pepperdine is near the city.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so awfully wrong on Her Majesty's Secret Service and supports Olga Kurylenko's beautiful five fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
In time, Prime Minister will fall hard on the charismatic tech billionaire, who claims he can solve the British computer puzzle: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odyssé of far-sarded inventions: exposed to servers, they set fire to a flash French restaurant; they create chaos when they swim on the Volta luxury boat; and English releases clean anarchy when they try to use a VR headset to introduce themselves with the inside of the Voltas house.
There certainly is a lot of work behind the last sequence, but despite the fact that the film is both charming and enchanted, it has an air of children's TV.
I mean, look at everything like everything.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I can't let you think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his speech?
Labor refuses to prepare a plan for Brittany to work a four-week job but pay for five days
Jeremy Corbys Party Labour reviews a radical plan that indicates that the British work for a four-day week - but gets paid for five.
According to the party, business managers want to spare savings made by the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra day free.
It would see employees enjoying a three-day weekend - but keep the same pay.
According to sources, the idea of "pass" with the party's economic agenda would benefit workers.
Changing to a four-day week has been approved by trade union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic changes.
A senior representative in Labor told The Sunday Times: A police review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"It won't happen one day, but a four-day working week is an effort that fits in the party's position to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker and the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, even the Party The Greens who promised a four-day work week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, this objective is not marked by Labor as a whole.
A speaker for Labour said, "A four-year-old's work week is not the party's policy and it's nothing that the party agrees with."
Skuggkansler John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was firm in his decision to withdraw power from "inspired leaders" and "sniffers" to state companies.
The plans of the Skuggkansler also mean that the current shareholders in water companies cannot get back all their efforts, as a Labour Government can make a "derogation" because of what they consider to be wrong actions.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in corporate management and create so-called Inclusive Ownship Fund where 10 per cent of the private company's own capital is transferred to its employees, who are then getting annual distributions of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell the TV program "60 minutes" if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has sent a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court at least one week and raises the question of whether the Bureau's investigations could allow some Republican senators to change their position on the matter.
In an interview sent on Sunday, “60 Minutes” correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out about anything that would lead to their change of views.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I said when I went into the interrogation, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened, when the complaint came out, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, convinced, irreverent."
But Graham's voice seems awful.
"I've already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamism," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett rejected it strongly," said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all her names couldn't verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new being changed."
What is Global Citizen Festival and has done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will be worth the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a huge impressive set of stars and an equally impressive task; to combat the world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people elected to Central Parks Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the actual goals of the event: to fight extreme poverty before the year 2030.
Global Citizen Festival is, according to a 2012 statement, an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group that is expected to fight poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you were not ready to pay for a VIP ticket), concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteer work, mail a world leader, call or otherwise meaningfully contribute to raising awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been in 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert a genuine way to convince people to act, or is it just about what is called "clictivism" - people who feel they make real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen reports that more than 19 million "actions" have been registered from its supporters as fighting for a number of different objectives.
It is said that these measures have helped to encourage world leaders to recognise commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will affect life for more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group cited 390 commitments and notifications arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the resources collected have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the United Kingdom between investors and actors engaged in "helping children to develop their full potential", promising to give Rwanda $35 million to contribute to combating malnutrition in the area after having received more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can do social injustice as a footnote in history," said the ambassador of the partnership Tracey Ulman to the public mass during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 measures were taken that require the UK to improve the cost of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes cost programmes aimed at 5 million women and children.
In answer to one of the common questions on his website, "What makes you think we can fight extreme poverty?"
Global citizenship replied: "It will be a long and difficult way - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-participation movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monée are some of the artists who attend the New York annual event, whose values are Debora-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use its fleet in a "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports indicating the Minister of State
The government can "if necessary" approach its fleet to prevent Russian energy operators from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, from discovering US Prime Minister Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zink claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria - especially where it appears at the invitation from the legitimate government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, southern parts of Europe," he said.
And he says there's a way and means to get rid of it.
"The US has the ability to ensure, with our fleet, that the seaways are kept open and, if necessary, to apply blockages, to ensure that their energy is not used when the market is in place," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group called "the vote of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to managing Russia and Iran, and noted that they are really the same.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to use and exchange fuel," he said, while referring to Russia as a "day-end" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement follows that the Trump administration has aimed at increasing exports of natural gas to Europe in order to replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin "fence".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 traffic of 11 billion dollars, which will double the existing traffic capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
They claim that Washington's opposition to the project is only motivated by economic reasons and is an example of illegal competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was rejected by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to withdraw from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I strongly regret that a third party interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a "well-founder" if she will set up in the presidential election 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that she would take a "well-founder" around her participation in the presidential election after the United States' mid-year election.
At a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider setting up as a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our tragic government and it includes a woman at the top," she said in The Hill.
"After 6 November, I'm going to take a real fundraiser to apply to the President's post."
Warren went in to President Donald Trump during the council meeting and said he "took this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," she said.
Warren has been free of charge in his criticism of Trump and his candidate to the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need a FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a vote released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own supporters did not think she would run 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "True" Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not apply, according to a study conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidate.
The study showed more support for a candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 per cent for a potential candidate and 48 per cent against.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidate include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The bid said he would decide officially in January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palins PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he took his occupation in September.
He was arrested and charged for violence at home on Monday night.
"What my own son goes through, what he goes through now when he's back, I can relate to other families who have experience of PTSD and part of the trauma that our soldiers return with," she said to the audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his gripping for "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they will return like other people, they will return here, they will come back and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and refugees and all the other members of the army have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was charged with violence in the home against a woman, attempting to prevent a report on violence in the home and armed holding in a court of law, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 countries, and the District of Colombia support the issue of a new asylum policy
Arton states and the District of Colombia support a legal trial directed against a new American policy that rejects asylum for victims flying the aggregated violence or violence in the home.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district submitted a friend-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges police, reported NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the case of Grace v. Sessions submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the police has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner "and his violent gang members" abused her, but American officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
State attorneys who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries producing a large number of asylum seekers, who face major problems with hunger and violence in the home.
The new US asylum policy changed a 2014 decision by the immigration authorities that allowed illegal immigrants to seek asylum to escape violence in the home.
The District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a speech on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a provision conflicts with that principle", according to the friend-of-the court report.
Lawyers further argued in the report that policies denying immigrants' entry are damaging the US economy and argue that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "give necessary labour".
In June, Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered judges in asylum cases to no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and violence.
"Asyl is available for those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a certain social group or political perspective," said the session when the police announced on 11 June.
Asyl was never meant to solve all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when the number of deaths is doubled in the hunt for survival
For the survivors, the situation looked more sad.
"It feels very exciting," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her febrile boy in an evacuation center in Palu.
"The ambulance takes the body away all the time.
Clean water is a wastewater."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their destroyed homes, rotted through damaged property, and tried to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and ill, who were injured in the 7.5 earthquake.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who were killed by a broken back and axel, wanted outside the hospital of Palu's Army Hospital, where the patients were treated outside because of continued strong demand.
With tears in his eyes, he told me that the violent earthquake destroyed the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We don't fly him.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," said Haras for Associated Press and allowed his family to be in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador charges China for "mobbing" with "propagand ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page announcement in an American daily newspaper on the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump pointed out last Wednesday that China Daily paid a discount in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's best selling newspaper - after he accused China of trying to work in the United States's 6th Congress elections, something China rejects.
Trump's claim that Beijing tried to mix in American elections marked what American officials told Reuters was a new phase in a climbing campaign from Washington to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are, for the occasion, closed in a scalable trade war with high import rates.
China's reparation rates early in the trade war were designed to kill exporters in such countries as Iowa, which, according to Chinese and American experts, supported by the Tromps Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US Ambassador of China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in a debate article in the Sunday's Des Moines Register, "now doubles the motion by putting propaganda ads in our own free press."
"The Chinese government uses America's expensive tradition of freedom of opinion and a free press to spread propaganda by publishing paid ads in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the newspaper shop on the street here in Beijing you will find a limited number of dissident voices and will not see any real reflection of the different views that the Chinese people may have about China's troubled economy, as the media is governed by the iron of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He allowed "one of China's most prominent newspapers to order the offer to publish" his article, even if he did not say any newspaper.
Republicans fear the female voters before the mid-year election through the Kavanaugh Fiskot, warning analysts
Since many of the Supreme Republics defend the Supreme Court's nominated Brett Kavanaugh, who is facing multiple allegations of sexual abuse, analysts have warned that there will be a backlog, especially from women, during the next election.
The feelings surrounding this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they stand in the elections.
It cannot be delayed, says Grant Reeher, professor of state science at the University of Syracuse Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published in October.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s final attempt to a FBI investigation will suffice to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it in the morning and not in November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, an senior consultant and national speaker for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday, according to Washington, DC.
On Friday morning, the demonstrable "November came!" when they demonstrated in the hall to the late building, when the Republicans who control the judicial committee chose to continue with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the witness target of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go into action," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, for the news site.
"People say it's already been high, it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among the undetermined female voters in the presidents and younger voters, 18- to 29 years old, who, although they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Before Ford's public testimony with allegations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a background could be followed if the Republicans were to press for confirmation.
"This has become a confusion about GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the Committee's vote or final vote or whether Kavanaugh comes through, it is also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, chief of Priorities USA, a group helping democratic electoral campaigns, for the press channel.
But the Americans in general seem to be divided over who they should believe in fords and Kavanaugh's witnesses, and later it seems that they believe most.
A new opinion survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or possibly believed in Ford’s testimony board, while 35 percent said that they definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they felt that Kavanaugh had been falsely or definitively lied under his testimony board, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford, as well as those from at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
In front of the Senate's court committee during the past week, Kavanaugh was brutally attacked at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate to the Supreme Court exposed his sexual organs to her while they participated in a party during their time as students at Yale in the 1980s.
The founder of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the World Wide Web, launchs a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons are accessing the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee ridiculed that the purpose behind Inrupt is "world domain".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start-up company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technique to allow people to create their own "personal online data size" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, make lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser at the same time.
What's unique with the personal online dating is that it's up to the user who can access the type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorisation through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company’s VD John Bruce, is that the company should take resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a part of the programme developer to work with the project and a group of volunteers.
From this week onwards, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team do not talk to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all business models are placed on top of one night.
"We don't ask them for permission."
In a press release published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new website created by Solid.
1994 converted Berners-Lee Internet when he established World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality in recent months.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and chief of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about this new era on the web," admitted Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Priest rewarded with Victoria's course during World War I
The only priest in the English church who was rewarded with a Victorian course during World War I is now celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann received the award for his campaign during the attack on Bellengle and Lehacourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed by a prank shield four days later and was never informed that he had been awarded the most prestigious price of the British military.
One memory was discovered by his two children during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his children, Michael Vann, said that it was "brellaly symbolic", that the stone would be revealed 100 years after his father was rewarded with the price.
According to London Gazette, Lt Col Vann led his battle over Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918 "through a very thick smoke and under heavy fire from fields and machinery."
He later jumped up to the shooting line and led the "great loss" line forward before he himself decided the fight.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German peak guard on October 4, 1918 - less than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his father's actions were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I'm very stupid in front of."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also let down a crane after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he was very proud to play a role in the paradise" and allowed "a real hero to be brought against is demonstrated by the support that many people will receive".
MMA fans stayed up all night looking at Bellator 206 and got instead to see Greta Gris
Imagine this you have stood up all night to see Bellator 206 just to be refused to look at the main challenge.
Shown from San Jose included 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown alive at night in Britain on channel 5.
At 06:00, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the British viewers were surprised when the program suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were impressed after they had kept awake to the early morning hours to watch the game.
A fan on Twitter described the program change to a marked program of children as "a sick joke".
"It was the government's decision that the content was not appropriate early in the morning, so they had to switch to child program," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice-vise for marketing and communication when he was asked about the shipment.
"Grea grass, me."
Bellator's VD Scott Cooker said they will work with their schedule to better include British viewers in the future.
"I think we'll be able to find a solution to the reprise," said Coker.
"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, the program change's caused a lot of trouble.
We tried to do what we thought was a technical error.
But it was actually a state issue.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We're going to show five matches instead of sex, which we usually do, and we took the water over our head in our effort to satisfy the fan.
It's an accident."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "substitution" because of sexuality
U.S. poet Tom Daley says that he felt under the shadow of his age because of his sexuality - but it also urged him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize he wasn't like everyone else before he went to the gym."
When he spoke in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the rights of homosexuals to give other "hop".
He also said that he was less concerned about winning the OS after becoming a parent.
The official director of the popular showen programmer, Kirsty Young, has taken away a few months because of illness.
During his first meeting at Lavernes, Daley tells how he felt "lower worth" than others in his youth, because "it was not socially acceptable to think about boys and girls".
He said, "This feeling of feeling less valuable and different has been a real source of strength and strength to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said, so he didn't weaken everyone when they were so young that they were told about his sexuality.
The two-fold Olympic bronze medalist has become a highly-professional advocate for HBT rights and used his presentation at the Year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to convince more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he took the word because he felt that he had the road to live open without restrictions and would give other "hope".
The three-fold world champion said his love in a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "came as a surprise".
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar's winner last year, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much in such a young age" -- he participated in his first OS as 14 and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone in the same age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all life prospects" had been changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was just about winning gold," he said.
"But you know, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that Dad didn't accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked if they had got their tickets to the 2012 Olympic Games in London - where he would sit on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him: you won't be able to sit on the front row," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and he was dead as I finally admitted that he wasn't communicative," he said.
That year Daley competed at OS 2012 and won a bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to look forward to a home audience on an Olympic arena, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song - Proud by Heather Small - a song that had followed him to the OS and still gave him drawings.
Desert Island Discs is sent to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson from the bank on Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will shoot record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but then he has to set the shape to avoid an accident crash.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in row, was bunked by Captain Jim Furyk for the four-day football and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of events, which he has often been for the United States, the five-time winner spent his day working handcuffs and training his game in hopes of having a chance to demonstrate his ability.
He has never been the worst driver, not even at the top of his career, and the 48 year is not in shape before the empty path on Le Golf National, where the long call often misses hard.
It is not just the road that breaks, in the ninth game on Sunday, Mickelson meets Master Francesco Molinari, who, together with newsman Tommy Fleetwood, won all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who sit 4 points in front of the 12 single maters, have arrived at the start, Mickelson's match can be quite decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, not because he could say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a beating on my back and left my arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"His self-confidence is no mistake.
He's known and he's added so much to these laws in previous seasons and in the past week.
I probably didn't think he'd be able to play two games.
I thought he'd be better, but now it's what it is and we'll enjoy it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson Nick Faldo's record of most Ryder Cup matcher played.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never lived up to the heights in his individual results.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven shares, but Furyk said his presence brought other qualities.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, funny, he likes to laugh with people and he's a good guy to have in the law," he explained.
"I also think that the younger players thought it was fun to play against him this week, which was fun to see.
He adds so much more than just games."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership can soon be a memory of nothing
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in the recent days in Ryder Cup can quickly be transformed into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his debut in 1997 at Valderrama, where a law under Seven Ballester's leadership held a five-point advantage over the Americans but finally won with the least possible margin with the result 141⁄2-131/2.
"It reminds you that we led great on Valderrama, we led big on Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we got water with thirst and openness," said Bjorn (on the photo) after having seen the 2018 class win 5-3 both in Friday and yesterday and leading with 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So the story will prove to me and everyone in the board that this isn't over.
Tomorrow we'll give you everything.
Go out and do everything right.
This is not over until we see the point on the table.
Our goal is to try to win this poker and that is where our focus is.
I've said it all the time, I focus on the 12 players that are on our side, but we're well aware of what's waiting on the other side - the best players in the world."
Björn was pleased with his players' performances on a thin golf course and allowed: "I would never be able to do this myself.
Tomorrow's waiting for new challenges.
Tomorrow it's the individual performances that apply and it's a completely different thing.
It's nice to be out with a partner when it's going well, but when you're out there on your own, your ability as golf players is tested completely.
It is the message you need to send to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must go and get the best of himself."
In contrast to Björn, opponent Jim Furyk will want players to do better individually than those who did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who brought home three points of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of major revolutions during the last days in a contest, both in the winning game in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser when Europe ran "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every damn word of it," he said as he was asked when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, Captain 1999, had collected his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to go out as fast as Brooklyn, as in Medinah.
When the pace starts to one point, there will be a lot of pressure on these intermediates.
We made our position and put the guys we wanted to create a little magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the fight and meet Rory McIlroy at the summit, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter meet the other Europeans in the upper half of the scheme.
"I went with this group of guys in this system because I think it's enough all the way," Bjorn said about his single choices.
Germany's new warships again
The latest fleet of German fleets would have been set at sea in 2014 to replace warships from the time of the so-called war, but it will not be seabed until at least next year due to false systems and high costs, reported local media.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship for the entire new Baden-Wuertemberg frigates, has now been shot up to the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper quoted by a military speaker.
The ship should have joined the fleet already in 2014, but the problems arising after delivery were destroyed for the ambitious project.
The four vessels in the Baden-Wuertemberg class ordered by the fleet in 2007 will replace the old Bremen frigates.
They will contain a powerful cannon, a series of air and sea-smelling missiles, as well as some beautiful techniques, such as reduced radars, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to stop the latest frigates for up to two years without contact with housekeepers.
But continuous delays mean that the flagship warships - which allow Germany to design power abroad - are already advanced when they are in operation, writes Die Zeit.
The destructive F125 frigate created headings last year, when the German fleet officially refused to put the ship in operation and returned it to the Bloom & Voss war in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media indicated a number of important "software and hardware" features that made the warship worthless if it was used on a war mission.
The software deficits were particularly important because a ship in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be driven by a crew of about 120 seamen - only half of the crew of older frigates in the Bremen class.
It has also been observed that the ship has a significant overhaul, which leads to reduced performance and limits the ability of the sea to carry out future upgrades.
The 7000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" is considered to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during the second world war.
Apart from incorrect hardware, the whole project's price gap - including the training of crews - will also become a problem.
It has been said to have resulted in a shrinking of EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion) compared to EUR 2.2 billion in the start-up line.
The problems affecting the newest frigates will be particularly important in the light of the latest warnings that Germany's maritime power declines.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the fleet "is actually carrying a lack of fully equipped ship".
The official said it was a growing problem, as old ships were abandoned but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust Dissemination to the Secret Life of the Flanders
A new research carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to discover how gladdermös uses the landscape in his hunting for food.
We hope that the results will shed new light on the maintenance of unique flying mammals and help to manage future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by researchers at National Trust for Scotland, will follow southern and coastal pipelines as well as brown long-term and Daubenton flagdermöss at Inverwe Gardens in West Ross.
Special players will be placed in important places around the property to track flagermuseum activities throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of flagder music and what species to do.
An environmental map and report will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, natural health consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of life are the most important for the flagdermuseum and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of environmental management, such as the creation of angels and how best to maintain forest brands for gladdermös and other related species.
Fladdermus populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have significantly decreased over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects the welfare and loss of living environment.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as flight plans and certain chemical treatments of building materials as well as attackers from homes.
Fladdermöss is not really blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching the exchange.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to find insects and obstacles to their flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the wear of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes the flagdermöss on a large scale.
The organisation has ten trained experts who regularly conduct investigations, examine the benefits and sometimes carry out rescue operations.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated flagdermus reserve at Three State in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's 10 flagder musarants.
Owner David Thompson says property is the ideal area for them.
"Here on Three we have a good area for flagdermöss," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of weather conditions and a lot of pleasant living conditions.
But there is a lot about flagdermös that is still unknown, so the work we do here and other property helps us to understand more about what they need to be tried.
He stresses the importance of looking for flagdermös before performing maintenance in properties, as it is possible that the sudden destruction of a single dwelling could kill up to 400 dollars and young people, and, if possible, expose a whole population.
Fladdermöss is peaceful and it is illegal to kill, disturb or destroy them or destroy their well-being.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish Officer for Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have much to teach us about our flags and too many of our species we don't know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo rejects violence while his lawyers threaten to vote for the German newspaper
Cristian Ronaldo has called the charges of violence against him for "false news" and says that people "will market themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers will vote in favour of the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus forward have been charged with the rape of an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was claimed to have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a Live Video on Instagram, Ronaldo (33) said from himself the reports as "false news" when he spoke to his 142 million followers, only hours after the requirement was reported.
"No, no, no, no.
What they said today was false news," said the Fifth Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to market themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good," said the player and log.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to vote on the claim, which they have called "an unauthorized report of suspicions of integrity", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "drug damage to a sum corresponding to the seriousness of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged event was said to have taken place in June 2009 at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he, according to the job, would have raped her all the time, according to documents submitted at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo fell sick after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" the failure of the "last percent".
According to the document, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple were having sex, but that they agreed.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photos of her injuries to a hospital, but later agreed on a comparison because she felt "fear for revenge" and was concerned about "to be condemned publicly".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to cancel the comparison because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was on his way to go to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged defeat, and in summer he moved to the Italian port Juve to an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "comes forever" to lose car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "will always regret it" if one lost his status as world car manufacturer after Brexit, Minister of Commerce Greg Clark said.
He admitted that it was "no" that Toyota UK had told BBC that if the United Kingdom gave the EU without an agreement, they would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer reported that the effects of delays at the border if no agreement was concluded could result in lost jobs.
The Burnaston factory - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150 000 cars in the dust, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My point is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March we will see the production stop in our factory," says Marvin Cooke, Toyota vd in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have voiced their concern about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini facility in Oxford in one month after Brexit.
The main problem concerns what car manufacturers say is the risks of the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without a solution.
The Toyota production line is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it may lead to disturbances at the border that the industry says may lead to delays and shortcomings in parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's consumption in stocks at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and that production would be stopped.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequer's plan for future EU relations is "exact calibrated to avoid border controls".
"We need a settlement. We want the best agreement that enables, as I say, not only the success of the current evaluation, but for us to take this opportunity." he told BBC Radio 4: Programme Today.
"The results from not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we must be absolutely able to continue what has been a very successful set of supplier chains."
Toyota could not tell how long the production would be stopped, but in the long run warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and thus reduce the cost of work.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the leader of the Union trade union at the factory, said his members are increasingly concerned: "My experience is that these jobs will never come back.
One government official said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trips meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says Vita house
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could "shut up for another week" while the fight against the Supreme Court named Brett Kavanaugh continues, said Vita's house on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work with Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian involvement in the election, links between Trump and Russia and the President's potential obstacle to justice.
Huruvida Trump will shoot the Deputy Justice Minister, and thereby adventure Mueller's independence, has fueled the Washington Wall in months.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying hearing equipment to play talks with Trump and the possibility of withdrawing the president through the 25th addition of the American Constitution.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House and reported that he was going to leave.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then in the United Nations headquarters in New York, to be held on Thursday.
Trump said he would "fare" not shoot Rosenstein, but then he was late to avoid a conflict with the Senate's legal committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a single-week FBI investigation of charges against Kavanaugh, which further sent a full vote in the afternoon.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke in Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date for it has not been determined, it can happen this week, or a post office with a week with a view to all other things happening at the Supreme Court.
But we will see, and I always like to keep the press up-to-date."
Some reporters would argue the claim: Sanders has not had a press conference from the Vita house since September 10th.
The value of Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences did not depend on any unsuspecting attitude towards TV reporters who "play for the gallery", even though she said, "I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President holds more questioning sessions than any president before him," she said and allowed without citing the evidence: "We have looked at these figures."
Conferences will still own room, Sanders said, but "if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is far better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this often and you have seen us do much over the last few weeks and it will replace press conferences, and then you can ask questions directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the Vita house or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, with the spontaneous statements and sometimes the presentation before the reporters.
Health Minister writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland with regard to Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in the Scottish NHS to express the country's gratitude and the desire to remain behind Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before Britain withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of outstanding status applications for EU citizens working in the decentralised public sector of the country.
In the letter Freeman wrote: "In the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU have continued to emerge, before decisions are expected to take place in the autumn.
However, the British Government has also intensified its preparations before any scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the efforts of each staff member, regardless of nationality.
Fellows from all over the EU, and the rest of the world, give valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care and benefit the patients and society we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after being hit by headache
Tennessee State Tiger's lineback Christion Abercrombie passed an acute operation after being hit by a head injury in October's loss of 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Tennessee's Mike Organ.
Tenssee State Chief Coach Rod Reed told the reporters that the damage happened just before half an hour ago.
"He came to the sideline and just got in touch," said Reed.
Trainer and medical personnel gave Abercrombie acid on the sideline before placing on a bar for further evaluation.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operating at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris allowed that "there is no information about the type/review of the damage" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a redheaded secondary student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five thanks on Saturday before leaving the match, which gave him a total of 18 thanks.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp taxes when they buy a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers can pay higher stamp taxes when they buy property in the United Kingdom, and the extra money is used to help homeless people, according to the new plans of the Tory Party.
The measure will neutralise Corby's success in attracting young voters
The increase in stamp tax will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The UK Finance Department calculates to get up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be paid a higher stamp tax when they buy property in the United Kingdom. The extra money will be used to help homeless people, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The measure will be considered as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corby's success by attracting young voters with the promise of more affordable housing and focusing on high-income people.
The increase in stamp tax will be taken out by individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom. The extra money will be given to the government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The extra fee comes in addition to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels imposed two years ago in holiday homes and apartments purchased for rent. It can be up to three percent.
The Finance Department believes that the measure will take up to 120 million pounds per year.
At the same time, 13 percent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by people living outside the United Kingdom. This drives prices up and makes it harder for beginners to get a foot on the housing market.
Many well-being areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become spout cities due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new show will only be a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in stamp tax in order to help younger people buy their first residence.
He charged large construction companies to keep the prices up by buying up land without using it, and asked Theresa May to withdraw from quotas at apartments with affordable prices in order to solve the "required housing situation" of the United Kingdom.
Jeremy Corbyn has launched a growing number of proposals for housing reforms, including rentals and an end to cancellations without the exception of the renter.
He also wants to give the municipalities greater opportunity to build new dwellings.
Theresa May says: "I said last year that I would spend my time as prime minister to restore the British dream, that life would be better for every new generation.
That means solving the problem on the housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be right when it is as easy for people who do not live in Britain, and also for companies who are based abroad, to buy housing as hard-working residents in our country.
The dream of having too many people have become just a distant dream, and homelessness is still an invaluable fact."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to train Scotland"
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his "final goal" is to once become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old shot faces the challenge of bloating life in the club from northeastern England, currently located in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in the summer after having led St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a game in the B-country game and that was all," Ross says to BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But when I grew up, I looked very much at Scotland at the Hampden with my father, and it has always locked me back.
But that chance can only come if I succeed in leading a club."
Among the representatives of Ross as trainers for Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyt and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says that he was not concerned about meeting such a established name in such a large club. He has previously thanked no for the offer from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Just now I'm assessing the answer to the question 'Can I get this club back to Premier League?'
This club is absolutely home to Premier League, considering its structure and talents," he says.
"It's not easy to get yours, but I might just see myself successful here if I can get your club back."
Ross has only been trainers for three years, after a period of time as an assistant trainer in Dumbarton and a 15-month stay as a member of the Heart Training Team.
Then he helped Alloa get back from the movement to the third division, and moved St. Mirren from being close to the movement to becoming the winner of the master title of the season.
Ross says he's more satisfied now than ever during his career in Clyde, Hartpool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a reason for the road," he recalls and aims at when he took the command over Alloa.
"I really thought leadership was entirely right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
It sounds strange, because I had no results and could live on it, and I had some great success.
But playing can be fun.
It's a lot to be taken every week.
It's still stress and pressure on the job for me, but training feels perfectly right.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it. I'm better than I've ever done in my adult life."

A study shows that the perfect time to take a beer is 17:30 on a Saturday
The summer’s summer heat waves have introduced increased revenues for the country’s fighting pubs, but the restaurant chains have got more pressure on themselves.
Figures showed that pub and bar groups increased their sales by 2.7% in July, but restaurants' revenues decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin from the company consulting company CGA, who has compiled the figures, said: "The fact that England remained in VM longer than expected to see a similar pattern in July compared to June, however, the pubs went up by 2.8%.
The decrease in restaurant turnover by 1.8 % in June has only increased in July.
Pubars and bars that offer drinks above all showed the absolutely best result with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than restaurants had gone down.
Pubars offering food also had difficulty in the beautiful weather, even though it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
People seem to have just wanted to go out and drink something.
The output of managed pumps and bars rose by 6.6 % per month and the consumption decreased by 3 %."
Paul Newman of the service and entertainment industry analyst RSM says: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and heavy sports events are still the most important factors in the sale of large forest markets.
It is no surprise that restaurants still have difficulties, although a 4.8% decrease in sales per year is particularly difficult to deal with beyond current cost pressures.
The long summer summer could not have come more improbable to business driven by food sales. It is time to demonstrate whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August give someone a well-needed response."
The total sales demand for pubs and restaurants, including newly opened facilities, was 2.7% in July. This reflects the fact that there are now fewer brands.
Business sales supervisor Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub bar and restaurant industry in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes information on how 47 active companies are dealing with a total turnover of over 9 billion pounds, and is a fixed direct brand in the industry.
One of five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide for their parents
A study shows that one of five children, sometimes as young as 11 years of age, has secret accounts on social media that they hide for their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high-level and high school students shows an increase in the number of fake Instagram sites
The result has increased anxiety because it is sexual content that is placed there
20 % of students reported that they had a "main account" they showed to their parents
One of five children, some as young as 11 years of age, creates an account on social media that they keep secret for adults.
A survey of 20,000 high-level and high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Instagram", a reference to the Instagram image sharing service.
The result has been slowed down because it is sexual content that is posted there.
20% of students reported that they have a city's main account that they can show to their parents, and then they also have private accounts.
A mother who sneezeed over her 13-year-old daughter's secret side found a teenage girl who asked others to "fuck me."
According to the study conducted by the organizations Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmisters Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of the children between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them acknowledged that they had a private account.
The president of HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are forced to create places on the Internet where parents and teachers don't find them."
Elidh Doyle will be "the voice of the idiots" in the Scottish Peace Alliance Board, Scottish Athletics
Elidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as an external board member at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most prized peacemaker, and President Ian Beattie describes the choice as a unique opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her wide experience at international level in the last decade.
"Eidh has won great respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are sure that players in Scotland would benefit greatly from becoming a member of the board," says Beattie.
Doyle says, "I want to be a vote for the athletes, and I hope I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at OS in Atlanta 1996, has a total of four Olympic gold and is now an expert commenter on BBC. He lost his ability to follow a mini-strake.
He writes on Twitter: "Today, a month ago, I got a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that time was revealed to me if I would recover, and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I've completely recovered, taught me to go back, and now I'm doing mobility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouragement!"
Advertising for breast pumps that compare mothers with breast parts Internet
A company that sells breast pumps has caused divergences on the Internet with an ad that compares breast milk to breast milk.
In order to highlight the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent breast pump" consumer technology company Elvie has released a music video-inspired advertising film with humorous estimates to show the freedom of the new pump that pumps breast milk.
Four real moms dance in a full-fledged box with a piece of text wire, like, "Yes, I milk myself, but no snakes" and "If you don't know that, this is not sweet, but dark."
The refranch continues: "Pamp out, pump out, I eat the beebs, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies."
But the advertising film, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has caused conflict on the Internet.
The film has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has met mixed reactions from viewers. Many say it sheds light on the "phasor" of the meber industry.
"A very bad decision to use prices to market this product.
Just as we need them to become pregnant and fed in order to produce milk, but their children are taken from them just a few days after birth," writes one person.

Another comments: "I understand it's traumatic for both mothers and children.
But of course, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their children?"
One adds: "What reality is used for advertising. "
Others defend the film, and a woman assumes that she thinks the song is "hysterically fun."
"I think this is brilliant.
I'd have got one if I was still pregnant.
The pump made me feel like a cow.
The advertising film is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a genius product," writes someone.
Another comments: "This is a fun advertising film that turns to moms who pumping (especially on the job or on the toilet) and feels like "cossor".
This is not a film that robs or condemns the mercenary industry."
At the end of the film, the women discover that they have all danced with the discreet pump stuck in the bag.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk say they feel like bread.
But the Elvie pump is completely quiet, has no cables or movements and can be carried in a rubber bag, which gives women the freedom to move, keep their bees and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin is a participant and ECD on Mother, and she says: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a deaf and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women pumping breast milk and milk, we would light on breast pumping and the challenges with it, while we would demonstrate in a consistent and easily recognizable way the extraordinary degree of freedom the new pump provides.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump creates holes.
During London's fashion week a two-year-old lady appeared on the catwalk with designer Marta Jakubowski's clothes while she used the product.
Hundreds of children of migrants quietly moved to a port near the border of Texas
The number of children deprived of their liberty has been high even though the number of persons crossing the border every month has been relatively unchanged, partly because of the emergency rhetoric and hard politics introduced by the Tromp government has made it more difficult to place the children in reference persons.
In the past, most reference persons themselves have been un paperless immigrants, and fear to put their own opportunities in the country of play by expressing their willingness to take a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential reference persons and other adult members of the household would be obliged to print fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Authority, witnessed before the Congress that the authorities had arrested thousands of persons who had requested to be referenced to a single minor.
The Authority subsequently confirmed that 70 % of those arrested were not known by the anti-fraud authorities since then.
"Nearly 80% of those who are either reference persons or family members of reference persons are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue to follow these individuals," said Albence.
In order to deal with children's affairs more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to intervene in law within a month after they were released, rather than after 60 days, which was previously practice, according to staff at the premises.
Many of them are currently on video link rather than personally to bring their speech to legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not assessed have the right to protection shall be deported quickly.
The longer children are deprived of freedom, the more likely it is that they are affected by anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent explosions or refugee attempts, according to staff in the facilities and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
The sponsors say that the alarm increases at large facilities such as Tornillo, where the sign of a child’s more likely is ignored, due to the size of the facility.
They add that if children are moved to the city without having enough time to prepare themselves emotionally and take the danger of friends, many traumatized people are already involved.
Syria requires US, French and Turkish "employment forces" to move back immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to come home, although the country's war is within its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegal in Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "will be handled in accordance with this."
"They must move back immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem stressed that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said that the Government of Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred way until we freed all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, primarily trained and advised both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opponents to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war-ridden country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are good for them to come home, and accused "wise Western countries" of "spreading irrational fear" that force refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They're policyping something that should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no aid for rebuilding Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a fresh agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last great rebellion Idlib has created an opportunity to proceed with political talks.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement halted a massive invasion of Russian-supported Syrian troops against the province, with three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "explain deadlines", and expressed hope that a military intervention would be directed against Jihadists, including warriors from the Al Qaida-related Nusrafront, who "will be defeated".
It is hoped that the United Nations Ambassador Staffan de Mistura will be able to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of the members of the government and members of the opposition in order to make a draft post-war constitution for Syria and the ban on elections.
Moualem set out conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee and said that the group's work would be limited to "examination of the articles in the current Constitution", and warned of involvement.
Why Donald Trump will win a change
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the 2020 election if his presidency did not come to an end in the past through wealth and scandal, which many liberal viewers are likely to hope for.
In what would no doubt be "the most dramatic final of a presidential ever!"
There are no signs that the viewers are tired.
Since 2014, the number of titarate numbers in the best delivery time has been doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and are almost three times that high, 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at best delivery time, which is an increase of 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen. The MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has raised the list of cable channels with as many as 3.5 million viewers during major news evenings.
"This is like a fire that people are drawn to, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, who drives the show for ABC's drama "Designed Survivor", which deals with a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroyed Capitolium.
Nell Scowell is a multi-year comedy writer and has written "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club". She has another theory.
She remembers a tax trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told me he'd vote on Donald Trump.
Then why? She asked.
"He said, 'To make me laugh,' says Nell Scowell to me.
There's a maintenance value in the case.
Of course, it is so that, unlike everything else on TV, the Washington report can determine the future of the legal case in abortion, Roe vs Wade, if immigrant families can be restored and the benefits of the global economy.
Shutting down is a joke that only the most privileged viewers have consulted.
However, it is also possible to be an informed citizen when suddenly supported and watched in six hours on an expert panel that debates Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" to his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's bomber jacket for $15,000 ("a plague filled with hybrids", said Washington Post) and the meaning of Stormy Daniel's macabre descriptions of Donald Trumps, hm, anatomy.
I'll never see Super Mario in the same way again.
"A part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality series is that he comes with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, vd for Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the rotating role of the Trump track and daily intrige (much green with NFL, promised Kim Jong-un).

When I spoke to the TV producer Mr. Fleiss this week, it was the sun and 27 degrees outside his house in northern Kauai in Hawaii, but he sat and looked inside and looked at MSNBC while he was playing a send from CNN.
He couldn't stand up, not when Brett Kavanaugh was placed before the Senate's judicial committee and the future of the Supreme Court was low in the corner.
"I remember when we made all those crazy programs back then and people said, 'This is the beginning of Western civilization'," said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from flows into the same connection sometime before the mid-year choice
It is not surprising that the 17th convention district of Pennsylvania receives a lot of money. It is thanks to a restructuring of a convention district that has made two members now compete in the same place.
This recently bordered district in Pittsburgh is represented by the Democratic Conor Lamb, who took his place in another district at a special election last summer.
Lamb campaigns against another member, Republican Keith Rothfus. He is currently representing the old 12th district in Pennsylvania, which in large measure covers the new 17th district.
The maps were written after the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January that the old districts were constitutionally modified for the benefit of the Republicans.
The merger in the new 17th district has resulted in a campaign funding dispute between the largest economic sections of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee, (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a great victory in a wide-guarded special election in March to the 18th convention district of Pennsylvania.
This place had been occupied by a republic for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts had given the Democrats a certain motive.
USA considered punishing El Salvador for China's support but then returned
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with Panamas President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama, until the members joined the Trump Organization's team.
Officials of the US Foreign Department decided to call home the heads of the American missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "our decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's speaker in a speech earlier this month.
But only sanctions were planned against El Salvador, which was estimated to have received $140 million in US aid in 2017. The money would include drug control and development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including reduced financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American country with its high unemployment and homicide statistics.
At the same time as the internal meetings continued, American and Central American officials held a high-level conference focusing on security and economic well-being in order to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, high officials in the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held, which in practice stopped the consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, which will now take place in mid-October.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
A speaker for John Bolton from Vita Huset refused to comment on the details of the debate, described by the three American officials, two diplomats, who were involved in discussing the internal submissions to the promise of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outstanding analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke anonymously.
Study History
The next inevitable step can be the specific investigator Robert Mueller's report on Donald Trump's alleged infringement of law, which is now available as evidence in public registers.
Mueller is also reported to conduct his research on whether Donald Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in its attack on the US elections.
If the Congress would change the majority, Trump will be held responsible for the assembly immediately when he prepares himself for the election once more, and perhaps finally for a citizen jury.
There are many uncertain factors in this, and I do not want to claim that Trump will inevitably fall, neither will his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to meet different options, both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how the extract of the fight can be.
In 1938, German officials were ready to launch a coup against Hitler, if only the Western nations had taken his stand and turned their backs on the Czechs in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
History surrounds such decisive events, and the inseparable progress of democracy is either accelerated or broken.
The Americans are now facing several of these decisive events.
What should we do if Donald Trump gives Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what is going to happen with Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported that he had proposed to play the President in secret last year, and speculation that he would not be fit for the oath.
Rosenstein says The Times report doesn't agree.
"How should we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if he is allowed to be admitted to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false witnesses?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-year elections at a convention held by Donald Trump?
If we fail in these trials, democracy lies ahead of a dark period.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of what I read in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime as once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me on my way to wear a Saturday light on the table decorated with the jacket.
With what heritage, how could I be more optimistic than the future?"

Graham Dorrans in Rangers is optimistic before the meeting with Rapid Wien
Rangers will receive Rapid Wien on Thursday. They know that they will win against the Austrians after the impressive Spanish match against Villarreal, which ended unexpectedly earlier in the month, will employ them in a strong position to qualify from Group G in Europe League.
A poor middle-aged middle-classer Graham Dorrans prevented from making his first appearance for the season, until the 2-2 match against Villarreal. But he believes that Rangers can use the result as a language bridge against greater success.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good law," says the 31st year.
"We went into the game in faith that we could get something, and from there we went with a point.
We might have been able to get it in the end, but in the big part, there was probably no fair outcome.
They were probably better in the first half, we came back in the second half, and it was better.
Now on Thursday, it becomes an important evening in Europe again.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a fine match. They got a good result at their last match, but if we have the audience with us, we can certainly get up and get a good result.
Last year was very tired, with everything that happened with my injuries and changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The team is good and the guys have fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put the last season behind us and succeed."
Women sleep badly due to the fear of pension savings
Although the participants in the study had a clear picture of how they wanted to be rehabilitated, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the extensive study said they had talked to their partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the step and talk about it, said Holly Snyder, Vice-President for Life Insurance at Nationwide.
So this is where you can start.
Talk to your husband/mother and children: You can't prepare your family to take care of you if you don't talk about how you want it in good time.
Work with your adviser and your family and discuss where and how you want to take care. Your choices can be of great importance to the costs.
Get help from your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your long-term funding options may include a traditional long-term insurance solution, a hybrid solution with cash-insurance to cover the costs, or a self-insurance with your own resources, if you have advice.
Establish legal acts: Avoid legal disputes from the beginning.
Create a healthcare authority so that you can identify a trusted person who looks at your medical care and ensures that the care staff follow your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also an authority for your economy.
Then you choose a trusted person who can make economic decisions in your place and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are not able.
Do not forget the details: Think that you have an elderly parent who is getting into an acute medical condition and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down such details so you're ready.
"It's not just the economy that's playing, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicine is it?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure the plan's ready."
You've been seen several times with air pollution in Ilfracombe
A man was beaten several times with air conditioning when he was promulgated home from an evening.
The victim, who is in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe in Devon when he was shot in the chest, neck and hand.
The police describe the shooting, which took place about 02:30, as a "crazy event".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
The damage is not life-threatening, and the police call the witness to hear it.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that killed the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday. It includes officials. The number of deaths is expected to rise.
The communications are disbanded, and rescue personnel have not yet been able to get any information from the Dodhea management area, a region north of Palu located near the earth’s epicenter. The earthquake measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Dodhia, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Centrala Sulawesi, and is located on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The city’s population was estimated to 379,800 in 2017.
The city was 40 years old when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Dodhea is a management area that extends over 300 km from the northwestern Sulawesis coast.
The administrative area, which is an administrative region under a province in 2017, had a population of 299,200.
The main beneficiaries of the Central Sulawesis economy are fisheries and agriculture, particularly the Dodhea coast region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dodhea have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last hundred years, according to the Indonesian disaster management authority.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes in Dodrea.
In 1996 a tsunami killed nine people.
Indonesia is in the circular seismic fire, often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake at the west coast of the Indonesian Aaeh Province in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries. However, 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A number of mighty earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with magnitude 6.8 on the Richter scale struck south of Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, and dissolved a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A quake with magnitude 7.6 hit the nearby town of Padang, capital of the province of Västra Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude 7.5 struck one of the Mentawa islands outside Sumatra. A tsunami of up to 10 metres was triggered. Thousands of villages were destroyed and about 300 people were killed.
2016: A cause of earthquake struck the management area of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami 2004.
This time no tsunamis are released, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that rose together.
2018: Great earthquakes killed the Indonesian tourist city Lombok. More than 500 people, however, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily set on the beach.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for violence at home
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for trafficking.
Palin, 29 years old and from Vasilla in Alaska, is suspected of violence in the home, for having entered a notification of violence in the home and for resisting arrest, according to a report released on the Saturday of Alaska's State Police.
According to the police report, he must have taken the phone from a woman who tried to call the police and reported the alleged crime.
Palin is free to stay in the Mat-Su shelter and is held against the city at $500 to be paid if the suspected breach against the bourgeois condition, according to the KTUU TV channel.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "guaranteed not guilty" when he was asked to state his position, according to the TV channel.
Palin is suspected for three cases of minor serious crimes under Class A, which means he can get jailed for up to a year and $250,000 in fines.
He has also been accused of a case of minor serious crimes under Class B, which is punished with one day in prison and $2,000 in fines.
It's not the first time Palin's been charged with crime.
In December 2017 he was charged with violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now handled by Alaska's veterinary hospital.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, for having been notified of domestic violence and for the possession of weapons under the influence of that event.
His girlfriend accuses him of hitting her face.
Sarah Palin received criticism from the 2016 veteran groups after she had linked her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome, resulting from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after a earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The earthquake, measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale, dissolved a tsunami and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The electricity supply and communications are down, and the death figures are expected to rise in the next days.
The earthquake struck immediately outside the center of Sulawesi, which lies north of the capital of Jakarta, Indonesia.
Movies that show when it hits the social media now.
Hundreds of people had been gathered to a beach festival in the city of Palu when tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors work on a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are responsible for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist act in New York that killed eight people. It is a rare punishment that has not been executed for a federal offence in the state of the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, has been using a rental car from the building and equipment chain Home Depot to carry out an attack on a road along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan. He landed footsteppers and cyclers on his way to the attack, which took place in October.
In order to cause a death, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "visibly" killed the eight victims and "visibly" caused serious body damage, according to the intentional declaration of death penalty submitted in the Southern District of New York.
Both the charges may involve a death penalty, according to the Court.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was charged with a federal jury at 22 points, including eight cases of murder to support defence activities, often used by federal prosecutors for organised crime, as well as the trafficking and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "abstaining planning and recovery", the prosecutors said, and described at the same time the way Saipov carried it out as "degradable, cruel and inhuman".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucco damage and loss," says the intentional statement.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
New York's southern district has not engaged in a target of death punishment for a decade.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was executed for murder of two knarklars, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was finally implemented in a federal target in New York in 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were sentenced to serve as a spy for the Soviet Union during the so-called war two years earlier.
On 19 June 1953, both of them were sentenced to death in the electric chair.
Saipov, who is a Uzbek citizen, revealed a lack of breath during the days and months following the attack, according to the Court's document.
According to the police, he told the doctors that he was pleased with what he had done.
According to the agreement, Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired by the attack after watching IS films on his phone.
He also asked me to put the IS flag on his hospital room, the police assigned him.
He has not declared himself guilty of the 22 points of claim in the contract.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov. He stated that they are "suddenly disappointed" at the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to commit death punishment instead of going to prison for life without the possibility of conditional release if the accused is to be admitted should only extend the trauma caused by these events to all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's team of defenders had previously asked the defendants not to intervene in the death penalty.
The House of Parliament of Tories says that NIGEL FARGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" today during a protest at the Torie Conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must "know this" from EU sceptics, when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians proposed that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative Member Peter Bone said at the March in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would already "have gone away" if Nigel Farage had been Brexit Minister.
However, the challenge presented by Theresa May in order to bring the deep-rooted accessions to reconciliation has been improved by EU positive tour members, who have joined in a separate protest against Brexit instead.
The Prime Minister is fighting to maintain its compromise plan, the Chequers Agreement, in the face of an attack by Brexit-Hungarians, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU themselves.
Her allies have insisted that she should press and try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the backlog, and force EU sceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package solution and "kaos".
Bone said at a mass meeting organized by the Organisation Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "spola the Chequers Agreement".
He stated that Nigel Farage should have been made equal and held responsible positions in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had stood in the hole, we would have been out at this layer," he said.
Peter Bonne, who represents the Wellingborough district in Parliament, allowed: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we must break the Chequers Agreement".
He explained his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought the world war to be defeated.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the claims that the general opinion would have been changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British would have changed and now want to stay is completely empty."
The Brexitan delegate Andrea Jenkyns from the Tory Party was also on the march and spoke to the journalists. "I just want to say, 'Minister of the Prime Minister, listen to the people.'
The Chequers agreement is impotuous to the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is impotential in the party and our voters who are out on the streets and make sure that we are elected.
Put away the Chequers deal and start listening."
And she gave a clear message to Theresa May: "The Prime Ministers can keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Nigel Farage said at the meeting that politicians must "know this" if they would fail the decision taken and with the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us, that is, the people, and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to defeat Brexit, and we're here today to say to them, 'We're not going to let you get away with it.'
Before the enthusiastic crowd, he said: "I want you to get our political class, which is about to fail Brexit, to know this.
We mobilize the people's army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, EU citizens marched through Birmingham and held a two-hour mass meeting in the central city.
A group of activists rose with banners with the text "Toury Members against Brexit" after the group was launched in the weekend.
Labour Parliamentary Lord Adonis from the Upper House held the conservatives for the security issue they supported with a party app when the conference opened.
"It's these people who say they can have local IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus the agreement, for unlimited boundaries and free trade without borders in Ireland," he said.
"It's a clean father.
There's no good Brexit," he said.
Warren is planning a "well-founder" to apply to the President's post
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to take a "well-founder to apply to the president's post" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the democracy of Massachusetts spoke about its future at a municipal meeting in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren has often criticized President Donald Trump, and is now referring in November to the representative of the Republican State, Geoff Diehl, who was Vice-President of the Donald Trump campaign in Massachusetts 2016.
She's been the subject of speculation about maybe taking Donald Trump 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th city hall meeting with the voters after Donald Trump arrived.
Someone asked her if she was planning to run to the president's post.
Warren said it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our tragic government, which means a woman at the top."
A person caught for the murder of the basketball player Sims from LSU
The police in Baton Rouge in Louisiana announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for the murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The police in Baton Rouge announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 a.m. for E.
They had released a film of the shooting on Friday to help identify a man who looks at the pictures.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot to death near Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died at last," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through the news site 247 sports.
Wayde went to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was arrested and admitted he had been at the scene and had a gun, and he admitted he had shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any incidents and brought to the corner at the police station in East Baton Rouge.
Sims was a junior player, 198 cm long and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 matches with 10 starting last season, and measured at 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton draws closer to the world champion after he won over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes's theaters would play a great role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and almost stopped Hamilton on dry as he defended his position during the first two wars, and invited Vettel to attack his roommate.
Vettel went to the roof first and let Hamilton drive in the back of the hall, which should have been decisive.
Mercedesen went to the bottom of a war later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after a little wheel-mot-wheel-action where Ferrari's driver otherwise left the inside at risk to offer a double cut to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen started in the back row and left seven at the end of the first war on his 21st year.
He then led a large part of the course and stayed in the roof to reach a quick measurement and drive about Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
Finally, he came to the roof at 44 o'clock but was not able to raise the pace during the remaining eight o'clock when the Raikkon went up to fourth place.
It's a hard day, because Valtteri did a wonderful job all week and was a right gentleman who let me through.
The team has done an exceptional job and got one and two," Hamilton said.
Really Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump handed down Senator Diane Feinstein at a mass meeting on Saturday, because she maintains that she has not lied to Christine Blasey Ford in what Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to judges in the Supreme Court, is accused of sexual abuse.
The President, who spoke at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not directly raise the witness target from Ford before the Senate's Justice Committee. Instead, he commented that what happened in the Senate showed that the people were "althought, undecided and false."
"The only thing that could have happened and the fine thing that has happened in the last days of the century, when you see the evil, when you see people who are angry, vain, undecided and lying," he said.
"I see the press message and jokes and then they say, 'No, I haven't.
I haven't done it.'
Do You Remember?
Did you smell it, Diane Feinstein?
Do you remember her answer? 'Have you liked the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I didn't like it.'
Wait a minute.
'No, we didn't smell anything,' he admitted, and imitated the senator.
The letter with details of Ford's charges against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and was released in September, but Feinstein refused to have come from her office.
"I didn't know Ford's accusations, I didn't like her story," said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill newspaper.
"She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she wanted."
But her dementia doesn't seem to fit the president, who, during the Saturday evening meeting, commented: "I must say you are a thing, that was really bad body language.
She may not have done it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continues to support the candidate to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual abuse by three women, and he stated that the Democrats used the complaints for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back the power with all the necessary resources.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive to get power and control," said the President, according to the digital news site Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two targets for Belfast Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars celebrated the loss of peace in Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Belfast Giants received an early two-way tour by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie voted in favour of the home meal before Dwyer re-established Belfast Giants.
Francois Bouchard tweeted for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League for the season of Adam Keef's law, which came from behind and struck Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season for the two laws, and Belfast Giants had won the three previous matches.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on assistance from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford gave assistance when Beauvilleer doubled the lead four minutes later.
During the intense first period, Sullivan returned home to the match at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered it to Cownie, who was at 15:16.
Dwyer saw that Belfast Giants was in the lead at the first phase when he made his second goal for the night at the end of the first period.
The House regrouped and Bouchard resigned once more with a goal in power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second period, and he secured the win with his law's fifth half-way through the final period.
Belfast Giants, who has now lost four of his last five matches, will play home against Milton Keynes at his next match on Friday.
However, it is possible for hundreds of people on a plane to fly from the ground.
A pilot in Indonesia is now hailed as a hero after he left when he saw that a plan with hundreds of people on board was safe.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a great earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy demand continues to plague the area and many are standing in the bridge in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung left his post in the wildly weakened control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Airs flight 6321, which was then located on the starting road, could safely rise.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was going to rain.
He left the hospital later.
The speaker for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of people's lives, according to the Australian TV channel ABC News.
"We arranged with a helicopter from the Balikpapan on Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, he left early this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
We're upset to hear this," he said.
At the same time, the authorities order that the number of deaths rise to over a thousand people. The disaster aid authority of the country says that there is limited access to the cities of Dodhea, Sigi and Boutong.
"The number of deaths is believed to continue to increase as there are still many bodies remaining in the ruins, and many have not been able to reach," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the authorities.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes fly in aid and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with dead bodies.
It's a shame about clean water.
The minimum markets are global."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help survive, but we don't know what they're going to meet there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can be much worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia called on Palu on Sunday and said to the military of the country: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the information related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" according to CNN.
Indonesia was killed earlier in the year of earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people were killed.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that a man is missing after a plane crashed into a plane
The airline responsible for the plan that broke down in a law in Micronesia in the Pacific states that one man is missing. It was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had been removed from the fallen planet and were safe.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not answer the questions about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Lokala boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water when it tried to land at the airport in Chuukóarna.
On Friday, employees reported that seven people had been brought to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and how the event looked.
The airline and the American fleet both reported that the planet landed in the ponds without reaching the landing path.
Some of the Witnesses thought that the planet was happy along the way.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the planet flew into very low.
"That's very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others were able to make things through the deep water to the needs of the fallen planet.
He said the cabin staff got panic and screamed, and he got a little bit of a headache.
The U.S. fleet said that seamen working near the development of a shipyard also helped in the rescue work by using a floating boat to drive people in the country before the planet fell in the 30 meters deep water.
Data from Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have experienced accidents with airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analyticals draw up a time line for the night when a woman is burned alive
On Saturday, the complainant concluded his complaint in the second trial against a man who was charged with burning a woman in Mississippi living in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spoke in hours as an expert in the field of reporting analysis.
He explained for the jury how he had used cell phones to put together the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber's movements the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location information from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers that night, however, which contradicts his previous claim, reported The Clarion Ledge.
When the information showed that his cell phone was with Chamber's cell phone during the period he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis about the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying because my car was in Nashville.
Another objection was that Tellis reported that he had met Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phones showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis once after Chambers' death radioed Chambers' text message, conversation and contact information from his phone.
"He kicked her out of her life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final launch on Sunday.
The judge said he was waiting for the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is the consciousness of the hippop?
A hipop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol seems to have come far from its origin in political messages and to attack social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hipop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently received a rehearsal in Britain through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
A black again?!
A child girl in New York votes a couple because of a "racist" text message
A child girl in New York agrees with a couple of discriminatory remarks after she received a false text message from modern, who complained that she was "a black again".
The couple deny that they would be racist and compare the wording to "expression".
Two - year - old Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed surprise when she realized that the new child girl Giselle Maurice was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"NIEEEEEEEEEI AND SVART IGEN," wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman in a SMS to his husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice twice.
After she had made her mistake, the Plato-Flaxman was "misleading" and gave Maurice the spray, and claimed that their former child girl, who was African America, had done a bad job and that she was expected to be a Filipino woman, according to New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a day's work and sent home in taxis.
She now agrees with the couple to get compensation for the cancellation. She seeks compensation in the scheme $350 per day for her work from the beginning to do, which would be in six months and where she would live with the couple.
"I want to show them that you don't do that," she said to New York Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple's complaint is that they would be racist and say that it was the only thing they wanted to end the Giselle Maurice job, and they were worried that they couldn't trust her when they abused her.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said the maker Joel Plasco to New York Post.
"But would you trust your children to someone whom you had been rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Seriously. "
Plasco compared the wording to "expression" and said that his wife would give birth to children two months later and found herself in a "very difficult situation".
"Would you like to give yourself to such a person?
It is not particularly pleasantly done," the investment banker Plasco granted.
The process of justice is still under way, but the general opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media and criticises them for their behaviour and rationality.
The Paddington commentators did not believe that readers could relate to a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Paddington's author, Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, commented: "It's hard to think about how it was for a person who read it for the first time before it was released.
It's very funny, given what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She told her father, who had worked as a cameraman on BBC before he was inspired by a small playboy to write the book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She allowed the 60-year-old jubilee of the first edition to be "biter life" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family" and allowed her father to be proud of his final success.
"He was pretty quiet about himself, and not a funny person," she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds with something. You get proud of the child even though it's not one who's got it.
I think he saw Paddington's achievements a little bit like that.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination he always used to give Paddington himself honor."
My daughter was going to die, and I was gonna take a walk in the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors worked to save her life.
"Now she called regularly to say that it was really bad, and that she wasn't expected to be all right," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad who said she would die within two minutes and that I had to take care of her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my love.
I'll come to you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The doctors who had given her her to keep her heart in her life slowly out and left her body.
She had died right before, and now everything went down.
I just got to sit there and wait and know that all of this happened.
I couldn't cry or cry or cry, because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now experienced the loss of her daughter, went on board the planet with the other passengers, who were fully convinced of the difficult test she was going through.
"No one knew about it," she said.
"I bowed my head, and the tears ran all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt a great feeling for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Surgeoning women put up tickets to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost a lot of their lives because of suicide are working to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that can be called for support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to need to have as bad as I do every day," she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney. She tells me her son was a promising cook who had an infectious legend.
"Everyone knew who he was because of his passion.
They said that his fiancée was listening to the room."
But he stopped working before he died because he was "in a very dark place."
Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his cousin when he took his life in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, "I'm worried about consequences all the time."
Sharon Davis created the map "for people to know that there are people you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be quiet, talk about it."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been a friend to Sharon Davies for years, lost his partner 15 years ago, Mark, a time after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt humiliated or depressed or anything," she says.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he was different.
He was on the floor at Christmas. When the children opened their Christmas cakes, he had no contact with them or anything."
She says his death was a very hard blow for them, but they have to take through it. "It's a family injury.
It's killing us.
But we have to go on fighting all of them."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI initiates an investigation
"I thought if we could achieve something similar to what he asked about - a limited study in time and size - we might have some agreement," said Jeff Flake on Saturday, and he allowed him to fear that the committee would be "distributed" due to deep-rooted divisional differences.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their resistance depends entirely on the time.
The mid-year elections will be held only five weeks, on 6 November. If the Republicans make a bad choice, which is expected, they will be strongly weakened in their attempts to get the one they want to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called the senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the Vita house and through him met his wife Ashley, who was a personal secretary to George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the afternoon, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are now sitting.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would make Vice-President Mike Pence break the death sentence and confirm his opposition to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean jumpers under Kim
The number of North Koreans that jump from South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, says a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-Seug, quoting data from the Ministry of Reunification of South Korea, says 1,127 people had hoped for last year, compared with 2,706 years 2011.
Park says that greater border controls between North Korea and China and higher charges for human trafficking are important reasons.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The majority of North Korea’s kidnappers are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have been crossing the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of the flights across China, which have the longest border to North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China sees the kidnappers as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often send them back with violence.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is technically still in conflict with each other, has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks focusing on the ongoing negotiations on nuclear weapons equipment.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, charged the US sanctions for the lack of success since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we can absolutely not fight ourselves unilaterally first," said Ri at a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh for "hysterical", saying he is inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader of the chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterically" and said that he was inexplicably inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosis comments came in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin in Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had acted like this, she would be called 'hysterical'," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became sensitive when he rejected the charges of having sacrificed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when both were teenagers.
During his opening session, Kavanaugh was very sensitive, and then he almost gave up his voice when he spoke about his family and years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats of the Committee and said that the charges against him were a "great and coordinated character murder" organized by liberals who were guilty of losing Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she felt that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as it showed that he was a party to the disadvantage of the Democrats.
"I think he is disqualifying himself with his statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi doubted when she was asked if she would try to put Kavanaugh in the hands of the law if he was attacked, and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this - if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he is not only inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court he is currently in," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Appeal in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi allowed her as a Democrat to be concerned about what decisions Kavanaugh might take against the Unfortable Care Act or the abortion of Roe vs. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In its confirmation questions, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It is not a position for a hysterical and dusty person to put himself in court and expect us all to intervene," Pelosi said.
Women have to stand out.
It's a fair criticism, months and years of love that cooks over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual.
And she continued: "I got good help from a woman who was a VD somewhere. She said that she also cried when she was angry, but had developed a technique that included that when she was angry and started crying she said to the person she was talking to: 'You might think I'm sorry because I cry.
I'm angry.'
And then she went on.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed to get out of anger partly because they are often misunderstood in the background.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs at a mandominated office, where I once cried out of unexplained love, was that I was taken into the hands of an older woman. It was a quiet boss I had always been a little scared for, and she took me into a trap.
"Never let them see that you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sorry and they're happy that they were able to press you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was engaged in an unskilled business on a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason not to investigate the idea of setting himself up in the presidential election.
"It wasn't a well-planned decision," she said with a smile to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates.
Someone called it 'Snovet and the seven bastards'."
Because she was late out, she left with the money collection, and promised not to go in as a candidate if she didn't get $2 million together.
It was a project condemned to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting fired?" she wondered.
When she announced in a speech that she would not start a formal presidential campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to collect money and focus on voters rather than delegates, and love for sex, that the vote stopped.
"You could have thought I had had a nervous breakdown," Schröder recalled near the reactions of the press.
"I could have thought Kleneex was my company sponsor.
I remember thinking, 'What are they gonna write on my grave?'
"She's crying?"
Why the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The opening of the US-China trade war was an earmarking. The war is far from over, but the gap between countries can benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first Warning Committee earlier this year by placing important Chinese exports such as solar panels, steel and aluminium with duties.
The most important withdrawal came in the week, with new customs duties on goods for $200 billion. This means in practice that half of all goods coming into the United States from China are customs duties.
Beijing has responded with the same coin every time. Recently, it was reduced to between five and ten per cent of US goods for $60 billion.
China has promised to match the US's actions. The world's next largest economy is probably not going to fall in due course.
To get Washington back means to fight for requirements, but to get public grip on the United States would be just too generous for China's President Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if Beijing is playing its short rights, the US trade war can provide a positive support to China in a long term by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
"A fast political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions for economic panic in the single country, and it is actually much more dangerous than the considerations have already been recognised," says Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria "redo" for returning refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that the country is ready to receive voluntary return refugees and cries for help to build the country, which is in ruins after more than seven years of war.
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country are now improving.
"The situation in place today is more stable and secure, thanks to our success in combating terrorism," he said.
The Government continues to build up areas that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
There are now all conditions for voluntary return of refugees to their country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures directed against their daily lives and pensions.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have moved the country since the war began in 2011.
More than six million people still living in the country need humanitarian support.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would have welcomed assistance in rebuilding the damaged country.
But he stressed that it does not accept conditional support or assistance from countries that have given rise.
Europe with the winner of Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by winning Team USA with the final 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times on the European market and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when the Danish captain Thomas Björn's team reached the 14.5 points required to strike the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who fought hard during most of the tournament, got into the water at the end of the 16th floor of the hall, and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari shined in all rounds and became one of the four players who have ever done 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was introduced in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was shot out 5 & 4 of the lowest ranked player in the European House, Thorbjörn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest ranked player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who could have made his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, who is a veteran with eight Ryder Cup behind, was once the most successful European of the tournament with 25.5 career points.
"I don't use crying, but today I can't help it.
It's been a fine year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed me.
I'm so happy to win back the winner.
It's about the layer, and I'm glad that I could be of help," said a Russianman named Garcia after the victory of the European Act.
He left over the lead pen to his countryman John Ram who won the American golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in single on Sunday.
"What extraordinary pride, to have to beat Tiger Woods. I am raised to look at him, said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four matches in France, and now has the result 13-21-3 for his career in Ryder Cup.
A special statistics for one of the world's best players ever, who have won 14 major titles, which has only been overcome by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA fought all weekend to find fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after the collapse of the layer: "I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
It was the day in the morning when we increased the temperature in Europe.
We took the sword.
The hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the US PGA tour and our Ryder Cup committee and then we're going on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be the captain.
You're gonna get a bug and a book.
They played better than we."
The flower: The leaves are reduced in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Floridas Fisheries and Wild Commission shows a general reduction in concentrations of algae flowering for parts of the area around Tampa Bay.
According to the Commission, there are different flowerings in the areas around the large municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier.
The algaflower extends about 20 miles from the coast, from north Pinellas to south Lee.
Flags can be seen about one and a half miles out of the sea outside the large municipality of Hillsborough, but in less places than last week.
Allegflowering has also been observed in the large municipality of Pasco.
Average concentrations in or outside the coast of Pinellas have been reported during the past week. Outside Hillsborough's coast is low to high concentrations, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee, background concentrations to high concentrations in or out of the coast in Sarasota, background concentrations to medium concentrations in or outside the coast of Lee, and low concentrations in Collier.
Reports of the spiritual irrigation continue to come from the large municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There were no reports of the spiritual resurrection in northern Florida last week.
