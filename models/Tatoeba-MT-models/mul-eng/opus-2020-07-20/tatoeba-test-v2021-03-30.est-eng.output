He's a reliable scientist.
This man must be a boy.
Where are they?
I didn't read it.
Why does it bother you?
Don't you ever give up?
Is there an English-Japan dictionary in the empire?
The older I get, the less I understand.
It's not good.

Two days ago, that wind spoke.
I don't speak French well enough!
Why me?
I know where Tom was born.
I don't have a good dictionary, though.
Didn't I warn you?
I should have said yes.
Grammatics are very hard.
I can run.
Good luck!
My friend's a nice friend.
Are you doing this?
It was too difficult for him to solve.
You have to do it now.

How did it get there?
I'm very tired right now.
I'm not trying to figure it out.
Good time.
We don't need him.
Did you have a good time last night?
Why didn't you apply for this job?
It's a fish.
Give me a report.

I like your visit.
If I ask you a favor?

It's too clear to me that it's true.
May I have your attention?
Do you think Tom's lying to us?
I'm a pretty good dreamer.
I'll stay overnight.

Animals, please.

Tom's already there.
He chose a good woman.

Good night to everyone!
I'm not doing it anymore.
Who brought it?
I won't go tomorrow.

It was mine.

Tom wanted it to be a surprise.

I can assure you Tom is able to speak French.
The evidence does not support the claim.
What should I say?
Excuse me...
What school did you go to?

You don't want to know.
How much does it cost?
I'm glad that's good for you.
Tom didn't give up.
Someone told me I shouldn't trust you.
I ate lunch two and a half hours ago.
Tatoeba is a multifaceted word.
Besides you, I don't have any real friends.
Tom couldn't answer my questions.
What's the problem?
As far as I can remember, I have always had thoughts and ideas that at the time seemed to make me unique.
I was a little hungry.
You can start.
Are you taking it?
Dad's driving to work.
Say, a few, three, a nine, a five, a half, a half, a half, a half, a ten.
These promises are not mine.
Tom's on lunch.
Give me my money back.
It's a very big social problem.

Let's go.
I didn't think you'd be wrong.
Don't move!

Is that what Tom has told you?
I was just kidding.
I'm Chinese.
Tom and Mary made pipe casings.
That's so funny!
Is that all right with you?
You liked Tom.
We knew it.
Can I cancel the ticket?
Tom wants to open his own restaurant.
I remember that.
Please don't stand.
Tom's coming with you.
Tom's friendly.
He's a little man.
I have to go to sleep.
Why would Tom want to see Mary?
Did anyone notice my lack?
Was that interesting?
Life is beautiful.
I'm sorry I didn't work hard as a young man.
You've got a headache.
What happened?
Tom tried to hide his identity.
The earth is flat.
How old were your kids when you went to Boston?
I don't understand why you're so worried.
How should it work?
I've only been there for a while.
I want a book.
What are you waiting for?
Please hurry!
We're walking between the sidewalks.
Tatoeba was temporarily unavailable.
I don't know.
Good evening.
Do I have to pay you back?
I went to the car somewhere else.
I should have told you earlier.
There is a difference.

They want to see you.
Why don't you go first?

I've got three boxes.
Please help me.
He got a piano player.

He's a good boy, and that's why he likes me.
I told you Tom was ready.
I have two eyes.
He's got a nice voice.
Can you copy me?
That's a tough decision.
I'll help you in a few minutes.
I live in Japan.
Do they understand?
I'm tired and I want to sleep.
I don't like living alone.
I need to help Tom clean up his room.
Do you think I still love him?
I'm eating my sister's lunch right now.
I'm tired and I want to go home.
I've got water in the kitchen today.
I'm sorry.
There's a lot of stuff.
Tom didn't look very happy.
I'm done.
I want to measure like it here!
Tom said he had to leave.
Of course!
Tom tried to kill himself.
Probably.
I was swimming in Boston three weeks ago.
There's a couple of horses on the horse.
I have one prayer for you.
Good night!

We've got enough to eat.
I can run.
Are you on this proposal or against it?
Can you see that?
As long as Mary had left Tomas, John was with the Russians in front of her door.
I have a cat and a dog, a cat is black and a dog is white.
Kiss me.

I don't want to live with you.
I'm volunteer.
Help me!
It's safer to stay here.
Hi, Mike.
They're wonderful.

Tom sat down with his sister-in-law.
Why aren't you in college?
Your death is gone.
I'm not embarrassed.
My brother gave me a kiss.
I have questions.
Many people like to travel.
Tom lied about his price.
That's gotta be a trap.
Tell me.
I'm afraid Tom's not here.
A dialogue based on mutual respect.
It made me dream.
Tom died last year.
According to the flight, it's dark tomorrow.
I didn't say hi.
This is where Tom died.
I was told I wouldn't touch it.
Thank you!
I saw what you were doing.
I'm the only one living with my children in Urumqis.
I know what it's talking about.
Did you cook the cake?
I want my sister.
The day is red.
Listen!
Tom didn't want to lose.
From heaven, it looked like a sea of snow.
I want my box.
I'm telling the truth.
They refused to talk to me, despite my prayers.
I got it!
Life is never easy.
There's enough room for you.

Do it faster.
They're very good.
Please come and look at me from time to time.
Tom hopes to earn a lot of money after his mother's death.
Wow!
You're a quick student.
I can handle it myself.
Good weekend.
Tell me about it!
He didn't have a bottle.
Get out of here.
John sent me a letter from Germany.
If Tom hadn't saved you, you'd have died.
I don't speak Irish.
Tom doesn't usually do his homework before dinner.
You've got a fever.
This book is about excellence.
Tom, I'll never leave you.
I don't have much time.
You'd like Boston.
Wherever I don't look, there's only a lift and a lift.
I got a car.
Try again.
Maybe Tom's been serving it.
I have two sons.
I want a book.

Same kept his eyes open.

What do you want?
Tom got too late.
In the middle of the clouds, it's raining over the water.
I don't need food.
What's your mother's name?
How could I trust you?
I'm not afraid of cold, but I don't want heat.
Your criticism isn't based on it.
Are we eating out today?
Take care of it.
If you lend anyone $20 and you never see that person again, it's probably worth it.
Where are you from?
It sounds like Hollywood's movie sucks.
I'm talking to Tom about it.
I'd like a city map, please.
I'll start tomorrow.
Ask him his name.
That was really terrible.

What am I eating?
If you want to be loved, love!

Thank you!
I'll call you tomorrow.

The city is beautiful.
Everything's ready.
How old are you?
I'm happy.
Good morning!
I looked at the TV instead of learning.
I'm talking to Tom about it.
Can you shut the door?
I think we should call the police.
What are your thoughts?
Hey, don't get me into this.
I'm afraid it could hurt Tom.
I decided to go there.
Many of my friends came from my childhood too.
You're falling.
Ooh!
It is clear that nobody has any new proposals.
Do you eat rice every day?
I don't like your proposal.
Who's Emily?
Maybe we can see it again.
What friend is he?
How many calories are there in a hundred grams?
Trust is not a strategy.
If I'm going to go forever, bad things will happen.
My eyes don't work very well anymore.
Love loves love.
Get in the other wall of their house.
