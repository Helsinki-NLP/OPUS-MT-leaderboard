Barack Obama will be the fourth United States president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, such as the fourth US President of history.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and check will be received, inter alia, through exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive at the Norwegian Metropolis in the morning and have much to do.
First, visit to the Nobel Institute, where you will first meet with the five members of the committee who, in October, elected you between 172 people and 33 organizations.
Later, the presidential couple planned a meeting with the king of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon the visit will conclude with a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious Gilead.
He will be the fourth president of the United States who receives him, although the third one who receives him in his charge.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the prize, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the award as president of a country currently in war in two countries.
His military efforts increased further with the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, which does not forget to mention any of its critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, the diploma and check of ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
It is proposed to give them charitable paraffins, but it has not yet decided which organization in particular.
During its entire programme, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet to which they will attend, in addition to the Norwegian kings, the first Minister and 250 other guests.
Obama had a more well-served attitude towards the prize from the outset.
He mentioned, for example, the feeling that everything is not worth it.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him but for all who struggle for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action".
Defender of the alleged cantage nature
La Policia de Litoméríce accusó de cantaje al presidente de la sociación civica Society for the Protection of the Nature of Litomérice (Sociedad dedefensores de la naturaleza Litomérice).

Brno doesn't like the containers too much to separate the garbage
In Prague, citizens can separate drinks packages and can find containers to separate waste everywhere.
And Brno?
Allies need several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don't want to say that Brno doesn't separate for nothing.
It seems to me that, in order to be the second largest city of the Republic, associations are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is totally delayed in the separation of bass, not only because we, citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastics, but especially by the number of containers for these residues.
Have they ever tried, for example, to put a PET bottle in the centre to the appropriate container?
It's almost impossible, especially it takes a lot of time and patience.
The only place I've found so far is at the Moravské namästí square, in front of the Potrefena Huse.
Don't get angry with me, Mr. Onderka and his companions, but that seems too little to me.
There is no need to mention that in other parts it is not easy to separate the garbage.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate it.
By Vagancia
What's going on is that the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I offered myself, after a party, to empty several bottles of glass and plastic.
But there was no red container near the Kaunicova Street.
Fortunately, by the way, I found the right place.
However, the garbage was already removed from the container.
It's still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?!
What's happening is that ecology and aesthetics don't seem to be too interested in socialists in Brno.
They prefer to buy you the hockey extract in the city, which shames us all over the Republic, and not buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials so Brno is cleaner.
I'm glad to be able to compare my hypotheses, after browsing the Internet for a while, with official statistics.
According to the ECO-KOM society, Brno is indeed the worst of the entire Jihomoravský krakë region.
The Paroubek budget has taken away money from pensions and sickness subsidies
After the left, despite the Government's opinion, would add funds to farmers or employees, it may not be sufficient for the budget to have enough money for pensions, sickness subsidies or for the construction of buildings.
But neither for the interests of the State debt or international disputes.
This will damage all those who rule in the second half of the coming year, said Hácienda Eduard Janata.
When social democracies and communists forced the increase for some groups, they were convinced that the government would then ask for a loan for sensitive, interest or sickness subsidies. "That implies just putting up problems for the future, it is putting mines," Janata says.
What happens is that, when money is taken out, you have to pay higher interest rates and, someday, you have to return the money.
The State does not have many options to make money.
If it does not reduce the social subsidies or operating costs of the State, it must increase taxes.
To all who added the left now: bombs, masters, farmers.
And later on, also to their children.
People don't have to worry about sickness pensions or subsidies, they'll get them.
But the price to pay will be the increase in public debt; the coming year will not be lost in the treasure only 163,000 million, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will continue to increase together with the costs of interest.
The State will need money to cover them and will no longer bring about a slight increase in VAT or reduced maternity subsidies, as the Government has done in its package against deficit.
Due to the transfers of money to some electoral groups, the coming year will also require five billion dollars to complete the construction of buses and railways.
This is mainly the sectors in which the bid has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their price cannot be reduced.
The maximum you can do is save them, which is not free either.
This means a delay or termination of the thirty major buildings; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warning the representative of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD proposed a salmonic solution for the reduction of funds: it will obtain money from the ČEZ dividends, which is mostly owned by the State, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe nor is it a fundless bag.
Last year ČEZ was devoted to the budget of 18 billion.
Each year dividends are liquidated by environmental damage, serve to complete the interest account or serve as a reserve for the preparation of interest reform.
In addition, this trend, according to EU rules, increases the real deficit of the budget at the level of 5.7% of GDP.
Carnival of money transfers doesn't end here.
Nearly three billion were obtained from the budget to pay several compensations to the victims of communism and crime, or for fighting costs, even in the construction savings.
It is not clear whether the State will need such funds.
It's a lotteries.
If we lose some international dispute, maybe we'll have to pay it, Janato says.
Thereafter, the Minister will have to save money within the resort or, in the worst case, the right hand of the Government's budget reserve.
There are also hundreds of millions already missing for the project Statäní pokladna (State Fund), whose price is 2,000 million and which has already been started. It must be allowed to monitor online what the different authorities are spending.
The first stage starts in January.
If the Minister of Finance does not find the money on the other hand, the project will have to be stopped and sanctions will come, warns Janata.
Your future smart phone can work with two operating systems
The United States will have a mobile phone in which the user can, by pressing a key, switch between several operating systems.
The plans revealed sound promising.
With just pressing a key, they pass in seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
This is precisely the goal of the U.S. company VMware, which focuses mainly on developing software virtualising for computers.
On your mobile you can take two user profiles at once.
They can change between them and divide them between home and work.
Both operate simultaneously, Srinivas Krishnamurti indicated from VMware company in the interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year, and several days ago it was demonstrated for the first time.
It will be launched in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is no longer a fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, where the systems mentioned, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of new mobile phones technology is in its support.
The VMware company cooperates with European and US operators to perform smartphone virtualization tests and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains worries hotelers
Not only the Telexers in Krkonoše worry about the tracks without snow.
The lack of snow makes people not book ski resorts in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Krkonoše you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including Nochebuena and Nochevieja.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at the offers, check the prices, but they're still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether these Navidities will have snow or bar," said the holder of the Spindl Information portal.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to pass in Špindlerův Mlýn a Nochevieja according to their expectations should no longer hesitate to reserve the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation in second place can try to wait a few more days.
Špindlerov Mlýn hotels offer mostly weekly stations for Nochevija.
I think they'll continue to offer them, but soon they'll give and offer shorter stops.
And then the free rooms will be sold quickly, he loved Jandura.
Ingotors, a Vrchlabí travel agency, continues to offer free beds for all winter days.
Now what matters most is the navid week, which is still not complete.
Half of the places offered are still free.
That's why we've already prepared some last-minute navigation stations," said Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
Vrchlabí travel agency can still offer the Nochevieja in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first forty days of February are sold very well, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stations is damaged by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if there's snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the snow-free mountain.
If the tracks remain cloudy during the week, the Christmas dates will also deteriorate," Schiefert said.
On the contrary, it's a little easier to keep the rooms in the hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For Nochevieja and Christmas, we have the latest free places.
Interest increases during Polish holidays in January and February is also well-selling," the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada, reported.
Eighty percent of the Nochevieja stations are also busy in the hotel Omnia, near the central parking area in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, in the most recent hotel in Janské Lázní in Navidade, half of the beds are still free.
This January was a great surprise for us, as we found about 60 percent of the capacity to employ.
February has been a bit weaker, but as snow falls, the interest for the stations in Krkonoše will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, hotel manager Omnia.
However, it seems for a moment that Krkonoše hotelers will be given snow gain while waiting.
Thursday should fall temperatures and, if there are precipitations, in the mountains should snow.
But then again, the temperatures will rise, reports Jiří Jakubský de Hradec Králové, of the Hydrometerological Institute of the Czech Republic.
U.S.: The repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is funny that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats in the matter the strategy of his predecessor, which he himself took for the worst.
When he finally revealed his Afghan approach, eagerly expected, it proved to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only is the phrase "like in Iraq" used several times in the same text, but it was not used in using the title of the Bush declaration of January 2007 for its own statement: "A new way forward".
It was him, who three years ago criticized Bush's idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country suffering from civil war, and that criticized him as "an irresponsible decision and with catastrophic consequences".
The following months, however, demonstrated that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful, so that nothing in the news is spoken of today.
Bush's reputation did not improve, however objectively left his successor a much more favourable initial situation than he expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama is waiting for the miracle to be repeated.
The camp commanders again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the chief commander of the Afghan operation, Stanley McCristal. He, despite the traditional subordinated relations, subjected the indiscriminate fuses in the White House to a harsh criticism.
He asked 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president withdrew for three months, but nothing better happened to him, so at least he lied to the general about 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to achieve that Europe would promise another 5,000, although he himself had previously counted at least 10,000.
The most problematic of all Obama's strategy seems to be its goal, to start withdrawing the Afghan troops in 18 months and finalizing this procedure in three years.
Many doubt that the increase gives the same result as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricated wars in recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: it is not possible to trust anyone and no agreement is reached.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces if they are accustomed to change their boss every day according to their needs.
The political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin, after which they will remain patriarchal tribal relations.
To balance the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely complex because of the confusion, even more complicated by the influence of Pakistani and Iran.
Not even establishing a state that is "capable of action", a minimum objective of all operations, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama's strategy is shocked by its volunteerism.
During the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and is now about to stop.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing about the reality, can believe that the soldiers sent to the war to "come home soon", will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date of withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will consider it an indirect declaration of defeat by the United States.
The latest NATO summit has demonstrated that Europeans are increasingly willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians don't know, and they don't want to explain to their voters what the safety of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with the Hindu Kush.
Another factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not have any effect on Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to find the answers exactly when, according to Obama, America begins the withdrawal of the Afghan troops.
However, each solution will mean a dramatic revision to the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that three years are missing for presidential elections and therefore there is still much time to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.
Goldman Sachs Bank's directors will no longer receive the bonuses in effect
The U.S. bank executives Goldman Sachs will not receive the bonuses this year in effect.
The entity announced it to react to the critical nature of its wage practices.
The group of 30 high directives shall receive, instead of money, shares which cannot be sold within a minimum period of five years.
In addition, actions may be withdrawn if they have taken excessive risks.
According to the Reuters agency, Goldman Sachs became the leader in an effort to unite the bonuses in Wall Street with the long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longest way to start, mentioned the former investment banker of the JPMorgan Douglas Elliott company.
The problem is in detail, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank faced the criticism after it had set aside nearly $17,000 million (about $300,000 million) for bonuses in the first three trimesters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to Reuters, is probably over, despite today's announced measure, $20,000.
High bonuses in the banking sector became, with the coming of the financial crisis, a delicate issue in politics.
Britain announced the Wednesdays to record once, with a tax of 50 percent, the bonds for banks that exceed 25 000 pounds (about 72,000 CZK) .
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received the Nobel Prizes in all the less physical categories
Five women, which is a record number, received today at Stockholm by King Carlos XVI Gustavo de Sweden's Nobel Prizes this year in specialized categories and in literature.
In addition to the four scientists, there was also a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine was awarded by two U.S. biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as his partner Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel in chemistry received the Israeli Ada Jonathan and the US Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz by explaining the structure and function of the ribsomas.
The last prize awarded, the Nobel Prize for Economy, was received by U.S. Elinor Ostrom and his partner Oliver Williamson for an analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without a prized woman, was Physical.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each prized collected the diploma, Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to ten million Swedish crowns (about 25 million Czech crowns).
In the case of multiple prizes in each category, the prize is shared among themselves.
The most traditionally expected Nobel, the Peace, received it this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech he acknowledged the controversy of having been awarded, as it is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country participating in two wars: Iraq and Afghanistan.
To defend his policy, however, he added that in certain situations wars are necessary to achieve peace, although their price is high.
Minister Janata thinks of the resignation. Klaus invited him to Castillo
President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning to Minister of Agriculture Edward Janata, who is continuing in the government, as he does not agree with the version of the state budget for the coming year, approved Wednesday by the House of Members.
It is assumed that the budget, and perhaps Janata's stay at the office, will be the subject of its Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis of public finances.
On the date, President Radim Ochvat's spokesman was informed.
About her stay in the function, Janata wants to negotiate Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the Budget Act, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163,000 million dollars.
The House of Members, however, approved Wednesday proposals from the left for transfers of funds and increased money for employees' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government does not agree with the proposals made by the Democrats, as they obviously increase the budgetary deficit.
Between the left hand side and the government, Klaus and the right side, there was a serious internal political conflict. Due to this conflict, the future activities of Fischer's bureaucratic office began to be challenged, which was agreed in spring by ODS, ČSSD and the Greens Party.
Critics claim that the budget, in the version approved by the House of Members, is actually liquidated by the package of safeguard measures imposed in autumn by the Government of Fischer to prevent public debt.
Klaus may but not have to sign the law on the state budget; today he stated during a breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians had spent a long time defending "the serious problem", i.e. "the unsustainable deficit" of the public sector.
According to him today, they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported in a broader consensus between political parties, could improve this situation, the president said.
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek said that the budget is frightening and that the government should think about its future existence.
The vice-president of ODS, Petr Nečas, told ČTK that the concept of the bureaucratic office with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens is obviously no longer functioning.
First Minister Fischer responded and qualified for similar words of "strong judgements".
The head of the ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is huge, prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek. It will exceed 200,000 million crowns.
Wednesday ČSSD said that the adoption of the State budget for the coming year was successful.
People were also happy.
Mandela in the new film of Clint Eastwood, interpreted by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that Hollywood's new film, Invictus: Inventable, reports much about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say that the protagonists play American actors.
The history of sports, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The inaugural fighter against the apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is interpreted in his biography by the U.S. winner of an Oscar, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that Mandela, 91 years old, asked him to interpret it in Eastwood's movie.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "When you interpret it, I'll have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama on the world of the Billion Dollar Baby box, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, who had just finished being a slave, of the U.S. Presidential fiction, and even of God in Evan Todopoweros. But rarely represented someone who is still alive and, for many people, is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Inventible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, who joined his forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after his apartheid his nation continues to be racially and economically divided.
He believes that he is able to unite his people through sport, and therefore he decides to join the rugby players, who belong to the outsiders worldwide.
The South African team was able to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story to the movies.
I had no other goal than to play this role in such a way as to be as much like reality as possible, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were out of the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, dinner with him, be among fishermen before his speech.
The most important thing was I wanted to put my hand in Mandela.
I found out that when I touched her hand, I received her energy, she transmitted it and had the feeling of knowing how you felt, she said.
It's important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national team of rugby, in which white players predominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of rugby.
A great surprise for him was, when he finally met for the first time with Pienaar in his home.
I remember calling the door, he opened up and the first thing I told François Pienaar in my life was, "In the movie I look much higher."
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of Director Eastwood, Invictus: Inventable he received positive reviews and also spoke of ambitions for the Oscar.
The movie critic of Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summarized his evaluation with these words: "It was a very good story, a very good film."
In film reviews on the website rottenatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive evaluations.
The Secret of Splendor on Norway Resolution: Russians proved a missile
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed on Norway.
The Ministry of Defence of Russia concluded yesterday that close to the borders with Norway had proved a ballistic intercontinental missile.
The launch failed again. The missile, of the type "Bulava", previously intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the pesada of the Russian generals and of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even its repeated presence in the missile tests has had the desired effect on the success of the pilot flights.
Bulava, in most cases, did not fly out or an air error occurred.
In Russian newspapers they write "Bulavá" as "a mission that doesn't fly".
A mission he doesn't want, but it's brilliant.
During this 13th test, no problem arose at first.
At the end of the flight, technical problems occurred again on the device.
Probably the engine was installed at the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulavá" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which floated in the White Sea.
This type of missile allows the launch from a ship that is moving and being submerged at once.
So it is likely that the mysterious light on Norway, caused by a flying object not identified, was actually the failure "Bulavá".
The same Norwegians from the first time did not vacillate that it would be a Russian missile.
The generals defend themselves this time by claiming that they cannot simply speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile arrived and the average was produced in the third.
In previous cases the engines were immediately informed at the first stage.
Although none of the launchs went through completely without errors, only six of them failed, according to the management of the Ministry of Defence.
The success of almost fifty percent full of optimism to the generals, and therefore they continue to say that "Bulavá" will fly one day without problems and will even be able to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, whose total weight is 1,15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with the Moscow CSKA in 51 years.
The legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will be re-presented at 51 years of professional hockey meeting.
The world's former champion, Olympic champion and winner of the Stanley Cup will help your team CSKA Moscow and will possibly play on Friday in the KHL debt against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash has been injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov is constantly practicing and has committed to helping the team.
We only have to solve some formal matters, mentioned the AP agency to Sergei Nemchinov, the trainer of the Moscow club.
It is still unclear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the soul of the other players, Nemchinov mentioned.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to ice tracks, it will become the longest professional player of the Russian hockey.
The legendary front of Gordie Howe played in the NHL by Hartford at the age of fifty-one, during the entire period, and achieved 15 dollars and 26 assistance.
The top of the group of five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing by the Soviet Union won two Olympics, seven world champions, triumphed in the Canadian Cup and in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career he also succeeded in the NHL: playing with Detroit won the Cup Stanley twice.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the hockey Glory Hall.
Hyundai has met the requirements of the unions. It will cancel all additional work
The management of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all the additional work.
Exactly because of the frequent extra work, unionists declared the emergency by strike on Monday.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaník, the driver of the Hyundai car factory.
The direction, however, wants for this year to agree with the unions a more Saturday tour.
We cannot redefine our production plan, as it is essential. That is why we propose voluntary additional work for Saturday, 19 December, i.e. it will work in two tournaments, Vanék said.
According to the Sedmička.cz server, the company offered 400 CZK bonus to employees working on the Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid on Saturday, 28 November.
According to Vanęka, the company decided to change the way it motivated its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can pay the bonus for extra hours or can take a day off on 28 December, i.e., extend the navies parties one day, Vaník mentioned.
In addition, all employees on Saturday shifts will receive money for the trip and for food.
Given that supplementary work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of unionists and attachors, who stopped manufacturing last week, the direction in the afternoon decided immediately to cancel all additional work for December, Vaník said.
Car manufacturers were forced to work two hours in addition to eight hours shifts, and this situation was virtually lost every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another trade between the factory and trade unions should be held Monday morning.
The chief of trade unions, Petr Kucharí, said Wednesday, that if the requirements are to be met and the document is signed, they are willing to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation in the car factory increased during the last week, when about 400 employees were spontanely arrested for their frequent extra work.
They also protested against the bad terms of payment and the alleged threat.
The Directorate considered that employees had to work extra hours to meet the requirements and to be able to provide cars.
The unionists, in their declaration of emergency by strike on Monday, also demanded that none of the employees, who had interrupted the production last Wednesday, be sentenced in some way.
With regard to additional work, trade unions require the company to reduce it to a minimum.
In addition, this year requires a reward of 5,000 crowns for this work.
The car factory in Nošovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
The production in series was started last November.
Up to last September it produced about 80,000 cars; its current productive potential is 200,000 cars per year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance even in HIV virus-induced viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists has proven new components capable of moderate the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is the fact that it is also effective against medicines resistant to viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the composition is not so effective in a common variant of the virus, such as some available medicines already.
The AIDS disease cannot be cured until now.
However, the life of patients can be significantly extended through a combination of medicines that prevent the replication of HIV in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely removed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, medicines will no longer work.
The work of experts from the three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and Heidelberg University shows the possibility of controlling the resistance of the virus.
They showed that the substances called metallocarbons have an effect on albumin, responsible for the spread of HIV.
The methylcarbons are composed of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently from all medicines used today and can therefore solve the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists find new, "improved" compounds, prepared by knowing the molecular mechanism of their link to the virus albumin.
The metallocarbons have one three-dimensional structure: two polychlorinated needles made up of boron atoms, hydrogen and carbon are combined by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A traversing and resistant virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the vital cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, the fractionation of the HIV virus is not produced and there would be no adult and infectious body organs of the virus.
If we stop the HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, explain scientists in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemicals and Biochemicals at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the Scientific Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compositions, in which two pairs of jaulas (see table) are united by a short organic series, which is still being systematically modified.
A bit weaker, but more effective
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested, as well as against its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metallocarbons on the common version of enzyme is not as strong as the clinical use of medicinal products, although they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which medicines often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, makes metalocarbons interesting for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Rézečova, the head of the laboratory of structural biology in the Institute of Organic and Biochemical Chemicals and the Institute of Molecular Genetics in the Academy of Sciences.
He's paying for the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he's defending himself.
ODS Chief Mirek Topolánek said that the budget approved for the coming year is "sperm" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, according to him, think about its future existence.
The ODS statements were noted by the prime minister as strong judgements.
They say it's time for the analysis.
The vice-president of ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of the bureaucratic office with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Nečas, the first minister has to decide whether in the House of Members he wants to support the minority, who tries to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his position with the help of the left parliament.
The attitude of ODS and social democracy towards the problem of public deficit is completely different, Nečas warned.
The House of Members adopted the budget for 2010, despite the amendments made by the left, by more than 12 billion crowns.
The House of Representatives increased the money for government employees' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government rejected the ODS proposals, as they significantly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage the deficit of 163 billion crowns.
ODS left the room before the vote and thus fulfilled the Government's wish that the revised budget would be better than a provisional budget.
Disillusionment and ineffectiveness
Minister of Hacienda, Eduard Janata, spoke of disappointment and feelings of worthlessness; first Minister Jan Fischer said that the government would reassess the current situation.
There is no doubt that if Janata would seriously threaten the exemption in the event of the adoption of the amending proposals, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká television Janata, he asked for a meeting with the prime minister.
He said he's thinking about staying in the function.
The reason is their rejection by the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer is in agreement with another fight against budgetary deficit, according to Nečas in the government, there is nothing to do with the ČSSD appointments, which has led to changes in the budget.
The first Minister should also say clearly, if he wishes to leave, if the camera adopts other laws that increase the deficit, such as those relating to sickness, pensions, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolanek: Ministers appointed by ODS are not guilty
This is the case with Prime Minister Fischer and with all the government.
Ministers appointed by the ODS have done nothing wrong, highlighted Topolánek in the U.S. text message.
He recalled that in several ministries there are people belonging to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
He once stressed that if Fischer decides to redefine the principle of the fight against the height of the deficit of the public office, "it is absolutely logical and correct, which is supported on the left hand majority, which is currently in the House of Members".
However, it cannot count on the support and tolerance of ODS members.
I didn't think about that, at any time, I'll take care of it, said to journalists in the House of Members, Minister of Defence Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government precisely by ODS members.
First Minister Fischer attended a European Council meeting in Brussels in the afternoon.
ODS granted the Prime Minister's request
He once stressed that the Wednesday in the House of Members would probably vote against the amended budget if the first Minister did not explicitly ask the ODS Members to accept the budget.
We do not feel like heroes, we are not small children, responded to the question, if ODS is not concerned about the absence of the leader of the party in Parliament and in the Czech Republic during the budget negotiations.
I didn't realize that my vote was wrong.
At the end of the mandate, he knew that in the next few months, it was mainly the Bolshevikization of the House of Members and the destruction of all the good, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new CD train schedule, less trains will travel almost the same rates.
České Drahy (Ferrocariles Czechos) will cancel or restrict some faster and less used local trains and, on the contrary, strengthen some links.
The total extension of traffic will be reduced by 2 per cent compared to today, after the new hour of train is in force.
Most tariffs including the basic and customer price will not change.
For example, the residents of the Ostravsko region will gain more links to the capital, and drag for this line will add a pendolino road.
The direct train, on the other hand, won't travel back to Bratislava.
In the Prague line - Písek - České Budějovice will travel less fast trains, restrict direct links Prague - Letohrad.
In the regions, the largest reduction in traffic planned is in the region of Hradec Králové, eight per cent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and around.
Two night trains will also be cancelled in Prague - Tábor - České Budéjovice and some fast trains in Prague - Písek - České Budéjovice will be reduced only a few days a week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the 15th line of the Esco system, around the cities, is possible through the electrification of the Lysá nad Labem line in Milovice.
The long-distance links to the capital will end in the Prague Hlavní nadraží station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will travel every two hours.
From 13 December the travelers will no longer travel to Bratislava in Pendolino.
This year's regional rail account: 200 million more than before
The rapid trains are charged and paid by the Ministry of Transport to cover the so-called loss of Drahy will receive the year that comes to four billion crowns in total, like this year. Local trains are charged by the regions, the year that comes to pay eight billion crowns in total, and the State will help them nearly three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast and locally expensive trains they have a new ten-year contract, so far the contract has always been one year.
Drahy is happy with the system, and perhaps that's why they didn't increase the prices of a large majority of the tickets.
The changes will be made only on tickets of one day - ČD Net and on cheap internet tickets eLishka.
For passengers without customer card the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLischka will depend on the distance, so far there was the only price of 160 crowns for travel between any two regional cities.
The Philippines's armed forces continue to hold more than 50 people, children were placed free
The armed forces have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including several students from a primary school and their teachers.
This was confirmed by the AFP agency, which previously reported only 65 kidnappings.
All 17 children detained and a teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del South.
They say that about 19 armed men use the reindeer as a living shield in the escape from the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the delivery of remaining pensions.
According to AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People's Army (NPA), an armed group of the Philippines Communist Party (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the police previously persecuted the kidnappers because of violence, which led to the adjustment of accounts between two clans of local families.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maginadao was the cause of the recent murder, in which 57 people were killed, the law imposed the martial law.
Among the victims of the death on 23 November, related to the governor's election, there were 30 journalists.
Suspected of the involvement in murder, they arrested the governor of this province in the south of the Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, a patriarch of an influential dynasty of the Ampatuans.
The Islamic separatists also operate on the Isle of Mindanao.
However, they renewed the peace dialogues on Tuesday with the Filipino government.
The history of RSA refers to the whole world, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next few days, a new film from Hollywood, Clint Eastwood Invictus (his official title in Czech is Invictus: Neporažený), which captures part of the biography of former President Nelson Mandela of the South African Republic.
The role of the world-known fighter against apartheid plays it by Morgan Freeman, who chose for the role of the protagonist Mandela himself years ago.
The second role, the legendary champion in rugby Francoise Pienaar, was interpreted by Matt Damon.
With the sudden birth of the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
Her full name was Nelson Rolihlha Mandela. She was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Prize for freedom of thought, in 1993 he received, along with Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in the years 1994-1999.
great hopes, as it comes to the public at the time, when in the Republic of South Africa there are preparations for the global football champion, while the media are shaken by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the people by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to this new film in RSA have been positive, despite many reservations against the distribution of protagonist papers by Hollywood's "very interesting" stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he's proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared well to play it.
Often I met myself with Nelson Mandela, for - as it is said - spending his energy, mentioned in an interview after the festival stars in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if through the film we can remember Mandela's character and message.
It's a story of the Republic of South Africa, but it's about the whole world, it added.
On the route of the national team of rugby
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game, the nation was born. It is the South African human rights lawyer during his first election presidential period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of people, racially and for many years separated. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as a protagonist is also wearing the national team of rugby South Africa and entering the game field.
By entering the gramilla in the suit, which in RSA is seen as almost sacred, Mandela has gained great ovaries, especially the white public and the recognition of the white people.
The football champion may be able to help people join and form a nation, said rugby Chester Williams, the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen if it improves the tense situation in the RSA.
The white Africans, however, are sceptical, as said in a recent interview for LN by rugby Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Britain.
The campaign begins on 11 June 2010.
In Lounsko rediscover a transformer with a value of tens of millions of crowns
The fire took place in the morning a transformer from the company Čeps in a switch box near the village of Výškov in Lounsko.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the leader of the Ustí region's bombings, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously, the bombers wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by fire, but later changed his mind and the fire was extinguishing him with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguisher material.
Fire was caused by a technical defect, the transformer's short circuit.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandátová, the company's voice, which would not endanger the safe functioning of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is of several million crowns, counting it exactly will not be possible before the fire closes.
According to Mandátová, it will be necessary to replace the transformer destroyed by a new one.
During the ten years of Čeps' activity there was nothing like it, the averies of this type are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the voice of the ČEZ company for the Czech Republic, the supply of electricity was not cut, and the fire of electricity substation did not affect the functioning of households, offices or companies.
A.s. Čeps served in the territory of the Czech Republic as the exclusive holder of the distribution system, of the power drive of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains good state, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the power of the transmission system to the distribution system, and maintains the electrical conductivity of 4339 kilometres long.
Jančira will submit a complaint for three months from ČSSD
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jancura today will present a complaint by slander to three democratic estudents.
This is the case with Michal Haszek de la region Jihomoravský körj, Radko Martínek de Pardubický körj y el etmán de Olomoucký with Martin Tesarík.
Jancura mentioned it in 20 minutes in Radiojournalal.
The demand needs to be addressed with the company's efforts to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, have signed long-term contracts with České Drahy.
All three months are attacking us and talking about the fact that we're "taking past the pastel", but we only bring the offer for what they themselves want.
They say that we are dearer than České dragonhy, which is not true. We know the prices of České dragonhy, which were fixed last week.
So there's nothing left to defend us.
It's because of the fraud towards the Student Agency society, said Radiojournal Jancura.
He mentioned instead of having evidence from all regions, he said that they have not taken the necessary measures in accordance with European law.
That is why he is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Haszek considers this complaint for the continuation of Mr Jančira's media show, which serves as a free advertising for his company and for himself.
Of course, I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and to appeal to the other ethnic groups that do so too.
I suppose that it will also be clear on this occasion that Mr Jančira has managed to manipulate the public on the issue of rail regional transport and uses false and false arguments, Hašek said.
Janchura announced last week that it would invest several million crowns in advertising, whose objective would be to warn of these regional measures.
RadioJournal told him that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and want to continue after the new year.
He meant that the campaign would be carried out against corruption as such.
Jançira launched the campaign after the regions agreed with České Drahy to maintain regional rail links and for the task of approximately 150 billion crowns they did not call for a tender.
According to Jançira, similar steps are inconsistencies with the law and with the opinion of the European Court.
Jančira claims to have been threatened by a member of the ČSSD, because of its criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was, that if we don't leave it, we could lose bus licences.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I know, what you are talking about, I will not say his name, said Jančira today for RadioJornal.
The neumoccal vaccine will be free of charge and voluntary
The neumoccal vaccine from January will end the usual customs.
As the first holiday should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free vaccine against neumococos stop.
The Institute of Medicinal Products is already fixing the maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts have also made this clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free toilets for children born in August
From January, children born from 2 August of the previous year can receive the neomococal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is that no dose of the vaccine has been received before.
Those who started with the vaccine last year or before, should also cover other doses of the vaccine.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and fifth months of age.
Last year the fourth part of the families voluntarily allowed their children to be vaccinated against neomocotes.
The parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
For the youngest children, four doses are required.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend from 300 to 450 thousand crowns annually.
Without shadow they will be saved in treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far the state has spent the entire vaccination of children about 500 thousand a year.
The covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janata package.
Neumocococo is the cause of the average otitis, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicemia.
Of the neo-ococcal infections in our country each year, according to research in 28 hospitals, children under the age of 10 die.
In addition to Chequia, the neo-ococcal vaccine coverage in children was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
However, there are opinions that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
From January it must be covered by insurance and voluntary companies.
The compulsory vaccine would be better, for example Rudolf Kalovský, head of the civil association Nahlas.
Its association has been promoting neo-ococcal vaccines for a long time.
Experts at an international conference, where our association participated, were not fully satisfied with the fact that we had the voluntary vaccine.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the way we have to start now, Kalovský said.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the vaccination procedure against neumocotes.
At this moment we don't think about it at all, his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň said.
The volunteer vaccine has its disadvantages, doctors say.
La President de la Sociedad de pediatras Special Association of Practical Child Doctors Hana Cabrnoch's Recognition, which la Vacuna volunteers have su desvetais.
If all children would receive the vaccine, you can reason on the reduction in the number of doses. "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a high amount, we understand the political decision to have initiated vaccination as voluntary," said Cabrnochová.
Experts hope that from the year over 80 percent of the young parents will leave their babies to take a bath.
The neumoccal vaccine is also a major change because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on the prophylaxis, to save later on treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy vaccines for themselves.
However, the pediatras are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be purchased by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, as when the state gave them other vaccines.
Some Members, however, were afraid that insurance companies could "sell the money from health insurance".
Doctors will therefore have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid by insurance companies.
It is estimated that the pediatrics will invest in the 40,000 vaccines per month, which is a significant sum.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in "the theft of a museum"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of stealing paintings worth $20 million from his father's museum.
The Pennsylvania police claim that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was arrested while carrying 90 cameras in his car and trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and other men used an excavator to break into the museum, in the region of the Pocono Mountains.
Frazetta father, aged 81, is famous for his representation of such characters as Conan del Barbaro and Tarzán.
The Associated Press news agency reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police officer claimed that a family dispute could have motivated young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta's 52-year-old son told the police that his father had ordered him "to enter the museum by any means to transfer all the paintings to a warehouse".
The agency said Frazetta Father refused to grant such permission.
The Labour Party defends the increase in taxes in the budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and cost cuts in the previous budget report, in the face of the criticism of opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling "loss" an opportunity to show his seriousness about the shortness of the deficit, delaying decisions until after the elections.
The ministers of Hacienda also received harsh criticism to harm low- and medium-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a rise of 0.5% in social security spending and a peak of 1% in public sector wage agreements since 2011.
Cholera for Social Security
Trade unions have complained that low wage workers are being punished with a recession generated by others, and warned of future "problems".
The increase in social security expenditure, which will increase about three billion pounds per year, has forced the business community, which states that this is a tax on employment, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those who earn more than £20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS OF INFORMATION IN THE PRESENT
Social security with an additional 0.5% rise from April 2011
The economy will take more than 4.75% this year.
New 50 % tax on banker bonds
1 point tax on small firms has been abolished
Tax Degradations for electric cars and wind turbines
State pension would increase by 2,5 %
According to the estimates of the Ministry of Finance, a person who earns £30,000 will lose £90 per year and who earns £40,000 will lose £ 190, while a person who earns £10,000 per year will win £ 110.
Ministers said that their goal of reducing the deficit for 2013 meant "hard decisions", but stressed that 60 per cent of the additional tax burden would be over 5% of the highest salary.
The Minister of Hacienda, Stephen Timms, denied that the tax and cost cuts described were a "grain of sand in the desert" compared to what was needed.
"These are large figures. It will allow us to reduce the deficit to half, which is absolutely essential for the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, the forecasts of the Labour Party regarding future economic growth, which will affect the amount to be paid and the speed with which the deficit is reduced, have been questioned after the Minister of the Interior has been forced to modify the first figures.
In his statement, he stated that the economy would probably be engaged in a 4.75% this year, much worse than the decrease of 3,5% predicted in April, while the claim for loans would be £3 billion above the previously estimated.
"A chance lost"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning about the "debt crisis" of the labour force party, said that the proposal for a loan of £789 million for the next six years was unsustainable.
Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how the money would be returned, adding, "synically" to the difficult options until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They have not included anything significant about what they will do," said the Minister in the shade of the ministry of Hacienda, Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do so and they have lost it."
"All important announcements will be made after the elections, whoever wins."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts, in contrast to conservative proposals, which would seek a greater reduction in deficits in a shorter term.
But the liberal Democrats claimed that the money collected by tax increases and spending cuts would be used to support the next year's spending, not to reduce deficit, arguing that the projects were like "cashes of sand".
The BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, said that the time chosen for the announcements, such as the increase in inflation of some subsidies due to the inability of the next April, mentioned earlier, would leave the ministers of Hacienda exposed to the charges of electoral maneuvers, as the money could simply be recovered in the following year.
However, the working party insists that the people most needed are being provided and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not publish data on subsequent expenditure by 2011, economists said that it was clear that the adjustment of public expenditure would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Fiscal Studies said that the figures of the Minister of Finance involved substantial cuts in many areas, possibly including transport, higher education, science and defence in the future.
"This is really making the pain go forward," said his director, Robert Chote.
"All important ads will come after the election, who wins," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant of Deloitte's accountants.
"This has been the false report before the budget. Markets take this into account."
FBI finds out about "U.S. arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the detention in Pakistan of five U.S. suspects of extremist connections.
The US Embassy of Pakistan told the BBC that men were detained in a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI said it's investigating whether they were the same men who disappeared from their homes in the state of Virginia, U.S.A., last month.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United States said that he was also looking for information on men.
Three of them are reported to be of Pakistani descent, one of Egypt's heritage and the other of Yemen's origin.
"If they are North American citizens, of course we will be very interested in the tasks which have been held and in what kind of circumstances they are being held," said the spokesman, Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokesman, Katherine Schweit, said that the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and nature of their business there, if they are actually the students who were missing," the spokesman said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said men were detained in a house belonging to one of them.
He said that the house was already in the presence of the local police and that there had been no charges against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, reported the Reuters news agency; but he said that the United States had to "work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan, to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people".
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in northern Virginia, in late November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian "abuses"
Human rights in Iran have always been the same in the past 20 years, according to a report from the Amnesty International campaign group.
The report details "the models of abuse" of the regime, before and after the presidential elections held in June.
A man quoted in the report said he had been shot and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticisms of its history of human rights.
Officials have said that such criticisms have a political basis.
Thousands of people arrested and dozens murdered in Iran after the election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad provoked major street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Twelve people have been convicted, and the prosecutors claim that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
The BBC correspondent in Tehran, Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, the senior leader, Ayatollah Ali Jameni, recognized some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance to the criticisms, according to our correspondence.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report by Ibrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student who said he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting the outcome of the elections.
"They often hit me in the face," according to his words.
"They burned me with cigarettes under their eyes, in their neck, in their head... threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and they left him and left him on the street, still bleeding and semiconscious.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said that some protesters detained after the election had been tortured until death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials rejected the allegations of rape, but admitted that there were abuses.
Amnesty also cited the case of an ex-container, who claimed that he had been detained in a container together with 75 others for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary had established committees to investigate the maladies of the post-election and the government's response, but said that the mandate and powers of the agencies were confused and the aeronautics of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski track was made in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to convert a Bristol interest site into a competition track.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for prizes in effect.
At the top of the pendant in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump ramp, facing a 100-metre track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year-old medical student, said that he had a beautiful view from the top of the track, but that was pretty exciting.
A beautiful view of the city's lights is seen below.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders of the county, true talent," he added.
The prizes were delivered to the best tricks or manoeuvres performed on the track.
After the Thursday afternoon event, the snow will cease.
Still them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a Laico State.
At a time when Swiss voters have requested that mine construction be prohibited and that there is a general warning about the alleged Islam of Europe, John Bowen, a North American academic, have written a detailed and study report on the possible integration of Muslims (which are actually being integrated) into one of the most open-ended societies in the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the latest work by the author "Why the French don't Like Headcarves" (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and its effects are still seen today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a broader and ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what really is happening.
It's been months in blends, schools and institutions that now provide 5-6 million Muslims in France what Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener who plays discussions between teachers and students on questions that are of interest to them.
Should a Muslim marry in a blend or in a union (or both)?
Should young Muslims teach them about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it lawful for a Muslim to use a banking system based on interests to get a mortgage?
These are apparently global issues, they support, things of everyday life, which concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of whom are named, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab academic and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern lay society.
They are not able to disseminate this argument completely.
Conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Mr. Bowen interview tend to disagree with his colleagues of Salafi, members of the Sunni Islamic Puritan party associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among European Muslims.
Bowen believes that the Muslim values and French layism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It asks how far the French political strategies (and the intellectual elite so fiercely defend layism) are really committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims probably have a more unjust treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments with the Latin republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, realizes "a value adjustment".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."
The world's most dissolute panorama
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramaticly than any other habit of the planet.
The ice that defines it is falling at alarming speed, taking with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fisheries have been focused on recently open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result.
In "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the North icon, the polar bear.
A knowledge of the complicated history and policy of the whale hunt, describes the long tradition of the explorers of the Arctic, who gave valuable evidence to face the white bear.
The discovery of Almirante Nelson as a valuable 14-year-old chain, struggling only with the extremes of his mosque, is certainly a myth, but others are true.
The creatures, captured as they were born following the bodies of their recently-extended mothers, were trapped and sent to zoologists and circuses.
A circular presentation at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even in modern times, zoologists are still generally a millionth of the area of an adult wild. The climate is almost never suitable: a polar bear resident in Singapore is green with algae growing within the areas without its wings.

They resort to stories from other writers and historians, and often return to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although it is prohibited in Norway, the United States and Russia, murder continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and motorized Indians use high-powered rifles to break their grip.
Ironically, it is in the waters toward the north of those two hunting nations where the ice will last longer.
In his new book, "After the Ice" ("After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, an ancient editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and scalable story about the science of the Arctic and an overcrowded view of how the future of that place can be transformed.
It's not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
It's not because of a lack of effort.
The pioneer trips of Fridtjof Nansen toward the end of the 19th century and the early 20th century gave indications for the first time about the movement of ice masses.
Then the cold war submarines drew a map of the moving ice corridors that surround below the ice masses.
Satellite explorations and the extensive series of probes mounted in the icebergs are a useful supplement, but individuals in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looked inside the extraordinary, lower world of the air-flowing system inside the Arctic ice, formed by saline water pumps that are compressed while freezing.
But from the oyster on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all condemned once the summer ice is removed, which can be believed to occur at some point between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us.
Marines among 6,000 who place crowns in Arlington's drums
Pfc. De'Angello Robinson, aged 19, traveled seven hours by bus to put a single crown in the tomb of a soldier who had never known.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to the Arlington National Cemetery for Tombs, it was a day for men and women who were once standing on their boats.
In a few months, from where they're aboard us, these could be us, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we are, I would like someone to do the same for me, so just try to show respect.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who met on Saturday morning to place crowns in the vets in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morris Worcester, owner of the Coronas Worcester Company in Harrington, Maine, began the event when he and other people decided to rent several hundred drums in the Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already a 18-year-old tradition, Morris and his wife Karen travel every year to stop in different cities along the way, to organize events dedicated to soldiers and victims of terrorism.
The Worcester also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Cross America, which extended the event to other states.
This year the volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the tombs of the Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, drums in the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, the Batteries Park in New York City, and in the memorial site of the 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation gave more than $150,000 to buy and transport crowns.
Charlene Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said he made the trip to Arlington to honor her husband, a failed military career.
While her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that this was his way to pay back those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family tomb.
Roofed in warm clothes, the volunteers walked through the broad plains and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers headed to older drums of World War I, Second World War, and Vietnam's war, because they do not receive as many visits as new drums, the organizers said.
The atmosphere was happy as the children played and the couple took their hands, while they carried the fresh pine to the burial stones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red beam attached to the top.
Nearly there, Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, was virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations provided 1,000 crowns to decorated the section, but the shadow atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the cold air.
Some read in high voice names carved on the stones, while others turned to see small white and black plates placed inside the moving bar, for those whose stones have not yet been filled.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who were stabbed with tears of her eyes in front of her son's grave.
I managed eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of the Sgto marine artillery. David Shane Spicer, who died in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free. My son paid for it, he said.
"A lot after my death, I want someone to remember it."
Cuban officials arrested a U.S. government contractor
The Cuban Government has arrested a US government contractor who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, the officials of the Department of State stated on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, with headquarters in Bethesda.
The company works in customer projects such as the United States International Development Agency and the World Bank.
Consular officials, together with the United States Interests Section in Lebanon, are seeking access to the detainees, who were arrested on 5 December.
Specific duties have not been made public, although according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be held for almost anything considered "hazardous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical writings, are at risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an initial blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and arrested by government agents.
Sánchez has requested several opportunities to leave the country to accept awards, but the permit has been denied.
The arrest of a U.S. contractor may probably cause tensions between the Communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a “slow pace” approach to improving relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to introduce the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new US policy emphasizes that if the Cuban Government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobiles and portable computers are legal in Cuba, although they are new products and codified in a country where the average wage of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobiles only this year; they are used mainly for text messages, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost the daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors from the hotel, and in some government establishment, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of a United States in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the United States Interests Section in Lebanon, said that most U.S. citizens' imprisonment in Cuba is between crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said he could not provide more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly detached.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as distributing free mobile phones, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the American programme of the Human Rights Watch organization, recently published a hard report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, itself Cuba", a reference to Raúl Castro's location as the country's leader, to replace his older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the accused are often detained, processed and imprisoned in one day.
It pointed out that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often triggers a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials design a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged brain of a conspiracy to send five men from Virginia of the North to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, expressing their hope that the case could help to unify an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who use the Internet in search of radicalized young people.
Researchers said they were pursuing a mysterious figure, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Saifullah directed men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal settlement, which is a family place for Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence officer who had been informed about the case showed on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince Qaeda's commanders that men were not part of a CIA task to infiltrating into the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargotha, far from the imposing mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of a covered operation.
For this reason they were rejected, said the officer, who spoke from the anonymous due to the delicacy of the case.
The officer said that men were not moving and were even trying to obtain the appropriate approval to access the Qaeda camps, when the Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, highlights the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps most important, determines who are trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, U.S. intelligence has been a major priority in attempting to infiltrate people within the Qaeda.
The organization's recruiters act as guards, not allowing those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who may be spies.
Analysts said that Qaeda had special attention to the aspirant American recruits.
But for the organization they represent a huge attraction, due to their potential to have access to American goals and their value of propaganda.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with regard to those who admit because US intelligence agencies have been expert in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way to follow the recruitment model than so many have followed? Kohlmann said.
It has been transformed into a model based much more on the Web.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demands climate action
On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters walked here on the streets, demanding that negotiators work at the Bella Center Convention Centre in the city, more decent actions for the climate.
The protesters said that 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police thought the number was close to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the center of the city.
On a day when little happened in the UN climate talks, thousands of activists walked through the city, maintaining maps in English that say "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish that said, "The Earth says "that's enough."
A number of prominent people joined the protest, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, her mother's mother's birth country, made me aware of the sad things that the country must be facing due to the effects of the climate change that are already happening."
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to world leaders, to present a just, ambitious and binding agreement.
This is not an easy task, but if you have to do, there is no way to avoid it for more time.
The police prevented the protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the use of masks or because they were wearing pockets.
According to Danish law, these activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a witness, who was not asked to be identified by being involved in climate discussions, activists with sports masks and black people placed several explosives near Copenhagen's main channel, which is close to several ministries.
They were by the buildings, he said, adding that they started as bells, but that they were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Within the convention center, people gathered around the television screens to watch the walk all afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to enter into the conscience of key officials like Su Wei, China's head of climate negotiator.
When he was asked if he thought that the event was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "I really wasn't so much in the situation."
Then he went on to say in Mandarin, "as the meeting place is large, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He pointed out that it depended on the perspective of each one to determine whether the departure was harmful or beneficial.
He said that this showed public attention in general and in different sectors to the topic of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that negotiations, or the freedom of others, affect negotiations.
Test data reveal persistent racial differences
The federal book of qualifications last week on performance in mathematics was a very good news for public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the country's best-performing systems, the book of qualifications showed that students in the fourth and eighth grade gave up a faster rate in the last two years, with respect to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent figures of the National Assessment of Education Progress is the persistent difference in performance between African students and white students at both local and national levels.
The mean score of the fourth-grade white students in D.C. over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 (in a 500 scale), but their African parents increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance difference grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the Afro-Americans in the eighth grade remained essentially fixed, lowering a statistically insignificant point from 245 to 244.
The average white score was not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a six-year extension, the table is no longer encouraging.
The difference between white and black students in 2003 when the first ENPE in the District was introduced was 60 points from the scale (262 to 202).
Although the score achieved by children in both groups has increased during this period, the difference has only been reduced to 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, as the progress made by Rector Michelle A. Rhee and mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrata) were driven largely by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole by addressing those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflict-like, Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit organization that advocates educational equity in the district.
I am not giving leaps of joy for a difference of two or three points, said D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-For accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Elementary Eaton.
Brown, a critical asset of Rhee's management style, said that the message of the test score is that secondary schools in the city have a desperate need for attention.
Of course you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect them.
But what concerns us is that we are not spending neither time nor energy necessary for our secondary schools.
Rhee said that the Department needed to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performance students.
This autumn, for example, is training some teachers to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, which is directed to students of the higher grades of primary and secondary school, who did not dominate the basics of early reading in their school courses and are significantly behind their parents.
The mathematics of every day, a mathematics curriculum from Kindergarten to sixth grade, which highlights real life games and experiences, which were introduced in the District under former Superintendent Clifford Janey, to which some of the progress reported by ENPE last week is believed.
I just think we need to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the level, Rhee said.
Others say that the ENGE results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and even provide additional money and resources for low-income schools, which will be needed to reduce the difference.
Here there is a sort of scaffolding dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teacher at the University of California in Berkeley, who studied urban testing points.
The solution to the Conventional Policy is to allocate its resources and administrative reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of D.C.
Then the objective can generate political implications that are contrary to that important timetable.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban superintendents, she tries to stick to the middle class, white and black.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access excellent public education.
Janey, now an overseer at Newark's schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end performance differences is to extend the year of traditional public school, currently 180 days in the district, to compete with autonomous schools.
It must take nearly 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, that he reached an agreement with his professors' union last year in a year of 185 days, which he considered as a "indicator" to seek greater increase in the next convention.
Make higher education a part of the future
The tourist bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong resolve.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12 years old, went down and disappeared for a moment before the white columns, the ladrill façade and the embered beaches.
Graciela's parents had only graduated from a secondary school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never put a foot in a university campus.
Even so, when she and the other eighth-grade students of the group explored Gettysburg, where the matrix costs $38,690 a year, their attitude was less than that of impressive guests than the potential student enthusiasmist.
Yes! Here is where I will be! Graciela cried out to who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Carey, seriously?, said thoughtfully, when the guide spoke of the low proportion of students in school.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children had visited on their three-day journey, and had already absorbed their completely delineated message: The question is not whether you are going to university.
The question is what.
While there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Spanish immigrants who leave secondary school or become pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who attend university education that they need to access to the middle class.
In fact, one of five of these Spanish "second generation" graduated from college, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing secondary school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they indicate the path to follow for a generation that will play a major role in the country's labour force.
Those who analyze higher performances say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of family ties with U.S. schools.
But care programmes can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to get to university, especially if efforts are sustained in time.
Noting children with low income, whose parents have no experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it is clear that any intervention at any time will not be resolved, said Patricia Gandara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latin students.
We have to think about providing a network of support for these children, from the childhood garden to the secondary school.
The federal program that funded the race by Graciela universities is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million annually to local school systems, to run university preparation programs, which begin when low-income students are in high school and continue to finish secondary school.
Since 1999, the programme has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent attending the university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
The Ministry of Petroleum is reaching agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government was able to attract important oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two subsidized Saturdays.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play a major role in the restoration of Iraq's oil industry, multiplied by decades of war and sanctions.
The U.S. companies refused to take up only two of the 10 substations.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second summit, which began Friday.
The only thing that presented a offer was lost.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for substations in June.
The poor representation of American oil giants in the opening of Iraq's oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of US companies, there are Asians and Europeans in the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Petroleum Forum, an online news centre.
It'll be a long time before something else is on offer in Iraq.
The security concerns raised by mass-coordinated bombs on Tuesday, and political instability while US military withdraw, probably prevented U.S. oil companies from becoming more energetic in Iraq, which has the world's third most important reserve of power, the analysts said.
The U.S. companies were in some cases outlawed, because rivals, in particular Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labour costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobile and Western Petroleum Inc were the only American companies that reached agreement with the ministry.
The principal American signatures, such as Chevron and ConocoPhilippis, who have bound ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum and have provided technical advice in recent years, have been abandoned with empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The National Petroleum Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, offered more contracts than any other company and achieved large investments in contracts for two main races.
We know that China is on its way to become a major economic and technological power, the spokesman of the Ministry of Petroleo Assam Jihad showed.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be at the side of its competitors and will meet its commitments to Iraq.
The companies selected to submit proposals made tenders that were then faced with the barrier subsidy that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above the current levels in each survey.
The main planning officer of Qaeda has apparently been killed in Pakistan
It is believed that a alleged US missile attack on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan has killed a major planning officer in Qaeda this week, U.S. counter-terrorism officials said Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second fatal attack against a high-ranking terrorist leader this autumn.
Saleh al-Somalí was one of the two Arab men who was thought to have failed Tuesday when a couple of missiles attacked his car, near the city of Miran Shah, in the northern province of Waziristan, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
The local authorities said that the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft of the type operated by the CIA within the illegal territory of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, in the direction of the Afghan border, when the car received the impact, a civil intelligence agency officer from Pakistan said, speaking by telephone from Miran Shah.
The officer said that the suspected local soldiers were trapped in the area and quickly confiscated what remained of the "completely destroyed bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials cited unspecific evidence that Somalia was among the dead.
Somalia was described as a high-ranking military planner in Qaeda, which led the terrorist group operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was dedicated to conspiracy around the world, said a high official, who spoke from anonymously, citing the delicate nature of U.S. aircraft attacks within the Pakistani territory.
In view of its central role, this probably included conspirator attacks against the United States and Europe.
There was a strategic guide to the highest command in Qaeda and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somalia had risen rapidly in the Qaeda lines and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a known name for some Americans, but it does not at all diminish the threat posed to us and our allies, the second official stated.
If his death was confirmed, Somalia would be the second leader of Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a military force in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking agents.
The rate of non-pilot aircraft attacks directed by the CIA has decreased since the summer, from an average of about six operations per month to two, according to a account of The Long War Journal, a website directed by a non-profit organization.
The reduction may be due to an improved tactic by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while killing suspect informants suddenly, the site said.
UN maximum sent to Kabul to cancel
The United Nations Supreme Envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would give up his post in March, ending with a torture warrant that was damaged by allegations of widespread corruption in the presidential election of Afghanistan supported by the United Nations.
Eide's exit occurs when Obama's administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional US troops to Afghanistan.
The United Nations envoy said that it supported the increase, but he was concerned that the U.S. Chronograph for the military withdrawal that began in 18 months had moved other NATO Governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the correct signal to Afghans so that they can trust the international community, Eide pointed to a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military authorities to increase the number of international civil servants, who collaborated with the political transition from Afghanistan.
The increase in the military sector must be reflected in the civil sector, he said.
Eide said he was not allowing, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said I wanted to notify the Secretary
General of UN Ban Ki-moon, so it would take time to find a replacement.
What I said is that it's better that they start looking for a successor, Eide showed.
When I got here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's exit and my arrival.
Ban has begun looking for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who has recently directed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a French who has previously conducted United Nations peace missions.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favouring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and covering evidence of a massive electoral fraud.
Eide refused the crimes, but said Galbraith's allegations, who was dismissed, "was certainly damaging the mission, because there was already a lot of speculation about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by United States forces in Afghanistan.
It also encouraged the leadership of the United Nations to allow its successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries, which are contributing to the Afghan mission, stating that this would increase his confidence in the proper use of his money.
Eide expressed frustration at the limitations of its powers in Afghanistan, arguing that the United Nations ' s strict rules of procurement had reduced its ability to capture talents.
That is how the United Nations rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and can't continue.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
The Defence Secretary, Robert M. Gates, said Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran, because of its failure to negotiate their nuclear ambitions.
Gates, headed to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a week's journey to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, remained important to him in the perspective of a military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, I supported, in response to a soldier's question about the probability of such a incident.
One of my concerns is that, if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years, it is the inherent invisibility of the war.
The administration of Obama is considering a package of sanctions directed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates noted that certain sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
I thought it would be necessary to "a package of incentives and disencensives", "to convince the Iranian government that they would be really less safe with nuclear weapons", because "his people will suffer enormously" sanctions.
Friday, in a statement by the spokesman of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders to warn that Iran will face "reliable" consequences if its nuclear programme does not fully respect the United Nations Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
They will insist that he wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In discussions in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would again negotiate on the restriction of his nuclear programme and accept to leave a substantial part of his enriched uranium reserve instead of the fuel that is desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pressed for this agreement, as a way to build confidence between the two parties and make time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran has seemed to have been away from the pilot agreements, in part experts have said, because the Iranian command is divided in relation to the possibility of compromise with the United States.
I believe, frankly, that Iran's persistence with the international community on some proposals that were actually accepted at the beginning of October has united the international community, including Russians and Chinese, in a way that has not been in terms of additional significant sanctions against the Iranians, expressed Gates.
President Obama has set a deadline on 31 December for Iran to respond to the proposals, before other options are reconsidered, even continuing with what Minister for Foreign Affairs Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "missing sanctions."
In a statement made in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what Thursday called "unfounded and missing base charges", by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities, and said it was his will to continue negotiations with the United States and five other world powers, "to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who was about to return to Washington the last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki, before flying to the Kurdish region of Iraq rich in oil, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurds in Irbil.
The tensions remain between the Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, in particular with regard to borders, property rights and participation.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in United States projects, to reduce the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety about the pending reduction. US officials quoted Gates' words to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve its security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We won't leave them."
In an elderly China, a change of course
Wang Wejiia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda cards that they spoke to them about the fact that "the Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "a baby more means a more grave."
They learned the lesson so well that when officials of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and the elderly population of their city, suddenly changed from this summer to encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instantaneous and firm: in no way.
We've given all our time and energy to a child only.
There's nothing left for a second, says 31-year-old Wang, a human resource administrator with an 8-month-old child.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the policy of a single child in China, creating two generations of notoriously wealthy children, single children, lovingly attached to "small emperors", a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen by 1.8 children per pair, compared with six times when policy was effective, according to the Division.
The United Nations demographic, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 and will operate from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent by 2050, is far above the global average of about 20 per cent.
The imbalance is worse in the rich coastal cities with very cultural populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for almost 22 percent of the registered residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Family Planning Commission and the Municipal Population of Shanghai, has shown that fraternity couples should have babies to "help to reduce the proportion of the elderly and reduce a future shortage of work."
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," he said.
A step-by-step relief
As part of the country's constitution in 1978, the policy of a single child in China may be the most Polish mandate introduced until the date of the Communist Party.
Couples who are politically hostile face enormous difficulties, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and labour discrimination.
Chinese officials have resorted to policy in order to avoid a critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have reported abuses in political taxation.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have had abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to an unnatural proportion of male and female.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually reduced their position on the policy of the only child.
In 2004, more exceptions were made to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husband and woman are single children, and in 2007 many of their hardlined limbs were developed.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Demographic Research of the University of Beijing, said that central government officials have recently been discussing even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is the only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost in the morning, the letters that ordered families to have a single child were replaced by copies of regulations that detailed who would be sufficient to have a second child and how to ask for permission.
The city government sent family and volunteer planning officers to visit couples in their homes and to tear down booklets under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say that the response has been very short-lived.
Dissociating Response
Although rural city officials in the Shanghai villages maintain that they observed a moderate increase in the demands of couples who want a second child after the campaign was launched, the most urban districts did not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five requests per month.
Disappeared officials in Shanghai say that despite the campaign, it is still expected that the number of births in the city in 2010 is only about 165,000, slightly higher than 2009, but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the municipality of Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people no longer want children.
They want to give her the best of their first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, aged 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, of 26, said they would like to have two children and are legally able to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only the medical and life insurance that the government provides.
Without a social protection network, they maintain that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West view the policy of a single child as an issue of rights, Yang said, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant for seven months from the first child of the couple.
Yes, they're stealing us the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples mention psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resource manager, said he wanted a single child because she was also: "We were the center of our families and we were used to all take care of us.
We are not accustomed to caring for others and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, owned by a translation agency, explained it more consistently.
For parents with two careers, of the middle class, who reduce the birth rate, he said, it is a matter of being successful enough to be selfish.
People between 20 and 30 grew up seeing their parents fight during the first days of China's experiment with capitalism and they don't want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child needs a lot of time from the parents, I supported.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, "you have to remodel your apartment", and the strategy "you have to have a curriculum prepared for the best guards when the child is nine months old."
Most of your friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
Our first generation with the highest standard of living, it showed.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
A UN group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The UN climate conference, which has so far been characterized by challenging positions and mutual crimes, has drawn renewed attention to Friday with the publication of a document that foresees ambitious reductions in greenhouse gas emissions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations that carry most of the burden on their people in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final policy agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a long-term negotiation with over 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
A United Nations ad hoc working group, the text does not speak of how much money the rich countries would give to the poor to face global warming in the short and long term.
This offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would reduce their carbon production, and what would be the limit of the global increase in the temperature that political strategies would be willing to tolerate.
This gives you a lot of flexibility in the process, said John Coequyt, High Representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who edited the document on six pages, summarized a negotiating text of 180 pages to concentrate on what the UN's largest climate officer, Yvo de Boer, described as "the great panorama."
Displays the profiles for a possible agreement in which industrialized nations would aggregate their emissions for 2020 between 25 and 45 per cent, compared with 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions during the same period between 15 and 30 per cent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions from 50 to 95 per cent to 2050.
The European Union also encouraged the discussions on Friday, promising to provide $3,600 million annually over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, Friday presented the same kind of verbal artificial fires that dominated conversations last week.
The United States special climate dispatch, Todd Stern, rejected the claims that require mandatory greenhouse gas emission cuts for industrialized countries, compared with the volunteers of the major emerging economies, if not funded by the developed world.
The manobra indicated that Obama administration is adopting a stronger line with China, with regard to what the Bush administration staff did just two years ago.
The United States is not going to make an agreement without the progress and measures taken by the major developing countries, expressed Stern, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of China He Yafei said that the U.S. climate negotiator was "common", or "very irresponsible" because he had said earlier in the week that the United States would not help China economically cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world's major powers in play, failure lines have taken root both inside the world in development ways, as well as between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four countries in the most influential world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the most valid action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegation from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the main powers are discussing who should spend the cost of limiting greenhouse gas emissions, even when vulnerable countries have become more aggressive, seeking to contain large-scale emissions of their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being developed, supported by Ulate, who also works as a regional council on climate change in Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the majority of the main participants said that the talks would produce a political agreement at the top.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, has drawn up a proposal for a preliminary treaty of 24 pages in the morning.
Artur Runge-Mitzger, who is the head of international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the push of small island nations has "mixed political pressure on the whole political process", partly because they are now united and demand action by emerging economies, such as China and India.
The discussions took a new turn as delegates focused on the fact that most of the exceptional issues had to be resolved before the Heads of Government had arrived at the conclusion of a treaty.
High-level officials, such as Minister of the Indian Environment Jairam Ramesh and Deputy Chinese Minister, came down from the planes and ran to the streets of Bella Center, to meetings at closed doors and press conferences, so as to reduce the claims that would be made during the next week.
The absolute decline of the meeting (where 13,000 people enter and leave the convention centre every day), activists who touch the guitar present night shows burning from the countries they claim to be selling, and preliminary hand-made proposals are made instead of e-mail), poses a challenge.
The intensity is only built: almost all key ministers are here at this time, and the Wednesdays 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the larger links, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, Vice-President of the Global Policy for International Conservation.
Heavy weights are coming.
The first train to 225 km from Great Britain redefined this feeling of the moon
At 5.13 p.m. in the morning, a silhouette will cause darkness to signal a train exit marking a revolution for travel in Britain.
The first high-speed interurban train from the country will reach 225 km, when it passes as a radio from Ashford, Kent, to St Panrcas Station in London, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
At Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transport, will then join Ms. Kelly Holmes on the first interurban service outside London.
He hopes that the new service finally connects Britain to an international network of fast, reliable and secure trains and connects the great rounds of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
Disappearances from the separate areas would turn into sudden emergencies, business travel times would be reduced, and the change in aircraft and rail cars would reduce national carbon emissions, as well as facilitate congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But tens of thousands of millions of pounds needed to build a new national railway network, the inevitable battle of planning and fear of environmental damage can still break the high-speed lines of Britain.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the Government with a feasibility study, will submit its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, according to the Times.
This will provide you with a detailed route from the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line that a London in the Middle East will be drawn within a five-metre radius in urban areas and areas where environmental impacts can be polar.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a 25-metre radius of a final route.
It is also expected that HS2 sets three options for a wider high-speed network to the north.
Lord Adonis will answer in spring.
The preferred option that is being proposed is an Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would be divided in or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west from the Peninos to Manchester and Scotland, and another to the north to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
"It seems this will be the most beneficial option," said a member of the railway.
Once completed, the travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first tram, which would not open before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with a little more than an hour.
The proposals would allow trains to travel 402 km, turning the British network into Europe's fastest.
The initial road is being designed to support 400 mt long trains, capable of transporting 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal would be needed to receive 20,000 passengers per hour.
Given the restrictions on capital space, an existing station is expected to be expanded to fit the high-speed network.
The experts in the railway industry maintain that only St Pancras International or Euston station offers this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes that the scheme should be carried out, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be taken until after a general election.
Even if the work is started, the network would have to be built in sections.
At first, trains would be forced to leave the fast lines on the roads in north Birmingham, maintaining the travel times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is considered to be the crucial point needed to ensure a change in trains, a reference point for railway revolution.
The contributors face the mortgage for a £75,000 treasure trolley of a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the voice of the Conservative Party, spent thousands of pounds a year on the cost of a orange that he built at the home of his electoral district.
The party's prison voice, which was degraded by David Cameron to complain that the MPs lived "reasonably", increased their mortgage at £75,000 to build a robust extension in their second home in Rutland.
The contributor was allowed to charge additional interest, with hundreds of pounds per month.
The authorities of the House of Commons approved the applications at its time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of the costs of the members. Yesterday Mr. Duncan said that the applications "can't be clearer or simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the richest Members of Parliament, owns a two-room house in a village in his electoral district of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have been sold for almost a million pounds.
The floor below includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the honorary office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year a winter added to the house, described in the plans as a "naranjal".
Neighbors described it as "a winter for entertainment".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in the loan, during a recent investigation by the Committee on Standards and Privileges of the House of Commons on its previous mortgage agreements.
Last month, the Committee decided to violate the rules after an investigation of its costs.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of 271,406 pounds from his property in London to the house of his electoral district, which he had purchased in 1991, the previous year to become a Member.
The documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was requesting approximately 1,400 monthly pounds in mortgage interest until March last year.
In April, their applications increased to more than £1,800 per month.
The interest rate of Mr. Duncan's Royal Bank of Scotland's mortgage did not change at that time, suggesting that the entire increase would finance the loan of 75,000 pounds.
The standard variable hypothetical type of BRE fell from 7.94% in December 2007, to 4% in March this year, the type that is now found.
The most recent document issued by the authorities of the House of Commons shows that Mr. Duncan continued to request £1.250 a month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his job as president of the Chamber's opposition in September, after a buried reporter filmed it saying that MPs had to survive "reasons" after the cost scandal.
"This is basically nationalized, you have to live for reasons and be treated as m**rda."
He said: "Give me my money in my garden and ask for a small fraction on the basis of what is appropriate.
And I could ask a lot more, but I don't."
The Member, a millionaire for his former profession as a oil trader, was first questioned about his expenses in May, when he found that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the wage office that this could be considered excessive.
An activist sought an agjure with the form of the symbol of the steroid book in Mr. Duncan's cesped as a protest, after he found out that he had requested 4,000 pounds for three years.
Yesterday, when asked about the increase in the mortgage, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for primary improvements, approved by both the pay office and later by Legg."
He added: "It is not about avoiding and criminalizing or infringinging the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It couldn't be in any clearer or simpler way."
Come to those who have faith, to see the calendar of the Brighton Beach Palace Event
Brighton’s palapas have found a new impetus for winter months in an interactive event calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity invited 24 owners to decorated their palatials for each day of December, using villas as their theme.
The event began on 1 December, with guests who could see the last palace from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, with full pastel and free serving ponche.
The selected villas so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and La Primera Navidad, where the palace presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, aged 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a non-remunerated clergyman of Chichester diocese and Beyond's leader.
He said: "We want religion to be more relevant to people in a post-Christian society."
"Why do we expect us as Church to come to an old foreign building? I think that the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
"The idea of the calendar of the event of the palace began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrating place and we are trying to prove and represent it through spirituality."
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and the whole world
Tens of thousands of demonstrators protested this Saturday in a petition of an ambitious and binding agreement to combat global warming, worldwide and Copenhagen, where the police arrested several hundred people.
Some thirty thousand people, according to the police, hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, were displaced by the Danish capital in a claim that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change should be reached by Friday, 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the growing climate mobilization worldwide, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents took place shortly after the beginning of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke off the escapes with adoquins and martils, reported an AFP journalist.
The anti-disturbies police intervene quickly and firmly.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 persons in total, according to it, particularly members of the Black Blocks, additional violent groups that had already taken place at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April last.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, complained of the conditions in which hundreds of soldiers were detained “without distinctions”, stressing that a hundred of them were “immobilized on the street by the night married and sat down despite the intense cold”.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, came out of Parliament and went to the Beautiful Center, the seat of the negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was set up to accommodate the invited speakers. The former South African Archbishop of Cabo City, Desmond Tutu, was headed by a guard with wheels.
Most of the protesters came by car and train from major European cities, but many Asians, among them Chinese and Korean, were also present as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most with celestial showerers responded by setting up a first concentration for the morning in Copenhagen to call Friends of the Earth to form "Blue Seas" for "justice and climate".
Today we take the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explains Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino soldier of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: there is a time, the well-being singer Angelique Kidjo said.
In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, watercourses that can be walked as never had been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the anti-globalization movement was close to the ecologicalist organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, explained that I came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the struggle against global warming is not opposed to the fight against another world".
The Pacific region, which brings together many highly vulnerable islands in the heat, gave the opening point to the demonstrations.
According to organizers, some 50,000 people went on the road to Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, most of their students, were dressed in red and lighting panties with trees in favor of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, concentrations of hundreds of protesters claimed to act energetically against climate change were formed.
In France, demonstrations organized by the "350" network gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marsella (Sur), Lille (Northe), Burdeos (Oest) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, tens of people were concentrated.
Separatist Abjasia elected president, although Georgia denounced "fraude"
This Saturday, Abjasia, a protrusive separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi complained "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were invited to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgia war in August 2008 by the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
Elections closed at 17 p.m. GMT.
According to the representatives of the Committee on Electoral Affairs of Abkhazia, the participation was 58 per cent a few hours before the closing.
The first preliminary results would be announced on Sunday evening.
The five candidates in the race, including the outgoing president, Sergei Bagapch, are categorically rejecting the idea of reunification with Georgia, which rejected the exclusion of votes.
These elections are a joke.
On the other hand, Georgian President Michel Saakachvili, "laughs that Abjasia has fallen under the total Russian occupation," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, Nicaragua and Venezuela alone recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considered it an illegal part of Georgia occupied by Russian troops.
After its separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand deaths, Abkhazia attempted to demonstrate through this election that she is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new life was like an independent state, declared to the AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who said he had voted in Bagapch.
She was among the electors who headed to the electoral table in a capital school, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with considerable landscapes, along the Black Sea.
Large tables show Bagapch next to the Russian Prime Minister and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different locations in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, West of the country, the district head, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed Russian officials who had come to control the development of ecrutinism.
In a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, are grateful for the support of Moscow, and particularly for the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, answered by raising his vodka flag.
On the other hand, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two entrepreneurs, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticises the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one granting Russia control over the railways that have been seized for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims that he does not support the current power or opposition.
A majority of 50% more votes are needed to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organized two weeks later.
Climate: World events, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday tens of thousands of people went out the streets of the world to claim an ambitious and binding agreement before the Copenhagen Conference on Climate Change, where the police, on alert, arrested more than 700 people around an impeccable demonstration.
Some thirty thousand people, according to the police, hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, died in the afternoon in the midst of the cold of the Danish capital, which accommodated delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, seeking an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, came from Parliament and went to the Beautiful Center, where negotiations are being developed.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center without attempting to enter.
A stage was set up to accommodate the invited speakers. The former South African Archbishop of Cabo City, Desmond Tutu, was headed by a guard with wheels.
A few moments after the start of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all black clothes, broke away with ladris and martils, reported an AFP journalist.
The anti-disturbants police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, throwing them to the floor several of them.
The police announced the detention of between 600 and 700 people, stating that it was mainly the members of the Black Blocks, ultraviolet groups that had already been operating at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April last.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the mandibule with an adoquin, and four cars were burned near a house occupied during the incidents that led to the arrest of 20 people, according to the police.
To the extremist groups we did not leave their eyes on the top, they warned police officer Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the order forces overflew the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived on the road and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, including Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, among them Chinese and Korean, were also present at the same time as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most with celestial showerers responded by setting up a first concentration for the morning in Copenhagen to call Friends of the Earth to form "Blue Seas" for "justice and climate".
Today we take the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explains Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino soldier of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, said to the AFP that came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the struggle against global warming is not opposed to the fight against another world".
The Oxfam organization, together with the former UN refugee commission, Mary Robinson, who should lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrations, including the Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Pacific region, which brings together many highly vulnerable islands in the heat, gave the opening point to the demonstrations.
According to organizers, some 5,000 people went on the road to Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, in most of their students, showed red clothes and lighting pans with sticks for solar energy in front of the Philippines capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, concentrations of hundreds of protesters claimed to act against climate change were formed.
In France, demonstrations organized by the "350" network gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marsella (Sur), Lille (Northe), Burdeos (Oest) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, tens of people were concentrated.
The assignment of history and geography is strengthened by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, said in an interview to be delivered in the Sunday Information (JDD, according to his French seal) that history and geography would "strengthened" the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific bachilerate.
From now on, all first-class basketball students will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, Chatel says.
For the Minister, "even with hypocrisy" so, he says, "the C branch is no longer a scientific branch", but "generally, it calls for the best students."
The branches of General and Literary Education can't be submerged from the C, it continues to emphasize: "I hear that historians or intellectuals have been upset by the fact that history and geography have been eliminated by the secondary bachilerate in technological schools."
An IFOP survey published on Saturday in L'Hhumanité revealed that about seven French of 10 (69%) rejected the government project to eliminate mandatory history-geographical education according to bathirate C. Intellectuals and teachers, the left and some right election representatives also criticized this fact.
On the contrary, the Minister added that "not to speak" to eliminate the philosophy of the programme of secondary bachilerate C.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teaching training, while 16 organizations (students and unionists) called for a day of mobilization to protest against the project, which, according to them, sacrificed the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year, they will give an admission test for the purpose of their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will also practice in real terms during the M2 year, then they will be the first year in front of the school as teachers in practice.
If you do all the proposed practices before the competition, you will already have a great experience in front of the school, i.e., over 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
He also confirmed the project to remove the school map "before 2012".
In the Upper Normal School, experts will have 15 minutes to explain with conviction the evolution of the climate
Five minutes to discuss the challenges of Copenhagen's summit, a challenge that he accepted on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel of Experts on Climate Change (GIEC) invited by the Upper Normal School of the Ulm Street Street.
Jean Jouzel, also the Nobel Peace Prize, opened the "Ernest" conference room, a day composed of a series of five-minute, filmed and open-ended presentations of experts, reported to an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that attracted people and sent them to learn more, explained in the framework of the 22-year-old Edouard Hannezzo conference, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized at the school's stakes.
We chose twenty participants among the experts of its discipline and selected them on their charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, "we can talk hours, but we can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who showed no notes, but with the help of graphs to some 50 people.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed that the public understands that "the Copenhagen conference is founded on a very serious scientific expedition".
The videos filmed during those conferences will be online on the school's website from December 15th.
It is scheduled for February the next "Ernest" day, followed by others at a bimetric rate.
Delay in payments: discomfort between prison guards, plans to take action
Prison guards' unions called on Friday a "general mobilisation" to demand payment before the end of the year, the premiums and extra hours, which was postponed to energy budgetary reasons.
The Prison Labour Force (2rd guard union) asked the staff outside the service to join the event on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and "block them" to declare the theft of their belongings.
The CGT (3rd trade union) calls on them to "convense in general assemblies in different prisons to achieve massive mobilisation", as the call for "happiness and unacceptable" in December calls for the failure of payment in the "external hours, good nighttimes, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first guard union, the Federal Autonomous Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) with a view to increasing disillusionment and anger".
The Department of Criminal Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that extra hours increased significantly in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but ensure that the balance will be subscribed in January.
At the last hour of the day, the Chancellor reported that Michele Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the security unions to ensure that the payment would be made next month.
No doubt about the efforts made by staff to operate and modernise our prison system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
Requests the Office of the Criminal Administration to immediately implement a set of measures to prevent this situation from being re-produced by a poor assessment of the number of extra hours in the future.
The payment of December will then be scarce, except for staff in the direction that enjoys the benefit of the famous premiums for functions and objectives, and that "always blames the budgetary requirements", Ufap/Unsa said.
It is a real scandal, said angered by the interregional FO of Marsella, announcing its decision to vote until the new order "all meetings and calls".
Staff will not come to work on Sundays and relevant holidays if they are not paid in December, the same will happen with extra hours, also threatening FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
While we are increasing jobs and missions without taking more effective, it is more sad that we should be forced to attack staff's pay, which is estimated by the Burdeos Prisoner CGT.
According to unionists, not all regions do the same, as some have more luck than others.
But anyway, the result is not expected, said Ufap Secretary General Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes "better gifts" than those he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas in the White House, confessed to the famous television presenter Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion on gifts: "I make gifts better than those I receive".
During a special interview that the ABC chain will issue on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they think they will celebrate the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Including Bo, the little four-foot family partner, will be from the game.
Father Noel also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, explaining that the dog will, of course, receive a gift, according to the extracts of the programme transmitted in advance.
And Michelle Obama argued with her husband's statements about the quality of gifts she receives: "In no way, last year she made you beautiful gifts," he urged the president.
True, I was forced to admit it before answering with humor by pointing at the hair of the First Lady: "Who gave you that?"
During an hour's interview, in a diverse environment with the famous encouragement that was devoted to the presidential campaign of Barack Obama, the president and his wife also recalled their favorite gifts of the baby.
Barack Obama recalled a bike with two speeds, as well as a basketball ball that his Kenyan father, who saw rarely, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball ball, the President said.
Just a few years later, I'll understand that he had given me that balloon.
On his side, the first lady remembered her house of monks.
I had no idea how to organize a house, then put all the furniture online against the wall, instead of staying around the house, however, he worshiped that house of monks, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL claims it's inducted
Johnny Hallyday was re-interacted in Los Angeles because of important "lessions" arising from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to its annexes, while RTL claims that the singer was subjected to a coma induced to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-interacted on Wednesday night at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where some doctors checked "the injuries resulting from the operation" of the dyscal hernia performed in Paris on November 26, he pointed to his press service in the same city, indicating that these injuries "needed a repair operation".
However, the author's press service tried to transmit silence by stating that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical part would be reported within 48 hours.
According to the RTL, the sponsor of the last round of the singer, Johnny Hallyday accepted, however, being subjected to a coma induced to avoid "pangs and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient disappears, we will have more certainty about his condition, add RTL.
The press service, questioned by the AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" would not have been introduced any channel after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the international clinic of the Parque Monceau due to a dyscalic hernia.
The intervention, planned a few days ago, was practiced by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux refused to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
The singer Johnny Hollyday entered the hospital Cedars-Sinaï in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection caused by the intervention carried out by Delajoux.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, explained the Thursday in RTL that his friend went through "a bad time", but made sure he didn't make "no problem" because rocker is "a fighter".
He just called me before traveling to Los Angeles, and I told him that it was a ton of flying twelve hours after the same operation, it's not possible, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the music producer, Jean-Claude Camus, threatened to calm down by saying that Johnny Hallyday, "was successfully reacting to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled".
Camus said he had talked to Laeticia, the wife of the music, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems multiplied since July when he was pregnant for nine days to give birth to a fall in his yacht.
Two months later, to general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated by a colon cancer after a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer repeated, as planned, his long "Gira 66", presented as his round of departure.
But since then, every health problem has gone too far. Fanatics and journalists have noted the difficulties of music to move into scene.
By mid-November, its allies had, even, demining a new immigration.
Euro-2009/ Short pool: first title of Bousquet in its favorite distance
French Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medalist in the World 2009 long swimming pool, received an international title on Thursday at a distance of which he feels particular affection, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in short swimming pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition in which polyurethane bathers were allowed for the last time, only three world memories were exceeded when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by Russian with 4 x 50 m 4 styles (masculine).
A penalty for Bousquet, which codifies the world's record in 50 m free, marks it in a long pool (20.94).
In one of the two queens of the birth, 50 m free, the 28-year-old French was forced by 20'''53 during a final where ten nads competed instead of eight as usual, an international primacy.
Bousquet advanced to the Duje Draganja Croat (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but did not achieve the world brand (20.30), as he had planned.
We can always hope for something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was at my reach, I would try to reach it.
Like Bousquet, almost all the navigators wore polyurethane bathers from 1 January will be prohibited.
These bathers, originating from 238 world records since February 2008, end their epipedia in Istanbul, where they first competed in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of bathers did not help German Paul Biedermann, two world pool champion this summer in Rome, followed by world records.
The young nadator did not succeed in lowering his mark at 400 m free (3:32.77), however, he was forced by the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give my back in this race.
I knew this time I couldn't beat a world record, but I managed to defend my title and carry out my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, explained Biedermann.
U.S.A.: A sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola sold in USD 1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to French writer Emile Zola was sold on Thursday at $1.5 million, far above the estimated price, announced Sotheby's art march.
This 2 meters long by 63 cm high, date of the third century after Christ, and its price was estimated between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "which represents four dynamic scenes, in a sophisticated architectural framework, surrounded by satiricals and Hebrew women, is a small part, since there are only four or five in the world," explained Tuesday to AFP Florent Heintz, vice-president of ancient Rome and Egypt's art assistants in Sotheby's.
It was sold between a hundred pieces.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the most picked up by buyers, no doubt the AFP pointed to a Sotheby's portfolio, Dan Abernethy.
Just a few days ago, it was discovered that the marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, then appeared in the home of the French actress Cecile Sorel, as part of his bath in his Parisian particular mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, minister of the French Republic and President of the Council for a short time, before the Marine Petain took power.
For some 50 years, his parade was uncertain.
By reviewing the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the freshness of the "Rougon-Macquaart".
Honduras cancelled Zelaya's exit to Mexico
The Mexican Jew felt that the conditions were not given to transfer to his territory to the deposed president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, whom the Golpilista government denied his rescue.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation last night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of the transfer, the Mexican Minister of Foreign Relations, Patricia Espinosa, said.
The plane from the Mexican government that arrived Wednesday to El Salvador to take Zelaya back to its original location, according to a source of the Directorate-General for Migration.
In order to give him a rescue, the Gollipist government wanted to force Zelaya to "renounce" and ask for political asylum abroad.
But the deposed president refused because he wanted to come to Mexico as Head of State in an invited exercise.
The golpist government "has suffered a new defeat by asking me to give up my job (...), they would like to present my resignation," Zelaya said on Globo radio, in which he often made statements since the beginning of the political crisis that took five months in Central America.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar, added the president of the depositary, who has been refugees in the Brasília Embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Embassy of Mexico presented us with a request for rescue, but unfortunately we could not accept it because we did not have an asylum application, the Minister of the Interior of the Golpista government, Oscar Raúl Matute, told the Hungarian radio HRN Wednesday.
I will not ask for asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya answered in an interview in the Telesur chain, whose seat is in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do it as President of the Honduran people, he underlined.
The rumors about Zelaya's party moved the Wednesday to the president's party, which was gathered around Brazil's embassy, strongly hosted by the military.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Golpist government.
This reflects the marginal character of this Government against international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached the Socialist President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, was defeated on 28 June, the day on which he had organized a referendum to prepare his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
Since his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisely on 21 September and fled to Brazil's embassy.
If so, he will be arrested and must answer before the Court for the crime of "high treason", according to the Golpilista government.
The President, Roberto Micheletti, was able to organize a presidential election on 29 November to replace Zelaya.
In the ecrutinian Polish, he elected Porfirio Lobo. This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until its mandate was completed on 27 January.
Wall Street up, U.S. trade balance feeds optimism
New York's Bolsa closed this Thursday, U.S. trade balance figures are a faithful witness to the economic re-activation of both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones won 0.67%; and Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points, reaching 10,405.83 points, and Nasdaq, a technological component, 7.13 points, reaching 2,190.06 points.
The expanded standard & Poor's 500 index increased by 0.58% (6.40 points) reaching 1,102.35 points.
We received good news from different sectors of the economy, Lindsey Piegza de FTN Financial said.
But this is anecdotic, he explained, considering that the market was concentrated "in the middle of the valley".
For Peter Cardillo, from Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the figures of the US trade balance, "which reflect an improvement in activity in the quarter".
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6 per cent in October compared to September, at $32,900 million.
Analysts, on the contrary, expected a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big news is the increase in the volume of trade exchanges, in particular exports of goods, reflecting the growth of the major economies that trade with the United States, comments Christopher Cornell, of the Economic.com research company.
In contrast, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States increased unexpectedly, 474,000 applications were submitted.
But in the last four weeks, the average of the number of new employment applicants "has been the lowest since one year," said Scott Marcouiller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market fell.
The performance of the ten-year-old Treasure bonus rose to 3,482 per cent against 3,423 per night on Tuesday, and from 30 years to 4,492 per cent against 4,408 per cent on Friday.
Cuba: more than a hundred members of power abuse the "White Ladys" · Global Voices
This Thursday's hundreds of Cuban forces beat the wives of political prisoners gathered in La Habana on the World Day of Human Rights and prevented another demonstration to which a decade of dissidents were convened.
Four "Damas of Blanco," wives or family members of political prisoners, were arrested on the street by party members of the government of Raúl Castro while they were on their way to the capital center, demanding the release of those arrested, supported a journalist from the AFP.
Kill the Yanquis!, "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Viva Fidel and Raúl!" ran with the high-ranking penalty of the power of the dissidents.
These last were chosen by civil servants who came to "protect them".
On Friday, a similar demonstration against the "Blanco Ladys" in La Habana, without injuries or arrests.
But in Vedado's Habanario village, a dozen dissidents who were also supposed to be present on the international day of human rights were arrested by civilized police officers, reported an AFP journalist.
The agents came under the force of vehicles to the dissidents who were abused by government parties, according to that journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances will take only a few hours.
The "Damas de Blanco," guaranteed by the Sajarov Prize 2005 by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "appropriate the release of all political prisoners", some 200 according to the decree, declared one of her leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, was sentenced to 20 years in prison.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, of whom 53 remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities refer to the opponents of "mercenaries" or "agents" in response to their declared enemy, the United States.
In the media, Cuban television reported on the demonstration of the government's juves against the "revolving" fighters.
Cuba, governed by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
A deliberate murder to an octogene with a knife and leaves 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
A man out of balance with two shoes killed an 80-year-old man and shot five other people in the center of the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Altos del Sena) on Thursday at the time of the greatest afternoon movement.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressive person would have been attacked with two knifes and for reasons not yet determined, to an elder, in or in front of him in No. 85 of Jean-Jaurès, reported police sources and witnesses.
Because of serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to a police union officer Alliance.
Then in the pharmacies or in front of her, she attacked a pregnant woman who was with her husband.
The husband, for about thirty years, was interrupted and wounded.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were transferred to the hospital where the old man fell.
The life of the other victim, with the apparently affected vital organs, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman suffered a drop and was admitted "in shock state", reported a police source.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the effects of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped by bulging Jean Jaurès.
Apparently, he would have hurt two more petons: one man of thirty years, and another of forty seriously.
By night, the scene of the crime was still unexplained.
He was armed with two fleshy boots that he was carrying on the back, explained in place a leader of the Alliance union in the Highs of the Sena, Arnaud Pressé.
Several transients, including young people, tried to control the invention, according to the testimony obtained by the AFP.
I've seen a guy for about thirty years with a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn't do it because the guy was strong, explained Alberto, a roommate from a nearby bar.
A crowd came up to him, including a police officer who broke the mug, added.
Jean-Jaurès, at the time of No. 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, tried to arrest the armed man and were wounded in prisons, according to the police evidence.
The facts were produced in one of Clichy-la-Garenne's major arteries, where numerous shops are located.
Some people came to tell me there was a man injured in the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old gentleman in the room. When I put him in a safe position, he found a very important wound in the abdominal, he told AFP Frédéric Allion, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person, about 35 years old, arrived with bone injuries.
Effective national police arrested the man without identity documents.
Nanterre's Tax Office submitted investigations into the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice of the Senior Justice Police (SDPJ 92).
The place was hospitaled on Thursday night.
During his provisional detention, he has not spoken.
A police source does not exclude the possibility of injecting it into a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were needed to dominate him at Clichy's commission, where he was transferred.
It was "in the state of overextreme" as "all disturbed by this type of force is significantly increased under the effect of action".
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer again asks that the cause be rejected
The French-Polish film attorney Roman Polanski once again complained this Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), who is appalled by the cause against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland for a sexual abuse over 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer of the director of "The Pianist", complained before three judges from the Second California District Appeals Chamber of serious procedural errors at the time of the facts, in 1977.
Hummel stated: I claim that the charges are rejected at the same time, since the conduct of the judge at the time of the case, Laurence Rittenband, "was a scandalous one".
According to him, Judge Rittenband (born then) would have discussed with a prosecutor who would have commented that Roman Polanski should go to prison, before hearing a sentence, which is a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was published in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), by the prosecutor's own mouth in question, David Wells.
But finally Wells declared in late September "had lied" to the author of the document.
Hummel called for the holding of a trial that would allow him to present evidence of his argument if the court refused the indictment.
The charge, on the other hand, reiterated the first argument, that there could be no serious assessment of the charges in so far as Roman Polanski did not appear before the court.
In 1978, 76-year-old cinematista fled from the United States before her sentence was pronounced "unlawful sexual relations" with less than 13 years old.
Since then, he has never again forced the United States.
The district vice-fiscal of Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayama, said Roman Polanski "must be here to present himself in the audience".
For this reason, we want to send the message not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that there is a possibility of fleeing? Asayama asked.
For her, the cinematographer "appropriates the court, although he despises his authority".
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also stressed "that there were other alternatives to the decision to leave".
Hummel wasn't the only one who asked me to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
He claims that his client no longer thinks that she is being approached every time the Polanski case arises, and adds: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was right.
Thirty-two years, it's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland by the US arrest warrant.
After more than two months after the raids, he was sentenced to house arrest in his camp at Gstad, pending possible extradition.
Wall Street loses the round and gets tired of the dollar's height
New York's Bolsa closed this round Friday, in a market that is debated between better indicators than expected in the United States and the dollar's height: Dow Jones won 0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached 65.67 points, reaching 10,471,50 points, while Nasdaq, a technological component, lost 0.55 points to be located at 2,190.31 points.
The expanded standard & Poor's 500 index has increased by 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1,106,41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, noted Mace Blacksilver, from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with tight margins, the volume of exchanges is increasingly reduced and I think it will be maintained until the end of the year.
The trend was maintained through the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which "helped to improve the market's view on the stability of economic re-activation", the analysts of Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3 per cent in November by the second month and higher than expected.
In addition, the US consumer confidence was clearly recovered in December, 73.4 versus 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimates of the University of Michigan.
However, the index was shaken by a new advance in the dollar that reached the highest level of the last two months in front of the euro, which "takes down to sectors sensitive to the economic situation", explained Owen Fitzpatrick, of Deutsche Bank.
Thus, technological values lost land.
The bond market fell.
The 10-year-old income of the Treasurer's bonus rose to 3,540 per cent against 3,482 per cent Wednesday night, and the 30-year bonus to 4,497 per cent against 4,492 per cent of the week.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month in South Africa, 112 candidates under Miss World are in the final right to fulfill their dream: to be chosen the most beautiful woman in the world in front of thousands of viewers.
During this great celebration of the beauty organized for the second consecutive year around Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran de Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo de Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino de Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sportist or, even, Miss Top Model during his stay in Africa.
It was a real revelation.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cabo City.
You have many things and I have lived countless experiences!, Miss Sierra Leone wondered.
This determination, which is carried out nine times in South Africa, will be transmitted on Saturday live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17 h (15 h GMT).
It's impossible to imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have lived twice, notes Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the summer of the Australian summer.
For young Russians, his second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with candidates and by the possibility of re-discovering "African landscapes that leave the shelter".
After a month of galleys, tests, press wheels, and safares, candidates to Miss World will focus on the concrete.
India's Pooja Chopra expects to be able to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as the Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both converted to Bollywood stars.
The dream of every woman is to be crowned as the most beautiful of the world, but it is not just the appearance.
We are ambassadors from our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, declaring Miss India with a great smile.
According to organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will come out with traditional clothes and, of course, with bathrooms.
The Chinese representative, Angela Chow, the former queen of South Africa, Michelle McLean, and a member of Miss Mundo's committee, Steve Douglas, will conduct the event.
South Africa proved to be able to receive the world with a high quality and hard pride to equal, assuring Julia Morley, president of Miss World's Certemony.
Like last year, the candidates made a safari, visited Soweto's famous cityship, but this time on bicycle, and enjoyed the local cuisine.
As an exception, they met South African President Jacob Zuma, who put his hand behind them.
A little bit common to a head of state, see Miss Sierra Leone.
Its best memory will no doubt be the luck in Cabo City (Sweden) for the World Football in June 2010, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I've been dealing with people I've never thought of getting to know.
He probably returned to the 2010 World, says excited Miss Italia, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday "son very positive", according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday's "very positive son", he assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport to accompany his hosted father several days ago.
News is very positive.
Dad was strong and everything was coming out very well, declared to the press David Hallyday at the landing of the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after the 13th hour (21 h GMT).
The son of the singer, who was released, made sure that he would be transferred to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered the moon for a sexually transmitted infection on November 26th in Paris.
The music is "as induced from that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to avoid suffering and thus manage its treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma caused by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered the moon for an infection, a drought of a dyskinesia operation on November 26th in Paris.
The singer was once again operated on Wednesday night at Thursday because of serious injuries caused by previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia was the Friday morning at the French school in Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade attended to attend a school act, confirmed an AFP photographer.
The Chief of Orthopedia and Traumatology of the Hospital of Pitie-Salpètriere, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles Monday to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who worked on the singer last November 26th in the international private clinic of Parque Monceau, Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were angry, said Camus.
He's talking about a possible demand, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus claimed that Johnny Hallyday had "extended too fast to Los Angeles with the authorization of the Parisian."
I spoke directly to the doctor and I was surprised when he made sure that there was no problem in making the trip, because I was operated twice by dyskinesia, he added.
Shortly before the RTL station, he indicated that the singer seemed to have been "out of the canal, nothing", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well-known in the artistic environment.
He worked at the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, at a Neuily-sur-Seine clinic where Delajoux was working at the time.
In 2007, I also intervened with the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematom formed by brain hemorrhage.
It is a doctor with poor reputation, convicted by justice on several occasions by malapraxis, as well as by tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer of the Medical Order, accused him of being "a man without scruples" charged with "regular" before the Order Council, and he is " far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
This indicated that the intervention "has been done without any inconsistencies" and that the results of postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "can't cause haemorrhages and therefore don't need drain," he added.
In any way, the singer's circle, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, has entered into a parentheses.
No doubt, taking back the turn on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, it seems very risky to me, said Camus.
The UDF association raises the tone and warns the New Centre about the use of its signal
The UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted this Friday before the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, tried to launch an OPA (public Procurement Offer) on the sign of the former gyscardist party, hoping to withdraw it from all its support, with due regard to being asked.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF signal, since he felt that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political legacy after he had put his hand on the left.
On the other hand, the Defence Minister, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In support of its management, she received the assistance of MP Hervé de Charette (ex UMP, current NC) who claimed the property of the UDF brand, as she was the first to register it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on the Friday night, the UDF office, controlled by friends of François Bayrou who do not want to be seen as private, broke the silence to launch a request to the Minister and the honourable Member, in order to discourage them from leaving the mark and transfer the rights of the brand to them, with a court order.
In recent days, you have made many statements suggesting that they were going to propose their political movement to recover the UDF signal, writing the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Central Alliance.
They also think it is proper to continue using the name of the movement, the +New Centre+, and the slogan + the UDF today' today' today'i+ in its military material and on the site's presentation page, the signatories support the letter.
As you already know, they have no right to use the seal, explains the UDF office that requires the NC to immediately remove "the name of the UDF of all support, as well as its (your) website".
He also asked Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of (the) mark to the legitimate rightholders".
If not, justice will be sought to respect the law and legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories will warn.
In the letter, they need UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and remember that Morin and his friends "elected" to go in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had done in 2002 to create the UMP".
Therefore, the New Centre does not, according to them, have any right to use the UDF seal.
They also recall that the latest UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and the establishment of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement based on Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when the brand was registered", he was no longer "member of UDF for three years", but UMP.
It uses scandalously and deceptively the absence of registration of the UDF acronym to carry it out by its account.
This indiscretion is being transformed into a crime, they claim, before the NC's strategy is realized: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more appropriate to make your own name that tries to get out of anonymously taking a name that is not entitled."
Case Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
This Friday, the Nanterre Court decided to appeal to the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the multi-millionaire daughter Liliane Bettencourt claims, the state of the octogeneary's weakness was used to exploit her from part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars of the show, will be sentenced on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime which is a maximum sentence of three years in prison and EUR 375,000 in fine.
This means that in this case there will be a worthy process of a sage on one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter are discussing the roots of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the Correctional Court also ordered that Liliane Bettencourt, 87 years old, bettencourt, was subject to medical examination by three medical professionals.
L'Oréal's legacy and main shareholders have always refused to submit to such examinations, even more in the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Fiscalía during the investigation.
Doctors appointed this Friday shall submit a report before 10 March 2010 which shall indicate whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered from weakness and for what period.
I think he'll accept it.
I'm going to talk to her, said Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, at the end of the hearing.
On the other hand, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, was satisfied with the court's decision.
It's a great news (...) The newspaper will show that he (Banier) maneuvered this elderly lady, whom we must protect, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter began criminal actions against François-Marie Banier, a multifaceted photographer and artist, accusing her of taking advantage of her mother's weakness for years to obtain billions of euros in donations, through checks, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For his part, Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to have been manipulated by the photographer, who is considered a long-term friend.
On Friday, while the court examined the proceedings of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' allegations resulted in, on some occasions, a large family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer took into account three letters that his client would send (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his note in which he said he had mistrusted the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between one and two times a day for five years.
Ever since his wedding, I could never talk to Françoise again."
On his part, Nanterre's Tax Office once again considered that the applicant was not in a position to compare, as much as a guardian judge denied, in these last days, his request to open a judicial custody procedure for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full ability to compare before justice, is not under protection and has no tutor.
No other person can be represented in his place," said the representative of the Ministry of Public Affairs, Marie-Christine Daubignney.
Finally, the Court decided that the judgment on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers would be delivered once.
Administrative revolution or the end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the large French companies, our fight for the development of business intelligence has been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies with regard to their employees recalls the position of companies with regard to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is the fact that the collaborators add to certain "values" as it was previously tried to impose on consumers products thought by manufacturing techniques.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave him its place in market purchasing strategies... although the authoritarian attempt to impose products that are not related to customer preferences is repeated regularly.
An employee mobilisation can end in a deadly demolition.
The suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the point of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilisation seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, particularly I+D and, more important, business intelligence.
In fact, the BI (Business Intelligence) "needs all parties involved (...) to have a proactive behaviour and a prospective vision"; this requires that employees make a commitment that is completely contrary to the recommendations of an authority.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution, which would consist in putting the partners at the centre of business concerns as much as the client.
Internal opinion surveys have a relative advantage
Will the internal opinion surveys, such as the questionnaire conducted by Orange among its employees, encourage the managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I could make sure that, in the face of a new situation, and after many times, all companies end up doing essentially... what they have always done!
Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own shortcomings.
Finally, because most directives have a simple vision of human behavior.
As a result of major engineering schools, they interpret psychology mechanically.
They adopt, by intellectual convenience, the old behaviorist theory that the U.S. neurosciences have recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Studies and Media have widely distributed their support.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the "commands" (sic) of the executives' commitment, a recent Ips research published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms the guidelines in a mechanical management position, which is not adapted to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the administrative revolution necessary for the good functioning of modern enterprises involves the adoption of a finalistic vision of human behavior.
It consists of integrating in any reasoning or practice of business management, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment with the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to make it part of its dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from the Moti-functional Analysis adopted this concept of employees' motivations.
Studies have shown that they judge their company based on a standard dose that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of mobility factors, business directives can control, predict and predict their "social performance" and reorganize human resource management "on the ground".
In this way, they create a favourable land for the organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo's speech: for the "just war" Obama receives right-wing praise
This Friday, the right-wing American, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, cried out the speech Obama had uttered on Thursday.
Conservatives, who had denied the award to Obama on 9 October, this time praised the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, former vice-presidential candidate during the 2008 elections.
I liked what she said, said Mrs. Palin, the main figure of the right hand of the Republican party to the newspaper USA Today, and added that she herself had addressed the topic of the war "at times necessary" in her recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is, since then, the last thing North Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
The terrorists must be stopped, he observed.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, was dedicated, this Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days ago.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, considered that the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really good, the former President of the Chamber of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
For a moment, the speech seemed very historical, Gingrich said, during an interview on the radio program "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, whom some consider to be a potential candidate for the Republican investment for the 2012 presidential elections, was pleased to hear "a left-wing president" when he reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they would not be free and could give a prize of peace if the force did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush's talks and current chronicler in Washington Post, Obama spoke "a very North American speech".
In addition to being presented as "the citizen of the world", as "always does", "he spoke as a North American president" by reminding Europeans "who live in a security hole that they did not create and do not do much to preserve it," said Gerson.
Among the few unconfirmed right-wings, a bash of the Bush era, former ambassador to the United Nations, John Bolton, qualified for the talk "Monoton, Pretentious and Inspiratory" on the website of the National Review Online.
At the left of the president, Democrat representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed when he saw Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we covered the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the left-wing press commended the president.
The English Time, although still believing that Obama had received the Nobel in advance, qualified his speech of "super-production" primarily for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," commented the California newspaper.
Obama "proclaimed the speech that was necessary," said the New York Times, judging it "as a shadow and as a building."
Road transport: three Marathon negotiations to ensure navigation
Following three marathon negotiations, the trade unions in the road sector and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only parental organization that remained until the end, came to an agreement on the strike and the threat of maritime security in the evening.
During the signing session on Friday evening, the State Secretary of Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" after several negotiations that began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussion, the negotiators went to the White Friday with the hope that the text would be signed quickly at the last hour of the morning.
Even when three parental organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) were withdrawn, a load was given.
But a more than six-hour meeting, which started at 11 a.m., was necessary for everyone to agree and the text was signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "hubbies have been very harmful to businesses" and "is afraid of disrupting the end of the year", Bussereau said.
The text provides for an increase of 4 per cent for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (International transport).
The hourly rate rises from €8.72 to €9.06 for low wages.
It's not much, but we started with a lot of disappointment, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will order our military officers that there are no more cuts or blocks in the supply centres.
But there may always be some rebel disconform, he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of the TLF, acknowledged that it was "a good deal", although it was "hard to give rise to high wages taking into account international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in order of EUR 170 per month for low wages and EUR 100 to 120 for the highest.
It is a common agreement with respect to employees, declared Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "an historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) is a "acceptable commitment".
The agreement also provides for an increase in the travel costs of 3 per cent and the holding of general road transport assemblies in the first half of 2010, which will allow in particular to address the issue of special payment and modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of EUR 100 million in parental duties" was the subject of an amendment by the government to the draft amending financing law for 2009, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The Government will ask the Senate to vote "under the same terms".
The TLF signature allows the agreement to be applied firstly to companies associated with this organization and secondly to all professions if the Minister of Labour is to extend it.
It will be "with the greatest speed," Bussereau assured.
The opposition of parental organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR claimed that it was a "genuine business" because the 100 million euros had been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the CO2 tax.
The Secretary of State of Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to contradict those who wanted to eat bread at the next Nochebuena dinner, the Unostra was saddened.
For OTRE, the agreement threatens "the stability of the sector's most SMEs over the next 12 months".
RER A: conflicts at the end of the week, trade unions with RATP proposals
Conflicts in RER A, the largest public transport line in France, continued at the end of the week, because at the Friday meeting, the second day of strike between trade unions and the direction of RATP, there was no agreement and the unions were not satisfied with their first request.
For this important weekend of navigational purchases, Saturday and Sunday, only trains will travel between 10 and 20 hours, due to a train of two in the central track (between the Defence and the Nation) and a train of four in the other lines.
Interconnection with SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to change train.
The Lafayette Gallery, which expect 200,000 customers every day, were pleased that "RATP is trying to provide services to large shops".
The RER Cross West to East Paris City.
The RATP tram runs from Saint-German-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, about one of the two trains circled in hours at a point, and almost no train at a time in the valley, as it had been planned.
The Thursday had not fallen into the mud with the organization of the inhabitants of the Isle of France.
In this way, the station in Saint-German-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less competitive than usual, especially because of the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), a 29-year-old engineer, Jack Nkwana explained that he had been raised “an hour and a half in the morning to arrive at time”.
The Saint-Lazare station did not meet, indicated the SNCF, which had foreseen police and order forces.
The A RERs that operate the SNCF from Sergey-Le-Haut or with its destination arrived or departed from the Saint-Lazare station to join the meters.
New general meetings of strike workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results will be analysed, according to the trade unions, of a meeting that took place on Friday afternoon.
The Director of ERA proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for ERA A: working time, professional development, etc.
That's not what drivers want to claim for a premium, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even put between parentheses its previous proposals, comments angered the CGT, pointing out that the direction "was unable to solve a problem that SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday to carry out "a more extensive analysis of the conditions for the exercise of the profession", the RATP said.
What also led the trade unions to say that the company "did not care about users at the end of the week".
In the morning, some 150 drivers invaded a committee in Paris.
Then the address, which had been refused until then to speak during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the water".
The conflict could be extended to RR B on Tuesday, after the United Nations and Independents have submitted a warning.
The unions ask for a premium of EUR 120 (U.S.) to EUR 150, of which EUR 30 is variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain of the degradation of working conditions on this line with a million daily passengers.
RER drivers, all in the second grade of their professional career, earn from EUR 2,200 to EUR 2,700 gross and from EUR 600 to EUR 650 premiums, per hour with alternate shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkey's justice dislodged the procuring party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court failed on Friday in favour of the resolution of the main procuring party in the country, a decision that immediately provoked demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the South East of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could be very difficult for the Government, which had just held a hand to the Kurdish community trying to end it up to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society (DTP) party was disappointed because it had become “the focus of activities that damaged the independence of the State and its inalienable unit”, said the President of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a majority of seven votes were needed to obtain the resolution, Kilic indicated, and added that 37 of the party's leaders, including his President Ahmet Türk and Mr Aysel Tugluk, are separate from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the end of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Turk and Tugluk, and the confiscating of the property of the party on the part of the Treasurer.
DTP has 21 banks in Parliament (from 550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament before being parliamentarians without a party label.
The decision is due to a procedure initiated by the Supreme Court prosecutor, Abdulrahman Yalchinkaya, in 2007, which accuses the DTP of obeying the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many more countries.
A number of observers believe that the DTP is the legal political escape of the PKK rebels.
However, the party ensures that it does not have "organic bonds" with the PKK, but refuses to qualify as a terrorist organization and invites the government to negotiate with it.
The Court's verdict intervenes at the time when the Government holds hands to the Kurdish community by proposing a number of measures to strengthen its rights, so that Kurds cease to support the PKK and thus end the conflict.
The DTP leaders claimed that a resolution could generate a recruitment of tensions in the Southeast Anatolio, where a large number of protests against the conditions of the PKK Chief's detention, Abdullah Öcalan, were generated in conflicts with the police during the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters have met in front of the DTP sites in Diyarbakir, the great concern of the people of the Southeast in most of them by Kurds.
The Order Forces threw lacrimogen grenades and used water cannons, while the demonstrators fired Molotov bombs or stones with dogs.
In Istanbul, about a hundred people were also concentrated.
After the verdict, Türk stated that the decision of justice was to "deepen the disillusionment".
Turkey cannot solve this issue (kurda, NDLR) by resolving a party, declared the press.
The Government, formed by a party from the Islamic movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle, we are opposed to the closure of parties.
So nothing is resolved, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision completely rejects the democratic opening by the government, political analyst Ahmet Issel commented.
We can, of course, expect a reaction from the PKK to add.
This Thursday, the PKK was assisted by an attack that killed seven soldiers three days ago in northern Turkey, one of the most bloody attacks in recent months.
Neves can begin suddenly
A truly fresh winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
In general, there is something that wants to make life impossible for citizens, says the Director of Road Maintenance in winter EES.
But with this, their employees can learn to test and dominate the entire vehicle technology.
It may be that at the end of the week the meteorologists announce it for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In this case, the EES shall act in accordance with an impudent plan.
As soon as snow profusely in Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called Tramos A with large vehicles with salt, explains Brauburger.
These include, for example, major arteries and adventures such as the Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also access to the body of bombers, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and trams with trailers, such as Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts around three in the morning
It should cover approximately 1,040 kilometres, as necessary, in a maximum of three hours with wet sand, which is better attached.
That's why the FES starts around three in the morning, "with it the roads are free until the traffic starts in the hours of the moment".
The difficulty is when it starts snowing around 7:30.
"Then we have a problem," said the director of the winter road maintenance, "because then no one is ready to waste space on vehicles with salt."
Immediately thereafter, when he is no longer swimming, he plays on secondary and private roads, which also belongs to the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is the side and secondary streets.
That's where the disturbances are generated, you know, Braburger.
Around five o'clock in the morning, FES' childhood is on its way, especially at dangerous and cross-border points.
In general, the EES could not be charged with all bicycles.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 to 4:30 does not lose the view of the bridge, says Braburger.
As these become rebalancing quickly, the vehicle with salt is started as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police can also call them.
The Dinosaurium
The Tawa Hallae had the same aspect as many other meat dinosaurs: an animal of two meters long and 1,50 meters high that ran over the two strong legs behind it, had an extended head with twisted teeth and curves, short arms with wooden hooks and a long neck.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it wouldn't have been something special.
But the Tawa halllae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in Thursday Science magazine.
The species lived around 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then located in a dry area of the transcontinent Pangea in the equator.
Tawa opened a new window to the early evolution of dinosaurs, notes Nesbitt.
It shows us much about the genetic relationships, the promotion and characteristics of the first dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists started excavating Ghost Ranch in 2006 in the north of New Mexico.
Sometimes, we have found a dozen dinosaur eggs in one day, this is something unprecedented for Triasco's settlements, reports Randall Irmis member of the Utah Natural History Museum team.
Researchers quickly identified some eggs as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation, the remaining five species were gathered in total.
A discovery confirms the theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt is an exceptional finding: "Treasic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other experts in dinosaurs do not share all such enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, such as Martin Sander of Bonn University.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs appeared for the first time some 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these first dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Therefore, experts are discussing, for example, when the sauries were divided into their three most important genetic lines: the carnivores among those found in the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the quadruped sauropods known as the "long dog" and their relatives, and the Ornithichia herbivores (sauris with bird pelvis), to which they belong, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to Nesbitt's analysis and his colleagues, Tawa Hallae is a primary therapist.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, comments Nesbitt.
For example, in the Tawa skull, researchers found air bags indexes, such as those that also have the offspring of the therapists, birds.
Thanks to air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawa also found the leaves of the vertebral column were clearly filled with air in part.
Tawa is the therapist with older and primitive air bags, comments Randall Irmis.
Because the inherited line of the later giant sauropods also had air bags and light eggs, it was likely that the common predecessors of both groups would already produce this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves towards North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs have so far been living in South America, researchers claim that the sauries were there for the first time.
As a result, the three genetic lines were separated at an early stage and extended from South America by all corners of the Earth, which was therefore still forming a single earth mass, the supercontinent Pangea.
However, the facts say that the team found together with Tawa to find the remains of the other two not very intimate therapists.
The three cannot descend from a unique legacy, the researchers argue.
We believe that at least three migration waves have been given to North America, reports Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, author of the Science study.
Of course, there are also opponents.
A more ancient species, Silesaurus, belonging to a group of dinosaurs, lived in the present Poland, comments the paleontologist Bonn Martin Sander.
His opinion could give a distorted image, because in South America it is simply continuing to preserve many fossils of dinosaurs, while in other continents there is only something to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs have evolved from a relatively rare coastal line of reptiles to the dominant land of Mexico remains an enigma.
While in Triasco the dinosaurs still shared their vital space with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of the current crocodiles and the pterosaurs and many other sauries.
At the end of the Triasico, dinosaurs spread around the world and many new species developed, while parentheses were scattered within the Triasco border to the Jurasic.
The successful stories were not eternal
There are two possibilities to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a massive extinction of which dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could beat the opponents in the area.
Success stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, the impact of meteorite has been on the growth of a group of species, which have also evolved in the Triasco, and since then have had a miserable existence: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and international signatures.
Participating in professors at the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California.
They participate in teaching in Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police departure from the occupied casino at the Goethe University of Frankfurt has affected the whole world.
278 teachers and cathedrals of the Goethe University, although also of higher education centres throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are solidarity with students in protest at Westend Camps.
In a statement published in German and English, they "refused" the police exemption promoted by the Governing Council.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the University, expelled last week the building occupied by students and teachers in educational strike, because the walls and works of art were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
Material damage, judging the signatories, does not justify "the violent resolution of the courses organized by the same students and cathedrals by a police command".
The expulsion represented a "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive approach to vandalism served as "the delegitimization and criminalization of the protest" and drew attention to the content.
The Governing Council has refused to establish the necessary negotiations.
Doctors require immediate withdrawal of the judicial claim.
Most of the employees have not caused material damage, it is said.
Protest on our lawyer's license
Young people from the Verdi union and the German Federation of Trade Unions are also solidarity with students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of growing concern for the future itself, comments the National Youth Secretary of Verdi, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Sciences of Hessen, however, defended the conduct of the director of the university and the police.
We are grateful to the director of the university.
The destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, commented on the issue of Current Stunde Thursday in the Parliament of the province of Wiesbaden.
We are understanding with the protest, but we are not understanding with vandalism, Peter Beuth, a representative of the Provincial Parliament by the CDU.
The opinion of opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the left is different.
The CDU used as a pretext the walls painted to criminalize the protest, expressed Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of carefully studying the students' arguments and requirements, they are dismissed.
The Left has submitted a motion requesting the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, unavailable for Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the 10 districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a well-guarded site for the secret investigation of arms.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, is considered to be the "Silicon Valley Russian".
There are important research and production centres for micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have contacted the scientific headquarters of Riedberg in Frankfurt, with universities and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Several mutual visits were made and now Wednesdays, Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Special Cooperation Protocol" in Frankfurt.
The Deputy mayor of Moscow, Juri Rosljak, and the mayor of Selengrad, Anatoly Smirnov, headed the Russian delegation; by Frankfurt, he signed the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010 they will travel to a seminar in Selenograd by representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the Natural Sciences Research Centre.
Scientific mode
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also deals with commercial relations.
The FIZ companies will have the possibility of placing a foot in the growing Russian market.
In contrast, Russian scientific companies wish to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenogrado is the seat of important Russian research companies and institutions.
Among them are, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the great Sitronics and Rossijskaja Electronica.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "City of Social Planning" for arms research.
Selenogrado (translated literally as "Green City") received his name from the landscape of forest mountains, in which research facilities were located.
Fronts of Stuttgart
Stuttgart 21 is not placed to anything high enough.
For project participants, it is simple and full of "the new heart of Europe".
The law I know. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, rather than a monster construction project, which will precipitate a decade of unremediated construction sites in the Banden-Württemberg region.
Stuart 21 came from the spirit of the 1980s.
Rile terminals, which ended in the middle of the city, were then considered to be the fossils of engineering in the 19th century, which acted as brakes of a modern rail traffic, since in ancient times a huge amount of time was needed to trap the rear locomotors forward.
Rodar, stop drying the trip; but that must be done.
And that's why the terminals were supposed to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a step-by-step station, which is about half of the trajectory of the trans-European lines of operation between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan of "Europe Heart".
The S21 will actually be launched, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have learned that in Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost impossible to implement the reduction.
The rail terminals of course have no more problems of entry and exit, since there are reversible locomotors with tractor unit and driver car at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE-constructed tram towards Ulm will already be launched.
Federal and municipal politicians have made it this way.
The railway continues, too, because the risks of the major individual infrastructure projects of the Republic are borne by the contributor rather than the State.
From the urban point of view, the project is still justified to a certain point.
New urban space is created, provided by many green areas, probably from the graphics generated by the designer's computer.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The step-by-step station and violent support are intended for the transport of people, which was attributed to the huge typical growth in the 1980s.
At that time there was no competition for low cost flights.
However, modern transport policy must first take care to strengthen the transport of goods, as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than road transport.
However, the new construction wires are good for load trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that S21 also directly affects many other railway projects.
More than EUR 6 billion must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official number.
Experts consider it to be more realistic between 10 and 15 billion.
It is certain that in the next decade money will be missing in other cross-border and narrow passages on the network.
A total of sixty major projects are listed in the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of more than 180 kilometres of long rows through the river of the Rhine.
Since 1987 the trail has been built slowly.
It would be urgent here to force the accelerator as it is due.
However, S21 acts as a brake.
The stream of the river of the Rhine will be the bottle for international transport of goods: through the heart of Europe.
The Government shall examine the judgement on the airport.
The federal government is staying in Wiesbaden's autonomous parliament if an appeal is to be filed against the failure to prohibit overnight flights from Hesse's administrative court.
The CDU/FDP coalition seems to have entrusted experts with the legal investigation of the VGH judgment of more than 400 pages, according to the Minister for Economic Affairs, Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had established in writing on this date, which, in the case of the construction of the northernmost landing track planned at Frankfurt airport, the federal state would have to re-order the night flight ban.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as provided by the federal government, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the noise population due to air traffic.
The coalition shall decide by 4 January, if it is to submit the appeal against this judgment.
The opposition criticized this succession and pressured the Government representatives to give up the appeal before the Administrative Tribunal of the nation in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gombel, called on the CDU and the FDP to respect its promises of prohibiting the nightly air traffic, which had been carried out before the elections. On the contrary, this could be taken as a lack of word.
It is very difficult, if one is left to fulfill his word, said the green chief Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the slogan of the FDP "We fulfill our word".
Minister Posch rejected the criminalization of Schäfer-Gümbel, which the federal government would be trying to achieve by means of law and tricks.
A thorough legal investigation would take a long time.
Coalition does not want to act on the basis of a "first fast printing".
We need a legally binding decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As represented by the opposition, his group's allegations about the nightly air traffic ban should never have been made.
The U.S. banks return the aid granted.
The large United States banks seized by the crisis are displaced from their state assets.
The Bank of America once returned the aid that had provided it with the tarp bank savings fund of a total of 45,000 million (about EUR 30,000 million).
The Citi Group also plans to return State aid, according to a report from the United States CNBC.
The institutions therefore seek to exempt themselves from the restrictions that had been imposed by the acceptance of the money, such as restrictions on the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high rates.
The Bank of America had achieved approximately 19 billion net money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum took the box itself, which had plenty of means, among others for the sale of grapes.
Banking director Kenneth Lewis thanked midnight especially the US contributors: the financial injection helped to overcome very difficult times.
The banking house had miscalculated the effort to absorb the investment bank in the climate of the financial crisis.
The Citi Group also intends to earn money in the capital market in order to be free from its obligations to the state.
The CNBC reported that the United States bank could already announce the increase in its capital by $20 billion this Thursday.
A representative of the Citi group did not want to make comments.
In June they had already returned their help to Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick Select
After all, everything was faster than he thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF's administrative council (German television channel) pressed the editor chief Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel may present a successor.
Yesterday night the Grim claimed to vote for the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the main study ZDF in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this on the part of the station, officially so as not to prevent the procedure.
But it must also have influenced not to harm ZDF Director Markus Schächter, if this proposal would not be approved in the administrative council either.
Frey, the candidate of Schächter, needs the support of nine of the 14 crew members.
The result of the vote was yet to be determined at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed in the administrative council with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender's contract for five more years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's destruction was a painful failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because most of the Union in the administrative council had indicated weeks before the election, that Brender would not be supported in his position.
The opposition against the editor-in-Office had been organized by the President of the Government of Hesse, Mr. Roland Koch.
He issued another mandate from the editor-in-chief with the argument, which, under the direction of Brender, ZDF's information would have lost auditing indexes.
Not long before the elections there were protests due to this, in which the political influence on the ZDF was flagged.
Finally, 35 public-law experts had been introduced into the debate, which qualified Koch's procedure as an inconstitutional one.
But he didn't serve anything.
About the person
Peter Frey was born in Bingen on August 4, 1957.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Roman philosophy.
He later worked at the Southwestfunk station and the Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper.
In 1983 he changed to the ZDF, beginning with the "hete-journal" information.
The following stations: 1988 to 1990 as the Chief Editor's personal rapporteur; 1991/92 in Washington; until 1998 Director and Director of the morning "Morgengazins" programme; Director of the External Policy of the ZDF; then Director of the ZDF study in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional request after the destruction of Brender, which was still elected this Wednesday as a journalist of the year by the media magazine Media Magazine.
Koch's opposition to the administrative council, the President of the Government of Renania-Palatinado, explained last week that federal states should change the ZDF's state convention so that the Director's staff proposals could not be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A withdrawal of partial policy-makers from the ZDF control grems was eliminated by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended before the administrative council with an intelligent game: he strongly criticized the Gremium for Brender's destruction.
Thanks to this periodical independence test, Schächter was able to appoint him for the editor-in-Office without losing his face, as the administrative council could vote, without having to suspect that he was given the post to a party sequencing.
In the calculations of Frey parties, it is offered in all ways to the liberals on the left.
The university careers are dissipated
A partial success for students: after a year of careers related to education, the Federal State Minister for Education and Culture gave up. At a meeting of the Ministers for Education and Culture with university directors, both sides agreed to try to improve the study conditions in the case of licensing and master.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of exams: basically each module of the course should end with a single examination.
It is also intended to consider the work of the students, and it is intended to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
Policy and universities also want to simplify the recognition of results of examinations between universities inside and outside Germany.
Federal states are committed to making structural rules more flexible together for Bachelor and Master careers.
Regulations of the federal states that differ from this should no longer exist.
Minor examinations
Since the beginning of student protests in June, the Ministers for Education and Culture and the Directors of universities have always talked about improving their ability to carry out and successfully complete a career (study).
Now for the first time, it was about a specific content.
The so-called accreditation council agreed to significantly reduce the number of exams: "Each module ends with only one review", says a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university courses.
The "sensitive reduction of the burden of exams" is intended to prevent development in a wrong direction, which would significantly affect the studyability, as explained by Mr. Reinhold Grimm, Director of the Accreditation Board.
In addition, in the future, "study" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
Modules and content should be considered sufficiently as to unnecessary restrictions for students in the choice of.
the courses.
Students should have "the right to obtain more space, which enables and promotes their own initiative".
These rules would be useful for new careers, but also in the examination of existing careers.
These should be "recredited" again every five years. But this would mean that it would be late by 2015 to examine all the courses.
Those responsible for this would be all over the country 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation board, installed by the federal government.
Education and culture ministers urged federal states in October to influence agencies in such a way that the number of materials and examinations were not too strict or demanding.
In some federal states universities and technical schools have already agreed with the ministries to take such measures.
So far only Renania-Platinada has ensured that additional means for the subsequent development of the process of Bolonia are made available.
With this money, universities must implement student education and advice programmes, and strengthen examination and external offices.
The Federal State and universities claim to have EUR 10 million for these purposes.
In early 2010, the government wanted to bring to Parliament a new university law.
According to it, there should be sufficient one review for the finalization of a career model.
The career configuration should be made more flexible, as well as ensuring recognition of evaluations in other universities and facilitating access to the Master.
Up to the end of the coming year is intended to examine all the courses about their "studyability".
This Thursday the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions of study in the federal state.
On the other hand, there were also criticisms of decisions.
At the federal level directive, Juso (young socialists) required that the configuration of the educational policy should no longer be carried out "by closed doors" by the ministers and university directors.
Later on after the education strike, students as main involved should also be able to think.
The president of the University Directors' Meeting (HRK), Margaret Wintermantel, gave her support to the students: "We need students' experience", said Thursday at a meeting with the Education Ministers, with which HRK discussed a joint reform document.
For the education and science union (GEW), Bonn's agreements were not sufficient: the union requires a legal right for each student with the title of Bachelor to access a post-master career.
In addition, federal states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are in a future sufficient place of study for Master with the best possible study conditions. Thus a member of GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller, informed him.
Federal states have to hire a lot more teachers.
But with more access to the master, the Education Ministers did not comment.
More than a note on Herta Müller's foot
"Enter and get out of Germany is virtually out of control," says the first line of a poem by Liric Werner Söllner in bilingual disequivalent language fragments, in which he fears the experiences of arrival in Germany lived by a dissident, who won his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked at the beginning as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and then as a reader in an editorial of children's books, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was awarded several literary awards, in 1993 he learned the memorable lessons or poetry talks in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002, he has been the director of the Hesse Literature Forum in Moussonturm in Frankfurt.
He said he talked enough last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the unfigured mirror of his security agents"
Invisibly insecure and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as IM in the Romanian secret service Security against fellow German-Romanic writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Prize.
Recruitment attempts had begun slowly in the early part of 1971.
"I am therefore someone who has not defended enough against attempts to provoke fear of security," Söllner concluded.
The Liric Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the grant of the Nobel Prize for Literature to Herta Müller and its literary polymymy without equal to the dictatorial domination mechanisms, the literary scene and, in particular, the German-oriented community of authors from Romania is cut off for a case that demonstrates the ambitions and the evils of a political system, based on control and spying.
Werner Söllner is, as you know so far, not only author, but also victim.
In his IM Walter security officer had played a role, literary scientist Michael Markel said after Söllner's confession, and he re-calibrated the influence on him positive of IM Walter.
He had apologized or defended him at all difficult points for him, said Marcel.
"I feel the moral need to make this statement," he said.
Söllner's statement in this way and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of an ex-deist and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable refuge for spies of the Security-Spitzel gewesen, wrote Herta Müller already in July in the weekly "Zeit", after reading his own 914 pages.
The participants will certainly have speculated and learned in some cases what names were hidden behind Sorin, Voicu and Walter's sydonyms.
Contrary to the revision of Stasi agents with a controlled procedure in Germany, the treatment with security inspectors is still quite widespread.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and difficult in recent years.
A National Board for the Explanation of Security Messengers (CNSS) of the Birthler Authority was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the delegates has since then been better monitored.
Since 2005, there has been a law governing the administration of dispatches.
An interview, after granting the Nobel Prize for Literature to Herta Müller, proved that the influence of former members of the Security Council in Romania is still quite great. In this interview an ex-prime chief of Temesvar Security spoke disrespectfully of the condecorate.
"She's got psychosis," they finally just asked her once.
The infamity of power seemed to be able to show without resorting to the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, as often as there are closed charges.
Why is it right now? Who has been hurt? The calm response of the listeners to Söllner's confession lets hope that the continuation of this story will be more guided by the anxiety of knowledge and not only by the dedication of guilt and shame.
For the genius of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize for Literature, it is more than a simple note to the foot.
The League of Campions as a guarantee to fill the stomach
When the new VfB football team trainer from Stuttgart, Christian Gross, accompanied by a orange plastic bag from the supplier of his team, approached a Mercedes class C taxi a quarter after midnight, he was impressed that a member of the elegantly dressed external service was coming out of a very pleasant Christmas celebration, in which the sports item manufacturer had distributed samples.
The man of the calva character had hired a driver, because he still did not know the city.
On the other hand, he could also drive the car himself: at the end of the day, there was no alcohol in the game, and he was not jealous of the man of 55 years.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow it would start work again.
I'd start it for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, which had been hired only three days ago: "It is true that we reach the final octaves," to know, in the Campeones League, that thanks to the triumph 3:1 against Urzicen Union of Romania, "but we can't let us down for success: we will have to fight brutally against the decline."
The "very important field" was waiting for them the next Sunday, he said.
Then, there will be a need to repeat in Maguncia the success of the "real classes" in the dailyity of the link.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly demonstrated again, after the rapid three waves of Marica (5), Tresch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Sort
The final octaves of the Campeones League (16/17 and 23/24 February/9/10 and 16/17 March) will be held in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy of the shining entry of Babel’s successor was still limited.
Not only in the supposed savior, who had recently inspired the uncontested professors of Stuttgart to trust themselves, willingness to surrender and enjoy the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on their strong points, I insisted that they be more fired, explained the undoor of Gross's soul recipe of success as simple sound, but that with the Babel therapist no longer had any effect.
He showed some magic, accepted Babbel's partner, Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse arises on the football, sometimes things that would not have been believed possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a few weeks of a stroke, continued to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "fenome" perceived with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way to work with the new boss: "He's a man who intervenes in the background, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
And that's what I missed when I was Babel.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warning sports director Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs everything.
Like Gross, the players and the administrator were also prevented from overestimating the triumph against a weak defence due to lack of revenues and fully based on the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with the 0:4 had arrived the sad wake, he thought Khadira.
And the Director Horst Heldt warned that although an objective of the season had been achieved, the other was still very far away.
We haven't dealt with the problem yet.
That Heldt would not like to celebrate in his 40s, even after the first victory in his headquarters for three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were re-update in the form of a television interview, transmitted just before the start of the game, which had given the porter Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions others make, and not Jens, Heldt faced Lehmann's harsh criticism.
This had condemned the weakness in the direction of the Board of Directors, who had decided to change trainer by pressure from teenage fanatics.
It would also have been eliminated after the games as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness", he said, and announced consequences for the last.
They probably won't be friends forever, the two-hundreds.
But at least they agreed with everyone else in which, without the previous efforts with the replacement trainer's team, it would not have been possible for the show of great play and battle force.
Babbel and his assistants had "a significant participation in success", said Heldt and Lehmann to the union; and I also agreed with the man in the plastic bag.
The world champion of heavy weights
Ardinente duolo in Berna: again and again the recruiter Kevin Johnsonn was causing the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his weight weight in the WBC version.
The judge's judgment was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko continues to be a world heavy weight campaign.
The 38-year-old champion in the version of the WBC Association won in the evening of the Friday evening in Bern to Kevin Johnson in the United States by a unanimous decision on points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was its third successful defence of the title since its return in October 2008.
Previously, Ukrainian had already been a world champion of WBO and WBC associations twice.
Unfortunately, the night that everyone had expected could not be achieved.
Klitschko expanded his balance to 39 triumphs in 41 professional battles, twice he had to win because of his injuries.
Rector Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his fight number 24.
Before about 17,000 spectators in the Arena of Berna, Klitschko, with a station of 2.02 meters, I wanted to dictate the fight, especially with his left hand.
But Johnson, 11 inches below, who had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era before the drought, was hiding once and for all the attacks on the world campaign, so Klitschko could not take decisively his dangerous right target.
In general terms, passive Johnson made too little for a rector, and only tried to pass the rounds.
Although he was causing Klitschko with words and gestures, his attacks were only rare times reaching the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who spent twelve complete rounds with Klitschko.
Before the war, the rector had already produced a certain scandal in the Swiss capital.
I had insulted Klitschko as "horrible zombie", who "does not know what to do."
When carrying out the burden, the campaign let the Friday get him out of Johnson's sunglasses "to be able to see his eyes."
The fourth triumph after the return of Klitschko
Also in his fourth battle after his return on October 11, 2008, Klitschko remained invasive.
After a nearly four-year break, he won at that time to Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered his "his" belt from the WBC, which had previously had to be delivered without fighting.
That year came after his defenses against Juan Carlos Gómez, Cuba, and in September with Chris Areola, from the United States.
In this fight I just got a hit, and I'm in very good physical condition, had explained Klitschko's quick return to the ring.
But his dream is still gathering all four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is a global champion of WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to British David Haye, after he destroyed Nikolai Valujev in November of 2,13 metres of statue.
In the previous summer, Haye had canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company that promotes it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium, London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack on the opposition: the head of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, called the Minister of Defence, Gutenberg a lie, due to false information on Kunduz.
The SPD and the left-hands require explanation to the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlín – Following the most recent announcements on Kunduz's air attack, the opposition has appealed to the Minister of Defence, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), who has made a mistake with knowledge of the cause.
In the release of "Tagesschau" on Saturday, transmitted by the ARD television channel, the head of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, said that the minister "the news had not told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two trucks.
In such a case, it is usually said: he lied.
The order to kill would have been taken into account the rules of the International Protection Army for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO had, and that was read by Mr. Gutenberg, Trittin said.
The Friday had been informed that in this attack, not only was it trying to destroy stolen trucks but it was also intended to kill two Taliban leaders.
In the U.S. Air Attack, requested by the German commander Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
Greens, the SPD and the left urged federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the federal parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel had to clarify whether an intentional murder strategy was part of the federal government's policy of Afghanistan, and if the Chancellor, Army and Information Service had adopted this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and his green colleague Renate Kunast called for it.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected criticism.
The Chancellor did not influence any concrete actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also doubts about the submission made by the Ministry on the reasons for the resignation of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to the SPIEGEL information, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and fully about the background of the attack on the trucks.
Officially, they had been said to have denied the existence of NATO reports and had hidden details from the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two high-ranking officials, it was reported that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a document of two pages from Colonel Klein, who was under command, and a report from a field patrol.
However, Wichert would have requested a letter clarifying the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sontagszeitung".
He hasn't received an answer until now, he said.
The Ministry did not appear on the Sabbath with regard to the complaints made to it, and pointed out that this would be made clear in the Federal Parliament's investigation committee, which would be the next Wednesday.
Unordinary worlds
In the state of alertness, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mental illnesses and drug addicts, there is a gap between imagination and reality.
While it happens during the dream, everything's fine.
When we are trapped in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can deliver ourselves without trouble to the bravest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, those who are experienced like sleeplike during the watch, or see and hear things that others do not see or hear, most of the time in the modern Western world is considered to be crazy or drugged, or at least as manipulative.
But such images and voices do not only arise from mental illness or drugs.
The crime has our imagination: the same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings, or write novels, sometimes break the boundaries between dream, joke and reality.
The alarmed state of consciousness that has changed anonymously can appear in the most different ways, in the best of the cases we call visions, and in the worst, we can talk about.
Although decanteries and effects can be distinguished, similar processes can be attributed to the visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the psychological experiences of the prophet of the New Era Carlos Castañeda, the states of Chamanic possession, and the psychosis and hallucinations.
Alucinations or deliriums arise when the balance of neuronal communication substances in the brain has been eliminated – above all dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcolin – and the interaction between different parts of the brain is interrupted.
During a schizophrenic psychosis very often there are complex hallucinations and dwelling thoughts.
The gravity no longer has power over him
The relationship between locura and sleep has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle designed the illusions as a form of a dream in the state of surveillance, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 a "great similarity of the state of living with the abnormal states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream even was "a psychosis, with all the disadvantages, trainings, and speculations thereof".
It's the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic figure.
Its body is of two dimensions and scandalously colored.
The gravity no longer has power over him, is floating near the roof of the room.
He feels a patada.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red mice such as blood, deformities, washing their teeth.
They're chasing him, beating him with heavy and flaming boots, throwing him against the walls, he's feeling pain all over the body.
Strong and malicious voices resonate from walls and radio.
You can't stand them anymore, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. opens two cables of the stereo, pulls them up to form a hole in the roof, and puts them in a hole in the roof.
He gets up in a box and puts the cloud around his neck.
Salta.
The door's down.
What a lesson for you!, the voices cry out in a choir that brings you back to the drums, "Come to the clinic and let them heal you!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six psychosis acutes, the last two years, the first almost 20 years ago.
The reason the product was LSD.
Its diagnosis is psychosis schizophrenia-affetiva-paranoid, it is also maniaco-depressive, taking medicines, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and deep despair, he says.
The hallucinations are a cruel reality
About 1 percent of the population falls sick at least once in schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common post-depressive disease.
In a acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the times affected are no longer able to distinguish between the outside world and the inside, and fall into an exhilarating state that can lead to hallucinations, deliriums of size, relationship disturbances, or persecution.
Especially extended is the voice of voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish the importance of what is not, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the consciousness is filled with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens up the compositors to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in the psychosis is focused on the subject, says cathedral Thomas Fuchs, chief doctor of the general psychiatric clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is located in the center of events, everything has a meaning directed to it.
At the same time it enters a passive role, like in a dream, feels overwhelmed by events and cannot organize them actively.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general, it is not possible to adjust the reality to them, the hallucinations are a cruel reality, awakening, impossible.
I've experienced a hallucination once in my life
In contrast to a dream, Fuchs says, "the spatial and sensory structure of the reality that is perceived in psychosis remains in principle such."
Paranoic thoughts and hallucinations are supported in the reality, the distance from experience has a place in the reality.
For researchers there is still an unknown reason why our brain makes knights.
According to Fuchs, exceptional states can lead any person to lose contact with the reality provisionally.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic provision for schizophrenia, but bone studies have shown that in addition to genes there are also other determinant factors.
Researchers believe that the affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that brain neuronal maturity is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a mother's viral disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it is still an unknown way that this change in the neuronal system occurs, which is also not shown in absolute terms for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or traumatic experience may be the detonators of a psychosis when there is a previous provision.
Likewise, alucinogenic drugs can cause a psychosis, as they interfere with the brain transmission system.
When the brain gets hot
The logic of all this is that psychotic people suffer with their hallucinations and take very expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that enable them to experiment with some, says psychologist Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Finding an austerity as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has collected ten years of reports on hallucinations and visions and has analyzed the results in the book Die Irreale Welt in our Kopf (The Real World in Our Head), published last year.
The hallucinations are among the typical symptoms accompanying psychosis, but also surprisingly, of many other diseases.
Among them are mental disorders such as personality or depression, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s and craneononecephalitis .
surprisingly and under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffers from hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of memories that are usually repressed.
They occur when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or are not covered; when our brain is hot, but also when they fail to stimulate.
Drugs can cause this condition in the same way that brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of incentives, stress, the ill of love or other brain states of exception.
In younger studies, up to a third of the respondents had at least once in their lives experience a hallucination.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. She was 16 years old, living in a small town of Mecklenburg-Ommerania West and attended a secondary school.
A running girl.
If it wasn't for those images and voices.
Sometimes, during the recreation, it happens that a boy suffers with long and dark hair.
When she answers, the other students look at her with surprise; no one, besides her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a little strange dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she's not dreaming.
He's awake and sees and hears that boy, the same way he sees and hears the girl sitting in the bank next door.
You may even feel your presence, at least a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes it.
Sometimes he asks if he's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the appearances are alarming.
The visions are often a load.
When he's in class sometimes he can't follow the lesson because the teacher – his eyes and ears – is presenting a new partner, while for the rest he explains mathematical equations in a visible and audible way.
At night, the appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for the dream to arrive, which often comes late and is scarce, you don't know if you're awake or dreaming, if the images you see, the mice or the girl with bleeding cuts in arms and legs, appear in front of their eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, call them in the figures.
Her parents and friends didn't tell them anything, they thought she was crazy.
October 2009. Sarah K. She is 20 years old today.
He approved last year's selectivity and lives with his bride.
A year ago, the hallucinations disappeared.
Since you've been in contact with psychologist Kasten on the Internet, you know it's not crazy.
Locust is also an art work for despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from an incentive restriction, it is very likely that after a while he begins to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is out of place and it's the same thing to look for entertainment.
Sarah K., the only daughter, had little fear of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he realized that the man he called Father since he used the reason was not his biological father.
Because visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real and noise impressions, to those affected like Sarah K. The results are difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Each experience," says Kasten, "has a place in the brain, the reality is projected there.
The hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, so they look so real."
Kasten also classifies night fantasy as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ essentially from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike the schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore recommends to his patients who appreciate his hallucinations as a special skill.
Sleeping and Aligning Limits
in this world too focused on consciousness, imaginary experiences are generally pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, cathedral in Heidelberg and medical director at the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious and painful disease but also involves something positive and creative – the fungi is an art work of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated so-called honesty, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as if it were a dream.
Ionacic hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person experiencing them considers them to be real and that they can no longer differ from being awake.
The unique conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with a trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyrradiculin neuropathy, who experience a motor paralisis with full consciousness. die bee vollem Bewussein eine motorische Lähmung Erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of one or more of the world due to a total and permanent engine disability, it replaces a very dangerous real situation by a self-evident and imaginary world that is disconnected from reality.
A limited way of dreaming and alucination.
Since it is impossible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change in the world, although the real situation is still present in imagination.
An intensive way to give meaning and interpretation to an inequitable situation in itself that our own creative capacity allows us not to complain about anything of lack of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The artist Peter Cornelius Claussen, from Zurich, also describes his unique experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as a life-saving action.
He was 49 years old, when his conscience was on trips several days after a heart valve operation, including heart transplant, while his body was sentenced to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen fell into a world created by the same and visited strange places of other times: he was laid in bed, a bigger man on the side of a sanatorium on a train, a robot wept for his health.
He was seen in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his country of origin, made Surf on his bed in the Alps with snowflakes and met with a Korean mafia.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in memories.
For Claussen, these trips are essentially different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, so describe your experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental travel are, many years later, much clearer, even in the relevant details.
More clear and intense even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience illustrates the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, ironicism, psychosis, hallucinations, and stupefactions show the fragileness that is the inner reproduction of external reality, even when we are exposed.
Every change in the state of consciousness, summaries psychologist Kasten, "may lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be entirely enriching.

Burda
Children will take charge of the editorial at 27 years of age
The new editor Kallen has come to a temporary solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, he commented to SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – Editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
Both children become heirs at 27 years of age and have a strong desire to enter the company, Burda, 69 years old, confirmed SPIEGEL.
Details have been arranged as precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will participate actively in the company.
Also, if they're trained for it.
One can't stand up to 7,500 workers to their children if they're not trained enough to do so.
That would end with the children and also with the company.
Burda told me the Thursday that it will be withdrawn from the presidency of the directive from January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This member of the Kallen family, 52, has been a member of the Burda Directorate since 1999.
At first he was responsible for technology.
Later, he was charged with the treasure and thus received responsibility for the company's estate. After Jürgen Todenhöfer's exit, he was also charged with direct marketing, foreign, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family takes over the editorial board.
The children of Burda are 19 and 17 years old. Their son Felix, who was now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's appointment also serves as "save the differences of 10, 15 years", according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
With regard to the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda showed that family companies are not safe from the decadence: "This has always affected families who are being infected by the advance of the capital search, who have judged wrong and thought they could be raised as well as the biggest player.
That's never been my strategy.
I've never had "great deliries," says Burda.
I don't see myself as a political predecessor of this country, as it was Springer, and I don't want to play with the "Time" in the world link; these businesses have become too big.
Integral Bell
Everything about beauty and well-being can be desired, as far as your hand is concerned.
This seems to have been proposed by the English Court, which just opened up at the commercial center of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and care of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has strong loans such as Hedonai - which is responsible for laser depilation-; Space, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi peluqueros; Marina d'Or, who has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a food section, which highlights the theatre, with more than 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while viewing the unforgettable views of the capital, or rent the relax area for two hours to set up your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relaxers with a Jacuzzi session, massages and taking a campaign cut are some of the possibilities that Spaxion offers.
Total are 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms to carry out the latest and most recent facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
For example, cavitation to combat cellulitis or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these machines, in addition to virtual 'trainers' which are guiding customer steps, offering them a fully customized treatment.
Everything starts by entering your personal key into a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
Then several videos show us how to perform our performance table correctly.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and drying) are sufficient to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And if, after exercising our body, we want to pass through pelvicaria, Luis & Tachi company has a room where ritual hair recovery, lightness or personalized nutrition are offered.
Innovation and exclusion seem to have been the premiums of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10:00 in the morning to 22:00 in the evening.
Variables
It is near Christmas and it is never too much to review the stars' looks to fit them into our party dress.
The shape of the scotch, very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we need to take into account.
There's a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an excessive and very complicated shot. It's not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The Endesa electrical company, together with the Barcelona Association, has created the 'LIVE Office'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logistics for the Implementing of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the road map for the installation of the electric car in the city and will achieve agreements around mobility, managing, coordinating, providing subsidies, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, it is intended to stimulate what will be the transport of the future.
3 'electrical cylinders'
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla join the project.
They are the three cities selected by the Government within the MOVELE Plan to stimulate the installation of the electric vehicle.
The Endesa electrical company has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
It is therefore intended to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalunia.
These would include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardization groups at European level and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a silence horizon' for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, sees "a horizon of peace" for the Spanish automotive industry, which he recalled is the country's main exporting sector.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has taken in the course of the exercise to support the car sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a panorama of giving up some of our main production plants," the President of the Government said.
"Thanks to this plan and the provision of the following brands in Spain, in a highly competitive sector, we can have a horizon of peace for the future of this industry, which is our main exporting sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Automotive Plan (IPA), was designed to appoint 800 million projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 subsidiary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than EUR 3,000 million.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to modernise existing products and processes.
Zapatero also highlighted the government measures to support demand, in addition to the 2000E Plan, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automobile brands.
According to the president, this plan has allowed the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in Spain to be reduced by 6 per cent and has contributed to a "strong increase" in matrices, which increased by "about 40 per cent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Room will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and motorists.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Crystal Babylon of the Campo House of Madrid.
This is an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres, with over 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only can you find classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid you will find all kinds of items related to the engine world.
Thus, among the exhibitors, accessors, exchanges, components, textile accessories, supplements, publications, thumbnails, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the classic engine that will make the deliciouss of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies are, among other things, Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-France Poeche sales and car restoration; or Classic Cars, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Tests of skill in the external
In addition, the commercial activity of this Chamber will be completed by parallel activities: the holding of concentrations, sports exhibitions, evidence of skill, presentations and contests.
Tests of skill will also be carried out with classic cars and motorcycles in a circuit equipped at the outside of the workshop.
Mazda3 i Stop: Sustainable sports
Mazda wants to show that sport is not related to respect for the environment.
Therefore, the stop and start system of the engine-baptised as i-Stop- has just been incorporated into Mazda3, a device that is currently only available with the 2.0 engine with 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 is highlighted by the good note achieved throughout it.
The exits, the end of the vehicle, the viability, the behaviour, the mechanic, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, we check that the front boots present excellent ergonomicity and subjectivity.
Also, the touch of the wheel is exhausted.
Following with the set formed by the table of instruments and the console we see as Mazda has continued the Japanese tendency to create a future interior design, with a large number of buttons and handles and calling colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of what is also presented by Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that both Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese and Japanese, are contrasting the sovereignty of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, to which they all want to beat.
Continued with the living room, this Japanese compact offers more than enough room for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In all of this there is a wide variety of patents and regular forms.
The engine stop and automatic start-up system, at least for the moment, is only available with a two-litre and 150-wheel fuel engine and with a six-way manual change.
This engine is a real delight. It is over by its finish, its reduced noise, its performance and the achievement of a contented consumption.
And it is that although the most demanding Mazda3 will be diesel versions, those who do not realize a high number of kilometres per year should not discard this i-Stop with a gas engine, both for their high run comfort and for their consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the version selected for the test is called Sportive, i.e. which includes a larger number of serial elements.
Of the series equipment, it is especially the car exchange assistant (RVM) that eliminates the dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive interior mirror, on-board computer in a large screen, parking sensors, independent air-conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch lens.
In addition, if you had little equipment, this version would have been with the Premium Pack, which adds up to 1,500 euros: make bixenon adaptations and BOSE audio system with disk loader, among other items.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts of the category.
It is particularly important for the quality of the materials employed, for their behaviour and for the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who don't make many kilometers a year will be able to choose this i-Stop version, associated only with the 2.0 of 150 horsepower.
The only inconsistencies in this model are its high price, which is between EUR 21.770 from the finished Luxury and EUR 23.270 from the proven version -Sportive.
Instead of this high figure, Mazda3 will offer us daily high-satisfaction doses.
'First' of July
L. A. Covers the red carpet of Sensitivity from Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have shed more light than ever in elegant models such as 'sexys' in the 'Nine' star. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', so sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark 'lady'.
The FonPeek Promise
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, not even possible to see certain types of attachments or browse through the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is harder, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid, for example, by the iPhone data plan.
With success the company has removed two new devices: one exclusively thought for Twitter, the other with a free life data service instead of paying six more times by Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third encarnation.
It's just as limited as your partner in the United States, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, of about 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it takes to give up the data when crossing the border or looking for an unexpected coffee shop with WiFi (or a background connection) to be able to look for the mail.
The idea of a fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and in time it would have to be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special arrangements and travel plans, but in my experience there is a lack of a doctorate in physics to understand them and good gloves to read the little letter.
The European Commission's repeated earphones to achieve affordable roaming rates for all of Europe have only had a significant impact.
Outside the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and rightly.
That a device such as FonPeek (does not stop being curious that takes the name of the Fund when Wifi is missing) achieves this type of tariff means that operators begin to think differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including the download of books and other online consultations.
No contracts and no cash.
It is a device connected and paid for it when buying it, not for months.
And that's what I hope to see some day with FontPeek, a purchase option with life-saving access like Peek already has in the United States.
Not because you're going to buy it.
I'm watching my e-mail on the phone, thanks.
I hope because I think it's a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
The yellow is undoubtedly the preferred tone of the first American lady.
If he has already attended the holding of Barack Obama as president of the United States with a dress and a dress of this color, he has chosen himself to accompany him in his second most important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has taken a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color - green yellow with brilliant reflections - the two times the performance consists of three pieces - dressed, jacket and cover of the same fabric - and adorned with a large edge or collar.
That is so, that in a first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States was following the star of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat her dress.
But the fabric in which the two garments are made makes them very different.
If for the possession of a bottle of a fat bag, Oslo is a printed third party.
The supplements have also changed: medium-sized green shoes once again, and a similar model, but in vain, now.
And also different is the penance: a collection on this occasion, meleen pulls the previous one.
75 per cent of working mothers have had working problems for their mother
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is how the study 'Employment and labour trajectory of women in Spain', prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women, reveals it.
The survey between 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75 per cent of working mothers have seen limited labour opportunities due to maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences at the beginning of marriage and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have a job outside of home, work part-time, or have a job that is not stable, start their marriage before their first motherhood, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, are delayed by conviance and maternity, and have less offspring.
"Women between 35 and 49 years of age with fixed employment have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after the beginning of the marriage, an increase of 4.1 women with fixed employment has taken more time than their livelihood to achieve, which has led them to oppose the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work performed has a lot of influence on maternity, although less on the comparator's calendar," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of studies is another factor that distinguishes women's age from when they marry and have the first seal.
According to the survey, the higher the educational level, the greater the age in which they get married and the greater the age in which they have the first child.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49-year-old group, those with elementary and upper secondary studies have been mothers for the first time to 25.1 and 32.1 average respectively.
"There is also another division between women based on their level of study.
While those who have elementary studies get married and have their first child before they get a stable job, the average or higher levels invest in this sequence and give priority to getting a stable job as a condition before marriage and the arrival of a child," Delgado explains.
Diane Kruger is worth it too.
The Paris Oréal just added a new name to his jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From the next year, the German actress will become a picture of different brand products, enthralling the universal theme of 'Why I Valgo'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actors of the international panorama, is joined by other famous figures from L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Funda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this selected club were the Evangeline Lilly actresses ('Perdidos') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millionaire').
In the male apartment, the cosmetic brand also includes luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox's (Egangeline's companion in 'Perdidos').
British Mode Awards
The British have much to say in the fashion world.
His senior representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - met in the annual delivery of their prizes, held in London, the Royal Court os Justice.
No one's missing the date.
The former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, chosen Best Year's Model.
Manuel Vicent's Poker
Manuel Vicent presents a series of photographs of writers that have passed through his literary life (and, in some cases, also by others).
It does not do so in predictable and frightening genes (biographical comparison, life and work), but seeking something similar to the core of ignition of the creative personality.
The trip has its excitements and Vict does not save dry or lighting.
In addition to a pleasure exquisite, the book is a moving invitation to reading and recreation.
I gave them some instants here.
About Albert Camus: "In his pages I found that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical, the same as I felt without giving him a name: the pleasure against the fate of steel, the morality of innocence and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nilist, an alegore Christian, wrote what I had in my blood, not in my intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a poetic smile revealing, without any sense, like the face of the knife I was about to kill."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was drowned by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirty years, in whose flesh combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of revenge, a spiritual privilege consisting of reaching heaven through the road of loss."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulises' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the tops of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which has to be scaled up the northern wall, from which the best alpinists are dissipated once and again."
About William Faulkner: "It was a rare guy.
On his own, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a condant and others who was the son of a black man and a cocodile.
Both dreams were great."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collected the scream slowly released from a bridge by that Munich character to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the 20th century under his literary form and did it on a journey running from himself and calling for succession with violent speech to the Gusanas."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she fell on her knees and said, 'Dear God, I beg you to let me write as a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb these words were written to Spencer: 'The dream after the effort,/ after the storm of the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after the hard life pleases death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In the team he also brought his depressions.
The husband accepted with all the normality that she had to tell him that Eduardo VII was spying on her among the lions or that the birds were singing in Greek.
Never has the case of a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent went before his locus."
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martin-Santos do but try to inculcate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try to pass on to Baroja for the weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cella do but take off that man's fame so he could serve him as a pedestal?"
Coward Aggression
Last week, my mother, about 70 years old, spent our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrad, when a group of young people aged 15 and 18 went over with her and our dog, an example of a mestitious breed, saved from the dog and not more than six kilos of weight and, without a word, they offered her two potatoes left to the injured dog.
Our anger is masculinious because we do not find fun in a free assault on a small and defenced animal, which, of course, was attacked.
This must be added to the suffocation that caused a woman who passed quietly and, when she believed these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energy that attacks an animal is able to do so herself with a woman, a child, an elder or, finally, with anything weaker than himself.
The event took place at five o'clock in the afternoon of any Tuesday for a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
Of course, we filed a complaint in a nearby commission that we doubt that it serves for a lot and not to generate susceptibility, just to make it clear that the killer cowards were Spanish.
Anger has led us to declare this fact.
We do not understand that it is happening among young people to consider it fun to treat an indefensive animal free of charge that gives us love, company and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have been left.
Michelin and Fesvial together with the use of casco
The manufacturer of Michelin Neumatics, with the collaboration of the Spanish Vial Security Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of cash, mainly among younger motorists, to inform both entities today.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of using the helmet, as it is the only protection element capable of preventing injuries in the head or even death in the case of an accident while driving on a motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign was part of his commitment to veal security, that "will go beyond design and manufacture products every day more secure" and that it also contributes to this goal by means of other educational and informative actions.
This new promotion campaign for the use of the helmet in the motorcycle, under the heading 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which cards will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycles, with the aim of achieving maximum circulation.
To conclude, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since as a nuisance manufacturer for two-wheel vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop more and more secure products.
Above the sale of light commercial goods
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see something light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units registered in November in Spain represent a rise of 12.6 per cent in 2008 and, more importantly, the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from Anfac and Ganvam vendors' patronage.
Good data should be placed in the accounts as the reference to which the comparison was made - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a 60 per cent decline over the previous year.
As a result, despite the response of the last month, the accumulated matrices in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January 95.853 units have been sold in total all vehicles that make up the light commercial sawcase: tourism derivatives, pick up, vehicles, light vehicles and trucks/light chassis.
Moreover, no one has been missing the most affected by the demand, since although they are also purchased by private individuals, most of the purchases are carried out by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay almost 100% of the cases through external funding.
In such a way that the restrictions imposed by the closed mortgage on bank credit should be added to other factors such as the increase in parity or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In the face of this panorama and unlike tourism, aid for the purchase of 2000E has been short.
In addition to the individuals, autonomouss and pymes who are going to acquire a light commercial of up to 3.5 tonnes of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, the number of operations has been evidenced.
Yesterday, from Ganvam again reminded the need to devote special attention by the Administration to these vehicles and also to industry (circuits and buses).
The sales association predicts a 2010 similar to the last year, for which it calculates a fall in sales (from tourism and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is already required
As with the ABS brake anti-blocking and the ESP stability control, emergency braking aid systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, it is already in all the light commercial tourism and new matrices, while for the rest a period of absence is set up until the end of February 2011.
The European Union's measure aims to increase the protection of pets, although it can also help to avoid many collisions by way of work.
The emergency brake assistant is what it does to increase the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the piston that the driver gives.
But it doesn't always keep that pressure to the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of components for Bosch car, the third party of drivers involved in an accident had not been able to force the brake before the collision and half of them did not take advantage of all the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, however, requires maximum braking system, reducing the distance used by the car to be stopped.
According to a study from the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with this type of element, they could avoid up to 1,100 fatal accidents per year in which petons were involved.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one of the four sinisters would avoid injury to persons - when the so-called smart emergency braking system is popular.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or a camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, help him by increasing pressure on the leg, if necessary.
In the event that it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device makes the maximum effort to minimize damage to the brakes.
General Motors delay until January the plan for Opel
While the workers of the Opel plant in Figueruela (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - on the 8th probably - according to the report of Javier Ortega, the US manufacturer warned that it would take more time to complete the Opel recovery plan.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, hopes is that each of the points of the plan has been previously agreed by the affected party.
And this can make the final document that will be submitted to workers first and then to Governments of the countries in which factories exist will be postponed until early 2010.
However, since GM it is ensured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the next days.
It is not strange that the Swedish Government has increased pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as far as possible.
GM allows to contact some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but supports the Dutch manufacturer's option of Skyper sports cars, which is supported by the Russian Converg group.
If he had not agreed with any of them, GM could sell some Saab assets to the Baic China.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year shall be maintained if it is not sold.
On the flight from Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop its latest, and toward joy, Porsche engineers took the S Boxster as the basis and managed to extend nothing less than 80 kilograms, which left the bascule in just 1.275 kilograms.
This led to their first approach to the automatic roof that has been supplied by one of the wires with manual action, which saves 21 kilograms; using aluminium doors such as the GT3, 'caen' others 15; removing the air conditioner, 13, reducing the fuel storage of 64 to 54 litres, gained 7 pounds more; mounting other 12 sports bags and with 19 light sheets, five.
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system resulted in another six kilograms and changing the door shooters by one of the screens, the remaining kilogram.
Although it is also offered with the double-beding PDK change, the test was carried out on a unit with the six-speed manual box, mainly on secondary streets of California, in mountain trouts with real-reverted trails
Your behavior can only be classified as incapacitated.
The weight reduction does not mean that the car does not break the asphalt with an aploma.
Instead, everything is different: it was a time when we did not test a model so small and light that once it transmitted so much security in the curve step, even at high speeds.
It's a small athlete, able to warm his muscles in a short walk during the time necessary, until we order him to print, to freeze, to recover and repress his engine...
What we're asking him to do, thanks to his direction, as well as his precise communication, what we say with our hands on the wheel is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with a surgical precision.
Engine sound by choice
The sound of your V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be enhanced by the 'sport' option and through a system that changes the brake of the engine, which has already been exerciated in Panama.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether from pause or in recovery.
Suspension is firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads that we passed with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car hit the bows well.
The electronic aid was just an act of presence throughout the tract; and that in some of the curves we find ice in the morning and the rough, it's already coming in the morning.

The Basconia Gives a Victory in Israel
The Labour Box achieved a brilliant 82-91 triumph on its visit to the complicated corner of Maccabi Electro, despite the many lows with which the team of Dusko Ivanovic was counted, and thus was located in the leadership of its group, following the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, which with eight recorded triples was the best of its team (29 rating).
The Victorian team intended to supplement the important absences of Herrmann, Olison, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work, although it had to endure until the end to be done with victory.
In addition, the great aquifer from the perimeter, with 16 annotated triples, had much to see in the final triumph.
The party began face-to-face for the Azulgranas, which had been placed from the beginning in front of the marker.
That the first four canads of the winners were from the perimeter had already predicted that they had jumped to the Israeli canyon with hot moustaches.
English and Teletovic were the main articles of 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was more than the same, but the team chose by the inner game of Barak and Elijah's work, which was received with pity and applause on the return to which his house was, to continue extending his advantage to rest (34-43).
Teletovic has already begun to highlight as the best of his team with 13 points, although the 'minimum six' of Splitter' evaluations had already suggested that it wasn't going to be the best night in Brazil.
But the party, despite being in a position to rest, was not even much less determined and the Maccabees wanted to remind the winners that in their song no one wins, and with 'the hand of Elijah' they were able to stand in the game.
Edson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to the return of 'marillos' to the light (50-49).
More Inconsistent
Ivanovic's wounded but not much less dead, needed to rent a couple of games with steel to catch air, and on these came Mirza Teletovic's amplifier, who with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the marker to a comforting income (54-67), which was able to make the premises at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The eagles came out to leave the skin in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they would not be allowed to leave what they had deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not reassert themselves and tried to keep their team alive from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter removed by mistake, the Ivanovics did not precipitate, they defended well, and although the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the party had already owned and the victory had fled from Tel Aviv for the first time in the period.
The injuries prevent fighting at Unicaja
The Unicaja lost strictly in Greece before the Olympics and handed over to the leader of the Eurolegi group B, in a party marked by the low castes, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated Greek victory.
The Malagian team was not affected by the environment of the pillar of peace and friendship and not by the rival entity, perhaps of the most powerful of Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first room allowed the Andaluss to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from Omar Cook base and one from Guillem Rubio, appeared at the places 12-18, minutes 9.
The Olympics were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja , although the arsenal of the locals in the internal game with Bouruusius, Vujcic and Schortsanitis gave him the turn to marker 22-20, min 13 at which an action, account of war, between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, subject to the disqualification of both players.
The Greek community began to function by showing its superiority within both areas, where the English pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez's three personal faults were being brought to the cassists.
Between the inner players and the Lithuanian hero Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the advantage 44-32, minutes 19.
Impossible to retrieve
The third period was very offensive to the Olympics, which, despite the 19 losses, was shown above and even achieved the difference between the meeting in Málaga 66-48, 27 minutes, which made the group's leader to fight.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last down of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all the inconsistency of Cook's direction and triples, and Lewis' contribution, he left some hope 66-57, 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympics when they appreciated and gave their superiority in centimetres within the area proved impossible.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to remount the stock exchange 81-62, minutes 37, and Unicaja closed, delivering the lead to the Olympics.

In the week when the application is in operation, the searcher has found that in general, the Spanish worker "is feeling payable", explained in a communiqué to Trovit's product manager Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Find your searchers in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the most paid.
A British computer programmer costs €45,226 gross annual and one French, 31.059, against the 24,000 who receive a Spanish.
Similarly, a driver costs €34,247 per year net in England, 25.751 in France and 16.420 in Spain.

Brazil dates out of Zelaya
The Brazilian Government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The depositary shall leave diplomatic legacy no later than 27 January 2010, when officially completing its mandate.
Francisco Catunda, responsible for the business of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed on TV Globe that "Mel" knows he must leave before that date of the embassy, where he has been refugee since 21 September.
"He is aware that he has to leave on 27 January, when he has completed his mandate, he has to seek another destination."
The station also referred to the former mandate, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline set: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the elections on 29 November (which resulted in the election of Porfirio Lobo), Zelaya made sure that she would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated when Zelaya rejected the political asylum condition that the Government had intended to impose on him "in fact" that was President Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring in which the inflation of assets has been dominant in the markets, once again the uncertainty returns to the markets, which should not be foreign since it is their natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by uncertain nature.
The medicine used by the central banks to stabilise the markets was currencyed with direct purchase of assets and indirectly giving free balance bar to close-to-zero types so that financial entities can buy assets for discounts.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have virtually been completed and, without question their heterodox liquidity policy, they are starting to take some of the arena in the orphanages as the ECB has done with its sub-item for next week.
As a result, investors doubt the global economy's ability to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a revision of risk premium reduction.
The flexibility of the Bols and the differences in corporate benefits have returned, although they remain very remote from the paranormal levels that reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was again affected.
Once again, there is a high-quality flight and the EU UU, Japan and Germany have been the chosen refuge by investors, leading to an expansion of the differences between eurozone countries with regard to Germany.
Spain had only been affected by this episode of instability but in that it came to Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision to the low-qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, there is no doubt that it is wrong for moral defenders to try to re-establish awareness of world economic policy officials because of the destructive effects of the credit restriction on employment destruction, when a new day of grace should be declared.
However, Dubai is a tribal struggle between the emissaries to recompensate power in the embassies and Greece we have seen before.
A government that hides public deficits, elections and a new government that pulls out the butter.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It does not make sense that Ecofin will save Hungary from failure to comply with its external payments at the beginning of the year and that it will allow a euro Member State to fulfil its commitments.
What is logical is that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and accountable to its citizens for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are confronted with an episode of normalisation of transitional risk premiums, after some overstated positions, it would be expected.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt are widening as well as we should not worry about European corporate benefits.
If the European differences decline and ours continue to expand, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncrasy risk.
The Standard & Poor's is an anecdotes. When our advanced indicators are obliged most of the study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to review their high-level scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, which return to charge with a Japanese stage for the Spanish economy does not open up much of the hope of life to their warning.
Again, it has all the painting that will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although at the moment "wisdom, driver friend".

The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday before the Congress of Members in which the energy strategy for Spain is being discussed in the next two decades.
After his intervention, following the president of Natural-Fenosa Gas, Rafael Villaseca, Galan gave the press some paintings of what he had planted in the subcommission at the closed door.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50,000 million euros by 2020 and another 60,000 million between that date and 2030, provided that the nuclear power stations are now in operation.
Otherwise, the necessary investments will not be 60,000 million, but up to 95,000 million.
Yes, Iberdrola believes that investments should be aimed, not at increasing capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and international interconnections in the coming decade.
Since 2020, the issue has changed and will have to increase power.
Its focus is on gas and carbon plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, it is considered that there are 18,000 new MWs, that is, with other "powers of support".
Galan, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act just approved by the Government is in line with what his company has come to claim, I do not want to take blood with the real decree to encourage national carbon consumption, which contradicts climate change policies.
In his opinion, there is "a clear long-term delay" in this regard, despite the "minutes" measures, as the President of Iberdrol called them.
Whatever the case, Galan believes that investment decisions, although long-term, should be started because they are late in maturity and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.

Act on your first bus trip in Australia with Hottief and Bouygues
Action fights for its first autopist in concession in Australia, a market in which it is already working as an energy company and water manager.
The work in play is of a tunnel valued at $1,700 million in Australian dollars (unless €1,047 million).
The French Bouygues and Sister Hochtief are their rivals.
A 5-mile tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the nearest option for Actiona to sit in the country as a construction and concessionaire of autopsies.
The City Council wants to have it at the end of 2014
After choosing for public-private collaboration (PPP for its signals in English) to advance the project, in a business plan protected by Erns & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to do with work and to exploit the stone.
Waiting for their bids to be submitted in the next month of May, the planned investment amounted to $1,700 million (EUR 1,047 million) and in the last phase, three partnerships with a significant presence of European builders.
The group baptized as Transcity is led by Actiona, the only Spanish in league, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second, located in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against the team of Actiona plays the Northern Direct Consortium, with the presence of British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last concert that took place in the past is the so-called LBRJV, where Australian Lighton shares capital (the company of the German constructioner Hottief, as part of the ACS), the local Baulderstone (the property of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the branch specializing in the civil work of Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises great works and privatizations, but makes it a clear difficulty to enter if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has followed the quoted Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which continues to be a pending assignment for the Spanish giants of the sector.
ACS has only achieved a position on that market through its 30 per cent participation in Hochtief, owner of the mentioned Lighton.
Millions active
It acts in a geographical area of maximum importance for the sector, in which it already has a high presence through its activity as energy supplier and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has its largest green park, Waubra (102 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for raising and managing Adelaide desalator, with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate these two areas and use synergies to enter the infrastructure construction and operation fields.
The underground stone road, promoted by the Office of Infrastructures of the city of Brisbane and called Northern Link (Northern Link), is called to join the western road of Toowong with the road of circulation in Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometres of tunnel. It is the most action to reduce congestion in the Brisbane traffic.
The calendar marked by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the work in December of the next year.
Although this payment step would open up the traffic in the last months of 2014, it is not expected that the work will be completed by 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two wheelchairs, an electronic pipe system and a complex ventilation system.

This action will provide fast Internet access to 400,000 people and will give German employment for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has transferred the construction project of the King George Tower from 27 plants to the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were still under way and Hottief has closed the sale to 129 million.

More than 63 million in France Telecom to boost competition
The competition regulator in France has imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France Télécom for anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited fixed and mobile telephony competition with the signing of exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programmes to consumers outside the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and the state company still collects more than EUR 560 million in fines since 1994 to put work on its competitors.
In fact, the punishment was increased yesterday because the competition authority considers France Télécom has committed similar crimes in the past and is therefore reciprocated.
Application Store
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile branch has followed the star of other operators and has opened an Internet application store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.

Play the Championships has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and to the Barca since its origin
The League of Campions has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
So, that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, what makes them the third and fifth clubs that have earned more money in the competition.
The list leader is Manchester United.
The list leader is Manchester United.
Gaining the UEFA Championships League is not only a source of glory. It is also one of the main sources of income from the major clubs.
Thus, the competition has allocated €5.362.5 million to 105 teams (12 of Spanish) who have participated in the event since the tournament was created in 1992/1993, according to UEFA data.
The Royal Madrid and F. C. Barcelona have been well-stopped from this department.
The white club has been the third of the continent that has been paid more money by participating, and the only one, along with AC Milan, has won the trophio three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the final winner of the Great Cup of Europe in 1992, is the fifth of the classification.
The list is led by the Manchester United and Munich Bayern, the two teams that also accounted for more money by participating in the past League of Championships.
And that, despite losing both of them in front of the Barca.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has made more money through the Championships, although it has achieved more titles than anyone else (five, for the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution
This seems to be explained by the complicated currency distribution procedure that UEFA applies.
For this exercise, the agency that President Michel Platini plans to enter 1,090 million for the League Championships.
From this money the UEFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs participating in the pre-classification round (including the Madrid Athletic) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who were able to participate received only 3.8 million for being there, plus EUR 550,000 for each party in question.
There is also a bonus for winning (€800,000) and empathizing (400,000 for each team). Octavofinists will earn three million each; the eight quadrupinists, 3.3 million.
The last four will be paid 4 million each.
The campaign will win 9 million, against 5.2 million finalist.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million.
The ship, on the other hand, paid 2.5 million to win the Superscope of Europe in August.
But there are also variable payments, for which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish is of the principals, and has four assigned places.
The previous year's campaign is with 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party shall be paid in accordance with the number of parties to be played in this year's edition.
New Rumasa offers €61 million by 29.9% of Sos
The New Rumasa Group outlined yesterday the details of the sale of shares with which it seeks to acquire a peak of 25 per cent and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not require you to launch a public procurement offer (opa) for the whole of the securities.
In particular, New Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 for action that would be paid in 10 years and would be paid with interest for this 1% arrears per year
Yesterday's shares closed to EUR 1.85; therefore, New Rumasa's offer is worth 18% below the market.
According to New Rumasa, the price of EUR 1,50 reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The German group gives a 15-day period for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling titles.
The CNMV had not been informed of the offer, although the company of the Ruiz Mateas claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
In order to achieve this, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when Sos' capitalization is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to restructure his direction.
In an attempt to remain on the edge of possible purchase offers and the judicial veals of their former directors, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar announced the election of Maria Luisa Jordan as head of internal audit.
A decision to turn it into the first woman in charge of the food business.
It is a new creation post that will depend directly on the group's president.
And it is not out of polygamy, as the company continues to engage in the legal battle for the alleged deviation of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar companies.
In fact, you can only disappear over the next few months.
With regard to the credit to the Salazars yesterday, the former advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Angel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) declared in the National Court of Justice that they had approved the withdrawal of 212 million undisclosed.
The CMMV authorises the option of excluding Paterinna which presented the Investor Sea

New devices to power cars
In these days of weather and accidents, not only do car dealers win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered from a sinister have been reduced to a workshop, where a expert must evaluate the damages suffered and which will be the cost of repair.
No sinister is equal, and the calculation of the costs of parts and the working time can be a long and complicated work.
The cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including human parts of work, may take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the most recent computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes
Therefore, almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
The service providers and solutions for the assessment of sinisters and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided by manufacturers, to develop it and provide it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audadex, of the North American group Solera, is the lead sign; 80% of the assessments are made with its products.
The other firms involved in the field of taxation and information processing tools are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with data provided by manufacturers is far too simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, trade director of Audadex, Spain works with 63 manufacturers and importers, each providing information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed does not stop increasing, to the point that in the last five years there have been many versions, varied and motorizations than in the previous five.
As a new car goes to the market, these companies are forced to work.
It is a very expensive job, because each of the thousands of pieces of the vehicle must be cataloged and put in their price.
In addition, each model produces a "intelligent" graphic image where different parts of tourism can be "pinchar".
If it is a veneer model, the work can be ready in a week if the process is going very fast.
If it is a minority car, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audadex has full information about 99.2% of the cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models are information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
With regard to the mobile park that surrounds, they exceed 99 per cent.
To carry out documentation and the development of databases, Audadex has eight world-wide centres (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), each of which is specialized in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three monitors.
Audadex invested 90 million euros per year in developing these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are included, and clients receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to make different uses and offer different products.
The most common use focuses on repair and maintenance, but according to which countries also have tools to manage waste parts or to calculate the van or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of users in Spain is Eurotax.
Audadex does not offer it in our country, but in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audadex it is easy to make an idea of the type of support that can be provided to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, including the AudaPlus star product, the standard solution for the evaluation of sinisters, for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light or heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it includes repair times estimated by the manufacturer or painting bars.
This tool is paid according to use, for each valuation.
The highest cost is €5.75 for low-use customers a maximum of 10 times a month.
Then every insurance company, which makes thousands of claims, negotiates its price with Audadex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it came out of the assembly line only with its number of tankers.
AudaGlass concentrates on the moons of the vehicles, and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to ride by the vehicles declared complete sinister.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, carry out geodemographic analyses, or to identify deviations by model marks.
You can, for example, study how many models of a certain brand have been passed by the workshop because of averages or how many serious sinisters have suffered during a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It sells, among other things, Gt Estate, which will also be for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Insa group founded in 1971 as a service provider and compensation for damage, loss or maintenance of the car
The Gt Tax Guide is its historical reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its business volume has increased at a rate of 20% per year in the last three years, and in 2008 it accounted for €10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year, their process of internationalization began with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audadex was born in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to sources from the company, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and 38% remain in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The global billing of the Solar Group (Audatex, Sidex, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, a 3.3 per cent higher than in 2008.
In our country, the company will enter 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solar Group was worth $1,000 million in Bolsa, and its actions now cost a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007 it has taken place in the New York Box and is included in the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Download by Internet of accidents cars
Last October the Solera group bought Autoonline, an online platform for the sale of cars such as motor vehicles or special vehicles.
The operation was made up of EUR 59.5 million per 85 per cent of the company's capital, which could be extended in the remaining year by 15 per cent.
The acquisition objective was to provide more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a vast international market.
This valuation and purchase service is directed exclusively to professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, credit companies, workshops, discounts and professional sellers who must be registered before the start of operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
3,000 daily ads are managed and about 100 new ads are included in the Spanish market every day.
According to the Spanish law, a car whose number of tankers has been given off cannot go back to circulation, but they can be used as spare parts that are not damaged.
Cars with historical value can be given up even if they have been given down after some terrible management.
Budget for four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user receives a budget in only four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for the replacement, create the budget and generate the budget.
The ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who are more or less likely to be more responsive to the use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 tourists, 109 all land, 137 motorcycles, 78 vehicles and 44 trucks.
Of course, a computer with Internet connection is needed to use it.
Once the model has been identified to be repaired by its carrier number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary change is selected.
The user may include variables such as the labour price, recharges or discounts, and may then print the budget to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a rating tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the orientation to the workshop does not include estimated working time.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is EUR 350 per year, which the client can finance.
At present, the Audadex company is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that the mechanics come with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and give it back to see the inside face.
