Well, then I'll go to Tom.
Looks like I'm feeling a little tired.

I didn't lose hope at the moment.
I didn't get an answer from her.
I didn't get an answer from them.
They never caught me.
I didn't hurt them at all.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.

I talk to her often.
I've often heard him play the tune of the tube.
I often play football.
I'm always skiing.
I only have one minute.
I only practice to look nice when I'm naked.
I need to break your neck.
I owe him a lot to Tom.
I owe Tom for this.
I paid a fine.
I'm going to skip lunch.
I'm planning on visiting Tom in Boston next weekend.
I love dogs more than cats.
I want more cheese cheese than cheese.
I'd rather be a subpoena egg.
I prefer black.
I'd like to sit down more.
First I'd walk alone.
I'm sure I sound funny.
I promise you I won't do anything to hurt you.
I hit him with a box in his pocket.
I pressed the button to include the radio.
I drew the word "Alice" to mark it.
I proposed it.
I put three coffees of fake sugar in your tea.
I've opened the tower.
I gave up smoking overcrowded.
I gave up.
I'm looking at the stock.
The Iranians are a peaceful people.
I read his book.
I read Tom's story to him.
I realized I haven't eaten yet.
I'm really getting married.
I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like how your hair looks.
I really like wine.
I like your website very much.
I really love your old sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss my mother's cooking.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I really want to learn French.
It would really be nice to keep quiet.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize the guy.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember how I met the queen.
I despise his rude attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I cried out one.
The iron is stronger than the gold.
Isaac Newton died as a virgin.
I said I'd bring him.
I said maybe he'd shut up.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I agree.
Is there anyone in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Did he miss something?
I saw a ghost at night.
I saw an unidentified plane object.
I saw her a week ago.
I've seen him right now.
I saw how playing cards with all of them.
I saw him there.
I saw my sister filming the letter.
But I didn't see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sandwich in the mill.
I saw Tom do that.
I saw Tom and Mary.
I saw Tom.
Is Boston far?
Buddhism Is Religion or Philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he did?
Are they caloric?
I don't see the deal here.
"I see," said the blind man.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
I left early to get the first train.
Is everyone busy?
Are you all happy?
Is everyone having fun?
Is everything there?
Is he breathing?
Does his aunt eat apples or bananas?
I just got off with my head.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
I should be sorry about them.
I need to take her home.
I need to pack.
I have to go get dressed.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have believed her.
I shouldn't have done that without you.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom.
I should regret it.
I should look.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I was supposed to be a cult.
I should've checked.
I should've done it yesterday.
I should have known you'd be here.
I should have refused.
I showed her my room.
Are you cold out there?
Is it done?
Is it far from here?
Is Tatoeba really very slow today, or does it seem to me?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is it true?
I've got him a bottle.
I'm sleeping on my feet.
I'm sleeping in chairs.
I slept like a swear.
I slept in the couch.
I slept on the bus.
I broke the sandwich.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholics?
I was laughing.
Isn't that exciting?
Is it not possible for Tom to do this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that too much?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
Isn't this too high?
I kind of like it.
I spent the whole day cleaning my snow.
Is he a cab driver?
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Is it really so beautiful?
Is that your mother?
I jumped into the man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I found something strange.
Is that what Tom's doing?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Does that actually exist?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that what I'm saying?
Is that satisfactory?
Is that Tom's coat?
Does Tom think that's what happened?
Did you do that to them?
So there's Tom?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you don't want to help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge safe?
Is it hot coffee?
Is the house over?
Is the lake deep?
Is he paying for the delivery?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Is there any food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there a sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a reward?
Is there something specific that you want to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this where this is?
Is he really a diamond?
Is that necessary?
Is this right in English?
This is Jupiter or a bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is it your radio?
Is anyone sitting here?
Is this a place free?
Was this all the excitement?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
This is your anger or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still don't believe Tom left.
I still don't believe it.
I still don't understand.
I still don't know how to do that.
I still don't understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still love horses.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know he's swimming?
Is Tom back?
Do you know Tom?
Does Tom contribute?
Is Tom dead?
Does Tom die of cancer?
Is Tom having fun?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is Tom looking for them?
Did Tom get angry with you?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
You're talking to Tom?
Is Tom there alone?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I've burned a hybrid in the dark.
I'm learning art history.
I suddenly felt old.
I'm losing the asthma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest we focus on the demand for exit from the cave.
I suggest we go home.
I'm starving you to get away with it.
I suggest you send someone outside to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
That's how I doubted.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
I was swimming in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't even deal with you if I burned you and you were the last cup of water.
I'll be there every day.
Are you still the freezer?
Is your head full of bruises?
I use the opportunity to thank her.
Italian police are driving me crazy.
I talked to my advisers about what I was going to take.
This whole thing makes sense.
It looks unfair.
It always happens the same way.
There can't be any chance.
So it wasn't.
It's not possible!
It's for you now.
He did a lot more than I expected.
Never, but never, could that ever happen here.
There's no way he was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
It'd be good.
I didn't care.
We didn't mention that.
It's not that bad.
That disappointed him.
It'd look good.
Don't interrupt me.
It won't improve.
It doesn't look very different.
It doesn't matter what you don't want to do; you have to.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't seem to help.
Doesn't sound like he knows what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I translate Chinese.
I'm learning English.
It's Taman.
That gave me an idea.
I've got something to do with it.
It had to be done.
It has to be from somewhere.
Depends on your decision.
It happened too soon.
It's happening.
It's happening.
It's crazy.
There's no connection to happiness.
It wasn't easy for us.
It has a sentimental value.
I've been thinking about it all day.
I think about him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think something's hiding?
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one of these.
I think I'm born.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I think I know how to stop him from happening again.
I think I'm going to eat outside.
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see what he's like.
I think I love you.
I think I've made it clear.
I think I'm pretty good at writing.
I think I'm pretty normal.
I think it's possible to cook.
I think I'll be fine.
I think I should watch Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I'm quite good at speaking French.
I think it's risky without any help.
I think it would be best to stay here for a while.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I think it's time to go.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to borrow Tom's money.
I think I figured out how much time we should leave.
I think I'm wrong.
I think maybe I can help her.
I think he's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel will be a little expensive for you.
I think that's terrible.
I think that's crazy.
I think it's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom left.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom's not breathing.
I think Tom's conservative.
I think Tom was brave.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom's great.
I think Tom's serious.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom's evil.
I think Tom's nice.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's a little girl.
I think Tom's a cypress.
I think Tom's rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's cute.
I think Tom's sensitive.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom's gonna go.
I think we can get him.
I think it's better not to drink this water.
We better not get out of this storm.
I think we'll join.
I think we're close to a solution.
I think we're done.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we ate enough.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it deliberately.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you'll have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you've panicked.
I think you're making the problem worse.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should choose her.
I think you should do this alone.
I think you can help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've lived in the jungle for a long time.
I think they lied to you.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think I need you to end up with this.
I think it helped enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I thought about you.
I thought he had bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
I thought I lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I thought it was my cause.
I thought you already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom's gone well.
I thought Tom went to retirement.
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
So we didn't agree?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd stay here for a while and talk.
I thought we'd visit the museum together.
I think you're gonna have a job at the goose.
So you didn't want the reward?
I thought you found another one.
I thought you lost your hand clock.
So you don't hate him?
I felt tired.
I thought maybe you could help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you were just dating girls who were lower than you.
So you didn't know how to play the piano?
So you didn't say you know how to swim?
So you didn't say you wanted to go with us?
I thought you'd better play chess than me.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you'd live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I didn't think you'd be busy.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
I'm so sorry to be here.
Mary's nervous when Tom leaves the shop cap.
It's a multifaceted process.
It depends on whether we buy it or not.
He's in school the first day.
I can't answer the question.
There's no way I can finish the job in one day.
It's less cool today than yesterday.
It's not quite cold.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Can I use that?
I'm paying.
It doesn't come into consideration.
They say the old hat is broken.
It begins to enter our minds that we cannot ignore nature.
He's been buried since yesterday.
It's worth citing a famous passage of his essay.
He's writing on his head.
It's written on his face.
It's kind of wrong with me.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
It happens all the time.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be Christmas soon.
It's gonna be hard to convince them.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be worth it.
It looked terrible.
He looked funny.
You look right.
It looks very delicious.
It looks different.
Looks familiar to me.
It looks like eggs.
It looks like I've had too much drinking yesterday.
It looks like these two are in touch again.
It looks like the two of them were calm.
Looks like we're gonna have snowy Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks nice.
That's how I got close to Tom.
You've broken me.
I'm worried.
It could be dangerous.
Maybe it'll be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
Maybe it sounded like a proposal, but it was an order.
Maybe he'll close up tonight.
Maybe he's acting weird.
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just an accident.
It's possible to come back today.
It must have been her.
I'm sure I'm surprised.
It must be perfectly symmetrical.
I told him when I saw them, and I told him.
I told the police that Tom was with me that time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I couldn't.
I told you it'd be hard to get out.
I told you my father died when I was thirteen years old.
I told you this was gonna happen.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I slept.
I'm back with the bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
My pants were removed.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I fully understand.
It's probably not worth waiting.
He came back two days ago.
He's been having a lot of trouble.
I tried to explain it to him, but he didn't.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to make him come.
I tried to make them stop.
I tried to pretend I'm something I'm not.
I'm really sorry about that.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to smile at you.
I'm trying not to smile.
He's ready to shut up.
That's classic.
It was a real disaster!
It is recommended that you check whether there may be any negative effects if you drink alcohol while drinking the prescribed medicine.
It's a child game.
That's a good system.
Everything's in the file.
It's all in the room.
It's all over.
It's all over now.
That's all they're talking about.
It's all very weird.
It'll be done a little bit more.
It's gonna be a little late in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She'll have to go.
He's having fun.
It's already seven o'clock.
It's already eleven o'clock.
It's already opened.
That's a minor mistake.
It's great you've survived.
It's good to see you.
There's nothing to think about.
It's too bad you've lost yourself.
It's about integrity.
It's an intelligent compromise.
That's a fake clue.
It's a risk plan.
It's too bad the concrete doesn't burn.
It's coming fast.
It's a simple thing.
It's a special reason.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a beautiful idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
He's locked up.
It's just my mom's bringing me.
It's been a week, up-down.
Three weeks have passed since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
This week is extremely hot.
It would be best not to talk that much.
It's better to be alone.
It is better to be optimistic and to lie rather than to be a pessimist and to be right.
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
It's empty.
Sauna's here.
It's the new money.
You scared me.
There's no one.
It's time to close up.
-Study here.
It's generally known that you're not dear Tom.
It's dark here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to evaluate his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easy like this.
It's easier not to end up in jail than to run away.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can easily distinguish them.
I guess I misjudged him.
It looks like her style.
I think that's the only possible conclusion.
It looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's what you need.
It's bad to hunt.
It's exactly ten o'clock.
That's what happened before.
It's very rare.
It's right.
It's fair.
To protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching TV is fun.
She's getting dressed.
It's dark.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's going to be wild.
It's gonna get colder.
It'll happen soon.
It's nice to see you all again.
That's a good training.
It's okay.
It's improved.
It's very fun.
It happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's her.
He's hot here in hell.
That should be possible.
It shouldn't take a long time for this.
I don't care what you think about Tom.
It's impossible for him to quit smoking.
It's impossible to get out of the cell.
It's a safe place.
He's in great shape.
He's in the basement.
I'm just kidding.
A simple question is where.
It's just invented.
Just sit there.
It's a little ahead.
It's locked.
It's made of skin.
I'm making a decision, Tom.
That's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to carry such gifts.
It's nice to feel you need someone.
It's not a big miracle.
It's not a big miracle.
It's so quiet here.
It's not your job!
It's not a secret that Tom doesn't agree with you.
That's not a big priority.
That's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not back.
That's not what happened.
It won't be easy to do that without much help.
It's not hard to notice if you're surrounded by fools.
It's no big deal.
It's not just a guess.
It's not usually a penny.
There's not enough light to read here.
It's not like we're doing something.
It's not my decision.
It's not my fault.
You don't have to.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not yet summer.
I'm not surprised.
It's not that deep.
It's not too early.
It doesn't matter to you.
It doesn't happen very often to someone buy a $1,000 hat.
It's not worth much.
There was snow last night.
It's obviously a print error.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
It sounds very strong.
Sounds very good.
Our job is to help them.
It's white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably right.
He's probably still there.
Probably still available.
It's done.
Actually, it's very common.
It's really delicious.
It's very possible I'm not right.
It's possible Tom won't help us at all.
It's just simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really bad.
It's the right thing to do.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
But it's strong!
It's a law!
It's so obvious that we don't need evidence.
It's getting dark.
It's still dark out there.
It's still on sale.
It's still working.
It's still not okay.
You're still growing.
He's still there.
It's weird how people in Tropical Zones eat junk food like cari.
It's stuck.
His surface was as flat as a mirror.
It's time for that again.
This is the best mission I've ever tasted.
It's a pajamas.
I'm so scared!
It's time to get to work.
It's time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It's too dangerous to fight them at their choice.
He's strong.
It's bullshit.
It's all wrong.
He's not holding his temper.
It's unique and irreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really hot.
I need to see Tom fast.
It's very relaxing.
It's very simple to understand.
It's hot here.
I don't care.
There's a wind.
It's from work.
You're losing.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
There's only three minutes on the water.
It's been all night.
He lived a lot more than I thought he would.
I needed a long time to get rid of those ants.
It looks like you're an unexpected beauty.
I put the ventilator on and put it on the wall.
I included the lamp.
I turned off the TV.
I rejected Tom.
It was a great honor to be asked to keep the talk.
It was so beautiful.
That was shame.
It was about midnight.
This was Arren day.
It was a great show.
It was all my idea.
It was all right here.
Everything was so easy.
That was an amazing evening.
It's been a while.
It was a terrible sight.
I was honored.
That was a offer I couldn't refuse.
It was a pleasure to spend the night with a smart, spiritual, and beautiful girl like you.
That was an extraordinary experience.
That was a surprise.
That was a wonderful experience.
It was a hard test.
It was a warm night.
It was a beautiful day.
It was a wonderful day.
It was a wonderful evening.
That kind of behavior was childish by him.
It was nice.
It was working.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was one of them.
It was fun last night.
It was all night.
He was freezing.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a beautiful gift.
It was nice of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It wasn't easy for me to admit I was wrong.
It wasn't easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty disgusting.
It has been shown that dogs ’ disease is higher than those who live on cats.
It was so great.
It was pretty funny.
Epten was cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really tricky.
It was a lot of noise.
It was extraordinary.
It was necessary.
It was seven and a half.
The day was so beautiful that we decided to climb.
It was so obvious.
It was awesome.
He was still there.
Tom gave me the picture that's stuck on the trigger.
It was Tom.
It was too much.
It was sad.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was ridiculous.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
It was very disgusting in that area because all the windows were closed.
It was Bether.
He deserved to try.
It was your fault.
It's not gonna be okay.
It won't be enough.
I'm not gonna be alone here.
There's nothing that's gonna cost you to fix it.
They won't help lies.
It won't help you.
He's doing good.
It would be very normal to be mad at Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk tomorrow if I can explain everything to you.
I need you right now.
I've been watching you before.
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I'm using that computer.
I'm using this.
I've already packed.
I've already read it.
I already wrote everything I needed to write.
I've already written my part of the report.
I've always woke up on Tom.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
He's always been helping me.
I always thought you were from Boston.
I've always wanted to get to one of these.
I've always wanted to live in such a place.

Would you like to watch TV?
Can you check those?
Can you send a message to Tom?
Could you throw out the cigarette?
Would you put this in the car for me?
Can you speak clearly?
Would you take part in this event?
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Wow, it's really late.
Look at this.
Oh, so that's great.
Look!
Write your birth date.
Write it to Tom.
If it were, he'd fix it... when the worm was born.
Yeah, bring me a cup of coffee.
Yeah, anyway.
Yeah, I said that, but I wasn't right.
Yes, my angels.
Yeah, and?
Yeah, so?
Last night, I prepared a cake with cookies.
I came here yesterday.
It was hot yesterday, but it's sustainable today.
Jogota is coming from India.
You all look so busy.
You always forget.
You always misunderstand me.
You're always leaving the current bloke.
Me and you will fly with the same plane.
You don't seem to know how it hurts to kiss you alone.
You're a good cook.
You're beautiful.
At the same time, you are heavy and easy, and pleasant and hot; I can't live with you without you.
You're drunk!
You're my friends.
You're my lucky one.
You're my pride and my joy.
You're not a Japanese.
You're not a Canadian.
You're not invited.
You're not following.
You're one of us.
You're also proud of the pool.
You're under oath.
Shut up.
He's here before them.
You asked me to help.
You're making bread in your ovens.
He beat her.
You borrow books.
You can ask me what you want.
You can ask them yourself.
You can ask Tom.
You can avoid this kind of trouble if you have these tips.
She can be trusted.
You can beat me, beat me, and even destroy my body, but you'll never shut my mind.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
You can count on us.
It's easy to get to know Tom because he's very tall.
You can eat as much as your soul wants.
Now you should go, sir.
You can go and stay - whatever you want.
You can get out of here.
You'll find out.
You can handle this.
You can take mine.
You can recognize the children's voices without problems.
You can make your job easier.
You can rest.
Now you can sit down.
You can stay in here.
You can only stay if you're quiet.
You can study here.
You can rest.
You can talk later.
You can't beat me.
You can't call them.
You can't control me, Tom.
You can't deny it.
You can't deny it.
You can't do what's gonna happen to you.
You can't let her go.
You can't let him go.
You can't help us now.
You can't leave the baby alone.
You can't leave Boston today.
You can't let that happen.
You can't marry Tom.
You can't prove anything.
You can't sell it.
You can't sit there.
You can't take it from me.
You can't treat me like this.
You can serve with my car.
You can use this car.
You can use this pencil.
You're quick to get the data.
You're making a mess with bugs.
You might be wrong.
You could have refused.
You'd be a great mother.
You better ask them first.
To find them.
You better go help him.
You better go.
You better let me do that.
You deserve a medal.
You deserve a higher salary.
He deserved better.
And you'd be my place too.
He's doing a bad job.
You've done your job well.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You didn't give me a chance.
You didn't know Tom was a faggot?
You didn't listen.
You don't see anyone coming in, do you?
You didn't tell me it was wrong.
You told Tom about it, didn't you?
You already did that.
He gave it all to himself.
You don't have to like everything.
You don't want any fish.
You're sick, right?
You don't have an accident key?
You don't know how long it's been.
You don't have to be abnormal to work here.
You know my whore.
You don't know anything.
You dream you know.
You don't really love Tom, do you?
You don't have to be present for this.
You don't have to go.
You don't have to panic.
You don't have to wear anything ugly.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
You don't understand business.
You don't want to do anything that would remind them that you're not really big enough to be here.
You don't want to go, do you?
You're not working here.
You're driving me crazy.
You forgot your morning!
You scared Tom.
He gave Tom the list, didn't he?
You're entitled to a phone call.
You're going to get Tom back.
You hit one.
You're not right, people.
You were right, guys.
Your hair is bad.
You hate us, don't you?
You've got a great job.
They're in danger of conscience, aren't they?
You have a habit I don't like.
You have small towns.
You have beautiful lips.
You were a great mentor to me.
You were busy.
You have lovely eyes.
You have a lot of different types of people here.
I respect you.
You don't have any idea how to do that, do you?
There's no reason to be afraid.
You don't think so, do you?
You didn't see it like that, did you?
You don't have a problem with him, do you?
You've got a really good manuscript.
Mikey's your hands.
You have to answer the question.
You have to ask them first.
You have to buy them a present.
You have to go home.
You have to help him.
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
You have to take a leave.
You have to come.
You have to stick away from him.
You can't lose your condition.
You have to try, Tom.
You have very beautiful lips.
You've got a lot of protruding eyes.
You've heard it.
Just get back from the rest.
You missed him for a while.
You missed Tom for a while.
You don't get involved in this.
Kids, you're staying here.
You knew, didn't you?
You know I'd do anything for your beautiful eyes.
You know I don't eat meat.
You know me better than you do.
You know me well.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
You know what I need.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
Quick story.
You'll learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
Leave me alone.
You let Tom escape.
You want your life, don't you?
You'll be all right.
You'll be confused.
You'll be in danger.
You'll be my guests.
You'll be known in time.
You'll feel better.
You'll get a copy.
It'll be better for you.
You'll get them back.
They'll make you weak.
You're gonna try, aren't you?
You're going with me and a point!
That's what you're gonna have to ask.
You're gonna have to learn the next year.
You'll have to talk to Tom about what you're expecting him to do.
You'll need a map to travel by bus.
You're gonna have to sit still.
You'll never find her.
They'll never take you to that club.
You'll never guess.
You'll never know.
You'll know when it's time.
It looked great.
You look familiar to me.
You look beautiful.
You look pretty bad.
You look very good.
You look sad, what's wrong?
You look imaginary.
You look very nice, Tom.
You've earned something.
You gave me a word.
You're messing with me.
Maybe you'll need it.
You can go anywhere.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
You can sleep here.
It wouldn't be bad for you to slow down.
She met my sister, didn't she?
Maybe you can help them.
You have to be careful.
You must be confused.
You must be very easy.
You must have jumped.
You must be very proud.
You must be strong.
You have to show yourself first.
You have to forgive me.
You have to help her.
You have to beat the kid.
You can't give up.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
You have to learn valuable.
You need a friend.
You need a good woman.
You need to buy some sugar.
You should do it somewhere else.
You need to make him listen.
You should grow up and grow up a little.
You need to help her.
You need to help me find him.
You need to hurry.
You have to do this to work.
You have no question why.
He didn't give them a chance.
We only have one life.
One's a life.
You need to make a habit of mixing your teeth every meal.
You need to go to a dentist.
You owe me nothing.
You pay me very well.
You've made a good choice.
You probably think I'm a traitor.
He's gone red.
He ran as fast as he could.
You're burning your car.
You're burning your car.
Your complaints upset me.
Your crimes have spread the graves of your ancestors.
Your demands are unreasonable.
Your desserts are attractive, but we're quiet.
You're ready to cry.
You're totally right.
You're a real human being.
You're acting weird.
You're a virgin.
You're a cheater.
You're after them.
You're a good son.
You're a nice man.
You're all scared.
You're all the same.
It really does.
But you lied to her.
You really need a psychiatrist.
You really should have let me call a cab.
You're always tired.
You're a moron.
You're nobody and nothing.
You're a pig.
You're a prisoner.
You're a racist.
You're really nervous.
You're a bitch.
You're a smart man.
You're a wise man.
You're bad.
You're busy, aren't you?
You're capable, but you're forgetting.
You're brave, aren't you?
You're hungry.
You're unorganized.
You're bad and disgusting.
You're an experiment.
You're right.
You're beautiful.
You're free.
You're a faggot.
You'll need help.
You're gonna need this.
It's good for you to go.
You're in the middle of the night.
You're hurting me.
You're not telling me.
You're impressive.
Now you're worthy.
You're in power.
You're incapacitated.
You're under influence.
You took my place.
You're not in any danger.
You're interested.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
You're something I'm tired of.
You're lucky I'm not late.
You're lucky.
You're lying to me.
You're mad at me. I can get to know you.
You're beautiful.
You're messing with Tom.
You're my neighbor.
You're not my friend.
You're not so young anymore.
You're not a miracle.
You're not a woman.
You're not dressed.
You're not gonna find me.
You won't find them.
You won't find us.
You're under her level.
You're at his level.
You're not ready yet, are you?
You're not so terrible.
You don't suggest we give Tom all the money, do you?
You're not so old, Tom.
You're not too old for her.
Now you can go.
You're crazy!
But you're smart.
You're our guests.
You don't have alcohol anymore.
You've got too much to do.
You're specific.
You're part of our team.
You're a pessimist.
You're poor.
You're predictable.
You're a tough city.
You're absolutely safe.
You're really nice.
You're an epithet.
You're so lucky.
You're kidding.
You're funny.
You're not cultural.
You're undercover!
I'm very attracted to you.
You're very dramatic.
You're very useful.
You're very passionate.
You're so negative.
You're a little uneducated.
You're kind of rude.
How different you are.
You're so talented.
You're stronger than Tom.
What a doll you're.
What a pig you are.
You need to help them.
You're kidding me.
You're scared.
You're the only one who can laugh at me.
You're the only one who met Tom.
You're the owner.
You're the prisoner.
You're the problem.
You're weak.
You're ruining your whole life.

You're distracted.
You're very smart.
You're very good with kids.
You're very lonely.
You're very direct.
You're so cute.
You're very cut.
You can wait here for freedom.
You're among your friends.
You're with Tom, right?
You misjudged her.
You're wrong, Tom.
You're lying, Tom.
The bears look strange to you.
Your future begins today.
Your hair smelled like spring.
You're getting too tight when you're getting hurt.
Your health is very important to me.
Your house is very beautiful.
It's a good memory.
They're coming back your month.
Your mom put your coke in the top guy.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
Your way is hard.
Your doctor must be written in English.
Your excuse is up-down right now.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
Your faith is precious.
Your role here is so important.
Your police are full of books.
There's yours.
Your sister's sleeping.
Your sons are quite handsome.
You're all here.
Your wishes are my order.
Your patent is broken.
That's what he said an hour ago.
You told me to call whenever.
You said we'd never catch her.
You said you'd help.
You said you'd write me a message last night, but you lied to me, obviously.
He saved my life.
You look disoriented.
I guess you already know the answer.
You look like you're studying.
There's an infection in the Bible.
I guess it's hard for you to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
Do you share his interest in the book?
You should ask for their help.
You should ask Tom.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Be careful not to go too far.
You should be happy for them.
You should be proud.
You should eat less red meat.
You need to eat more.
You should feel comfortable.
You need to sleep well.
You should give him some space.
You should give them some space.
You have to go and help him.
You should get up early.
You just need to talk to Tom.
You need to pay your rent in advance.
He found someone to talk to, you only got 65.
You should try it.
You should try this.
You should try writing respectfully.
You should have asked her first.
You need to wear a helmet while you drive the engine.
You should write a letter of appreciation to Tom.
You smell like shit.
You sound like it's easy for you.
You sound very sure.
You've made yourself a fool.
You're pretty.
You're really talking a lot.
You're talking too much about Boston.
You think she's weird just because she's not white.
The old man!
You two are very sweet together.
You used to be so funny.
You used to love Boston.
You're in the back.
They burned them.
You've experienced traffic, but you'll be fine.
Thank you very much.
It was of great benefit to us.
From the beginning, you're right.
You made white again!
You bought Mary something.
He beat me.
He beat them.
You've done so much.
You scared her.
She's over her head!
You've got a chip.
You're tired enough of care.
You got me wrong.
I promise.
Now you have, don't you?
You have to let me deliver a message to Tom.
You have to let me go home.
You have to work together.
Make Tom happy.
You jumped a button.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
You've been doing this for a long time.
You saw what I could do.
You were amazing.
He was in love with Tom, wasn't he?
He was lucky they survived the attack.
You're wrong.
It's not that you weren't right.
Tom was right.
He was driving fast.
It was great.
You haven't slept all night, have you?
He was very brave.
He wasn't right about the picture.
You'll do as I tell you.
You'll find your toys and books.
You won't need that.
You're not gonna make it.
You won't win.
You're kidding too much about him.
You wouldn't want to be late.
Yeah, I'm mad.
