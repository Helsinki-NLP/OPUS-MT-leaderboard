We can start living in a more friendly environment, we can become involved in nature’s chaos, and we can also be actors to reduce future suffering in some areas.
This is similar to the treatment of many cases, but if we do not have a temporary solution, we need to look for the cause of the problem, and we need to work on it.

The experiment Hershey and Chase suggested that DNA be a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or varnishes, to put their own DNA in a bacteria.

All are involved in society and are using transportation systems, and almost everyone is complaining about transportation systems.
In developing countries, it is rare to hear and have similar complaints about the quality of water or the fall of droughts.
Why did the transportation systems receive such complaints, why did they fail on the day? Did transport engineers have no capacity, or did something even more important happen?
The Traffic Train is the study of each driver’s movement and the traffic between two points and their interactions with one another.
Unfortunately, it is not possible for a hundred percent to guarantee driver’s behavior.
Fortunately, drivers run at reasonable speeds; thus, traffic jams have a precise frequency and can be represented in mathematics.
In order to better present the traffic stage, there is a relationship that is shown among the first three characteristics: (1) slowing down, (2) density, and (3) slowing down.
It can help you to plan, design, and operate road facilities.
Insects are the first flying creatures, and their ability to fly is what helps them to avoid enemies and that is their way of getting and eating as well as seeing pairs more easily.

The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and examine the structures and processes of the brain that have not yet been seen.
It gives us and many information and materials to build models of simulations that help us to understand the processes we think about.
Although the AI has a great knowledge of piping science, it has done and has a significant scientific computer branch, which is consistent with behavior, food and intelligence matching to a machine.
AI research involves making machines to perform tasks that require intelligent action.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, the ability to answer the customer’s questions and questions, until you know the passage, sound and face.
These things have become isolated areas, focusing on giving and solving problems in real life.
The AI system is now used by economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as many home computers and software applications of the video game.
