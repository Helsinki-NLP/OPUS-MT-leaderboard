28-year-old driver found dead in the San Francisco factory
This week at a supermarket, a 28-year-old boy was found dying, recently moved to San Francisco .
But the Upur brother says that he can't imagine anyone who would want to do anything about his brother, saying: "His life finally started to improve."
On the third day at the University of Westfield, a 28-year-old San Francisco resident, Franks Galicia, said the representative of the San Francisco Medical Expert Office.
The San Francisco police reported that his death was recognized as a fraud and is currently under investigation.
Upura's brother Luiss Galicia told the San Francisco radio station ABC KGO that Frank had previously worked on the bridge in Boston, but six months ago he believed in his dream in the San Francisco Sons & Daughters restaurant.
The representative of the restaurant "Sons & Daughters" reports that the news of her death shocked them and touched them.
"We are a small team working as a united family and he is very weak," said the representative.
During this difficult time, we thought we were together with Frank’s friends and family.
Luis Galicia reports that Franks at first was in the hostels, but in the last few years, life has finally improved.
"He picked up a new apartment and met a girl," Luis tells the KGO radio station.
Luis Galicia claims that he doesn't know who he's gonna want to do with his younger brother.
He was a good man with a wide heart.
"He always supported his family by preparing a delicious meal and by preparing lunch," said Luis Galicia
He never wanted to get involved in the conflict.
He was the brother who had adjusted his thinking.
"In view of all that has taken place in the world fast, he was like an unprocessed diamond that was very much dying every day," he said.
Anyone who has information about the event is invited to call the SFPD Information Phone 415-575-4444.
New doctor's strike: calls for new protests
The new doctors ask their trade unions to initiate protests in the debate on a new contract.
The British Medical Association (LMA) New Committee of Doctors (JAC) is preparing to request advice to support wider protests early in September.
The GOC believes that ministers have not been able to raise doubts about the contract.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by LMA.
58% of all the members participating in the vote voted against the contract.
In a letter published on Thursday evening on Twitter, a member of the JAC Council, Eleni Makkorta, said that the government continued to listen to this issue and therefore the offer of the contract was rejected.
She said, "In view of this, the proposal for a JAC vote has been completely rejected and decided to request new formal discussions to discuss the most important issues."
In response to the government's hearing, the JAC has officially requested the LMA Council today to authorise the development of new contracts that will take effect in September.
As a result of the conflict, young doctors have participated in six strikes, including the first time that NHS is reported to have stopped work.
Following a vote in which the terms of the agreement proposed by the BMA were rejected, the new LMA representative, Dr. Johans Malavana, decided to withdraw.
Before meeting with 54,000 young doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer is good and will be accepted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunts informed that the contract would be concluded with English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: Atttumto Alliance?
A sword that ended the crisis.
On Tuesday, the leaders of Russia and Turkey were asked to celebrate and declare an eight-month period of term and economic sanctions to the end of the war.
However, when Vladimir Putin spoke with the Turkish leader in the town of St. Petersburg, it became clear that these partnerships were more necessary for Ankara.
However, they both agreed.
Vladimir Putina’s smile looked at the meeting and did not cause angry emotions, even taking into account her apparent delay.
On the other hand, at least five times Tayjips Erdogan named Putin for his "good friend", a visit to the message.
I don't know how bad I am.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve until the pre-crisis level, but will become even stronger.
The next day a newspaper reported that Erdogan was going to make it as if nothing had happened.
I think his enthusiasm is causing negative feelings.
However, Putin’s violent anger shows that Russia’s leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was the destruction of the Russian plane on the Syrian border.
Then Moscow responded to the case.
Putin accused Ankar that he had entered a Danish mosque.
The change was even worse, considering that it came from a friend.
The restoration of true trust may be very difficult, even impossible.
Since November, Russia's public position has changed.
Over the course of several months, the government's controlled television spread aggressive accusations against Ankara.
The last ones seemed to be cruel Turks everywhere.
The most serious allegations were that the Erdogan family itself had benefited from illegal oil trade with the Syrian State controlled by the Islamic State.
He himself, of course, denied it.
However, St. Petersburg’s meeting was the main message that it was time to forget the past.
Finally, this meeting was only because Putin received President Erdogan's apology.
Russia could see it as its kind of victory.
The benefit of Ankara from the peace agreement is obvious.
First, Erdogan needs all the possible friends after an unsuccessful encounter last month, where he tried to find them.
Uncountable terrorist attacks have also affected her positions.
There are also economic reasons.
Russian sanctions have resulted in substantial losses, particularly a ban on chartering, which normally provides several million Russian tourists in Turkey’s districts each year.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Russian tourist operators and charter companies will also facilitate the recovery of regular flights.
They look forward to vacation in the Mediterranean season.
The national TV is already planning to reduce the prices of fruit and vegetables this week, as Turkey's imports will be re-imported.
As a local newspaper Vedemosti says, "Tourists to them, to us."
However, there were other political reasons for the visit from the Moscow side.
Ankara is excited to the West about, of course, a weak reaction to an attempt on the horizon.
All of us can also see the dissatisfaction with the long-term negotiations on the accession of the EU and Putin, which is well used in the situation that Turkey has withdrawn from the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly received additional points in Ankara's eyes, expressing support for its elected government after the trial.
Note that Moscow is well aware of this because it is itself deeply alarmed by the fear of the change in the regime.
The summit, which took place in this coastal town of the sea, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present how a analyst called it "sustained alliances", two countries that felt driven from the West, combined forces.
Despite public unity, however, there are still considerable differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main differences affect Syria, where Russia presents itself as a carrier of peace, but Russia and Turkey are actually supporting the opposing parties.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations, not wanting to reveal information, the two presidents at the press conference announced that they had not discussed this issue.
The President of Turkey had deliberately avoided the issue of non-compliance between the two countries, but President Putins wanted to emphasize it.
There is no clear consensus on how both countries could find common language in the Syrian question.
However, a few months later, a positive relationship and potential disaster were revealed when NATO member Turkey launched a Russian war machine, the situation has improved as both leaders at least started negotiations.
Scotland Royal Bank will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
The SKB will continue to play a role in support, as announced by the Executive Director of the Bank.
In addition to Scotland, SKB will no longer be available.
Ross Macevans tells the BBC channel in Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with bank ambitions at a global level.
It has rejected these ambitions, as the bank had almost collapsed almost eight years ago and needed financial assistance.
Until recently, experts in the labelling strategy have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The bank received millions of tickets from international sports sponsors starting with the Six Nations regime and ending with Vimbdona tennis champion Andy Mure.
However, it is now decided to draw up other national marks on the proposal.
Scottish Royal Banaka will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be started.
In England and Wales, all references to SKB, outside the main office and the official list of offices, will be replaced by the name NatWest.
The Ulster Bank has already been used in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Now there will also be less private financial brands, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Macevan was interviewed during the departure with customers and employees via Inverneschira.
He sent the BBC Scotland Channel: "SKB will become our investor brand and our employees will work with it, as we now become more than a brand bank."
In time, the bank became a global sign, and the NCBs became a global sign.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in their sector and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
The NCB has already announced that it will not continue to sponsor "Six Nations" and will engage in various brands in sponsoring sport.
"Have we had the right time to become a brand bank because we have already asked ourselves how to become a better bank to our customers?" said the Executive Director.
Three years ago, it would have been very Chinese if we announced that we would become a huge bank to our customers and develop these brands.
But thanks to hard work and focusing on customer needs rather than on our own needs, we have obviously made big changes.
We can revive these signs again, so I think now is the real time.
Franckys Detori won the 3000th victory, gaining the first place in New York with the Irish Pred selection
Detors withdraws the champagne by putting his 3000-year-old victory to the end of the first race in New York City.
On Friday, French poet Detori defeated his 3,000th victory in British history, gaining the first place in New York City.
He did this by winning a second victory in these events that took place in his hometown, to deal with Pred selection, which was trained by John Gosdens.
At 45 years of age, Italy is a six-year-old bird that has achieved such results in a horse racing race.
He has joined Seram Gordon Richard, Doug Smith, Lester Pigot, Pitt Eder, and William Carson.
The three-time champion of Detori, who had previously won the Ghyyar race, said, "It's something special."
I'm very upset because my family is here.
I am very happy that this happened in New York, because I have lived here for 30 years.
This is no big deal, it's not the Royal Askota, but it's a regular Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I would feel relieved and very grateful.
After victory Detori and Pred selection are expected with wings and heads.
Two jockeys have achieved this record in encounters with obstacles - champion Richard Johnson and the final 20-year-old champion Sers Antony Mackoys, who installed several records in his career, winning more than 4300 winnings.
Lester Pigots, the nine-year-old winner, won 4493 wins during the race.
France is one of today’s best harvests, and there is no wonder that he has achieved what only rarely can.
He's strong and strong, but his tactics feel different from other jokes.
He is a fantastic facet representative, his enthusiasm and his years of warfare attract fans to this kind of sport.
A few weeks ago, I told Frank that he had already won 6000 victories if he did not participate only in the weekend and the big ones.
But speaking seriously, it is a real joy that France has been winning the United Kingdom talks regularly for 30 years.
He is a life - giving person who enjoys the company of British poets, and he is an excellent hunter.
Frank Detori noted this achievement with his company's brand - a flying decision.
From the end of the wind speed to the flying decision, France Detori has been on British horses for 20 years.
This has been the full way of life.
He has won an unprecedented number of links, including the famous 1996 "Great Seventh" in Askot, and has also survived the plane crash and the disqualification of the use of the equipment.
Three years ago it was difficult for him to return after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated his strength of character by drawing those who doubted him back in his best form.
And he could have participated in the conversation for a while - Detor has said earlier that it would be good to continue the conversation for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putins resigns the head of administration Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putins unexpectedly dismissed Sergey Ivanov, head of administration.
Ivanov has been in the area of Putina’s closest people for many years.
Today, 63 years old policy has been appointed as a special representative on matters of nature and transport.
The Kremlin Communication states that Putin "has decided to release Ivanov from the duties of the director of the work of the Russian Presidency", without giving rise to reasons.
Anton Vaino, who has been a guest since 2012.
44-year-old Vaino has won a diploma.
Vaino was born in 1972 in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked in the Tokyo Embassy.
According to the Kremlin Home Page (in Russian), he later led the President's Protocol and the administration of government staff.
After his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your faith."
I believe that the main work of the administration is to support your work at the Office of the President of the State, by developing laws and controlling the implementation of your decisions.
On Friday, he told a Russian radio company that Ivanov himself wanted to leave his office and recommended Vaino as his replacement.
Do smiles confirm it?
This step has confused Moscow.
Sergey Ivanovs is a senior and close member of Vladimir Putina and, like Putin, has worked in the Security Service of the Council at his own time.
He was one of the most influential men in Russia.
At the national television show, two men announced that Ivanovs would withdraw from his office after the same initiative.
But despite the camera-oriented smiles, which are rarely confirmed by such an explanation, especially before Parliament's elections.
Is this the result of a struggle for power?
Nobody knows that.
The official claim, however, that the man who was considered a potential president immediately wanted to become the leader of the Russian environmental policy is considered to be a great challenge.
Ivanovs says to Putin: "It is the fact that at the beginning of 2012, I ask you to trust this complicated office, you might even say, a problemal office, four years.
It seems that I have been working in this office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov's office took place in December 2011.
Previously, he was a prime minister and a defense minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and former VDK State Security Service, as well as Putin.
At the end of 1990, Putin led the Federal Security Service, which is the successor of the VDK, took over Ivanov's office.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
At the end of Putin's second term, Ivanovs was considered a potential candidate for the position of the Russian President, as Putin's conversion to the third term would be anti-constitutional.
But again as president, another close companion of Putina's society - Dmitrys Medvedevs.
Putin became prime minister, and after three and a half years he returned to the office of the President.
A small fish show in a garden in Banfas
A man from Banfa asks for help to explain the conditions of the species that have appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Beins thinks that 75 fish could be silhouettes that have left with waterproof .
Mr. Beina, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, published a video of fish on the Periscope website, hoping that someone would know how these five inches of large fish had moved into his garden.
The cross-section of the wine industry: the oil is now connected to Faifu.
At present, 1.35 billion projects worth of tickets are planned to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have joined the northern part of the Quinisferia cross-section and transit, which means that the bridge is now connected to Faifu.
The first of the four connecting parts is completed, which means that the construction of the bridge is nearing its completion.
The construction of the Faifas bridge is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 support cables.
Currently, 1.35 billion projects are planned to be completed in May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brauns had returned to the construction site today and was one of the first to hit the bridge.
He said, "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the port of Quinsferia."
In this project we see an impossible engineering solution, where only more than 30,000 tons of cement and steel have been used in the construction of this part.
Despite the heavy weight and size of the needle, the combination of the needle and the transducer is an extremely delicate process in which extensive accuracy is required.
In general, more than 79% of the steel layer has already been built and the last phase that will be included in the bridge with Rosita today means that all parts of the steel are ready for inclusion.
The fourth pillar project director, Michael Martins, says: "The first connection is a very important point in the construction of any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first link demonstrates the construction of the highest class of engineering.
After the final stage is set up and its connection to the North Tower support, we are left with the northern route with the ground part or the transducer.
This was done by cutting off a part of the north-east crossing of 700 millimetres south.
It was a very delicate operation at the same time.
It's funny because the transducer is 222 metres long, weighing about 6000 tons and had to carry about 3 % silence.
Delicate because the two directions with which the team worked were only a few millimetres.
Well, luckily, everything worked out well.
Simona Bailsa gets gold for women in winter.
Forget it.
Forget the silence.
Simon Balsu didn't mind it.
Dynamic fluids.
Without effort, the wines are served on the balconies.
It is not possible to move on the floor.
It's completely harmless.
And finally the Olympic champion.
On the fourth day, 19 - year - old U.S. winewinner drew a gold medal, fully demonstrating the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympics.
Her total number of points 62,198 were the main court over the fate of the copper medal winner and her team member Alijas Raismanes and the result of the Russian athlete Alijas Mustafin.
On Thursday, US sportsman Simona Bailsa made a winch for the individual winner of the Baltic sport in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Riodezáneiro, Brazil.
Ballsa became a fourth American on a series that won a multi-threaded champion title and the fifth best winemaker, at least to strengthen the reputation as the best winemaker of his generation and possibly the best winemaker in history.
When the final outcome was announced, he was thrown into the lions ’ pit, for the long way to the end was at hand.
This achievement brings them closer to the inexhaustible athletes such as Michael Felps, who played his sport at another level.
In the last three years, Ballsa has dominated his sport by acquiring 15 medals in world champions, including 10 gold medals, performing such excellent, precise and ambitious combinations that in 1984 the Olympic champion Mary Lu Retone called him "the best Winner she's ever seen".
In Brazil he was facing the final test, where he had to deal with the hopes that were placed on him, not with other athletes.
She would be excited if she returned to her home in Spring, Texas, without gold medals.
U.S. athletes Simona Bailsa (on the left) and Alija Raismane were interviewed after the respective winner of the winner of the gold and silver medal in the individual series of final women in the summer of 2016 in the Olympics in Riodezáneiro, Brazil, which took place on Thursday.
The first gold medal was won on Tuesday by special election coordinator Martha Karolji.
Although Balsa claims that in her long journey to the glory halls there has been no such thing, it is not true.
Part of her initiative was free movement, including her special acrobatic transition, to introduce Latin music, which would be great for the street near the Rio Olympics.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl who adopted her parents when she was still a child and who discovered the trainer’s mother, Amy Burmese, on a trip to the sports hospital where the Burmese train took place has now become the force to be calculated.
She has not lost much of the competition since the summer of 2013 and the winning series can continue as long as she wants it.
Although there were few changes in management during the two rotations of Mustafin, it was only insulin.
The balance of weight and free movement - part of the competition where the ball will defend its champion title is still ahead.
She appeared in front of the result 15,433 on the balcony and strengthened the management with the result in 15.933 free movement
Raismane looked at her gently as she looked forward to the results that were only formality and was thrilled to see the dream she had ever recorded in her notes book filled with joy.
The result of Raismane was a small attraction for four years old when he shared his third place with Mustafin, but he lost his battle for bronze medals.
This time, 22 years ago, the captain of the team, who the Americans call "old man", was appointed as a trusted leader.
After the delivery, she was free to leave for her doubts about her return.
By the time she was 19 years old, the official Twitter entry r, which she had published this week, is now completely different.
Six-year-old Mahajs Brown's "scarutum" survived in Philadelphia.
The police report that a six-year-old boy believed to be in Philadelphia, stating that it was already the second six-year-old who was in Philadelphia this week.
The parents of the CBS Philadelphia News channel confirmed that this is Mahajs Brown.
The parents said that Brown was beaten several times, including in the circus, in the leg, in the arm, and in the stomach, but he was still in bed when he was taken to the hospital.
His mother, Delores Mendezza, told TV: "His little body was just locked up."
I can't believe it.
She has been placed in a hospital in critical condition and has already undergone several operations.
The family informs him that he will definitely be taken back.
He had to start attending the first class of the local elementary school.
Brown is one of the four people who met in part of the city of Germany.
Three men were also arrested: two 29 - year - olds and one 32 - year - olds.
CBS Filadelfia reports that one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, but the other two injured are stable.
The channel reports that the child was found at the front seat in a critical situation of nearly 29 years.
The other two injured did not find the car and the police were wondering if any of them had been shot.
The investigator informed the channel CBS Filadelfia that several fishermen were most likely involved in the crash.
In the event site, weapons are found with a pattern of weapons belonging to a variety of weapons.
It looks like it's been a long time ago.
On both sides of the entrances of the corridors are found shells.
"So far it seems that there have been a number of armed soldiers who were actively involved in the riot," said Captain Antony Ginaldi of Philadelphia Police.
The damage has also been done to several homes and cars.
No one has yet been arrested and the police are reported to check the records of surveillance cameras.
The next day, during a raid, a six - year - old girl was hit by a hole in her house in the front of Westouklein.
She's getting low, but the police are still looking for the enemy.
Why do we need Simon, Gaby, and Laurie?
I called it the Year's Olympic Olympic Games because of several reasons.
First, I've been on all the Olympic Games since 1984, and the US team has never been so good.
Second, there are three lightweights, Simona Bailsa, Gabia Duglasa and Laurie Hernandeza, which have a lot of new origins.
People may be pleased that this team also includes Alija Raismane, who is a Hebrew and Medison Kocian, who is a Catholic.
Finally, this team really represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
In the last four years, the best winemaker has been an American of African origin.
In the past year, Simon and Gaby took places 1 and 2.
These are impressive results.
In the past Olympics, Gabia Duglas became an Olympic champion, and America was able to swim.
The world has now seen incredible wineries performed by the three-fold world champions Simon Bails, Douglas and Laurie Hernández, making unexpected but brutal wineries.
On the fourth day Simona became a fourth American in order to obtain gold medals for individual women.
Her teammate, Alija Raismane, acquired silver medals.
We have seen the best that this sport can do, but the situation in the other country is completely different in winter hours.
Simona, Gabia, and Laurie entered the Olympics as well as Alicia and Madison.
She's the "Olympical Jew," because the next Olympic Winning team will have only four athletes, and this is the trainer Marta Karola's last year's trainer's job.
Winning is really a great sport. Winningers are primarily training private luxury clubs, and they are cared for by parents who pay for trains, rooms, trips, training courses, hotels (trainers, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of this lighthouse club is located in urban areas that can allow this sport.
These club athletes call all their training, and this is a expensive and long investment for easy families.
Emija Burwman - Simonas Bailsa trainer and Maggie Hainija - Lauriia Hernandez trainer have trained their athletes since both girls began working with a light switch.
We need to provide young girls with more opportunities to train Simona, Gabia and Laurie.
I built my LAG 20 years ago.
My organisation is located in Harlem, and we offer more than 15 000 young people in the city (mainly black and Spanish origins) winery training at no cost or at a low price. We have also trained national and international campaigns.
In September we will open a branch in Detroit (in my hometown) to provide local young people with the opportunity to get to know this wonderful sport.
The rapid development of power, position and body coordination also led to hard work, discipline and achievement.
This combination ensures long life with good health and success at school and at work.
This team has raised thousands of young girls to work in a light room and that is fantastic.
Working with this kind of sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thanks to Simona, Alija, Gabia and Medison for the wonderful "Strengthening of Girls" demonstration, the acquisition of the Olympics of gold medals and the motivation for countless new, diverse girls to become healthy, strong and successful new women.
Following the rejection of the proposal by Jeremy Hanna, the young doctors plan to make more strands.
Ministers wanted to end the dispute by reaching agreement on changes in the agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association, but they rejected 58 per cent of the 37,000 new doctors who participated in the vote.
In July, Hants announced plans to conclude a contract indicating that NHS is in a unstable state and that further delays only harm workers and patients.
The first doctors have already signed a new contract, which provides for changes in working conditions for night shifts and weekends in order to improve working conditions during hours of work.
Last night, BMA's new doctor, Dr. Elena Makourta, said that young doctors still have serious concerns about the contract offered, in particular that it will deepen the labour crisis and that it does not provide for all doctors equal conditions.
Eight weeks have passed before the first new medical team will sign a new contract, so progress must be made, as the time is short.
The BMA's efforts to address the problem through negotiations have been overcome by the government's unwillingness to participate and sometimes by full silence.
This happened despite the fact that, last month, Jeremy Hunts said that his door was always open.
Jeremy Hant must act immediately, stop unemployment and cooperate with new doctors.
If he does not, young doctors are ready for new protests.
At the end of the last strike, more than 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were left, while nurses and consultants were trying to replace doctors who had given in the package.
The Ministers hoped to end the dispute by reaching agreement on changes to the Agreement with the representatives of the British Medical Association.
BMA wishes to increase the rate of work per week for 54 000 new doctors concerned with new contracts.
NHS Executive Director Daniel Mortimers called on new doctors not to give strike.
Mr Mortimer explains that the strike does not solve anything, but only increases pressure on the employees who are under stress and causes stress and anxiety to patients, caregivers and their families.
In the last two months, we have talked to the new Committee of Doctors, and together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, we have responded positively to their questions about reminders and rapporteurs.
Workers hope that active cooperation on other important issues, such as job creation, flexible training, additional training for those who return after a break of career, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, student dropouts and gender pay in medicine - shows that employers, the UK and the Ministry of Health want to implement agreements concluded with BME in November, February and May.
Medicinal product subject to 2 injections a day may reduce the risk of heart attack.
Thousands of patients who have had a heart attack may be treated with 2 injections a day, as official representatives recommend that they use more people and longer periods of time.
Ticagrelor contraindication reduces the risk of repeated heart disease in people with heart disease.
This medicine is already prescribed for use 12 months after heart beat, reducing repeated heart rate.
The NHS representative recommended that this medicinal product be used for 4 years after heart attacks in order to further reduce the risk of heart disease in people with heart and blood problems.
However, the NHS now recommends that this product be used for 4 years after heart attacks to further reduce the risk of heart and blood vessels.
About 140 000 people live in England each year, and a quarter of them experience repeated heart attacks or stroke.
Cardiac and insults cause the swelling of fat in the heart of the chest by forming convulsions.
If a rash occurs, it can cause a thrombosis by blocking the blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack.
However, if the thrombosis is separated from the bloodstream, it can develop into the bloodstream and block the blood from access to the brains by causing the infarction.
People who have had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of heart attack.
Ticagrelor, produced by AstraZeneca, a British company and marketed by Brilique, reduces the risk of thrombosis.
The new NICE guidelines published today are recommended for humans to use 90 mg Ticagrel for 12 months and for another 3 years after 60 mg twice daily with aspirin.
NICE Director of Health Technology Professor Kerola Longson explains: "Despite the availability of medicines to prevent heart attacks, more than a quarter of people who have had heart attacks experience another heart attack or stroke that often has serious consequences."
Balls from repeated heart rate can have a negative impact on the quality of life.
The evidence shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of repeated heart rate and heart rate in humans who have already experienced it.
By temporarily administering treatment with Ticagrelor, we are happy that we can extend treatment opportunities to thousands of people who are thus beneficiaries.
In view of the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding when taking this medicine for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend that they be used longer than this deadline.
The culture of policy correction promotes corruption in Muslim communities during the election
According to the management report, the former mayor of the city of Tauerhamlet, Lutfurs Rahman, was dismissed from office in connection with corruption.
The government report reveals that as a result of the culture of the policy correction, eyes are focused on widespread corruption in the Muslim communities.
Former government minister Sers Erik Pikls criticizes police, electoral observers and city councils that they ignore the signs of error in the election process because "they are afraid of killing ethnic and religious interests."
The former Community Secretary, who has now become the leader of the anti-corruption organisation, says that the arrest of voters for religious reasons is so widespread that the police should be allowed to put up a job at the electoral stations to protect the petitioners.
He also recommends that voters should be shown a document proving persons when they vote in order to prove their true identity.
Only name and address should be given to the voters today.
He even recommends marking the purchases of voting voters with a special tin to prevent double voting.
The rapporteurs should also provide greater protection, said Sir Erik.
He believes that the press should have greater access to the Council's documents and decisions adopted by the informal committees and working groups.
He says, "The goal is not only to prevent fraud from choosing, but also to protect the local government from the wider corruption and corruption culture that goes hand in hand with it."
The report was sent to Daungstrita after scandal in connection with the elections in the city of Tauerhamlet.
Last year, the Court of Justice decided to remove the city level of Lutfur Rahman from the city due to corruption and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman "skinically confused" his Muslim community's religious view and heard his criticisms, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman has led his election campaign with the belief that the religious duty of faithful Muslims is to vote for him."
About 300 votes were either false or doubtful, for one person had voted several times.
Likewise, Sers Eriks points out that there are signs of fraud throughout the country.
He pointed out that it was particularly disturbing to lie in voting by post where the elderly members of Muslim communities forced others to vote for their own candidates.
Sers Eriks recommended a number of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of a document identifying persons to clarify the identity of the person.
His report writes: "The evidence shows that vulnerable ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, are forced to vote for the elderly candidates of the Community, particularly in the Bangladesh and Pakistan communities."
"There is concern that the regional institutions will not pay attention to these problems due to political corrections, as they could eliminate ethnic and religious interests."
Sers Eriks made 50 recommendations on how to improve the electoral system, which also prohibits political activists from working with votes taken by mail to prevent "voting".
The report also calls for a more careful registration check to prevent the use of electoral lists to mislead immigration and aid.
Consider the possibility before voting to ask voters to present a document of proof of persons.
Mark the purchases of voting voters with a special tin to prevent double voting.
Systematic checks on the nationality of persons to ensure that a person is entitled to vote.
Set the three-year limit for requests for automatic voting by mail.
To prevent political campaign participants and activists from working by mail and election to vote by mail.
To provide the police with the power to guard against electoral attacks.
Amendments to the Law to facilitate the recruitment of persons under the 1983 Human Rights Act.
Prevent taking a photo of the selection in the clipboard.
Set the requirements for selecting only English (except in Velsa).
To strengthen training to ensure that the electors go to the polling hours at the same time.
Sers Erik's ass criticizes the Metropolis police, saying inexplicably that the Tauerhamlet case has not been brought to trial .
He says: "The election of the court has only been disqualified by Luftur Rahman and his representatives for actions related to corruption and fraud."
He was convinced that he was guilty of a standard of criminal law based on unbiased evidence.
He also criticised the lack of effectiveness in the registration of electors in the city council.
Sers Eriks points out: "The decision of the Court last year is a call for fear.
Our land is known as the family of Parliament, but the distribution of corruption and the isolation of the institutions in the worrying and hidden elections does not endanger this good reputation.

The CBC Olympic player apologizes for his comment that the Chinese player's "will end up like a dog".
Barona Macdonalda's 14-year-old analysis of the Ai Yanhas terminal in the fourth place 4x200 m free-style staphet for women, called the connection wind in CBC viewers.
The Canadian Canal CBC was forced to apologize because one of its commentators commented that a 14-year-old Chinese athlete was "fleet from the competitions that he had just died" and "would end up like a dog".
Commentary Bairons McDonalds thought his microphone was off when 4x200 m free-style staffing women finally showed their personal views.
McDonald, who was included in the CBC Commander's command to give comments on life, said: "The little forty-year-old from China can't stay with her."
"After she got in, she ran away from the competitions that she just died and ended up like a dog."
Thank you very much.

The viewers throughout Canada responded immediately to the Internet because they were shocked to hear such tone and expressions.
Emets Makfarlains wrote on Twitter: "Or the direct CBC commenter just said that 14-year-old hunters from China "were ending up as a dog"???.

The criticism of the Baron MacDonald was quickly adopted, as many asked for clarifications.
Twitter users were unable to comment on the unfavourable comments of Bairona Macdonalda.
Twitter user Sarah Paradi wrote: "Oh, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and Tevis, we all listen as you do. #opposite.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Rasel, who was then directly led by the CBC, apologized for the comments made by McDonald, saying: "We regret that the comment on the result of the piloting was re-examined in the summer."
It was a failed choice of words, and we are very sorry that it happened.

CBC then filed an apology for more than 90 Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments.
The channel also quickly published apology and notification.
We are very sorry that such comments were made and that they went directly into the room.
Yesterday we responded immediately and apologized to all viewers and followers of social media.
For the sake of clarity, it should be said that the comments made by Bairona were made about the delivery of the petitioner, not addressed to him personally.
However, in any case, they were not professional and failed to choose words and Baron was very sorry.

In the CBC Olympics, he said, "I would like to use the time and apologize for the comment I made yesterday after women's free style contests."
I was talking about the donor's gift, not his personal.
I'm sorry to say that I wasn't thinking of showing up, and I'm really sorry that happened.
Primark bought a woman in shock, who suddenly appeared in the middle of the subsoil store.
The couple felt awkward when the woman began to dress in order to get into the middle of the shop.
As the situation deteriorated further, she approached them to make sure that they were present and then beaten, to put the biscuits back in the shop.
She continued to search for clothes at the center of the trade center of Volkestein Bouverie Place and attended four more biscuits.
Primark is a manufacturer at Bouverie Place Trade Center in Folkeston, a place where this woman caught the shoe and then left it in the back.
At the same time, Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children, reported that an unknown woman, after holding a bottle of clothing, had to sell her clothes and shoes, not to buy anything.
She points out that humans were unable to do what they could in their own eyes.
In the middle of the store, she took off the floor of the floor, grabbed her pockets and biscuits, and then took them to her place.
She did not even try to find a more discrepancy place where she could measure it, but she simply kept it in place.
All saw how her grandmother was looking at her kisses and apparently did not like them, for she simply threw them back in the hair.
She weighed three more biscuits, until she decided that she would not like any of them and let the trade go.
They did not think that they would hold back from seeing or thinking about the person who would buy the clothes they were wearing.
Young Davidson (33 years old) from Kent, says: "The idea is that someone buys clothes that have been caught by another person and that have not been removed afterwards."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson says: "I accept that after her departure, business workers have removed these clothes from the shops - which is also acceptable."
I can't imagine that I could buy a new shoe and know that other women have taken it and then they have not been removed.
The representative of Primark indicated that Primark was known for the incident that took place on Tuesday, 9 August.
Certain clothes have been removed from the shop’s hair.
How to protect yourself from firearms using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
In order to explain how to protect ourselves from the firefighters nearby, we spoke with Krav Maga Mayor from Ronu Mirraki, New York.
Regardless of whether you're tired from front or back, this video shows how to protect yourself and get over the attacker.
Mizraki indicates that if an attacker is caught from the rear of the wall, first of all, it must be forced to see the attacker clearly and avoid such a trajectory.
Then the weapon shall be joined between its forward and its rear, and shall strike the enemy in the face with his free will.
Then follow a line through the circle, and as the attacker gets hurt, he has to take his weapon, walk on the edge of the gun and walk away, turning the gun against him.
If an attacker is coming from the front, the situation is similar - it must be avoided from this trajectory, it must be armed and it must be released so that evil can not be eliminated.
At the same time, pressure on the weapon must be placed on the enemy by the chest and finally withdraw his weapon and withdraw from it.
Did you hear the trouble?
Look at the video to see exactly how Mirraki does it.
Remember, though, if you are not a master of Krav Maga, it is safer to give your money to the savior.
The family of water is exhumed by the Saltash Kornvola social home and is placed on the street.
The water family is expelled from the neighborhood for the terror of its neighbours, causing damage to the social home to 50,000 cucumbers.
Tanja Skeldon and her partner, Shawn Trebilkoks, were expelled from the property in Saltaša Kornvola, as they received several complaints.
When they were forced to leave their property, shocked household officials found that the property was completely demobilized.
The walls and walls were torn down, the walls were covered with debris, and the walls were covered with graphite.
The family is now separated from property and is more likely to live in a private property.
Donna Makevoja, managing director of the Cornwall Home Service, said that there is concern that homes will not be restored.
She relates that people who lived here were extremely difficult and felt that they could not live without it.
In this case, several factors need to be assessed, as there will be no good reputation for this property in Kornvol.
This family is famous and their name is well - known.
There were three children who regularly remained in possession, and the police said that their terror was expressed as violence, outlawed on the streets with baseball bats, kidnapping of local people, drug use, drug trafficking, and fraud and restlessness.
In June, 47 years old Skeledon, whose name was owned, was sentenced to an antisocial offence.
Several demolition houses have found waste.
There are also a number of degrees in the house where drug trafficking is possible.
The families say they've walked on the street regularly and there's always a called police.
The Kornvola Home Service freed them from the burden of property when they had been given 11 weeks to be released from the house voluntarily.
The missing neighbors were very happy about leaving because their lives had been absolute.
One said, "They didn't care about other people."
We lived with them for almost 20 years, which has always been a tragedy.
I can't believe how often we've seen the police here.
We couldn't keep going.
We did it because here was so close - we didn't get to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be wonderful here.
Adam Fitzpatik, who is head of the protection services of the Cornvol Home Service, said that the family did not cooperate with the local security authorities.
The family lived here for 20 years and here regularly called the police.
In the growing garden of the house, various old and unused items were found.
He also said, "I'm very sorry that the prosecutors did not show any responsibility for their conduct, because leaving the house is always the last step of the Cornvola Home Service."
This was a very difficult case because their behavior was extreme and their neighbors were very strict in controlling their behavior.
I appreciated the work that all of my team, Devona and Cornvola police and community members, who were brave and cooperated with us by providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will ease the lives of our neighbours and show that antisocial behaviour is unacceptable.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived here for different periods of time, but all were about 20 years old.
Unclean matrices left on the floor in one of the rooms after the drying.
Service personnel will now have to clean up the waste head left at home.
In 2014, the police took over the house and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, weights, assets and 1700 pounds in clear cash.
Skeldone is only recognised as a harmful substance in the storage of drug class B for the purpose of distributing it.
She said that money was intended for her son, Lí Sheldon, who was injured in a car accident in 2013.
After the settlement, it became known that they are currently renting a private property in Plimut.
On many of the walls of the house were marked with graphs.
The police have sent that they will continue to appoint officers who violate their rental contracts.
The representative of Devon and Kornvola Police, Angela Krova, points out that this exclusion is an unambiguous warning to other prisoners who continue to violate the rules.
She also said, "This is a warning to those who think they can do whatever they want and there will be no consequences for them."
Devona and Cronvola police are not acceptable criminal and antisocial behaviour, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect the local communities.
The willingness to spend can give impetus to the economy.

"We are not talking about a religious symbol ban in the plaza, but about an extraordinary suit of clothing that is related to confidence in the terrorist movements that war against us," explained the head of municipal municipal services, Thierry Miglus.
He added that the bourgeois puddles in the Canny Plains have not been seen since 28 July, when the best members of the Central Party, the Republicans, signed this order and it came into force.

The "Cuban" festival began in Lucavsala.
On Thursday, 11 August, the evening in Lucavsala was given a start for one of the last festivals of this summer - there will be "Cubana" until Sunday night.
On the first night, groups such as Enter Shikari from Britain were expected, but the program did not show up, American banks "NOFX", DJ Maxim from the "The Prodigy" group and others.
Also in the next days of the festival program there are respectful words - "Guano Apes" and "Garbage", pancroke legend "Ramones" founder Markijs Ramones with "Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg", "Brutto&Lyapis" with the Baltic Pancroke leaders in the front of Sergei Mihaloku, a popular Georgian actor and singer Vahtangs Kikabidze, Ukrainians "Vopli Vidoplyasova" and a variety of others, but the full event program can be viewed here.
This is the second year when the "Kubana" festival takes place in Latvia.
After this serious financial failure and serious losses, but it did not stop the drivers from re-examination - they added the name to the mark, also included a group of Latvians (on Friday evening 19:15 on the "All Day Long" flag) and reported that the festival now became "closed and gained local colors with the Riga symbols such as their pants and cats".
Whether these efforts will be justified, it is still too late to judge because the festival was only indistinct, but, as the first night of the "Delfi Excise", at least the great efforts of the people in the past were not made and the number of visitors were similar.
The British Railway Corps team has twice a good Olympic record and has won the press.

President, who remained in the dream: Gustava Zemgal - 145.
Friday, 12 August, about 145 years after the birth of the second president of Latvia, Gustav Zemgal.
The Zemgals announced the state of Latvia, but failed to do so, is still well described by the first president of Latvia, Jan Chakste, and the last president of the former period in the dream of Karilla Ulmana.
None of our civil servants have so far defended democracy and justice as Zemgal, written ten years ago by Arnold Auzinsch in his book for Gustav Zemgal.
In the interview with the "Delfi" portal, Ausunš points out that Zemgal is one of the rare high-ranking politicians who have had a sense of humor.
The rest are strong, always very right.
He taught it not to be, it could be the same today as Raimonds Vijni.
"He was the one who was close to the people," says Auzion.
Today’s politicians know bad stories, they refer to Karl Ulmani as a good leader, but rarely does anyone know how bad he was.
The only person on the board who was not a thief was General Balodis.
Even if he was mild - tempered and lowly in heart, he was, of course, historical.
"The earthquake with its sense of humor and democracy leaves exactly the opposite effect," Auzinš says.
Professor of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia, Aivars Stranga, in consultation with "Delfi", agrees with Ausina's assessment of Zemgal as a peaceful and respected national hero.
He also notes that Zemgals has given due respect to minorities, regularly calling on the Jewish representatives to take the lead.
"At that time it was not an act of aggression, after the Zemgal Presidency Alberts Kviess took this tradition," the historian says.
He was a deaf and deaf person who had long come to talk to be the president.
He didn't say it himself, just the glory of the Nealka.
He was also quite critical of himself because he did not know French but felt that the President must understand it.
"During the presidency, the basis for the French language was both taught," explains Stranga.
The ground did not allow him to be contacted again, and he did not like it very much.
In all things, he is a very valuable person in the history of Latvia, already in the capital before the arrival of the President - he was very asked by the notary.
Zemgal also led the famous Zemgal Kasai Suvorova 3 street where a treasurer and treasurer company was found, in which the practical government discussed the fate of Latvia.
He was always progressive.
There was no great Ulman treasurer, but he was not opposed in public either.
"In private talks, both times, it has been said that Ulman's actions do not empathize him," says Stranga.
He lived a peaceful life without any suspicion of lawlessness or corruption.
How is Zemgal remembered today?
I'm sorry, but for most of him, he's only associated with some part of Riga.
He was an absolute democracy, considered central.
"There were no major disturbances during her time, i.e., he could associate with the real stable presidency," Strang said.
During the Presidency of Gustava Zemgal, from 1927 to 1930, Latvia's visit to Sweden, which at the same time directly meant full recognition in the neighbouring country and inclusion in the North European democratic nation.
On 28 May 1929 Zemgal visited the country in Stockholm.
The visit of King Gustav V of Sweden to Latvia took place on 29 June 1929.
The second president of Latvia was born in 1871, but he died forever in January 1939.
Simple ways to help your child end up with a shower.
I often come face - to - face with the fact that the child’s breath, the expression of shame, is viewed by the parents as something wrong and abnormal.
When the child openly expresses his breath - we don't know how to react, "Econet" indicates psychologically Jekaterina Kesa.
The specialist is encouraging a small debate on these natural and human emotions - the emotions and emotions that each of us has on a daily basis.
Aggression - it is already a physical activity that is addressed to other people, and it usually appears when we feel tired.
When we grow up, we are excited, and we usually know what is happening to us and how to end it.
We can say, push, hide, keep ourselves, tell our friends or other neighbors, we can smell the couch, smell the cigarettes (it's not the best way to breathe the shower!), go into the shower, go into the kitchen with a ball on the table and do other things that we don't usually do.
We do not oppose our aggression against others because we know different ways to end up with these emotions.
Children do not understand what is happening to them, how to name them, and how to live with them.
They can say, "Ei prom!", you're dumb, "Mother, "I don't care about you," "I'm not with you," and very rarely, when I can say, "I'm on your breath."
Children live in a natural sense, they are completely right here, this time, they are spontaneous and really express their feelings, and often they are in different emotions.
It is very important that parents do not prevent their children from expressing their feelings, including enthusiasm, not being critical of them, but rather, directly, helping the child.
Do the relationships need to be maintained?
The last working day in which everything didn't happen as you wanted, or just bad breath - there's so many reasons why you would want to be late, day or even longer "close" from all over the world.
Is it possible to have relationships and little trouble at the same time?
Does this mean, though, that each of the partners is going their own way?
In his opinion, the King was involved in various ages.
Janis (23) is short and nuclear: "In my view, if you need to keep your relationship, then you are not with the real person."
As long as Eduards (30) has discovered a scheme that may be helpful.
If you feel that the partner starts to get you nervous about every smaller factor, then definitely - it is a real time to study other fields of rain to see if you are missing, or especially about them, or even not wanting to see them again.
So the answer is - yes, maintenance can help save time and understand how important it is to you on the other side.
Kaspars (29) reveals his theory.
In my opinion, relations should be kept separate from the other day, because if you spend time with a person 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then the conflict is inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that each of the other’s symptoms are present, and this starts to get on the nerves.
People start covering each other, especially if there is no more to talk about, just about what you've done every day.
My personal experience is in this regard, so I have not been in the relationship for more than a few months.
If you ever think that others or others are better - then why is this woman with whom you are together, who might think that you are not good enough and that behind the mountains there are paradise fields?
Thinking is already a small burden.
If not, then not.
"I am, so I'm not going to say a few things about those who don't." said Edmunds (46).
Karim (33) is a completely contradictory opinion.
I think everyone needs a moment's rest.
You can't see every dream all the time, from morning till evening, looking at each other and laughing at love.
Attopis!
There are so many things - friends, jobs, ballet.
It's all your time.
Of course, even a close friend or a wife, but if both of them are to maintain a balance between family life and the rest of the world, they can live up to their marriage vow.
That's it and that's it.
Martíns (27) says: "It is difficult to say - whether or not, whether or not, whether or not to take this step, but one is clear - for the proposer there is nothing in the relationship to the end, something missing."
If this question arises, it should be calculated that there will be a change in the near future - to the good or to the bad side, it depends on itself.
I think as long as you're new and late as you're so tired, you need some time, but when everything's going to be serious and relationships go completely different, then there can't be no talking about rest.
But you decide to take all eternity together!
"If you can't stop each other now and once you need a break, then what will be when you'll be retired who comment, how exciting some of them are or argue about what the garden needs to be better prepared in the day," explains Kristap (19).
All the words of the Lord have been changed.
With its sensitive and sensitive personality, Rozentals first stimulated the interest of Latvian peoples in amazing arts.
"In this sense, he was the first love of the Latvian people, which will remain forever," wrote Roman Suta, the late Latvian poet Jani Rozental.
Also, in 2016, in discovering a wide retrospective exhibition of the elderly in the restored Latvian National Museum of Art in the main building, it is clear - Rozental is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on 12 August, but it will be available to visitors from 13 August and will be held until 30 October.
The Latvian National Museum of Art with a wide retrospective reopening in the newly opened Grand Exhibitions Hospital is the year's anniversary of Jani Rozental (1866-1916), which is included at the international level in the UNESCO Winter Calendar.

The U.S. model business closures in his interpretation resulted in the absence of the perversive photosession glancs and the lack of admiring film.
In fact, it is very provocative, on the balance of the falsification and banal vulgarity, which makes it difficult to draw a line between European art films and Hollywood's generic product territory.
The film, with Vigo Mortensen, focuses mainly on whether the models of parents' conceptually selected life (environmental, vegetarianism, alternativeism and restriction from consumer society’s deceit and values) are the result of holiness or destruction for their children.
After the death of a woman, the ideal father of six children is confronted with issues of right choice and true values.

The Islamic state has sent 2,000 civilians to Syria.
The Islamic nation's combatants of the terrorist group, fleeing from Menbija, Syrian Aleppo province, have lost almost 2,000 civilians who are used as a rival, reported on Friday the US-supported Kurdish and Arab alliances and observers.
"We do not punish them because they took themselves with civilians when they fled to Jérébulous," said the representative of the Kurdu Menbija Military Council.
After two months of prolonged fighting, the Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD) who are supported by the US Kurdish-Arab Alliance in the north of Syria announced on Friday that Menbija was liberated from the Jews.
The Islamic State Menbiz adopted it in 2014.
In the past week, QSD has seen most of the "Islam State" fighters from Menbija, but some have remained and displayed strong opposition.
On Friday, however, they left the city, carrying their bags with them.
Islamists go to Jerābulus, which is on Turkey's border.
In London, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) also reported that the Islamic State has defeated about 2,000 people.
SoHR reported that the Muslims had captured the city’s citizens’ cars, forced people to cross them, and then took them to Jérébulus.
The Islamic nation's warriors have also previously done mass killings.
In January, Islamists in the province of Deir ez Zoras conquered more than 400 civilians, including women and children, in eastern Syria.
Later, about 270 Muslims were freed from slavery.
How many Islamic national warriors have fled from Menbija is not known.
The representative of the Kurdus Menbija Military Council reported that the QSD has led to the rescue of 2,500 people who have been Muslim in Menbiz.
The information collected by SOHR shows that at least 437 civilians, including 105 children, have lost their lives in Menbiz.

Collegiate refused to apply for the VID director's office.
The Director-General of the State Environment Service Inga Kolígova decided to withdraw his candidate from the Office of the Director-General of the State Revenue Service (VID) and informed the Agency in the Ministry of Finance.
Collegiate notes that its discussion of the candidate has increased among the opposing coalition parties.
The real reasons for the debate seem to be linked to the political realities, but more often, the invisible interests, and they have nothing to say about the assessment of my professional abilities.
"It's not acceptable to me," he points out already was the official candidate for the VID leader.
In the event that his candidate was approved in the Government, it would be clear that this would not be a convincing vote and would not allow it to work fully and implement the necessary changes to the VID, with all the support of the Government.
Without it, it would not be possible to work in full, Collegiately.
"I am more publicly stressing that I do not want to be politically independent, but now all my candidate process is too political," the official explains.
"Thanks for my confidence and support, it is an experience that I appreciate as a result," wrote Reinnice-Ozola in his presentation.
On the third day, the Unit stated that during a meeting with Koljöv, "the essential contradictions" were revealed between the explanations of the candidate and the information available in the public register on the costs of the SIA Palogs dividends, as the decision of the Palogs members does not provide for the participation of the members of the meetings.

The police were immediately informed of the incident, which was also the decision on the children's next train.
Riga's freedom has introduced all the recommendations made by the SMEs in relation to the Russian island project.
The Riga Free Office has introduced all of the five State Control (ECF) recommendations on the development of the project Infrastructure for the transfer of port activities in the Russian island of Russia from the implementation of the city centre, the port of Dina.lv was informed to the company.
The approval of the project is planned at the next meeting of the Riga Free Trade Board.
In order to implement the recommendations in accordance with the recommendation of the CF, the Riga Freevost administration also conducted the legal and operational audit conclusions of the International Auditor Deloitte Riga's voluntary management and the recommendations made to improve the management of the project during the next phase of the project.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to the WK today.
Despite the fact that Riga's liberal administration does not agree with the opinion prepared by the UK on the effectiveness of the implementation of the Russian island project, we are very responsible for the implementation of the project and the donor of funding - the European Commission (EC).
I would like to stress that all the planned construction work within the project is complete within the deadlines and the planned amount.
"In order to prove to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the VK and the incentives that the free movement is the key target of successful implementation of the project, we have fully implemented all the VK recommendations on project management and monitoring," said Sanita Kaire, director of the Russian island project.
The long-term plan of action for the project's achievement and monitoring objectives was complemented by the most important planned actions of the parties involved and the necessary deadlines for the time-limits for the meetings and regular reporting and their time-limits for the planned monitoring instruments of the construction process, as well as for the definition of the most important border points.
The approved action plan for the achievement of the project's objective by 31 December 2018, in accordance with the recommendations of the JC, was complemented by the implementation monitoring activities, thereby strengthening the control of the time limits of the other parties involved in the implementation of the project by the free market of Riga.
A project management plan has been developed for the development of project management and for the reduction of potential risks, by defining project management areas and by specifying the documents drawn up to ensure a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
In order to increase project capacity, a project management structure has been developed which reflects the structure, qualifications and functions of the project management team.
In order to improve the communication between the parties involved in the project, the plan of communication of the interested parties to the project, in addition to the Parties identified in the project action plan, defines the project for the successful completion of the project by interested parties, the principles of information exchange, the types of communication and periodicity.
However, in order to improve the control of the use of financial resources, the need for a service contract to be concluded or purchased will need to be further detailed and legal.
Under the project, the Russian island has built a port infrastructure corresponding to global standards - four new depths, railways, and engineering communications.
The co-financed buildings of the Cohesion Fund have been completed and are placed in operation at the end of the year in which they have already been invested, reaching a total of EUR 10.6 million.
For the sake of security at airports in Slovakia, security has been strengthened.
After obtaining non-specific threats, Slovakia reinforced security measures in several airports on Friday, announced by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
"In view of the threats, we have strengthened security measures at international airports in Bratislava, Poprad and Košice," the AFP press representative of the Slovak Ministry of Interior sent to the Agency on Friday.

The meeting will discuss the impact of the British Brexit referendum and discuss the future of the EU without Britain.
Slovakia is the EU Presidency by January.
German researchers are discussing the number of "Berlin's Seagull".
According to a new study, the number of injuries to the former eastern borders in the south of the communists could be much larger than the previously considered, but doubts about the number of true victims remain undisclosed.
According to data provided by the Berlin Wall Museum of Checkpoint Charlie on Wednesday, from 1945 to 1989, along the border with the western zones, and the last 1841 people from the Western Communists' power station have come out of their controlled territory.
The border-related deaths museum has been investigating for years and is currently correcting the number of children.
Other 11 deaths have been added to this year's list, including the inclusion of a six-year-old child, who has become a member of the family, trying to reach the Western Hemisphere through the eastern Czech Republic and Hungary.
Among the new Berlin Walls, there are also the council's dissidents.
"The final amount of damage caused by the double evils of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented," acknowledged museum director Aleksandra Hildebrante.
"Our task is to provide for the capture of those who have been injured, trying to avoid the Communists-controlled state, to be collected and ignored," says the Hildebrandes report.
However, other researchers have already questioned the new numbers.
"Skaitlis 1841 is unconfirmed", an interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung, quoted by a professor of history at the University of Free University in Berlin.
He, together with other researchers at the Berlin Free University, is currently reviewing possible fatalities at the border and has been able to confirm only 260 cases.
Previously, researchers have found that only 138 people have been murdered by the communists of the Berlin Wall.
In view of those people who have suffered, trying to escape the Baltic Sea or to enter the Middle East through the territory of neighboring countries, the number of victims, according to the State, could reach about a thousand.
But this is much less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the different number of birds could be different methodologies.
The Checkpoint Charlie Museum also records all the cases of suicide of the Austrian border guards regardless of whether they were directly related to their service.
The museum also records deaths that are not related to direct violence.
"If older people from 70 to 80 years of age have died from heart disease after border controls, it must have been the consequences of these "slipkavnic boundaries", Hildebrante is considered.
However, the State is convinced that a difference should be made between the elderly who may have died as a result of their experience and those who have died from long waiting in the bus by the border.
It is not easy to record it, however, because the authorities of the Communist Republic did not disclose such statistics, and researchers should examine the documents in different archives, states the State.
However, the United States Group has recently drawn up new documents, and therefore, in the near future, it could come up with a survey of the number of new birds.
LPF President Pone to Rio owes trainer accreditation; this is a surprise.
In recent days, President Kaspars Pone Riodezáneiro of the Latvian Federation of Pledements (LPF) came out of the Olympic Games with a trainer's accreditation, but he felt surprised about it.
On the third day, a large riot took place following the words of German Jakubovska trainer Alonas Ribakov, an Olympic pilot, who discovered that the last time Riodzejaneiro decided to go to Pone while the trainer was staying at home.
The original travel list was approved by the complainants Aliona Ribakova and Uvis Kalniņš, trainers Jakubovski and Davis Kolins, as well as the federation president Pone.
The Latvian Football Federation requested five members to play the Olympics, and even before the flight, Aldons Vrubläevskis claimed that Germans would be and are looking for tickets.
"But apparently for objective reasons he did not," said Pone, saying that this did not affect the outcome of Ribakov.
At the request of the Federation, Uvja trainer agreed to help her.
Mr LOK, who is a member of the LOK Executive Committee, was critical of the LOK operation by renewing the flag to the Olympic Sports Supervisory Organisation.
In my view, it is unrealistic to approve five persons and none of them are included in the LOK Executive Committee.
"I don't know why the Federation didn't eat the places directly," Mr. Pone said that the work of the federations and their presidents had not been evaluated in society, remembering that the federations did not receive wages.
Pone also criticized Jakubovski himself, saying that before the London Olympic Games, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he filed a complaint at the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and called on Latvia not to send any athletes.
Mr. even couldn't tell why he was in the Olympics with a trainer's accreditation, which was most likely to have to be given to Jakubovski.
"I was asked to be president of the Federation ("the leader"), but for some unknown reason I received trainer accreditation and now there is no one inside."
The situation changed every day, the number of accreditations available changed.
Until recently, I thought that Germans would be there because I had no other information.
After the information in the LETA agency, a few days before the beginning of Ribakov, she had had an interview with Poni and after her client had been in tears, but the LPF president himself said that it had been a daily conversation with the athletes wanting to stop before the start.
He recalled that the LPF was monitoring five types of sports in the Olympic programme and that four of them also take place in Latvia.
The President of the Federation said that there is also a very important issue of networking in Latvia, as well as those programmes he spoke about, that Riodezáneiro has been there for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the Federation and said that in 2018 there could be a global crisis in Latvia.
The presence of Riodezáneiro is not my vacation, here I worked, spent my time and tried to implement the four-year programmes.
In most, 600,000 will be set free.
During the Latvenergo Fisheries Renewal Programme in Daugau this week, the landing of salmon and time-consumer species in Mangalsala is planned to take over 600,000 individual salmon and time-based fish species born in the Bior Tomes and Doles.
The Latvian authorities informed LETA that fishing would continue in the coming months - a total of 6,300,000 different species of fish and crustaceans are introduced each year.
In the spring and early summer of 2016 there will be a release of beds and beds, June - summer, July - summer summer, August and September - Saturday and spring.
The director of Latvian production, Mr Könickis, told us that concerns about the environment are one of the cornerstones of the sustainable development of the Latvian Group.
"All activities in the protection and promotion of fish resources are aimed at environmentally friendly actions in close cooperation with the scientific institute of the Bureau, in the development and deployment of fish stocks in the Daugava database and in the implementation of other activities," Kungickis said.
This year, Daugavas will spend more than 600,000 individual lakes and timepieces.
For the second year before the landing, small fish are already marked by boiling water.
Today, the cargo is loaded with an average weight of 25 000 pounds.3 grams.
Each year, scientificly based species in Daugau and its base watertips occur in small and medium sized fish.
The development of fishing resources in Daugau and its waters under the legislation shall be carried out by the Bureau on the basis of an expert opinion on the losses incurred by the fisheries resources resulting from the activities of Latvia and on the basis of the conclusions of the measures to be taken to ensure the diversity of fishing resources.
On the other hand, the State environmental service shall, on the basis of that expertise, decide on the amount and type of compensation.
The annual amount of compensation in Latvia is EUR 1,035,000 in the programme for the renewal of fisheries resources.
In the spring of 2016, in cooperation with the company "Our Fish", 400 artificial fish nests in Daugava are located in the city of Cabala and Ikkoiles for the fifth year.
Cooperation with the company, in favour of the natural nurse of the fish, is an additional support for the initiative under the Fisheries Renewal Programme.
The establishment of artificial nests in the water register is an important step that contributes to the protection and development of fish resources in Dauga.
The Festival "Sansusian concert hall" is a village hall, forest, circus.
In the Guli tent, eating as a restaurant, walking along the streets and asking for a room music, enjoying a good nature, - such a combination offers an alternative room music festival in Sansus, which is already called the third summer to the Akniste novel.
The festival will be held in Susyas - no longer existing castle - in the ancient pagan temple, near the woods and in the deserts.
Three days, from 12 to 14 August, on five views, can combine unsatisfying natural and academic music's tasteless tastes.
Here is a theatre and a contemporary circus, performance and installation.
Opera and academic music, in particular in its latest performances, find new audiences free and open in the environment without concerts.
The distance from these two to Riga is about 150 km, but to the smile on the face and the ease in the legs is just a few minutes.
"Please don't look for a program, because we've deliberately chosen not to publish it before, so that people don't take one specific measure or artist, because in Sansu, the voice can only be heard during all three days," the festival's founder and farmer, Colonel Armand Siliņš, called.
On Friday, 7 p.m. and the first concert is at 9 p.m.
Of course, there will be programming spaces with all the information.
For those who have to choose one day, we recommend a Saturday, as it is most popular - from 9 a.m. to the next morning.
"The names of the artists are available on the website www.sansusi.lv", says Armands Silinš.
In the colourful artist's book, for example, the violinist Eva Bindere, the artist Kristine Blaumane, the operaist Inga Kalna, the clarinetist Guntis Kuzma, the tromethist Janis Porietis, the pianoist Reinis Zarinš, the quartet Quadra and RIX and even the Greek Great, which together with Latvian musicians Eric Kirschfeld, Martin Zilbert and the actress Anci Strazdu have created a temporary circle of Confines about the inner battle of the artist.
A special festival has also created new jobs.
It shows children "Kukinis", which, according to the story of F. Kafkas, was composed of the values of Olyesia Kozlovska and Jacob Niimanis, until Armando Silin, musicians and activists will participate in entomologists (student of cooks) Ugis Peterán.
Oskars Herlinš has created the first Stigít square, while Anna Čirse - Koku opera, performances that are the main towers in the Andra Kalnozola regime with Katrins Neiburg video projections and Andra Egliši's scriptography will be three small holes in three hectares in the wide square.
By singing in the voices of Laimas Ledinės, Dinaras Rudáns and Zigmára Griša, they will enter romantic relationships, as well as the nature of the time spent in the study of Swedish scientist Karilla Linneja Kokus (1729).
Riodzejaneiro's Olympic Games today begins one of the biggest hopes of the Latvian delegation's seven-year-old athlete Laura Ikaniece-Admidinja.

In May, Latvia set up a new national record (point 6622) and set up a second place in the prestigious seven-year competitions in the Austrian city of Gecis.
Ikoniece-Admidinja also participated in the 2012 London Olympics, when she took up the ninth place with the Latvian record.
In the last half year, the national record of sportsmen has been improved four times.
Today, plkst.16 is also intended for Latvian judicious Arturo Íkiforenko, which starts in the weight category over 100 kilograms, first calling war against Azerbaijani sports director Usangi Kukauri.
The jury will be the first Olympics in a career.
The LETA agency has already reported that on the fourth day the weight category to 100 kilograms of losses was already experienced in its first battle by the Latvian killer Jevgenijs Bordovko.
He approached Japan, Hagu Rjunoski, who later acquired a bronze.
In 2000, Vsevolods Zelonis brought the Latvian Olympic bronze prize to Latvia, but in the next four Olympic games, the Latvian Jews won only one victory in seven battles, which was achieved in London directly by Bordovko.
At 16.30 p.m., the election will begin on Saturday.
The Olympic road mark was received only on the day the Latvian delegation was officially notified, but later he revealed to the LETA agency that it had been quite safe to drive since April.

Reids argues that if Clinton will be elected to the office of the President, then he will appoint Garland as Judge of the Supreme Court .
The leader of the Senate Democrat Party, Harijs Reids, is convinced that if he becomes president, then he will be appointed America Garland as the Supreme Court Chief Justice .
The Party of the Republic of the Senate has blocked the approval of Garland since March when it was appointed by President Obama.

Greenland hajiv is the tallest blacksmith in the world - video view

Jewish researcher Julius Nilsen reports that the longevity record belongs to a mother who may be 272 to 512 years old and five feet [5 m] old.
The French court rejects the requirement to engage business in the refugee camp of the jungle.
The French court rejected the request of the Kale authorities to hire ten self-made shops and restaurants in the jungle, where thousands of refugees live.
This week, at the trial meeting in Kale, the authorities indicated that 72 self-made shops should be set up by the country where people in the territory of the settlement market various goods, such as cigarettes and energy, offer freshness services, 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for some euro-formed restaurants.
The prefecture Bureau pointed out that these self-designed companies need to be shaken because they create economies of interest and do not pay taxes, as well as create fire and sanitation risks.
The representatives of the humanitarian groups explained to the court that these small companies are important because the food provided by the government and support groups does not provide the housing needs in which the number of victims continues to grow.
They also pointed out that self-made shops and restaurants often offer free meals and food to those who need it most.
The Grand Court ruled that it was not a legal basis to expel people who had created 72 self-made shops, but it understood the concern of Kale Prefecture.
Justice Jeans-France Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a greater role than simply providing food to people living in "extraordinary non-target conditions".
He pointed out that these places are peaceful places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that is at risk of retiring is the library of the jellyfish "Jungle Book Kids", which provides more than 200 free meals on the day of meal, English and French, and provides advice on asylum issues for hundreds of minors who are not protected without adult guidance.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition for the protection of children.
The issue in Guardian's letter indicated that the elimination of caffeine "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years of age."
On Friday, two charity organisations "Help for Refugees" and "L'Auberge des Migrants" reported that the number of displaced persons "Jungle" has increased to 9000 people, the highest figure since the rapid arrival of migrants in the summer.

Fiji demonstrated master classes in the management of bombs, bombs played with legs, support games, and brutal violence in the play of gold - the first Olympic medal in its history of its existence.
The story brought a prize of precious peace - a silver medal that was now the third medal in Britain. The British election can be pleased with its success in the first Olympic reggie-7 tournament in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
At the end of the great battle, in which the Boks team insisted that the result was 7:5 days in the first half, it was possible to play for Britain at the end.
But in any case, Fiji is now in its best form to win the 15 men's team.
Although we do not believe in it, we know the peace for Britain could be the fact that at least one Briton gained gold medals. It is Fiji's main coach Bens Rains - former English coach from Vimbdona.
This was a disturbing experience for Britain.
Eight years ago, under the command of Rainena, they lost all the game reggie-7 series in Adelaide.
This time they lost only one game.
It's painful, but growth is amazing.
Fiji suddenly started to lose weight, opening the way for the British forces to be happy.
Captain Tom Michel and the brothers were in contact with several buses on the opposite side and the World Series champions set out at 5:0 when Osea Colinsau won the first landing.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwa has also increased the volume by making the seed in the fine soil.
The result was 12:0 and the British team had not even been able to hit the bomb.
Michela’s great strength did not allow natural Leoni Nakarava to get three points, but it only had a little effect on Fiji.
In the seventh minute the Jasa Veremallu won the conquest in good shape, strengthening the overarching over Britain to 17:0.
After the replay, Nakarava increased its weight even more, and by the end it had remained more than a minute... by the end of the first half.
Vatemo Ravovov avoided some of the ineffective British methods and crossed the line by drawing points.
The floor provided a result 29:0.
It's like Fiji is born to play Regbie-7 games while the British are still learning.
In fact, it's also true.
The British team made fundamental changes in half, over the Fiji player line... full four minutes, which after the first half of the standards were good, until after Joshua Tuisova, after a fantastic team game, gained some more points in the Fiji team's well.
Dan Norton was able to get points in the British team for the good, making landing on the left side and achieving the result 36:7, but the game was already lost, so that the fans of the South Sea trekkers were singing, waving the cards and playing in the tribunes.
Fiji is not to be confused with life-threatening behaviour.
Mata Viliame made Fiji win even more sweet with another kiss at the end of the game.
When the game was over, Fiji could begin to sing, but the Britons only had the ability to dance in the medicine.
On the first half of the day, Fiji won Japan as a result of 20:5, but the British were too much over South Africa, where the two teams won the battle on the ground and the South Africans lost only a few points.
The first half of Kails Brauns set up Box commanders, but the second half of Dennis Nortons crossed the line with sharp skill and bought a bomb between the pillars to ensure the British victory.
Markus Vassona, who is the brother of Antonia at the end of the game, is a member of the British Governing Body-15 team, gave the team a victory and another medal at the end of the game.
The trainer's battle with cancer inspired Helen Gloveri and Heter Staningu's victory in the air raids.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in these rings, and it has already spoken a lot.
From the first to the last century, Hellenas Gloveres and Heteres Stanning’s golden miracle was particularly important in the path of Estacio da Lagoa.
Although there are only two athletes on board, she took Robin Viljamsa's support, which led her to the second Olympic gold medal for women to be the first women in British sports history who had such success.
He no doubt dominated her, for the 39th time she won an unprecedented, unprecedented victory.
The two great athletes with the floor elegance swirling over the surface of the water do not fully reflect this triumph.
After each gold medal, there is a healthy team that works hard to improve the performance of the athletes and the greatest contribution to their success, the trainer who had not yet known whether he would survive this day because he was diagnosed with cancer.
After she said that, it seemed as fast as she could.
I had an urinary cancer, which is one of the things that can operate, and that's what happened.
If I don't, it'll be distributed throughout the body.
And the situation would be uncontrollable.
It doesn't change your vision a little.
In December 2013, William’s cancer was diagnosed.
This three points out that William was able to initiate the recovery procedure at the beginning of 2014 and to reduce the duration of the suspension to a minimum if it can be said.
I needed income, so I had to move quickly.
It encouraged the return.
I was in the hospital, and I stayed six, 10 and 15 feet [15 m] long, even though the doctor said he would agree with some steps.
It all started.
Air travel is a challenge, but this time it was even greater.
After the victory, the first thought was about William, who had been very upset all morning and spoke more than usual about the excitement.
Stanninga, who's been born in the Royal Artillery unit in Afghanistan, said: "This was a very hard week, but it means a lot to me."
This only confirms how much it means to us and how much I, Helen and Robin have worked.
The three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin we would have achieved nothing, so thank you so much for him, he's the best coach in the world.
I can't imagine a better training team or a better coach.
Helen Glovere and Heter Staning have not lost any of their lives in the past five years.
The press is reaching such a speed that no competitors can compete with.
Even in the last 500 yards [500 m] when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to arrive, Stanings and Glovers were too big.
We feel every dream.
Helen said, "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
Not losing concentration is really important.
We had a good start, but at the same time we did not have high hopes.
That day we didn’t want to go through the records, but we just had to get a good wind and win the fight, and we did the same.
After a few years, you will rest to decide what to do next.
In the next month, there will be the chaos of Glover's and the television show search engine Steve Bashala.
In the meantime, she just wants to enjoy the dream.
I didn't mean to say that these were my last adventures.
This would have been too much pressure.
In London, I needed about six months to understand that I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very excited.
This time it needed about four minutes.
She said, "The feeling is amazing."
The unique opportunity to explore the fantastic architecture of the Central Library of Los Angeles.

New and obese DTLA children are affected by domestic changes,
By marking the 90th anniversary of the Los Angeles Central Library - with what else? - as a new book!
Collegiants VID's head office "will go to the end".
Following her statement, Minister Márim Kučinski (Green and Agriculture Union) and Finance Minister Danai Reisinicei-Ozola (Green and Farmer Union) are now "primarily important" to approve the candidates led by the Minister of Finance at the VID's office.
Rajevskis said that both Kučinski and Reizniec-Ozola are "the first big decision" that can affect them as a political future in this government.
If the position of the VID's senior candidate is now being changed, it will have a negative impact on the management of their immunities.
The next week's session of the Cabinet of Ministers has included the question of the transfer of College of Directors of the VID to the Office of the Director-General of the VID, showing the government's working order.
Mr Reizniece-Ozola, head of the Board of Directors of the VID, was headed by Minister of Finance after the departure of the management of the service from Inára Petierson and when a tender to the Director-General of the VID was terminated without a result.
On Thursday, 11 August, the vice president of the VID took part in the interview with the Latvian Radio - if he offered to apply to the board of directors, he could accept it.
The Minister of Finance later acknowledged that he did not consider other VID managers' candidates in the past.
The Head of the National Union Union Group, Raivis Dzintars, also acknowledges that the UN continues to support the leadership of the Colleges of VIDs.
In Spain, the possibility of reducing budget deficit could not be threatened by the creation of a government.
By 12 July, the European Commission (EC) concluded that Spain and Portugal had not implemented sufficient measures to reduce the deficit to 3% of the total domestic product required by the euro area (ICP) before 12 July.
The calculations show that the deficit of the Portuguese budget at the end of last year was 4.4% of GDP, but in Spain - 5.1%.
However, the European Commission has decided not to apply economic sanctions to both countries, while setting fiscal targets for the near future.
One of the reasons why the EC does not impose sanctions on both countries is that Euroscepticism has increased in many European Union countries.
Additional sanctions would only increase such negative trends.
Critics also point out that the EC is not consistent in its decisions, from the beginning of agreement on uniform rules and then unable to apply them in life.
For example, German Bank President Jenss Weidmanns said that Europe is losing its confidence in this way by creating a public opinion that the rules of the European Union are recommended rather than binding.
The EC has now proposed and all Member States have agreed to extend the budget deficit deadline until the end of this year to Portugal and Spain by 2018.
The European Commission aims to examine progress made by both countries within the next few months, while indicating that both Spain and Portugal should be ready to introduce additional storage measures if the conditions require them.
The initial projections show that the targets set by Portugal could be achieved at the time and that the deficit of the budget could be reduced to 2.5% of the total domestic product this year.
This means that, under the Stability Programme, this country's government has to implement savings measures of 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in the budget of this year, with additional attention to the control of the costs of purchases of goods and services.
In Spain, the situation is much more difficult.
This year's budget deficit needs to be reduced to 4.6%, next year - to 3.1% and in 2018 - to 2.2% of GDP.
In addition, in the next two years, consolidation measures should be 0.5% of GDP per year.
In particular, it would be difficult to achieve these objectives, because for eight months the political parties of Spain have not reached agreement on the establishment of a government, and it is increasingly possible for Spain to be able to make a third-time parliamentary election within a year.
The public opinion, however, shows that the third election would also not significantly change the political stage of the country.
The most popular party remains the current prime minister of the country party, Mariano Rahoja, whose election will be 33% of the vote again.
Their popularity has increased slightly only by socialists, while the popularity of the "Podemos" or "We All May" and "Ciudadanos" or "Pilsons" of the parties against the rescue measures has decreased slightly.
The People's Party wishes to achieve socialist and civil society involvement in the government this month, otherwise it will not be possible to adopt and submit to the European Commission a draft budget for 2017 by mid-October.
As the representative of the Parliamentary Group of the People's Party, Rafael Hernando, said that if the government did not succeed and that Parliament's elections would also be held the third time, Spain would become a European flag.
The purity of the river is critical in the coast of Riga.
In the fifth year of flooding, activists have concluded that every year, unfortunately, the number of missing persons has increased, and here it is estimated that the largest visitors to the mountains are visiting.
The most polluted swimming pools are Riga.
It is clear from the city’s view that swimming places are busy every day, but fighting against unclean visitors is very difficult.
In addition, waste left in the ground during waste disposal can be depleted in water, thus damaging its quality.
Apart from Lipaja’s beaches and certain places in Curzem, the cleanliness of the beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
This announcement was circulated this week by the volunteers of the "My Sea" campaigns.
For five years on foot along the coast of Riga, activists have concluded that the number of waste left by the population has increased every 100 metres.
Unfortunately, this year this critical assessment has taken place.
"We see that this will be the year when the number of wastes on a plane of 100 metres may even exceed 200 units," said Janis Ulme, representative of the expedition "My Sea".
Latvia's Radio is known, he's found in your beach, where he continues his free route along the Riga Sea River.
This year, between the various wastes of life and the remains of the Picnic activists, even the daily light bulbs left in the seabeds.
The transitional participant and organizer Ulme said that the pollution directly affected the population.
"The main source is the beach visitors themselves, as more than half of the total waste is plastic, various wastes, starting with bags, plastic bottles that are already in the destruction stage, they are no longer able to identify them, and the flavors, bottles, corners," says Ulme.
Among the cleanst beaches are also the fishing grounds in Riga.
In Daugavgri, for example, an average of almost 800 waste units are collected every 100 metres, which is critically high.
The organizers of the campaign also explain that they are also smoking on the stage and not all of the warning or prohibition signs placed.
"The average figures for all three Riga fishing sites together - Daugavgravgrav, Westernbull and Parents - unfortunately collect far too much and far above the desired goal or goal, which, like Latvia, will reduce the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020," concludes the environmental representative.
Cleaning places in Riga every day, in the summer’s hottest days even two times, the representative of the Council is Ugís Midauski.
However, the fight against unclean visitors is very difficult.
We come back to the cultural issue of these people.
"The use of alcohol, smoking and doing all the things that must not be done, even special signs, is not working," says the Middle East.
As a result, Midauski invites visitors to report to the police about the polluters.
It can be called police, safe to point to these crimes and thus fight everyone.
Perhaps you can take some new warnings, but as I said, quite or as radically changing the situation.
"Because everyone should simply turn around and be inappropriate to such offenders," he points out.
As long as water quality measurements have been carried out this summer the fourth time a health inspection that may set out a ban on official poultry.
Today, as in other years, the quality of water is always good and satisfying.
The present situation is that all 56 water quality in the water is always good and has no limitations on the flow of water.
"The last time we'll take an analysis at the end of August," said the senior environmental health inspector Normands Kadičios.
The waste left on the ground during heavy rains can be depleted in water.
It may, however, affect its quality, as indicated by the environmental specialist.
The rotations in Russia continue - the change of leadership in Putin administration.
Do you love me?
Vladimir Putins announced to the Russian media that Sergey Ivanovs would like to leave this office itself and will continue to be the president's special representative on matters of nature's protection, environmental and transport.
In notifying of the changes, Putin's television camera gave Ivanov the welcome words: "Sergej Borisovic, we have worked with you for many years and we have done it successfully."
I am satisfied with how you fulfill your responsibilities.
I am well aware of our agreement not to use you at this presidency's management office for more than four years.
Therefore, I will wisely resist your desire to change the field of activity.
And I hope that in the new office you will also make full use of your knowledge and experience.
However, the leadership of the President's administration is found to be very important and has made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
In view of the upcoming election of the State Council in Russia, the concern was expressed that this step is linked to the struggle for power in the political elite of Russia.
Ivanovs was also called potential Putin replacements in the President's office and therefore the claim that he himself wanted to take the office of the President in matters of nature's protection and transport has raised doubts.
As shown by the Lsm.lv archive, Ivanovs is the General Public Security Service of the VDK and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanovs was a very old and close Russian President Vladimir Putina's colleagues.
He started his career in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, Putin became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his assistant.
However, the first Russian President, Boris Jelcina, was appointed Secretary of the Russian Security Council at the end of his reign.
In 2000, after Putina’s arrival to power, Ivanova’s “Information Safety Doctrine” was approved, including the restoration of national censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001 Sergey Ivanovs became Russian Minister of Defence, but already in 2005 he was Deputy Prime Minister Mihaila Fradkova and was responsible for the development and export of arms to Russian defence companies.
Now, after the presidential administration's appointment, Ivanovs will also remain in Russia's National Security Council, where I will also work with the new President's Director of Administration Vaino.
Vaino comes from the family council elite.
Vaino, head of the presidential administration, advised Ivanovs himself.
We've known Anton Eduardovic since.
From the time we worked in your government.
And for almost five years, we've been in touch almost every day.
"So I am convinced that he is ready for this work after all professional and personal qualities," Ivanovs said.
Vaino comes from a family belonging to the elite of the council party.
His father, Karl, took the lead in the Communist Party of Estonia, including his first secretary for ten years until 1988.
The Internet spending "Meduza" in reference to the book "Independence and independence of Estonia" writes that at the end of the 1980s Karl Vaino was asked to allow Moscow to use force against demonstrators.
However, he was rejected and soon lost his job.
Soon after, Vaino moved to Moscow.
Anton Vaino has graduated from the Moscow International Relations Institute and manages the Japanese language.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the management of the President's Protocol.
It has already been reported that in recent weeks Russia has been affected by the arrest of several high-ranking officers and even arrests, including the replacement of several district governors and federal representatives.
As policy points out, President Vladimir Putins is re-elected by the ruling elite before the elections expected in 2018.
One of the main features is the increasing frequency of representatives of the power structures at the leading atoms.
He's also killed a little boy in New York City losing his first Olympic game.
This was the first time the fight was in progress, and the Latvian junta killed his participation in the Olympics ended at the end of the 17th place.
Coach Olygs Basins of Latvia on TV admitted that the hope of Níkiforenko was very small, and it was already clear before the competitions.
He also discovered that a young Jew had been beaten by thieves in the war.
Of course, in order to be at the Olympic Road Marks, Žikiforenko came to start in a weight category other than its experience, i.e. in a weight category up to 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijani coast was 25 miles [25 km] thicker.
It has already been reported that in the course of the war, Juvgenjis Bordovko was in the weight category up to 100 kilograms against Rjunosuki for a period of two minutes, until the opponent was released a year of pure victory.
So far, Latvia's Judiciary Rio has closed.
The dreams go into Rio's brains.
On the fourth day, a Jew named Jevgenius Borodovko was married.
Yes, he was entitled to resist, but he was able to overcome the ambitions of his time.
He didn't say.
Artura was even more difficult in New York, as his experience was less and more respectable.
The result is similar to that he had in the dark for a half-minute longer than Borodovko.
Unfortunately, in recent times Latvia's Jews lack the most ambitious ambition.
Since the federation, Gunnars Chierson and his financial studio, Vladimir Šestakovs, have left Latvia, after Aleksandr Jackevičs, is no longer known as the Golden Score, - the Jewish development routing on the side of the shooting line.
Jackević, who is here to consult the Jews of Kazakhstan, and Vsevoldam Zeloni, cannot see the natives.
But if you don't grow up, you won't.
And it's the federation's favorite.
Because of the promise of the President of the Latvian Federation of Judo, Rio, from another galaxy in the Panorama of the East, made to break the medals.
Flight far from reality.
In the evening we looked forward to the beach volleyball match Samoilovs/Smédiņš - Evandru/Pedru Solbergs.
Intrig as already in the "death" group - losers in the end of the game.
The Latvian dupe had a small difference - it could also be lost, but not more than four points in two sets.
The competition was still growing in the length of the previous game.
No one wanted to die - this feeling over the windscreen of the card all the time.
For players, the brake wind created additional difficulties.
At first, they thought it might be the permanent - which is more general - popular.
But he didn't.
It was pretty simple to play against Latvia's duet here.
They're so close to Samuel, and they're waiting for him to come.
The first set at the end and the third at the end of the siege against Cuba was against Canada because the load was not too high for anyone.
In those days, the work was small, but when it was, it was a good one.
The Brazilians of Samoilov with Shmeedin were able to win two seats, for the first took control of 16:15, but also on 16 remaining at the limit of the lost points as well.
But they could also lose with 0:2, because in the second set the deficit was -4, however, thanks also to the leader, they were able to win.
The third has already been detained on the mark of Evandr's services.
The chains were displayed - the service was taken undisputably, the second game was often too close to the network and Samuel was left with very little options for the resulting attack.
If there was a neighbor of Samuel in the kitchen, he was more successful this time, and the loss of Sasha would be unprofessional.
Kreile also made a mistake, and it is symbolic that the last bomb hit him directly.
They're losing the team.
This time, there was a certain lack of progress - in the third century only two Evans' attacks almost flew out of the map, but the bomb was still on the line.
Two steps were next to the line.
The controversial episode video is also a decision for good opponents.
If the first two games were with servants, Evandru was very productive for us.
All of the total loss on the table.
The causes of failure should now be analysed peacefully.
Perhaps it was as many as living near the stadium, not together with a delegation in the Olympics.
It's been a couple of hours on the way.
Maybe a little self-reliance gave a seven-sided series of semi-finals.
It may not have been necessary to play in Klagenfur, but to get out here faster and better.
There may have been an error with the discovery of the gymnasium.
We are waiting for more than an answer to the question.
Our final games are over.
The dream of medals is over.
What's next?
There are still some World Cup tournaments, as well as the "Masters" of the Jūrmala.
Samuel’s life has never been pleasant and will not be like that, for there are too many different personalities.
But that's not necessary either.
When the dream of the Olympic medals has come true, the idea of separation can also come to mind, as the war will be sought not only by itself but also by partner.
The solution is not difficult, but much harder will be found in Latvia to find a decent partner.
The two brothers are playing the game, but John and Tom have already tried and broke up, but Michael Samuels is still too green to start closing the world’s top.
You can try to return to the Navy, but it will not be better than this option, which has not just proved itself in the world's stages.
Copabacan’s pain did not strike them this time.
A whiskey.
Of course, it also needs to be taken into account that the floating volleyball is becoming more popular, that is, newly introduced, and that only the rare growth is less than two meters.
This does not yet guarantee success, but it is a major argument in the fight for victory.
Our spirits do not remain.
For athletes and journalists, it is possible to mix games in the places offered by the players and choose your own.
The U.S. basketball team lives on a cruise ship, and some tennisists do not stay in the Olympic Desert.
Also, a part of the beach volleyball list has been visited in the hotel in Copabacan.
This time, prices were strongly exceeded for journalists who were offering all reliable shelters.
Therefore, the choice is also a challenge for the rent of the apartment.
The risk is because sometimes they may be ineffective from a logical point of view.
This is the risk corrected.
Together with Vladimir Vladimirovic, we rented apartments on the Copabacan and Ipanema border.
Pludmale 200 meters away, a sidewalk half an hour away.
The area is relatively safe, as the favela is too far, but you must not lose your mind.
Vladimir Vladimirvičs is not what some people think at the moment, but the most professional sports journalist in Russian media Vladimir Ivanovs.
P.S. looks like another medal was fired on Friday morning.
100 meters in the bar and high-speed Laura Ikanice-Admidinė has been withdrawn from her personal records.
But there are still five disciplines.
After 10 years of interruption, the "Purjis and Besa" scans in Liepaya.
The first study of the Portuguese and Besa opera was held in Latvia in 1973 at the Latvian National Opera.
Since then, the internationally recognized headquarters has not been rebuilt.
That is why the organizers of the Czech Art Festival and Liepaja art forum have decided in close cooperation to give listeners the opportunity to enjoy George Géršva headquarters.
"We are delighted that after ten years of interruption, when Liepaja was finally able to enjoy the study of the opera, this great version of the concert of the opera "Porgijs and Besa" by George Géršvina is blessed with us in the new, newly opened concert "Great teeth", says the concert director of the "Great teeth" of the Bible God.
Opera "Porgijs and Besa" is a full-fledged story of love, its inconsistency, corruption, as well as the tragedy of life and the simple daily pleasures.
It reflects the afro-American vitality, music and rhythm.
That is the lack of this policy correction in this operation, the exclusion of tolerance makes it so alive.
"And you have to, this love story is extremely strong, extremely beautiful and in some way really deep," said Director Viesturs Kairis.
What I like most - listening to or listening to this opera, there are always such touching points - famous melody, glorious motives, but these transitions from character to character, revealing one person or other person, or horse or orchestra.
"It's the most exciting, this building," the opera evaluates the opera's music director and director Andris Poga of the "Porgius and Besa" concert.
The visitors of the opera are convinced that this is a grand event.
They are delighted to hear the famous Christmas opera in this world.
It is a blessing to see the spirit of the world in Libya.
"Completion professional", the opera is evaluated by the visitor Edgars Láms.
The concert was special with the first time the orchestra played in the new open concert hall "The Great Dintar" during the orchestra and the first time the concert was performed.
A garden at the Museum of Arts could be named after the newly renovated buildings in the name of New Rosenthal.
In the opening of the exhibition of the exhibition in Riga, Andris Ameriks Rosental revealed that the museum's own address could also be not the Christmas Valdemara street 10a, but the New Rosental area 1.
Mára Láce, director of the museum, acknowledges that the reregistering of the address will create a serious bureaucratic burden, but in general this idea is welcomed and therefore agreed to the municipal proposal.
In 1936, the city of Riga's main act of this idea was created by the memory of the Burkarda Dzena at Jan Rozental, who was standing at the museum.
The director of the tour museum, Wilhelm Purvitis, was one of the initiatives to create this monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
I don't care about the heart all the time - but Wilhelm Purvitis, where do we leave his name?!
"Well, if you, Mr. America, swear to think about it," said Láce.
It is reported that the National Museum of Art was officially opened this May following a massive reconstruction and modernisation of its doors.
Finally, the construction of the VEF Culture City will begin this week.
About 11 million euros will be returned to the SIA "Velve".
The plan is to renovate several city rooms, including two viewers, as well as the building to adapt to people with traffic disturbances.
The Riga Council is committed to attracting the project to the European Union funds of EUR 6 million, but the Director of the Riga Special Department of the Riga Council, Mr Olíegs Burovs, recognises that there is still no complete clarity about the European funds for the project.
"Despite the political desire to start the VEF Culture campaign on reconstruction work by joining the European Structural Funds, we have been waiting for months for a decision, real action by the officials of the Ministry of Finance, whether or not it will be granted," Burovs said.
Last December we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission to decide on its own decision not to take a decision here.
Now we see another round of discussion, so let's see what we can expect in the next few days.
"I want to point out that the Riga Council is undoubtedly guaranteeing that this process will be started and completed within the deadlines," Burovs said.
It has already been reported that more than a year ago, in March 2015, the VEF Cultural City collectively conducted a waste concert immediately before the expected renovation of the building.
Although over the past year, the renovation of the building has not yet been started, and collectively continued to work under inappropriate conditions.
In the Department of the Riga Council's Special Department strategy, the restoration of the town of VEF Culture seems to be divided into independent refurbishment works, each of which will ensure the implementation of different city functions.
The first is the increase in the availability of VEF Culture City and the improvement of the surrounding territory.
It is intended to organize environments and engineering communications, as well as to restore the building phase.
Second - Improvement of VEF Culture city services.
It plans to improve the interior of the building, the walls and the ceilings, the visual and sound records, as well as to organize internal engineering communications of the building.
Thirdly, improving the working conditions of creative workers' collective work, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before "Livu" 40th anniversary, a legendary team can be identified at the exhibition in Liepa.
The exhibition will show various "Livus" features - photographs that are drawn up on the timeline to reflect the group's activities from the beginning to 2010 when the group is notified of the end of its activity.
The attendance rates, musical instruments, awards and concerts of participants will also be shown as well as other issues that have not yet been seen to the general public reflecting the activities of the "Lavi" group.
The exhibition will be complemented with the items of the Museum of Liepaja's storage.
The exhibition's visual layout became in cooperation with fashion artist and painter Elitu Patmalnieci.
The musicians who had been associated with the "Lavi" group and their neighbors also called the call and shared both objects and memories.
"Livu" was first sought in 1972 when a vocal instrument assembly led by Juris Pavitol was formed in the Liepaya cultural home.
The assembly took part in its original composition in 1972 and 1974, as well as in the sight of cities and republics.
In 1976 a legal meeting was held when Juris Pavitols met with a group in the city of Erica Chigele and Metalurgu culture, calling for the addition of Ingrid Gütmani, Andri Krūzin and Jani Groddum.
Over the years, the composition of the group has never been mine.
The participants have joined, others have gone their way, some have returned.
However, the main thing is that we want to prove that Latvian rock music is able to live and exist - remains unchanged.
"What you see is no need for - gins, mats, and bars, these children feel different from the stereotype of the widely accepted stranded stereotype," said music viewer Clas Vávere.
In the group without the music mentioned above, music such as Igo, Vilnius Krievius, Modris Sterns, Valdis Starks, Laimis Racenais, Talis Pusbarnik, Ainars Virga, Aivars Brize, Guntars Mucenieks, Danis Virga, Thomas Klein and many others.
Enter the exhibition free of charge.
The exhibition will be held from 19 August to 30 October.
On August 27th, Liepäja's concert hall "Come, the boys" will be held in the "Lviv" group for 40 years at the celebration of "LÉVIfest 2".

Zbigņevs Stankevičs: The time is coming, and the truth is high.
In the interview of the Catholic Church of Latvia, Metropolis Zbignivs Stankevičs, an interview, the independent emphasis is that if we want to gain power in life, the message of the Gospel must be in its centre.
Because the power of truth is greater than the darkness of evil.
Many are already on the road to the Most Holy of New Mary’s Celebrations in the Aglon.
What messages will faithful ones receive this year?
In recent years, the desire to take the lead in the ministry in Aglon has been expressed by the apostle John.
So, too, the main message contains its contents.
The tradition of your kind is also to consider that the road of the Cross is led by the fate of Janis Bullis.
And he'll make his own message.
In the past day, I was taking the lead in the sacred service of the Vigilian god.
In the past year, I will address the French encyclical "Laudato si" and update it to a solid common home, the theme of the Earth in the context of Latvia.
This year... of course, I've watched what's going on in the world, and I'm trying to react to it.
My approach to meeting the church recommended that the Gospel message be kept in the center of life.
It must be shown that the Gospel answers the most devastating problems in man’s life and gives him inspiration for further ways.
Then it's talking to people.
But in Jesus, in the light of the debate, you say that "return to understanding as a perfect man".
What do you understand?
Does this mean that a person has turned away from the church’s message?
And is there such a resource for the church today?
The capital city of India is a street where men die.
No one in the capital of India is aware of the death penalty for men dying on the road - it seems that he was asleep on the road for hours and then drowned, informs BBC.
It has been reported that the man who was identified as Matubúl was traveling by race every day, but at night he worked for protection.
Matthew 5:30 a.m. came home by the way, when he got by the light car.
The surveillance camera record shows that the driver is separated from the car to be viewed by the victim and then deleted.
In an hour when no one knew of the bleeding man, a mob surrounded him.
About 90 minutes after the accident, the police and the victim were taken to a hospital where he died from the trauma.
In referring to his candidate to the Office of the Director-General of the State Revenue Service (VID), the Director-General of the State Environment Service Inga Kolígova has saved the government from a fall, the associate professor of the University of Latvia's Social Sciences Faculty of Science, Ojärs Skudra, says.
The explanation of the cancellation of the candidate in connection with the conflicts in the coalition is linked to the failure of the government.
In the Skudra negotiations with the Leta agency, he found it difficult to think that the college candidate would be supported in the government's meeting next week.
Similarly, if the "Union" ministers voted against, while the College would have approved it in its office, it would have resulted in government resignation.
The expert also considers that before the announcement of the withdrawal of the candidate, Kolígova has consulted both Finance Minister Danu Reiznieci-Ozol and Prime Minister Mári Kučinski.
At the same time, it also has an approach to "Unity", which was strongly opposed to its candidate.
In predicting whether the tender will help to find an appropriate candidate, Skudra recognises that there are two options - whether a compromise figure will be selected, or whether the institution as the Executive Director-General will continue to run the Dace Pelé.
At the same time, he points out - if the Finance Minister has so far claimed that another candidate is not being considered, there is a house for Pelékaya that he cannot participate in the competition.
LETA has already reported that the Head of State Environment Service has decided to resign its candidate to the office of the Director-General of the VID.
Because of the "unity" opposition, the government left the College's approval on Tuesday for a week at the office of the Director-General of the VID.
After the government's decision to resign, Koljegova confirmed that he is still ready to become a VID leader.
However, a later change of mind - on Friday's presentation to the Finance Minister Danai Reizniecei-Ozolai says that they withdraw their consent to transfer to the VID management office and this does not make a easy choice for her.
The Prime Minister, Mr Kučinska, Secretary of the press, Andrew Vaivars, explained to the LETA agency that a new competition will be held at the office of the Deputy Director-General of the VID.
In the center of Riga, an accident occurred that involved a police car.
In the center of Riga this afternoon, a road traffic accident involving a State police car occurred.
The police car with the sound and light signals on the top of the category will arrive at the top of the road of the Barona and Dinnav Street.
The police explain the circumstances, but the initial information shows that the second force does not support the long police car.
In the event of a woman's injury.
This year the number of people living in Riga is reduced
At the beginning of this year, Riga had a population of 638,784, which was 0.34% less than in 2015, when the capital city officially registered 641,000 inhabitants, the LETA informed the Central Statistical Administration (CSP).
On the other hand, the number of inhabitants in Latvia is set at 30 places between the capital cities of the European Union (EU) and the large cities with more than one million inhabitants.
According to data from the EU statistical office Eurostat, Riga is the largest female figure - Latvia's capital is convinced first among European cities with 127 women per 100 men.
All three capital cities in the Baltic States are the largest number of women in Europe's largest cities: in Vienna they are 123, but in Tallinn 121 women are 100 men.
The warning icon will be displayed at LNMM.
In the next few days, at the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMM), warning signs will be posted - pictograms, by the agency LETA, the representative of the Department of Special Affairs of the Riga Council of the Republic of Riga.
At the present time, the rapid improvement of the museum's glass damage has been successfully achieved, resulting from its activities.
A warning pictogram will be displayed in the coming days.
They will tell the people that the snow is likely to be cold and snowy, so they must not be moved by cars, as well as by bicycles, wheelchairs and wheelchairs.
In this social network, Ušakovs also wrote about the "Facebook" that indicated that no security threats do not cause damage, but that "sees unaccompanied", and the "will be hit".
Saints for children and parents - New children's wheelchairs in Riga.
In this summer season, Riga’s municipality has set up two more new railway villages in the city, Cyprus and Chicago, which are now available to children.
A wide multifunctional rotary ship with various rolling elements, tiles, games, drums and slippers is installed on the Chipsala platform.
The root area is intended for all children of all ages.
The field also includes the elements of noise and various balance sheets.
The world of Fantasies complements the attractive location of small shipyards on the Daugava coast with a view to the port of passengers and the cruise ships seen there.
On the other hand, the game name, bats, step-by-step track, balance-by-step, spindles, rotary pumps and other game elements, as well as the Winning area with lines of power and coordination training, including sports elements.
The rubber thread is included in the soil in different colors.
Up to the wheeled field on the side of the street is a new, colourful set of armor.
The reconstructed route is open in the woods.
Minister of Transport Uldis Augustis, VAS Latvian State Roads (LVC) and the representatives of the building SIA "Binders" and local authorities have now opened the national main road border of Russia (Grebneva) - Rēzekne-Daugavpils-Lithuania (Medumi) (A13) from Medumi to Lithuania (156,4,163,05 km).
Roads are a national visit card, especially border roads, so a special pleasure is to discover a reconstruction step on the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of improving the situation on the main road in the country, thanks to the co-financing of the European Union funds.
"As the forecasts show, the available resources will be available for this planning period already in 2018, and we need to think about how to continue to maintain the most crowded cars in very good quality, and also to ensure the mobility of citizens throughout the Latvian regions without the financing of the European Union," said Uldis August, turning the symbolic plane.
The Minister of Transport also indicated that proposals prepared by traffic experts on sustainable financing for Latvia's roads will be presented to the Government in the near future.
Construction from Medumes to Lithuania's border (156,4,163,05. km) SIA Binders began to fall and continued this year after technological interruption.
Restructuring costs are EUR 13.5 million (including VAT), co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"In the reconstruction phase, the construction of the road has been fully restored and the next year the reconstruction work will begin in the next phase from Medumi to Daugavpilij itself, to this end all roads from Lithuania to Daugavpilj will be arranged," reported LVC's president, Janis Lange.
The main road in the country is most crowded, and by 2018 we plan to ensure that all main roads in the country are in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality, to ensure periodic maintenance and to replace asphalt with asphalt every 7-9 years.
"There will, of course, be a need for adequate funding, and all road users with hopes of meeting the proposals of the expert group for the planning of the road financing system," Lange noted.
The linkage and lighting of roads within the project in the Medume centre.
Substantive land operations have been carried out: four stages of large reforestation and extensive logging and harvesting work have been compared to road fire profile, which has so far been very unequal.
Public transport facilities are also restored and the newly built return area for public transport is restored.
In the past, there were insufficient capacity and the area of the relay was not visible because of the mountain tracks, as well as the old road along the common rail.
In the next construction season, it is planned to renew the road phase from the city border of Daugavpils until now the rebuilt stage (144,80,156,40 km).
This year the LVC plans to carry out various kinds of work more than 1100 kilometres of national road.
Information about all the repairs planned on the national road network this year is available on LVC’s website www.lvceli.lv.
"To achieve the desired results of weight reduction, it is very important to choose the right combination of food products," admitted Lithuanian Dietologist Laura Romeraite-Kuklierien.
In addition, it is easy to grow during the summer period when our own gardens produce fresh fruits, vegetables, and vegetables.
The combination of food products for the product concerned may help not only to reduce the weight of the waste but also to contribute to the various processes of the body.
Macarones and labels are a successful combination, as they provide long-term sense of taste and help fight fats.
The studies published in the European Clinical Food Journal have shown that the label has a positive effect on blood glucose and helps us to correct the worlds.
Keen peppers and proteins rich in food, such as poultry meat or protein cocktails, result not only in a taste of salt but also in a reduction in the food chain after large meals in the next eating season.
The combination of such foods can also increase by up to 35% after meals.
Studies show that Caina’s peppers can help relieve fat in the soil area.
Olu consists of a food-stimulating substance - Holin, but its pepper is a good source of vitamin C.
By taking sufficient amount of this food, cortisol levels may be reduced, including fat burning around the body's average.
The fruit of the grape must, for which fresh grains have been added, is another garden and fat burning potatoes for breakfast, which is worth including in your food card.
The tissue and the ovaries contain solvents that control the grelin - an appetite stimulated hormone - and thus the feeling of espresso.
In addition, the oils contain polyphenols, which are supportive in weight reduction and are not allowed to produce fat.
Fruits and proteins can also perform miracles in weight reduction.
Such a combination can create a sense of humor.
The fruit contains water and liquids and thus stimulates the taste of salt.
At the same time, the protein slows down the drying process and ensures that the salt feels for a longer time.
In the afternoon you can eat salads or prepare a protein cocktail from a ready mixture and enjoy it together with your favorite fruits.
Avoid combinations of products.
In plants there are cicures - monoharids or disacharides - one or two molecules compounds.
On the other hand, the wall in the gardens is a polysacharide.
Plants are divided into organic matter, but they are not chemically separated until they reach a third or fourth degree in the drying process.
The wall is divided into three different stages that are already in the mouth.
Therefore, it is important not to eat sweet food immediately after meals.
Eating salt food immediately after meals, it is "exploited" in the stomach with other foods where it is not chemically digested and begins to eat.
Do not eat meat, potatoes, vegetables, bananas, dates or other carbohydrates with lemons, juice, oranges, grapefruits, pineapples, pineapples, pineapple or other acids.
The enzyme ptaliline, which is present in the cells, is only active in the environment.
Plant acids stop not only the accumulation of carbohydrates but also the production of them.
Do not eat oils and meat, fats and meat, cheese and oil or cheese and cheeses, meat and milk, oil and milk or fats and milk and similar protein mixtures of rich products in one meal.
Their processing requires different strains, each with different strengths, characteristics and the time when they are to be reached in the stomach.
Bubous, honeymelon, muscatamelone and other melons should always be eaten separately from other foods.
Melons are not fermented if they are in the stomach with other food products.
fats in combination with protein-rich products.
Fats form a successful combination with hard, but they cannot be described as fats and proteins - fats stop the accumulation of proteins.
The protein can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If a large number of protein-containing products are consumed, avoid the full use of fat.
It is also related to sweating - it is not recommended to combine large quantities of fat (containing protein) with a whole avocado (containing fats).
This combination prevents effective weight reduction.
How can you prepare better?
"Earth preparation, thermal treatment causes a significant loss of nutrients - approximately 15% to 55% of the original ingredients of the products," says the Dietology.
In most cases, nutrients are lost by draining food into water.
However, the value of certain foodstuffs increases, which is to say, directly.
The remaining liquids are recommended to be used for the preparation of soups - in this case, you will not lose the nutrients left in the water and you will be able to dig them later.
It is recommended that fruit be prepared and cooked.
The thermal treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of the liquepan contained in tomatoes.
When tomatoes are turned into tomatoes for 30 minutes, the amount of lucopene increases by 25%.
Thermal treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of betacarotene found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, burcane, sweet potatoes and spinach.
The thermal treatment of wool and meat removes the natural properties of the proteins present, making them easier to digest.
Similarly, the treatment of meat and egg heat makes it easier to absorb iron and other mineral substances contained in these products in the body.
It should also be borne in mind that freezing of products may reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to 90%, but the freezing of solvent does not affect.
In combination with tomatoes, iron intake in the body can be increased, which provides better brain and muscle function.
Our body takes up to 33% less non-blooding iron, which is found in plant products such as apples, leaves, vegetable products, than blood-producing irons, which are present in animal national products such as beef, fish and butter.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-hazardous iron into the body by taking non-hazardous iron products with vitamin C sources, e.g. oranges, tomatoes and guinea pigs.
Vitamin C helps change the non-hazardous iron so that our body will absorb it more easily.
Iron is needed for the production of haemoglobin, which provides oxygen supply in the muscles and brains.
To obtain maximum benefit from salads, add healthy fats such as olives or linseed oil.
When preparing butter with lass, add vitamin D to the rich lasarium or sardines of a free yogurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium in the liver and plays an important role in bone formation.
Auses (as well as other filling products) together with vitamin C sources such as soils, opiums, avenes and other fruits or nuts help stabilize the level of cholesterol, and avoid arterial degradation.
Snapchat Anime’s Effect Crisitivity Crisitivity
Snapchat representatives say that this filter is an exciting animation, but some commentators claim that it is racistly insensitive.
With this downward effect Snapchat allows 150 million users every day to change reality in an absurd way and play with their identity.
You can turn yourself into ananas, a dog or a picture that will be captured in the forest of Roja Liechtenstein.
The bodies are mythical, image-breaking instruments that generate more than 30 million changes in loans per day.
Any error is quickly detected in public.
Snapchat has already been criticised by the fact that the application is popularizing too thin or light-faced skin tones as an ideal beauty standard.
This week, new effects were published, allowing users to create the appearance of the eyes, the eyes, and the wings, and some critics called it a racist austerity.
Similarly, the question was raised whether such contradictions do not show that the company has greater problems with diversity.
On the third day, news and public negation came to light when the expenditure “The Verge” and “Motherboard” indicated that the effects of the lease were removed from the application.
The company explained that the aim is to paint Anime pictures rather than to carve people from passion.
But people who have experienced racism have remembered these effects from painful stereotypes.
Other categorically denied equality with Anime.
From Korean American art student Greisas Sparapani Twitter's article on pictures has gained a wide range of reasonings. In an e-mail she notes that the effects are “sighing and inexhaustible, so as not to say more.”
She adds that it is difficult to detect the apparent similarity between Asian caricatures and lake effects.
This shows that the effect of the lightning is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face in the understanding of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has been included in these cultural fairs.
The American culture is also involved in the ongoing fight on diversity and inclusion, from business meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we use every day.
And Snapchat, a large audience of young people representing different races, unlike the elderly, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat reads creates an image that calls users, then "Today such things are not remembered," said 25-year-old Keitija zu on Thursday in an interview.
On the fourth day, Zhou, the manager of the Media Products Company, destroyed his Snapchat application and recommended that others do the same.
In her article "Media" and on the phone, she explained that she understood that the problems related to the race are due to the employment policy of Snapchat, which does not support the diversity of the race.
He criticized the company's leadership, which consists mainly of white men and then closed his article with a reference #DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there are no racial differences in the company, so such decisions are allowed. Either some other racial representatives are working in the company, but they do not take such an office in order to make their views safe and convenient," says American American from China.
She also agreed with others, but Snapchat did not respond to her complaint.
The company shall not disclose how many workers represent different races, indicating that it is a private enterprise.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of his staff, but his representative discovered that the company had hired a staff specialist who would concentrate on also representing racial minorities, which were not widely represented and would encourage inclusion in the company.
On the other hand, Zuu will not renew his Snapchat account, adding: "Interething, do they really need more users like us to understand that this is not right?"
The Congress has announced that military officials have amended reports on the State of Islam.
On the fourth day of the communication, the Congress stated that the representatives of the United States Central Volunteers had changed their reports by reflecting a much more optimistic response to the Islamic nation in Iraq and Syria than is true.
The analysis of the Central Appeals Service shows general dissatisfaction with the report of the Task Force Committee, the Committee on the Exploration and the Sub-Committee on the mission of the Sub-Committee for Protection, stating that their management has controlled reports on American progress in combating the Islamic State.
The central charity known as Centcom is a military base in Tampa, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest reports on this report indicate that the intelligence reports approved by senior commanders Centcom reflect the US's fight against terrorism more positively than is true.
The representative of the Republic of California, Kens Kalverts, says: "Centcom action is unacceptable - our soldiers are those who suffer if our policy makers receive false reports."
Centcom management errors are searched for in the senior management of the organisation.
This 10-page report is detailed in the analysis and analysis of the existing problems of the Athenian Central Prize for the preparation of Iraq's forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although this does not provide compelling evidence that the senior officials of the Obama administration had left the reports to be reduced, it shows that Centcom’s management has made a known pressure on analysts to represent a more optimistic view of the threats posed by the Islamic state (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report states that, in the first half of 2015, the release, announcements and reports of the Central Administration press presented the situation to Congress in a much more positive light than it was in fact.
For example, Centcom’s representatives publicly announced that the Mosul recovery operation could start in April or May 2015.
Mosul is the second largest city in Iraq, still under the control of the Islamic State.
In his report, Mr Pompeo, the representative of the Republican Party of Kansas, wrote: "The investigation for several months is clear."
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the main U.S. central administration officials have collected reports representing the ISIS's risks lower than they were actually.
The Republican Party established a working group, recognizing that the analysts were concerned that the information about the Islamic country was altered.
To continue the investigation, the report published on Thursday will follow new disclosures in this case.
The General Inspectorate of the Ministry of Defence shall conduct an investigation into the activities of the Centcom intelligence service.
On Thursday, members of the Committee on the Management of Investigations of the Democratic Party published their own report, in which they agreed with the conclusions of the Working Group of the Republican Party.
In his report, the Democratic Representative Adams B. Šifs wrote that from 2014 to 2015, Centcom had too limited the preparation of the results of the evaluations of the intelligence services related to the ISIS and the Iraqi Security Forces.
Mr Shifa explains that this process "stops the dissemination of information", has damaged the ethical of analytical work and "has spread facts that are not in harmony with the truth."
But the members of the Shifs and Democrat Party add that there is no evidence that the White House has put pressure on Centcom analysts to produce reports, according to the "pre-defined or political position".
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the Congress's investigation on Thursday.
In August, The New York Times reported that the general inspection of the Pentagon began an investigation on the complaints of Centcom analysts.
The representative of the Pentagon, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, announced that he would not comment on the report of the Congress until the investigation continued.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data in different ways, and the Ministry of Defence and the search management calls for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not limited to the question of whether the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement made by a growing representative of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year's allegations raise doubts as to whether President Obama can fully rely on the reports from the Central Administration on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hot points.
The criticism of Islam's invasion of the State recalls more than ten years ago when centcom's analyst published a study by Gregory Höker, claiming that the administration of the Bush began the war in Afghanistan, thinking too little about its possible consequences.
Hüker also played an important role in the opening up of the question of the question of the State of Islam.
Last year, the official representatives reported that the Hüker team discovered that contrary to public reports, air raids on the Islamic State oil industry did not significantly damage the financial situation of the terrorist group because they had built temporary industries to sell oil in the black market.
In the September issue, The Times reported that this disclosure did not occur outside the central management borders.
In the meantime, Commander General Loids Ostins III received criticism, as many legislators considered war reports to be too positive.
In April General Ostins withdrew and replaced General Joseph L. Votels.
In the US due to the British women's hockey field, the United States will win, thus gaining a fourth victory by order.
The day after victory over Japan with a result 6:1, the fourth day Keitia Bama won the first two words in the U.S. female hockey team, when the Americans won the Indian team with the result 3:0.
Five-word gains in two games are unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bama said that she could never remember what had ever happened to her.
She said, "I don't feel."
I'm not one of those people who count their names.
But she knows that the American result in the Olympics is 4:0, which gives them in their group no distinction with Britain, which will not be won on Thursday after victory over Japan with the result 2:0.
Britain and the United States will be on Saturday to play the last round in the first round of the games.
The two teams have already qualified for the fourth final and the game will only determine which team will take the first place in the six teams and which one will be the second.
The first winner will soon avoid meeting with the powerful Dutch team, which is the leader of the second group.
Although the six-day game will not be turned off, Americans have already called the wind a surprise, four years ago, in London, the last place between 12 teams.
There was also Bama in this command.
In his hometown of Bübele, the field hockey bride was first adopted by her at 3 years of age (her older twin sisters had already worked with this type of sport) and joined the national team when she was 16 years old, becoming the youngest player in history.
She did not attend the 2008 Olympic Games because she did not go to the end.
In 2012, however, she and her team failed.
In the following year, English - speaking trainers were appointed by Kreg Parham, and everything changed for good.
Bama called it "cultural, mental and physical changes."
In London, we did not earn as much work as we do now.
We've completely changed everything.
Four days in the game Bama discovered the result by getting the words in the first half with a backyard girl from nearby distance.
India's game began without winning in its account, but their choice was very smooth and held a minimum result 0:1 until the third period ended when Bama again gained words.
She introduced bombs to the enemy zone on the side of the field, then she pointed out to be on the middle of the field and to draw bombs in the hands of the enemy, pointing to the Americans at 2:0.
In the fourth half of the period, Melisa Gonzales won another prize.
This was the first game of the U.S. Watchman in the game of Jackie Brigas, each of the first three games to play in one.
She's in.
And also Bama.
"We're going very well now," said Paham, but how good it will show the game on Saturday.
The most delicious food for the period of depression is "Food-free"
In March 1933, shortly after the election of the President, Franklin Delano Rüzvelts sat in an oval room to stay in the kitchen.
President Ruzvelt was attracted by the delicateness of culinary delicateities such as the garden of zoos in the cave or the ruins of Merylenda.
But now her diet was a little more comfortable: full of oils in the tomatoes chamber, potatoes, and desert - flow bottle.
Jenina Ziegelmane says, "This is the way to solidify food preparation with people who wore very hard."
Her husband, Andrew Kou, adds: "It's also a message to the Americans how to eat."
The passage from the Brooklyn Heights area is a food historian.
Kou's last book "Birthing" describes Chinese cuisine in America, but Ziegelmane describes the life of his book "97 Abels" through the food house in the eastern part of Manhattan.
Their new joint work "Food malt," published by Harper on Tuesday, is a story of American food during the Great Depression.
Showing some solidarity in culinary, they held meals together with reporters Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, on a simple afternoon meal in the Flatron region and worked since 1929 when a major depression took place.
At 54 years of age, Ms. Ziegelmanes ordered butter with mixed cheese and olives, and 57 years of age Kou ordered salads, potatoes, and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered the fake pig, several recognized that his choice was very suitable for the conversation on the Great Depression meal .
Mrs. Ziegelmane told me that the fake son of a bitch was very popular.
There was an earthquake, a hailstorm, and an earthquake.
They were prepared from the basic ingredients and other ingredients that enriched the meals.
I thought it would be so many earthquakes that they'd be in the middle of the day.
Mr. Kou's new.
"It's almost as if the dog is full of pigs," he added.
In the pre-depression years, half-day American ships joined the Swedish fleet, particularly in rural areas.
Women were prepared to eat their men-workers and freshly prepared meals were presented in breakfasts, lunches and evenings.
During the first world war, the Americans sent food directly to the Europeans. The "Special malt" described how the Americans adapted to conditions when the Americas were suddenly no longer the land of plenty.
"At that time the meal became the main object of the American people's attention every day," said Mr. Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write directly on this subject.
It also became important for new budget diets: such unknown foods as fake dishes and snacks became everyday, drinking was "a great way to use surpluses," noted Ms. Ziegelmanes, as the dangers could hide undesirable ingredients under the harsh measures.
The fresh fruit was replaced by the slightly fragrant fruit.
The meat that had long been a major component of the American diet has now become an extremely rare luxury product.
During the time when the number of calories and food intake was more important than the noise, the young generation, the remains of the species.
How old is Mrs. Ziegelmane found recipes to prepare symphony filled with ground cream?
Mr Kou adds: "It was not a popular addition to the afternoon table."
Mrs. Zeegelmane points out, "It was serreal."
The groundnut butter and lip symphony are not compatible.
Many household meals were used in difficult times.
The economic operator of households such as Luise Stenlie, head of the Federal Economics Agency from 1923 to 1943, determined the state's food stocks that were not experienced before or after the Great Depression.
By publishing letters and recipes and magazines, they encouraged households to become "economicists" and to face challenges such as turning macaroni and burcanum into a delicious meal.
"The early Maltese" is a love of historical thought.
It is particularly interesting to see evidence of the government's attitude to its emerging citizens, for example, President Herbert Hüvera's "let me eat chicken".
Although he publicly told of his simple childhood and meal in Ai, he actually ate as a small millionaire, which he had become.
Mr. Kou says, "He liked European cuisine, for example, fish with a hair shirt."
He's eating almost in a crowded guest room, eating half a day's jacket.
He was completely discovered from reality.
President Rüzvelts would have made the same mistake unless his wife, Eleanor, advised him to set an example with her eating paradigms.
The book says that Rüzvelts hired a maid who did not learn to prepare to eat, so the White House became a place "where not only one of the most delicious meals was delivered in Washington, but also the worst prepared foods".
As soon as the national economy is back, most of the air culinary culinary of depression disappears.
But we continue to focus on calories and nutrition, as well as on how to apply science in culinary, Mrs Ziegelmanes added.
The story tells us that in writing, they gained a greater understanding of Mrs. Ziegelman’s mother’s eating patterns, such as why she could not eat outside.
"She really was afraid to eat outside," said Mr. Kou.
Mrs. Ziegelmane said, "She actually betrayed people."
Once there was an accident with the windshields.
When we were eating in Eisenberg's restaurant, a couple of writers came out of the room to prepare a dessert: a rain bottle that President Rüzvelts had to eat in the afternoon.
"It's a flow distortion," said Mrs. Ziegelmanes, adding that the entry for delicious foods was now distributed to give a short name.
It does not contain dust, only dried fluids, little flour, sugar, water and canals.
All were impatiently exposed to the carrots in the brown mass found on the liquids.
Surprisingly, it wasn't even that bad.
Mr. Kou has some more corn.
After listening to the experienced "economicist," he said to the woman, "The cut-off pile of vegetables."
Gilead receives reimbursement for legal expenditure in combating Merck on Hepatitis C patent
The district judge has decided that ‘Gilead Sciences Inc.’ is entitled to return the costs of legal services which he has paid in the case of the patent of Hepatitis C against the pharmaceutical company ‘Merck & Co Inc’.
In June, Gilead was fined with 200 million fines for two Merck patents, which threatened it with successful sovaldi and Harvoni tablets, when the U.S. federal judge found violations of Mark's operation, such as the threat of the transfer of wild animals and other non-ethnic activities.
On the fourth day of the trial, U.S. District Justice Beths Labson's Frimens stated that Gilead is entitled to claim compensation for the legal expenses incurred by it in this case.
Merck is trying to get positions on the market against Gilead, which dominates the market with new generation of Hepatitis C medicines, which are effective 90% in cases of liver disease.
The case had already begun in 2013, when Gilead and Merck offered each other ownership rights to the newly developed active component of sofosbuvir, which is the main component of Gilead medicine.
The US-supported forces claim that they have fully taken control of Manbidz's city from the Islamic State.
The US-supported forces have fully taken over the northern part of the city of Manbidz in the northern part of the country near the border of Turkey and the last soldiers of the Islamic State have left the city on Friday, the representative of the group announced.
Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are currently opening the city from the last enemy fighters who have not yet fled the city.
They have released more than 2,000 civilians who had been sent by the warlords, and the news agency Reuters told Charfan Darvis of the SDS' SDS' SDS military council.
"The city is now in full control of us and we are looking for warriors," he informed Reuters.
Clinton's income reached $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a share of 34.2 per cent of federal tax.
Hilaria Clinton published a 2015 tax declaration showing that the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party and her husband have earned $10.75 million this year and paid the federal tax rate by 34.2 per cent, respectively.
During 2015, Clinton has donated $1 million, mainly to its Clinton charity organization. Former President Bill Clinton has earned about $5.3 million by standing as a spy and former State Secretary, with $3 million from his work in the State Department published in collaboration with Simon & Schuster.
Clinton's election was published - U.S. Secretary of State Tims Keins and his wife Anna Holtone have published his tax declaration for the last 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hilaria Clinton and Tim Keins continue to define new financial transparency standards," said Klinton's partner, Jennifer Palmieri.
On the other hand, Donalds Tramps hides behind various employers and polls in order not to make promises to reveal his tax information.
The publication of tax information paid is recorded in practice for the candidates of the US President, but this is not required by law.
New York businessman Tramps and his attorneys have been audited by the State Revenue Service as a reason not to disclose tax information.
"Your go", in his Twitter entry, sent Ian Sams to Clinton's campaign partner about the tax information of the Democratic Party's candidate.
On Thursday, Trampa Special Adviser Michael Kohens informed the CNN that he would not allow Tramppa to publish tax information before the audit was completed.
Trampa criticism, including the candidate of the President of the Republical Party for 2012 Mits Romnij and other Republicans, argues that his refusal raises questions about his real ownership, the amount of his contributions and other business obligations, including his commitments with Russia.
Clinton entered the oil fire on Friday by publishing a video where several powerful Republicans asked Tramp to publish their tax information.
She returned to Michigan on Thursday during the economic discussion on this issue.
She announced her efforts: "He refuses to do what the other presidential candidates have done for decades."
Politico writes that in 1990 Tramps had paid very little or no taxes during two years, and on Friday, the author of the New York Times business shop wrote that many journalists and lawyers believe that nothing has changed.
The federal tax rates are an important issue for these presidential elections.
Clinton, in support of the Varena Bafeta proposal, popularizes the idea that every person who earns more than $1 million a year must pay tax at least 30 %.
This proposal is also supported by President Barak Obama.
During the last week of Clinton's uprising in Omaha, Nebraska, where his Berkshire Hataway conglomerate is also located, Bafets invited Tramp to exchange tax declarations.
Bafets said that he was also audited by the Revenue Service and Tramps was afraid of voters, not tax authorities.
The Clinton campaign has published tax information until 2007.
Clintoni now lives in Japan, New York and for the period 2007 to 2014 has paid the average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent and the total tax rate of approximately 40.5 per cent.
The 2015 Clinton tax report shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income is paid.
Their main investment was the low cost index fund from which Clinton received $109,000 in dividends.

Hebrew film director criticises the hotel in Berlin about the closure of Israel's telephone code after a request for war - RT News
The director of the Hebrew French films said in the wind in social media when he discovered that there was no Israeli telephone code available at the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin.
Clods Lancmans, documentary film director of the Holocaust Shoah, did not hide his discontent with the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel and sent an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During the recent visit, Lancmans tried to find the Israeli telephone codes in the hotel list offered.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries to which it can be referred directly from the hotel number.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel was destroyed and destroyed?
It's Lancmans.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol hotel offers to call this country through its call centre.
The director asked for an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lancman wrote that the answer received was "they were shocked."
The hotel administrator explained that "this is a well-known hotel management decision".
The reason for the removal of the code was even more confusing to the film director.
"Most of the guests are Arabs and they asked for the removal of Israel's code," Lancmans says another hotel worker's explanation.
Suddeutsche Zeitung writes that Israel's Ambassador to Germany Jakovs Hadas-Handelsman has been called a "great dog".
We're surprised and shocked about this incident.
It's the same thing about yourself and great beauty.
And the fact that this has happened directly in Germany, right on this hotel network is even greater.
There is no need for explanations.
Amatperson said: "We hope the hotel will make the right conclusions."
This event gained a pretty wide range of reasonings on the Internet, where people called it scandal.
Others believe that Kempinski's hotel is simply designed for Arabic customers.
Another entry sent "square", indicating that the hotel is located in Kurfurstendam street near the synagogue.
The issue of Der Spiegel reports that the hotel itself quickly rejected all the translations, declaring that it was all "responsibility" and apologized to Lancmana.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of national numbers," Suddeutsche Zeitung said to Kempinski.
And it adds that the code will be added to the list again.
The police use rubber and steel gas against protesting Brazilian students.
The student and police clash took place on Thursday in Sanpalu, Brazil, where students were protested against government education reform.
The police used rubber and steel gas against the students.
The problems began when the court tried to raise the students, as a result the police used rubber and steel gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to show their disapproval of the reform of the education system.
The proposal of Governor Geraldo Alckmina is to close almost 100 public schools, while 300,000 students will be transferred to other schools with a view to saving funds.
Some of the demonstrators marked the scene on the wall with messages against the former President Michael Temer.
This protest took place just a few days after the previous protest, when the students in the plenary demonstrations aimed at giving support to President Dilma Rosefia, who voted in favour of the imprisonment.
Skots Kelom Skinner ends first, bringing the British to the gold medal ring
Kelemus Skiners from Scotland finalized the first team of men riding in Rio, which took place last night. The British team won its champion title, which it won in the 2012 London Games.
The 23-year-old athlete from Glazgova played an important role in these events by making a nice legendary suit of Seru Krishu Hoju and choosing a victory for New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won a surprising victory when Hoys defeated five of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they did it again at the World Championship in London, even though Hoys had already finished his sport career.
The problems were at a stage between Beijing and London Olympics, as experienced beginner James Stafu came to replace.
It's been done for them the last time.
When Hoys left, he tried to fill his place with Kian Emadi and Mets Krampton.
The British coaches were hoping for Skinner to see the potential he later demonstrated.
Hindi, Kenya - champions who started with Hoju and Skinner four years ago, who installed the Olympic Qualification Record, but the best start was the New Zealand team
However, the British trio gained gold medals.
After the Hindus were in their midst, Kenys took the lead, and Skinner took the lead.
The change of the strategy played an important role in the victory, as Hindus traveled with greater flexibility to allow Kenya and, in particular, Skinner to move faster.
Hoys observed the conversation as a BBC representative and cut off the eyes of Skinner, Kenya and Hindus as they climb onto a beautiful pedagogue.
The 23-year-old glaucoma said, "It was an inevitable betrayal."
I do everything to protect my name.
We finally installed the Olympics and won the World Championships.
That was just incredible.
There's no better victory.
After winning with Kenya and Hoju in 2012 in the Olympic Games in London, Hindus realized that the races had fallen on track after a failed start.
Later, he reiterated this comment and British competitors were not able to prove the opposite.
There was no such incident right now.
Hindus said: "The British flag in the tribals called London to mind."
During the last three months, we have become a chained team.
We have lost so many World Championships, so the victory in the Olympics really was special.
One medal will meet a country that has won seven of the ten gold medals for riding in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is a team progress indicator over the last five months, the next five days will be very exciting.
In view of Kenya’s outcome, he could indeed resume Hoja’s achievements by acquiring three Olympic gold medals.
Kenya would mean six refined gold medals and one silver medal. Kenya is also born on March 23 (it is considered to be a British holy date because this day has also been born Steve Regreivs, Mo Farahs and Rodgers Banisters).
At this date, Hoys is also born.
The next lines in Kenya are the pressure that starts today and will continue for the next three days.
A 28-year-old athlete from Bolton said: "Now I'm just going to test it.
The team's journey is always the best.
Because then you can win with the team members.
If you're honest, then winning one is a little lonely."
He said, "If he gets two more gold medals, he should be picked up by the army."
That day it was the only war on medals, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sers Bredlijs Vigins, Eds Klensijs, Steve Burks and Owens Douls showed the fastest-ranking time for four kilometres in attendance.
His time was 3:51.943
The World Record, which was installed in London in 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final will take place today on the second side of the day where Vigins will certainly be in the centre of attention.
He was not in contact with the Commissioner until yesterday before his qualifying journey, when the judges called him to measure his growth.
In the women's journey that will continue and end today, Laura Trota, Joanna Rovsela Shand, Elinor Barker and Keitija Archibalda from Milgavia installed a new record 4:13.260.
The British delegation hopes that the British Rising Team, hoping for a medal in the middle of the Olympic Games.
In view of the outstanding and unprecedented supply in Beijing and London, all expect the same accomplishments as Rio.
In the meantime, there have been a variety of complaints about sex and respect, technical director Shane Satons, and Hoys and Victoria Bendletona have also finished their career.
However, starting with the first rounds, it seems that Britain will always reach the highest level in real time.
The future of Portland's coastal village is unclear because the ambitious contract has been terminated.
The future of its employees in Portland has become unclear in the light of the fact that its main client's energy company has announced the cessation of cooperation.
This Communication is based on the Victorian Government's plan to halt the subsidisation of an energy company, which is essential to enable the company to continue its work.
The 20-year subsidy will be suspended in November.
Thus, more than 2000 Alkoa Portland industry jobs are at risk.
The risks could be both direct and indirect jobs up to 2000.
In addition, there will also be unplanned side effects, as the greenhouse gas consumption is about 10 per cent of all Victoria’s electricity supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the bridge to Point Henry, which led to the interruption of the operation of the English power station.
Alcoa Portland has been working with losses and can be closed.
These events have resulted in several years of speculation about Australia's dollar value recovery and industry production costs.
The energy supplier of the plant "AGL", who supplies energy from its Loy Yang A power station in Latroubes Iele, says that the other three owners are likely to cancel their contracts.
Most of the power stations belong to Alcoa and Alumia, as well as parts of the company are also owned by the companies of the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubine Corp holding companies.
"AGL" hopes for the continuation of the work of the Portland industry, which would mean the next energy supply pipeline," said its representative.
‘AGL’ stated that the contracts are the so-called ‘risk-limited contracts’ which are intended to enter into force from November 2016.
The agreements have a 12-month period of validity and will therefore be valid until 2017.
"AGL" plans to receive revenue from these contracts also in the fiscal year 2017," said the company's representative.
Since the fiscal year 2018, the potential impact on profits has been limited by a favourable market forecast with regard to the wholesale prices of electricity in the future.
"AGL" claims that in its forecasts losses have already been calculated at $187 million , provided that these contracts will be terminated.
Alcoa submits that the decision to conclude contracts will not affect Alcoa's ability to continue or to supply energy to it.
The US company writes that in 2010 it concluded a contract with Loy Yang for 20 years, but it will be terminated in November.
The analysts have expressed concern about the possible closure of the Portland castle in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago industry shortly from New York to the weak economy.
Last week, Executive Director Stevens Mikelson said that 600 megawatts and 900 megawatts were used during the Portland year after analysis.
If both industries are driven from the energy market, the demand for energy will be significantly reduced.
And that wouldn't be good enough.
The Community legal centre hates 160 000 people every year.
More than 160 000 people are rejected every year, and a reduction in the budget could make the situation worse.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, defenseless workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to fight illegal exploitation are denied free legal assistance and representation.
The Community legal centre, which is already overloaded, warns that reducing funding will only make the situation worse.
Since next June, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than so far.
Director of the Legal Centre of Queensland, James Farels, said that the latest report of the National Legal Centres Association reports that legal aid is now denied to thousands of people who need it.
Mr Farel pointed out that if this decision was not rejected, the situation would only get worse.
He also said: "The Chinese legal centre has always received insufficient funding, which means that the aid is given to thousands of people who need it."
People who are trying to end violent relationships, people with deep debt, families with divorce, workers who are unjustly released - all these people have legal problems and this report shows that they do not receive the help they need.
Since June 2017, the federal government has reduced funding by 30 per cent, meaning that more than a thousand people in Queensland will have to solve their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Attorney-General and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to stop the reduction of funding immediately so that those in need of legal assistance can get it.
Last year, the Government opened its plans to establish a level of legal aid up to the national average.
It is now time to pay attention to the needs of the local communities and their customers and the Palestinian Government to invest in this important area.
Donalda Trampa campaign was filed in court because one of the employees was fired by a gun
New York: Donalda Trampa campaign organizers have been brought before the court because they have not done so by receiving information that their commander of the North Karolin Operation will turn a gun against an employee when they have been on a single car in February.
This incident was described in the court's request by the court of Charlotte on the third day, by Vincent Boroni - former campaign programmer.
Boroni said that he had waited for months for an internal examination of the case to be initiated, but the understanding that this would not happen.
Director Árls Filips "takes off the gun, puts his good indicator shop on the back and lifts a stop against Vincenta road", Boroni claims in his complaint.
He also claimed that by submitting complaints to the local and regional campaign management, Boroni knew that at least four people had experienced the same thing.
"The weapons don't have to come out to cause damage," Boroni wrote in his complaint.
Only two days before the submission of this case, the candidate of the Republican party to the President's office had caused a scandal by informing people that "The People of the Second Amendment", i.e. the owners of arms and enthusiasm, would be able to do so if the election had been won by his chance of Hilary Clinton and his elected judges.
The representatives of the trampa campaign announced that the media had expressed their words from the context, and he had never resorted to violence.
Boroni, with his request, wishes to provide compensation from the campaign organizers for the abuse of surveillance, but from the Philippines - for the use of an unauthorized weapon and for the creation of emotional stress.
The representative of the trampa Houpa Hixa did not comment immediately.
You haven't been able to contact Philips.
WCCB - Charlotte's local news agency reports that Philip has recently launched a campaign.
Nor has he been able to introduce his consulting firm "Innovative Consulting Services".
The presidential candidate for the Republican Party, Donald Tramps, has carried out a controversial election campaign.

New tradition - holiday and sport holidays in Külcie.
On Saturday in Külciet for the first time, the crowds flocked to the festivals of the past and the sport.
Ten years after the celebration, Ezra was decided to cease the festival.
The new page is now split.
The day began with sports competitions.
This time the competition was not traditional and too serious because, for example, the shootings had to be done for a restful purpose, the bird flew, with a man's left hand, the "bubbleing" was not in any Olympic game at all.
However, each participant was able to show how strong, courageous, and dependable he was.
After the game, all the moments of freedom began at the end of the day.
At the same time, the "children's noise" was also working, where little could get out of the attractive attractions and get new pictures in the giraffe.
The youth who could also become a tradition was a display of bicycles, in which both tractors and motorcycles were given.
Inga Kadikoe-Skadinja, head of the ancient administration of Küłciema, who had chosen a nice rest and dry time, had all talked about things, however, but it was not able to cause much trouble.
The festival continued with the greeting of the newest people in Külciema.
It's really good that the old man has added five girls and one girl.
A more ambitious collection from the Engueres novada has been presented with the advantages of the "Rudens rhythm", the performance of the various peoples' "Red" and the performance of the young dancers "Zelta Pearls".
And it's nothing that happened to someone in the dark view.
Of course, local poets and poets were pleased to have a famous actor, Janis Jaráns and Danis Porgant, who was once again Mildian Nabin and Clearerite Krānī, as well as the attractive women of Bárzciema from the fishing seat "Dienjas".
Balli played the Bruggis team.
The British must maintain the Olympic spirit and expand Hitrova.
Hétrova will not only promote well-being and growth in the local regions and London but also throughout the country.
This, in my opinion, makes Hitrov very attractive, just like in 2012 in London, where we have invested a great deal of work to get all the national regions from the Olympic Games .
Stratford and Istenda gained a great deal from the Olympics.
And we will do so again by providing local citizens and businesses with business opportunities close to Hitrov.
In local communities, we will only create 10,000 new business opportunities, 40,000 new jobs, and finally add a point to the young unemployed in the Hitrov area.
As in the 2012 London Olympics, there will be people who will now feel that this challenge is too big and that the expansion of Hitrov is too ambitious.
On that occasion, people said that Britain would never be able to prepare for the Olympics and that it would be a global catastrophe.
In 2012 and in the case of Hitrov, they were not right.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Hitruva has so far overcome all of them.
Like the Olympic Games, Hitrova is an infrastructure project that will benefit the whole society, not individual individuals.
The expansion is possible to create up to 180 000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating soil for both employment and experience in this airport and throughout Britain.
In the hitro there is a great team that has created an investment programme of 11 billion yards worth of infrastructure, including in time and budget, starting with terminal 5, which has been called five years from the spot as the best airport terminal in the world and ending with terminal 2, which has been built between two more intensive flights in the world.
Now they are ready to set up a third race, which will be financed by private investment in the amount of 16 billion slots.
The 2012 London Olympic Games were a great success, and I am convinced that it will also be the expansion of Hitrov.
It is time to relive the Olympics and expand Hitrove by ensuring our future of trade and creating a new employment environment with which Britain could be pleased.
Lords Paul Deiton is a member of the Governing Council of Hítrova and former Secretary of Trade of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
In Switzerland, a woman will climb up a ladder, trying to commit suicide.
In the middle of the night, he's lying on his bed.
The police are trying to find witnesses for the accident when about four o'clock in the morning, they drove her across several cars.
The accident took place on Thursday after midnight on the A1 road near the city of Vo Canton in the city of Morges.
The Canton police report said that the woman was trying to commit suicide in an effort to get her to the dark side of the road where several machines were collected.
Of course, trying to push yourself, kids, 49 years of age, collected several machines, including a heavy machine.
She died at the scene.
Several of the drivers involved in the incident have already given evidence, but the other involved have not yet been identified, says the police calling on the drivers involved and the witnesses to the accident.
In the case of a criminal investigation, which in this case is a logical step, Le Tribune de Geneve sent the lawyer Gilles Hofstellers.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid tension?
Hofstellers says, "It's a noscaider prosecutor."
Two similar cases that have occurred over the last five years show that none of the drivers will be called upon to respond.
In both cases, the passenger night had gone out on the highway, so it was decided that car drivers could not be expected to find a passenger, a letter.
Last year, a police officer was sentenced to a life sentence after he had been shot by a man lying on the A1 road near Paijerne in August 2014.
The court found that the 22 - year - old victim was drunk and later found himself on the road.
The court concluded that the police officer who was on the road to the accident carried out the situation in an appropriate manner and the judge acknowledged that the man listening to the road was "a completely inexplicable and extraordinary case".
Anyone who has information about the accident on Thursday is invited to contact the police by telephone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
On the Internet, they collect signatures for the award of a new VID leader.
The opening of the application portal "Avaaz.org" opened the selection of signatures for the award of a new Head of State Revenue Service (VID) for the award of tender.
The request addressed to the Ministers of the National Union (NA) and the Green and Agricultural Union (ZZS) indicates that the society wants a cross-border and professional staffing process.
The petition was drawn up on 10 August and is currently signed by 55 people.
The opinion of the Director-General of the VID is inconceivable and non-professional.
This brings to mind the best traditions of the Council's staff of the Union.
It discredits public administration and makes society look forward to government and politics.
"There is a need for a competition with clear criteria to be assessed by all candidates," the letter's petition text.
Its author, Jánis B., pointed out that the public is not aware of the criteria as chosen by Kolígova.
In addition, it is not clear what candidates are invited to do in the work of the VID.
The request indicates that the State Chancellor should create a new, open tender in which professional candidates are actively interviewed, staff experts are involved and a suitable remuneration is offered.
The Minister of Finance, Dana Reiznieces-Osola, officially addressed the College's VID director's office last week, and this week he was scheduled to be approved in the new office, but all Party Ministers voted against, so the issue of the week was left.
Samuel: If we lose, then I won the worst.
Pludmal volleyballists Aleksandr Samoilovs and Janis Šmēdinš were looking forward to the glorious Riodzejaneiro in the Olympics, but, unlike them, there is no difference where the competition ends after the tournament came out of Samoilov.
One of the world's most powerful soccer volleyballs in the final and decisive game of the nine-fourth-day subgroup tournament with 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) lost Brazilians Evans Gonsalveša Oliveir and Pedro Solberg Salgad, completing their participation in the four-year sports forum.
The three subgroups won one victory for Latvian athletes, but the same was the same with two others.
Three too small points were further listed, which was the best for Latvia, after the loss of the most convincing loss in this port.
"In the first set we were in charge, but from 16:15 it also remained at 16 points," recalled Shmeedinz.
I don't even know how the rest of the set remains without points.
It must not be played.
After that, the second set was in order and the set ended up playing, and it also had to be a good foundation for the third set.
This is similar, but only one team will grow after the parties have been replaced.
We had too many mistakes in the attack.
In the subgroup, all teams were similar, almost all of them had three seats, so small points were important.
"I wanted to play more like this, rather than give 3-4 points back in order," said the athlete.
We knew Evandru could be observed.
"In the first set to meet with them at the end, the second to two points, but the third to +4 has already bought him a game," recalled Shmeedins.
We tried to show the best game.
It's time. It's time. It's time.
The situation of the co-assessment before the match was not seen, but it was known that more small points were needed as far as possible.
"If we lose, then I won bad," said Samuel.
From Evandr, we looked forward to a good service and, with it, at the first sessions, was quite good at the end, but the third was open to the service and it was difficult to produce an attack.
However, I took many wrongs directly from the Pedrus, but I had to end up doing so.
Samuel told me that the opposite was not the case with the athletes today.
"We went, we played, we also had protection, but we needed better service," said the athlete.
"They played well and finally reached the Urra."
Before the tournament, I had just said that the exhibition was the most unlikely.
We had the chance to fight for the first place, but we didn't even get out of the group.
"All of us were waiting for medals and we were also from ourselves, but then there was no difference - 25th or fourth place," said Samuel, who predicted that the present will continue to play together in the future as well.
I think that the issue will not be and we will continue to play together, because this is just one tournament.
Samolilav Riodezáneiro was already in the third Olympics career, as he started in Beijing in 2008, but he played with Ruslan Sorokina four years ago in London.
As long as Shmeedy was the second start in the Olympics.
Latvenergo follows the process of opening the gas market from the potential market position.
The national energy company "Latvenergo" followed the process of opening the gas market both from consumer and potential trader positions, said Secretary of the company, Ivita Bidere.
"The decision on whether the future "Latvenergo" gas market will also be joined as a trader will determine what model of the gas market and the legal framework will be established."
"We are therefore actively involved in the creation and commentation of legislative acts on our part, as well as in the submission of our proposals," Bidere said.
BNS has already written that the Ministry of Economic Affairs (EM) has, in cooperation with the Commission for the Regulation of Public Services and the Energy Company of Latvia, developed the draft Regulations of the Ministry of the Office of Natural Gas Trade and Use, which will change the principles of the functioning of the natural gas market, from 3 April 2017 to ensure that natural gas users are free to choose the natural gas dealer.
In developing a new natural gas market regulation, the EM aim is to make the natural gas trading process as simple as possible and understand the user.
As the most efficient and user-friendly service option, the "marketer's central model" has been selected, in which all activities related to customer service are provided by the trader - one contract, one account and one information and one place of service for customers, by leaving the technical issues of the natural gas distribution system.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in electricity trade.
We remember that the opening up of a step-by-step market for households - also after 3 April 2017 for those households who do not wish to select another natural gas trader will be able to continue to receive natural gas from the existing trader at a regulated price, thus becoming related users.
"In such a case, the obligation to supply natural gas-related users at a regulated price is set for a public trader," the Ministry informed.
However, traders will have to choose a natural gas trader to conclude a natural gas trade agreement.
Until the conclusion of the natural gas trade agreement, the trade in natural gas for a certain period of time will provide the original natural gas trader with a fixed price.
The draft rules of the Cabinet of Ministers discussed the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and user.
The rules shall lay down the arrangements for the supply and suspension of natural gas to users, the safety requirements of the natural gas system, the trader, the public operator, the operator, the operator and the gas-based object owner's rights and obligations in the supply and use of natural gas; the arrangements to be made for the provision of the services received, the percentage of derogations, the marketing arrangements for the supply of natural gas and the supply of users; the procedure for which the supply of natural gas is provided by the public operator.

Minister of Finance Dana Reiznice-Ozola (Green and Agriculture Union (ZZS)) is planning to discuss with Prime Minister Mári Kučinski (ZZS) and government coalition partners on the increase in the remuneration of the State Revenue Service (VID).
On Friday, the Journalists pointed out that the issue of increasing the remuneration of the VID Director-General must be addressed promptly in order to make this matter more attractive to the bidders.
The following week we will also talk about the change in the terms of the tender.
The Minister also stressed that she did not think of any specific candidate to be called to appeal to the vacancy office.
At the same time, Reiznice-Ozola expressed the view that the Head of State Environment Service Inga Kolígova would be a good VID Director-General.
On the other hand, with regard to the current VID manager's duties, Daci Peléko, who expressed his willingness to appeal to this office, the Minister reiterated the view that the new VID Director-General should be "visible" and should not come from the VID structure.
She also stressed that it would be expected that Saeima would return from his leave to move as soon as possible the amendments to the laws necessary for the VID reorganisation.

Koljegova also pointed out that the discussion of her candidate has increased among the opposing coalition parties that are also unacceptable.
It was also reported that the former Director General of the VID was leaving office at the end of June.
Oil prices continue to rise; increasing the price of beer in the US and Europe, as well as the value of US dollars.
Oil prices in the world continue to grow early Friday morning, with the positive impact of investors' claims on the statements of the South Arab Minister for Oil Affairs, which reinforces the hope that the largest oil recipient countries will take action at the forthcoming OPEC meeting in September to stabilize the world's oil market.
On Thursday, the three main U.S. bureaucratic index reached a record level which had not been observed since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the high price of oil and the strong financial indicators of several large companies.
The increase in oil prices and the strong financial indicators of several companies were also the reason for the increase in the European beer index.
The US dollar value is increased on Thursday with regard to the euro, the UK flag and the Japanese flag.
In New York’s electronic trade market, the WTI brand of raw oil supplies increased by $1.78 to $43,49 per barrel on Thursday.

The sales of the preserved "Green lamuna" are only 33.8% low.
The sales of the preserved "Green stock" alone amounted to €4,202 million, which is 33.8% less than years ago, while the company’s losses decreased 5.7 times - up to EUR 904.7 thousand, shows the annual financial report published on the Lursoft database.
The company’s management report states that in 2015 the company was working on losses incurred for several reasons, including the permanent loss of funds due to the withdrawal of the Unicredit Bank from the Baltic market by interrupting the existing credit line and leaving the Zilo Laguna with concluded contracts unimplemented.
Consequently, the company did not have sufficient means to purchase lower materials in large quantities and to obtain a discount.
The withdrawal of the bank concerned from the Latvian market also led the company to implement projects of support from the European Union Structural Funds which would allow the production of new production equipment and modernise the infrastructure.
In addition, the company’s financial producers had a negative impact on the price of raw materials during the year in question and the customer’s refusal to pay more than the product produced by the company.
"Only on the second half of July 2016 did customers recognize price changes and were ready to buy goods for new - higher prices," the company’s manager said.
In 2015 the Green Laden also started discussions with potential investors, including an assessment of the company’s movements and non-exchanged assets.
Investors have already been at the company's largest creditor, Unicredit Leasing, where the parties have known and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company’s activities and development had a positive impact on the implementation of the restructuring and optimisation plan launched in 2014 and 2015.
This plan included the improvement and optimisation of technological processes, enabling greater production productivity and capacity.
"A number of equipment has been purchased to ensure a greater speed of production," the company’s manager said.
The management of the Green Laden notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the company to carry out orders that have not been possible so far.
The first batch of production to be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
Since the supply protocol for the sale of the product has already been signed, all products will be sold in accordance with the supply protocols.
The new product will increase turnover by around 300 thousand euro per month," the company’s management indicated.
In August 2016 the company plans to sign a cooperation agreement on the supply of fish production to Iraq.
In 2016 the Green Law has sent the first experimental container to Israel, extending the market to Cyprus and will sign a cooperation agreement with the new U.S. wholesale chain this September.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase its turnover.
In 2014, the Green Layer worked with EUR 6,347 million and EUR 5,113 million.
The Green Laden is built in 1997 and its core capital is EUR 1,156 million.
The company belongs to two Latvian private persons - Mihalam Kaidanova (89.11%) and Igora Shiršona (10.89%).
Welcome to the museum at 15 p.m. to wait for a movie of Záru Leanderi and participate in a press conference.
Riga can be viewed as a divine movie of the beginning of the career of Záras Leanderes and the city of inspiration.
In 1924, Zára Lander's ordeal at the Krastmat Ruth, who was a Swedish messenger in Latvia, was judged to be legitimate because she had just discovered to Zára Lander's wife an unusual low contrast, which she tried to debate at the Riga theater.
Perhaps the unsound sense of taste in Riga has become a legitimate focus on the Creator’s creative way against the world’s glory.
Riga Zárai Leanderi was associated with the warm memories, and she hoped to return to the neighborhoods of Riga, but unfortunately these hopes were not fulfilled because the Second World War began.
Using the form of the exhibition, this meeting will be possible at Riga Christmas 2016 and will be attended by the great Ieva Kerēvica in the excellent role of Zaras Leanderes.

Explosion in the park of England has been a sexual attack on two children.
The police in the city of Bergshire are looking for an attacker who has been sexually abused by two six-year-old girls in the Legoland park, says Daily Mail.

The man was unknown to girls, white skin colors, and about 20 years old.
The Kurds activists are taking over the building of the German public radio organisation.
On Thursday evening, a large group of 30 people arrived at the WDR building in Diseldorf, where they held a protest for almost two hours, reported to the German police.
The demonstrators, accompanied by the adopted posters, were excavated by various rumors, trying to draw attention to the current situation in Turkey.
The staff shall report that the demonstration has been carried out peacefully and the protestors at the end of the employee's request have voluntarily left.
The insurer shall pay compensation to passengers on the third day of departure from the airport.
If the insurance has paid a travel insurance fee to a family on Wednesday, on 10 August, Riga Airport withdrew from the proposed music festival.
On 11 August, If Insurance received an application for compensation from a client.
The family had planned to go to the music festival in Belgium, but since it was not possible on the third day because of the airport’s flight, the customer was charged with a night reservation that could no longer be cancelled, as well as with the tickets purchased for the festival at EUR 204.
On the other hand, the money spent on car tickets has promised to pay off the airline.
If Insurance of all travel insurance payments is averaged by 15%, the compensation for the suspension or cancellation of the travel has been paid.
"In such cases expenses are paid for the purchase, payment or exchange of tickets, as well as for the reservation of the overnight home," says Dagnia Rutka, director of the insurance product.
As we know, on August 10th, due to the technical problems of the Riga airport, a private plane stopped, so only several flight flights were cancelled, but several incoming flights came to the other airports.
Because of the family’s repairs, a man is forced to move to a broken roof and has to leave the house.
In the case of LTV "4.study", Dmitry Saidjašev, whose neighbor started a capital repair in his home, and since then Dmitria has been in a state of shock and is not sure that staying in the apartment is safe.
The problem is that my neighbors did volunteer construction and my apartment was damaged.
Then I informed the Riga building administration, the house manager and other organisations.
The Bureau said that we are not an operational service and that we have no expert.
"The owner of the village must go to the Latvian Engineering Union, and there will be an expert from the possession," says Dmitry.
The expert invited came out, confirmed what had happened and realized that the surplus was inconsistency.
However, since the first month of Dmitria's presentation, it has been in the building, and by the beginning of this week, it has not been able to answer that there is no risk to life in the apartment.
In the building, you said - it's legal, wait if you're not satisfied, write it in order.
"Then I wrote to Riga's mind, but they sent it to the house manager, then the house manager went back to the building, and then he's on the road," says Dmitry.
After all the examination of the paper’s hair, it is clear that the construction work has been stopped, although it can be heard at any time that someone is working there.
In another two-month period, an expert must be present and within six months the owner of the apartment, who is doing repair work, must avoid all these deficiencies.
The independent expert has drawn up his opinion, but the building is considered to be incomplete and excessive.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal regime in this transport structure has been affected, so there is no doubt that a threat to the owner of the lower dwelling is posed.
"That is why we have asked for further clarification from this expert," says Ilze Züka, representative of the city building of Riga.
Despite the ban on any repair work in the upper room, it is still heard that the building will continue.
The fine for voluntary construction without building permits is from EUR 70 to EUR 700, but in a particular case the penalty may be even more favourable.
While the expert opinion is expected, the building government has decided that both apartments should not be operated - both in which the construction is carried out and in Dmitria.
"This is not a case in the construction practice where, in this way, the citizens may have created a threat not only to their property but also to the owner of the lower property, as a result, the owner cannot operate his property," the representative of the building.
Now Dmitria remains looking for another place to live - with radios, friends, hotels, or rent another apartment.
But the losses caused by Dmitry can try to get away from a neighbor’s civil justice system, which may take a lot of time.
Because of the construction of the buildings, living in both houses is now prohibited until the builder brings his lock, and it can be expected for three weeks.
The losses incurred will have to be borne by the owner of the apartment in which the repair has taken place.
The owner of this apartment has not taken into account what is said by the building and has been in danger of being arrested for a period of up to six months.
Take it now!
How many lions in this picture?
The correct answer is five.

The conversion of the former Khmer Senate to five-star hotels will cost EUR 22 million.
The former Chemero Sanatorium for the five-week Park Hotel Čemeri will pay EUR 22 million, and the agency will tell the next hotel manager, SIA "Park Hotel Čemeri", represented by Gita Želve.
The establishment of the hotel is the first phase of the restoration of the former Senate of Chemera.
The second stage will be "wellness" or a well-being clinic planned to be opened in 2022 until the hotel opening is scheduled for May 2018.
Jelve notes that the cost of accurate clinics is not yet known.
However, she points out that it will be found in the former Chemmer Square polyline building, which has an area of about 12,000 square meters.
The clinic will be located in three locations.
Park Hotel Čemeri and the proposed clinic owner is an international fund "G Capital Europe", which invests in European assets.
The owners of G Capital Europe are several investors who invest in this fund, says Želve.
As Executive Director of G Capital Europe said earlier, George Jones planned to invest between EUR 12 and EUR 15 million in the existing framework, total investment of more than EUR 30 million.
It has already been reported that in the restoration of the cultural park more than 42 hectares, in the restoration of roads and roads, in the construction of an interactive nature tourism facility, in the improvement of the territory and in the construction of the road of Emila Darzin, which will contribute to the social development and growth of the city of Jūrmala, the Maritime Council plans to attract EUR 14.5 million from the funds of the European Union, co-financed with EUR three to four million.
The design work planned by mid-2017, but construction and planning work will begin in the next autumn of 2017.
As reported, the historical sanatorium complex "Kemeri" is designed to create a five-week hotel "Park Hotel Čemeri" and "wellness" or a well-known clinic.
However, the reconstruction continued.
However, the 2010 report also claimed that "Ominais" regularly communicates with the hotel operator "Kempinski", who continues to provide daily technical control in the "Kemeri" sanatorium, and has already decided to "complete the construction of the existing "Kemeri" hotels" and immediately start preparations for the opening of the Kempinski chain.
In October 2014, the "Park Hotel Čemeri" was declared to be a non-profit holiday for a group of Chemeri property belonging to the taxable "Ominais Latvia" in the island, but a month later the island was recognised as a non-profit because the winner had not paid for the purchase at a certain time.
The sales price was determined according to the latest unlisted auction rate - €2.86 million.
As an agency, LETA informed the city council representative Ieva Aile, the municipality, signing the protocol, has confirmed that with the support of the European Union Structural Funds co-financed infrastructure - the restoration of the historic Chemmer Park, the establishment of an interactive nature tourism object, the establishment of roads and parking spaces.

Former NATO Commander Bridlov's e-mail was heard by Russian hackers.
Hackers, who hosted the U.S. National Committee of Democrats (DNC) computers, may have carried out several other cyber attacks, also listened to the mail of former NATO commander Filipa Bridlov and George Sorosa's "Open Society" servers on Thursday by the business news agency Bloomberg.
Hacker's information was published on the website "DCLeaks.com".
The list and information on the work of the Sorosa Institute are also included there.
The hackers have been available for a full year.
According to Bloomberg, these cyber attacks were carried out by the same hackers related to Russian spies who heard the DNC e-mails.
The newspaper "The Wall Street Journal" also reports that the U.S. administration of Baraka Obama is currently considering the issue of the establishment of new sanctions for Russia by reacting to the detonation of DNA computers.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration will have an official cyberattack for democratic party servers to be accused of hackers supported by Russia or the Russian authorities.
As reported, the website WikiLeaks published about 20,000 e-mails received from the DNC computer system in July, and of which it is clear that the leaders of the Democratic Party have tried to harm the party's candidates, the former chancellor of Vermont's campaign, Bernija Sanders, to begin the election of President.
As reported by the U.S. press, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which conducts the investigation of democracies, as well as other US specialists, believes that Russia's commitment to cyber-absorption is beyond doubt.
Makartnijs: Joko Ono's presence threatened "The Beatles".
Paul Makartnies acknowledged that the presence of Joko Ono created a sense of danger to the legendary group "The Beatles".
At 74 years of age, the obstetrician now maintains a "bad" relationship with the rare John Lenona, but while his dose group was in the study, Makartnia was afraid because Ono was the only woman among the group members - George Harrison, Ringo Star, Lenona and Makartnia.
When the singer asked about the relationship, he said to Rolling Stone magazine, "That's really good."
We're still in danger.
While we were recording, she sat on the strengtheners.
Most groups could not bear this.
We were able to do this, but not quite successful, because we were very upset.
We were not afraid of sexists, but the girls usually didn't come to the studio, so they let us work.
When John started meeting Joko, he was not sitting in the control room, but in the middle of the four of us.
The author of the "Yellow Submarine" also realized that he now regularly contacted the former team members Ringo, and in time approved the work plans of the "Apple" study, but otherwise "The Beatles" is "end to work".
The question is whether he is still in touch with another member of the legendary rock group, Makartnies said in the Rolling Stone magazine: "I don't know."
We are content with social events and balloons.
But I don't even go to meetings, but I'll feel a few of these limits.
I got rid of Apple during the terrible divorce.
In my place, I sent John Eastman to the meetings and said, "Let me know what everyone says, because I can't hold a seat on the table."
It was too painful to see her family dead.
The company now works because I'll just listen to all the records.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA Climate Model: Venus has ever been inhabited by a planet
Based on NASA's latest climate models, Venus has once been a inhabited planet.
Scientists at the NASA Godard Space Research Institute have developed models to explore the history of Venus using tools and algorithms that also use climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether the surface of Venus is hot, where there is no water and which the atmosphere consists almost exclusively of carbon that has ever been the same conditions as Earth.
Scientists have previously said that the slow pace of vene is explained by the soft atmosphere.
The latest simulations, however, show that there has ever been a plan for Venus, an atmosphere similar to that of the Earth, and it has changed slowly.
The model also looks at the ancient topography of Venus.
The planet had more dry areas than on Earth, but it had enough water and geographical diversity to create life and not allow water to disappear.
In the early summer of Venezuela, Saule was 30 percent happier.
In the simulation of the GISS model of Venus, the model of movement reveals that the light part of the day on it lasted for 2 months, the press explained to GISS scientist Antonijs Del Genio.
This process warms the surface of the planet and causes a case that, in turn, forms a thick layer of mud that acts as a liturgy, protecting the planet from Saul’s wrath.
As a result, there is a measure of climate temperature, which is actually some degrees lower than the temperature on Earth today.
The model depicts the history of Venus, which is similar to the theory of evolution, which scientists have developed in their hypothesis.
Although it has been alive for a few billion years, Venus has been subjected to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Its oceans burned, and ultraviolet stars burned.
In total, the water left behind only the planet’s carbon dioxide atmosphere with deadly greenhouse gases - Venezuela, which we know today.
Scientists published the results of the new Venezuelan climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Rojs departs from the "Avalanche" trainer's home
The fourth day of Colorado's "Avalanche" trainer and hockey operation vice-president Patrick Rojs asked for reasons of insufficient impact on the team's decision-making process.
The vice-president of Colorado and General Joe Sakiks confirmed this news and informed that the club would immediately start looking for new trainers.
"In the last three years, I have been energetic, cautious and objectively fulfilling my duties as the main coach and vice-president of the Korean hockey operation," Rojs, aged 50, wrote in his statement.
During this evening, I have had a lot of thought about how I could improve the team's delivery to give it the necessary flexibility and achieve the highest level results.
In order to achieve this, the vice-presidential vision of the main trainer and hockey operations must be fully aligned with the vision of the organisation.
He should also be able to influence decisions relating to the performance of the team.
Today these conditions are not met.
The speaker, who reached Russia on 23 May 2013, thanked Roja for her contribution to the team.
He said that Patrick had informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate all that he has done for the organization and want him to do the best he has ever done.
In his first season with the "Avalanche" team in 2013-2014 Rojs was recognised as the best coach in the league and received the prize of Jack Adams.
He helped the club reach 112 points and first place in Central Division, but the first round of the Kolorado team won the Minesot hockeys. Since then, the club has not been in the closing games for two years.
"Avalanche" concluded the 2015-2016 season with a result of 39-39-4 and left five points behind the "Wild" team, without a further special invitation from the organizers of the Western Conference.
The famous drug guard Rojs broke out in his career four Stenlie kousus - two with Montreal "Canadiens" and two with "Avalanche".
The North Sea Oil Platform workers resume negotiations and stay on strike
The staff strike on the remuneration of the employees of the North Sea oil platforms has been suspended because the two parties involved in the dispute have initiated negotiations, the leaders of the communication.
The oil treatment company "Wood Group" is periodically directed to the North Sea Oil Platforms, where the Royal Dutch Shell works.
The Joint Declaration states that the Wood Group and the United and RMT companies agreed to resume negotiations on the settlement of the dispute.
A number of full-day meetings are scheduled during the coming week, which will begin at the beginning of the next week with the aim of re-examination of issues.
It was announced that their recent measures, which were organised after more than 25 years of interruption, were aimed at 30 per cent of the planned reduction in wages.
The negative market pressure of the Wood Group has reduced wages by 9 per cent in the North Sea this year.
In 2014, the company had already reduced the wages of land workers by 10 per cent.
The company makes it clear that additional pay reductions would allow the company to survive market collapse.
In contrast, Shell has already reduced wages for several thousand people and has announced plans to stop oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries in order to optimise its work by preparing a large-scale merger with the British Energy Company "BG Group".
Energy companies feel pressureing oil prices, and the situation is increasingly difficult for the UK to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, Scottish Parliament Member Davis Andersons met with staff representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - the North Sea Strategy Plans.
He said that North Sea is vital to the economy of the region.
In his report, he makes it clear that the North Sea and the country in general need an economy that benefits all, not individuals, but individuals.
In 2016, new North Sea projects are planned to invest almost $1.4 billion compared with $7 billion invested in the last five years.
Keplers measured the speed of the stars in the Plejades.
The most recent Keperra telescope mission has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of stars speeding in the Plejades star.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in this star differ at different speeds, as well as how the speed of the stars is related to the design of the planet.
"We hope that when we compare our results with other stars, we will get more information about the link between the stars' mass, age and even the history of their solar system," said Professor Caltech Infrasarkano and scientist Luisa Rebula.
The stars are 445 light years away from Earth.
Many stars in this galaxy are just beginning to grow at about 125 million years of age.
It is measured at maximum speed.
With maximum speed, these rising stars emit a large amount of star wind.
The winds move through the magnetic field, they break the stars.
As the stars grow, their movement rate decreases.
Keplers measure the speed of each star's movement by setting the time between the known star area, e.g. the display of the sun's plane.
The latest star rating catalogue shows that larger stars are slower than smaller stars.
Rebuls compares stars with giants, larger growers do pirates less than smaller raisers.
Rebuls tells us that the Plejades "ballet" is visible that the slow rotational objects are larger and smaller, while the faster the rotational objects are very small stars.
Because the Plyde star is so close, it serves as a great space laboratory, where stars can be compared to the speeds of rotation.
Rebuls tells us that Plejades' star helps create theoretical models for the rotation of stars in both the older and the younger stars.
We still have much to learn about when and why the speed of the stars is reduced and about their complete stopping process.
Rebuls and his colleagues detailed the analysis of the speed of the Plejades constellations in three new publications that will soon be published in the Astronomy Journal.
