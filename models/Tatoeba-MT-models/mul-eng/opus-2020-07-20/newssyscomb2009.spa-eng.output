Turnout of the right of populist in Austria, together with 29%
The elections before the Austrian Parliament have led to the early results, a significant weakening of both sides of the present great coalition, and an express strengthening of the party of the right of populist.
Some of the forces and specialities have suffered from the Austrian People's Party (ODP), where the position of current President, Wilhelm Multer, is seriously affected.
On the contrary, the Head of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), Head of Government of the state of Carintia, Jörg Haider, prepares his triumphal return to national policy.
According to the results, social democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with a 29.8 per cent vote, thus losing a 5.5 per cent vote compared with the last elections of 2006.
Worse still, the OVP has lost 25.6 per cent, almost nine per cent of votes.
They are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the postwar war and especially for the peoples who convened these early elections.
At the beginning of July, when the OVP left the coalition, the populace had a considerable advantage in terms of preference to SPO.
It is clear, however, that the voters punished them for letting the shipping government.
In the first responses to the results, speculations about the resignation of the party's president and, to date, vice-canceller, Wilhelm Multer.
Observers believe that this could be achieved this Monday at the exceptional meeting of the party's presidency.
This would clearly facilitate the path of the constant and closer start point of the electoral results, i.e. the renewal of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the strengthening of both parties to the right of peoples - the liberals (FPO) have gained approximately 18 per cent and the BZO, an eleven per cent of the votes - and that the social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same year 1999 would be repeated when the populaces negotiated with the populists (then the FPO was a unit, but in 2005 BZO was de-membered) for a coalition government that had come to bring a penalty on the part of the European Union.
For this evolution it is clear that Haider has already announced that he is ready to cooperate with any party and that he has already taken his return to Vienna, to national policy.
The Green Party has also been able to reach Parliament even though it has lost slightly and has fallen from the third to the fifth place between Austrian political parties.
No other party has clearly exceeded the limit of four percent and therefore does not form part of Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool off
If it is not possible to solve the problem of Czech scientists who have been charged in India for illegally collecting scarabs, it may be possible to freeze the Czech-Indian relations, according to Foreign Affairs Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This was demonstrated by the Minister in New York, after meeting today with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this would not be solved then yes, then yes, it would be safe to arrive at this freeze," he noted after the meeting organized by Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that in legal matters it can be difficult to implement.
However, he indicated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who had been accused and punished with a fine, the government could negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in whose jurisdiction the case was heard.
"Your problem could be solved," said the minister.
For Emil Kucherera, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest courts.
Then he could ask for the exoneration of the case and wait for the sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"Acquired to appeal to the Supreme Court and then it would be possible for the guilty," the Chief of Czech Diplomacy said.
The only way in which the Czech party can enter the matter is by obtaining a "legal competent support" to the defendant, the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that such support was already achieved by the Indian party.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relationships with India, which have a long tradition.
Indians also recognize it," commented Schwarzenberg.
On the other hand, as ČTK said, his colleague stressed that the Czech Republic considered the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We'll really consider prison and condemn these Czech scientists for a terrible mistake," he announced.
The Minister gave the answer to the question whether he had received from the Indian side the promise that he would handle the matter.
"I've received enough promises," he just noticed.
A Czech is fighting a battle at the bottom of the sea
I'm near an electronic wall map, on which I represent Australia surrounded by sea.
He does not care, however, about the continent but about a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it is the seabed that surrounds it.
The region is, at the same time, as large as one continent," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the United Nations Division for Ocean and Sea Affairs.
Her head, Director of the Division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, continues the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
He'll take over this talent and enthusiasm for work.
The seabed is still hiding a little known world, rich in natural sources.
Petroleum and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms to date take the key to the development of drugs against cancer.
The bottom is bigger than the ground.
Countries with coastal borders have begun to debate repeatedly the new territories under the sea.
According to the United Nations Treaty, these rights enjoyed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is essentially what is called Continental Borde, which is sometimes extended to a few hundred kilometres from the coast of the country.
This has, under the Treaty, exclusive rights in all the resources of the Continental Board.
"Simply, the part of the seabed and its surface is understood by the Continental Borde, which is the natural continuation of the continent under water.
It reaches the border of the coast of the sea, and often, to the border of the two hundred miles of sea, that is, the purely economic area," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the delimitation of the external borders of the Continental Board must be submitted with scientific scientific documentation based on research and measures.
This is the result of a series of years of preparation of work.
"One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal assistance committee.
The Commission has so far dealt with five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only the last three countries mentioned have gone forward," adds Mikulka.
Not long ago, Australia’s success had a global impact as it was the first major expansion of its maritime domain.
However, it was also achieved by New Zealand - the seabed surface that the Commission provided it last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, that is, almost six times more than the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in their studies.
The profit derived from the use of the marine fund will be, as they promise, inestimable.
Other states are also slowly submitting their requests.
They can do so up to ten years from the time they ratified the Montego Bay Treaty.
There, where the Continental Borde begins, the region of the Ocean Fund declared by the Treaty as "common heritage of humanity".
Now, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right to exploitation in these areas is governed by the Treaties established by international institutions.
"The marine fund, however, is not any gold mine," said Director Mikulka with emphasis, adding "that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and their regime defined by contract."
The Czechs in the Pacific
And today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other countries of the then Eastern Block within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in 1991 with a treaty as investors as well as few other states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the capacity to operate in the area of ClarionClipperton in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian and Kiribati.
The area to investigate by the investor is something bigger than ancient Czechoslovakia.
The fund there is an accident, it's about something as well as a marine replication of the Tatras.
"A total area of 75,000 square kilometres may be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete coatings containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concrete.
He reminds us of a little patata or with a little fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend relived Golem.
During the release of the hostages, the command of the German Special Forces was at the scene of action
The Government of Egypt had asked for assistance from Germany to resolve the crisis of hostages. The experts came.
When the situation was serious, the command of special forces was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are known about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior in the rescue action, German special forces also participated indirectly.
Therefore, in the place of release, the German army specialists as well as GSG 9, the federal police aircraft team, the Federal Criminal Investigation Office, were also experts in the logistics field of the technical institution.
As the ministers reported on Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, given a violent release, left their prisoners and escaped.
The Government of Egypt accepted Germany's help to use it as a local support.
"Coursely the moment has not arrived," said a spokesman from the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On September 19th in southern Egypt, the asylum seekers had kidnapped a group of 5 German, 5 Italian, a Romanian, and eight of their Egyptian followers.
After the kidnapping in the southern desert region of Egypt, the Queens deported them from one side to the other in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers was unknown until the end as well as the details of the release or possible redemption payments.
While so many healthy and healthy people arrived at Cairo.
Steinmeier said the released hostages were under the protection of Germany's embassy.
He didn't say a word about the details of liberation.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", 5 tourists and special forces have to return to Airbus from Germany's air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The United States Chamber of Representatives does not approve the rescue package
The first camera of the United States Congress failed with a large savings package of $700 billion for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell very badly.
The United States Chamber of Representatives rejected the Government's financial markets package with 227 votes against 206.
Despite all the calls made by President George W. Bush and former political parties, a majority of the program was not reached with which the disorder should be limited in the financial markets.
With a dramatic action, the desperate defenders have still tried to convince critics to accept the large $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the president of the democratic negotiations had asked Members to make a vote even though the plan is not so popular.
"It is difficult to receive political approval to avoid something that has not yet been absolutely done," he admitted.
During the vote, the Dow Jones dropped to more than 6 per cent or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of investors that the state rescue package could fail.
He retired at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
Experts have other serious disturbances in international financial markets.
The approval of both the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate is necessary to allow the programme to be implemented.
Organizations record the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to one study, the volume of sales of travel reservations for the coming months increased compared to last year - even the winter period in more than 30 per cent.
According to one study, despite the weakened ratio the desire to travel from Germany remains as before.
As reported last Monday by Germany's travel association (DVR) in Berlin, travel bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a sales volume of 31 per cent more compared to the same period of the previous year.
According to the investigation of the GfK market research institute, reserves for the months of autumn had already been raised in number.
Thus, the volume of sales of travel agencies in October was nearly 1 per cent more compared with 2007, reported the DVR.
The results are GfK's figures, which are the information analysed on reservations to 1200 travel agencies and account for almost all of the market.
The data collected are travel reservations made by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak course of the United States dollar, all travel to the United States is of great demand, the DRW reported.
In this case, the number of reservations increased almost one third.
The Germans' preferred destinations are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also Germany's regions.
On all organized trips are very preferred, explained Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices increase, travel costs are, in this case, "better calculated for the customer than during an individual journey".
Among other things, consumers can save money with advance booking discounts or All-Including offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months travel was well reserved, so the volume of sales compared to last year has again risen - although according to another study the number of Germans who made a trip, comparing last year, decreased.
My first October
The hits of the festivals under the sky open in the endless Balneario, the beer in litres and the famous people dressed in traditional bazaars of designers.
A start in a campaign shop.
Really Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
She's rude, the moderater on television and wears a traditional cow-traffic dress.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is already used.
But there's one thing that unites us: we're just in a campaign shop, the photographers have already raced to us and filled out their memory cards with the photos - it's a lot of lisonizers over everything because I'm the first time in Octoberfest.
That's what friends do.
The traditional cheap cow's shoes seems to fulfill its function.
In fact, as a tourist in Octoberfest from northern Germany, my feeling of well-being with a traditional bavor dress to this day was still limited.
But after reaching the Teresa Prado, everything isn't so much.
Almost everyone wears traditional clothes or leather pants; no one seems to be getting into a case or feel uncomfortable - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my front receive rare views on the side of a platinum stand in the chocolate.
A municese calls my attention to my front that I had dressed in wrong way: "The left side is lonely, the middle is the virgin, the right side is compromised, then the left is alive."
Oh, God, now I'm broken behind the left.
"It's okay," he says laughing.
The others don't care much of the subtle ways to flirt and take up where it's written "To drink to get dressed!" and show them, without asking, their naked ass.
A young boy who behaves as an exhibitionist is called Bob, is from England, and is also for the first time in Octoberfest.
To him it seems "gorgeous", what he utters with a "o" very long.
I'll tell you after I put on your glass of beer that just had to drink.
I put it directly on the side of the fire mouth, most think it's an empty cube.
Then Bob is one of the famous people who know a lot about drinking.
Others do not have much luck and cannot consume so much alcohol.
On the 8th of the night, health groups run around the party site and have to worry about poor drinks.
Sanitaries appear every time in groups - suddenly there are four people who carry the covered streets from one campaign store to another.
It works like most visitors do: They get drunk, they get drunk.
You can't see who suffers from the degrees of alcoholism and is in the streets.
"They're those who can't do any more," I was told by a nurse answering my question and disappeared in a tumor.
Victim of an accident identified by the police
The 63-year-old peton has been identified who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in the Essex County.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road, in the city of Brentwood, was involved in the incident that took place in Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later she died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested under the unbelievably conductive suspicion.
Since then, he's been put free under jail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Before Turkey became a member of the European Union, the European powers expressed the desire to enter the country.
In the eastern part of Bósforo, perhaps only 20 steps towards Asia, is one of the most interesting relics of the disastrous imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-renacentist style.
At least this is what guides say.
The building is set to hold the end of the platforms and takes before two towers, one for each corner, and looks like all of a typical German settlement.
The stone is dirty.
The building in your complex is a little decadent.
But once the trunk was overrun, there is no doubt about what the size of the company was the most western gate.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German Consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railway that was fed up to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
Their streets were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and their irregular Arabs.
Due to the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, fell below
the British domain and when the forces advanced in Egypt, they urged the Turks and their German allies outside Palestine and Syria.
The news was also bad for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 a munitions train exploded by destroying its elaborate roof.
The Turkish sources commented that it was a sabbatage.
Since then the station has been falling and remained on the edge of history.
But today, this railway, port of entry to Anatolia and all eastern centers, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party that is in the Government - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a new collaboration policy.
The Turkish Government maintains excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I went to a letter and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, with the aim of visiting one of the leaders of the AKP, expert in foreign policy, Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten hours and a half later - after a sacudied trip, which produced the cadences of the old world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, reached the Turkish capital - a new city, intended to rule a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamic roots, represents a paradigm change in the Turkish consensus
that has raised some suspicions in the West and, in particular, in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - built ad hoc - in a development hub, surrounded by medium-sized commercial centres and "power pastries" where middle-class managers - men and women -- meet at the first hour of the morning to agree/work.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a right-wing politician of almost any party in Europe.
I wear, cut, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate vicinity.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he says.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look at the same time towards the East and the West.
It's not a case if it's not one or the other.
You have to do both things.
"But certainly at some point," I ask him, "Could Turkey be obliged to choose?"
"Turkey," he answered, "he doesn't want to interfere with that election."
Then I point out that almost everyone I have spoken to so far had almost quoted me: the relations Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the entire Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Once again at Hydarpasha station, after a second night without sleeping, my thoughts go back to the two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised would it be to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East, in large part, would be in the hands of Turkey today?
And waiting at the terminal for the Ferry that will take me back through the buffer, I agree that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
There is no doubt, then, that the continent must reciprocate this fascinating country.
Memories: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: which music director at Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (as at 11 September) was responsible for the Guildford and Coro Philharmonic Orchestra.
As part of the city's musical project, the following year he founded his magnificent choir of young people, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for the 21-year-olds, but at the time the Proteus sang his final song in 1979, several of us were finishing the 20s - we just refused to give up to the heart.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological variable form) represented the will of the heart and the ability to perform any music that is presented to him, whether Madrid or the Messiah, whether not accompanied or with complete orchestra.
The resatisfaction of music produced by this young heart was often surprising, always exciting, and everything was due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that continued to be absolutely constant throughout the years.
Often everything told us to "let music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in music.
That's all you have to sing!"
Its variant was always absolutely clear and precise, although never imputable, not too flowery.
Anyone was the musical scoring, always finished at an even greater level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been riding, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades in which he was directed by the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed by anyone – on the contrary, many times I have been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of size and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply "sold one or two very well-known horses of war all over the world."
We'll miss much less.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his essay by William Woodruff (September 25, 1946) he said that "in 1946, economic history studies were resumed in Oxford and in 1950 he won a scholarship from Houblon-Norman... while studying for a license, one of the teachers and one of the doctors."
This is learned from a note by Woodruff's author at Beyond Nab End, but it's not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which he completed a doctoral thesis on the British coal industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 with the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a bout of Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 in the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to pass this part of his career is unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in Faculty of Philology
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's "Flamenco and Life" exhibition because his photographs in white and black, documentary style are fantastic.
They called me attention to their simplicity and the strength they transmit, always treating protagonists with great respect.
An exposure that shows a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second floor for Honda supervents
On November, Honda will start marketing the second jazz generation.
If its predecessor had already counted with a wide habitat, this new monovolume presents an even larger inner space.
All of this includes refined mechanisms, which increase the comfort of driving and allow more fuel to be stored.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a very similar line to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among other things, it should indicate an innovative design, a new platform, larger sizes and new mechanics.
However, before examining the new model, it should be noted that this new Jazz comes six years after the first generation was introduced into the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter period than the one employed by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case in Japan, where Jazz was the most marketed car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Exactly in Japan nearly a million Jazz units have been sold since their launch.
The second market has been the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz allows to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007, the Japanese firm marketed a total of 83,000 Jazz units, in 2009, estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would represent a 17% increase in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has marketed a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda sales in Spain.
With regard to the new generation, the Spanish branch officials will expect to sell 2,000 Jazz units in a full year.
Exactly the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to pay large amounts of sales in Spain.
In fact, brand-holders hope to complete the year with a total of 22,000 trading units, which represents 4,000 less than a down of 16 per cent in 2007.
Despite this increase in Honda sales, it has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm is also expected to achieve 2 per cent in 2010.
To achieve this quota Honda trusts the arrival of another new model.
This is the Insight, a hybrid of five gates and compact size - 4,37 meters long - that the Japanese company expects to market about 200,000 units per year worldwide.
By markets and according to the estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50 per cent of the Insight sales will be produced in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The Insight commercial launch is scheduled for the first months of the year, once it is held in society in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its quotas.
Its length rises to 3.90 metres (five cm above), the width to 1.69 meters (two inches above) and the distance between the axles up to 2.50 meters, which is an increase of five cm.
The height, however, did not vary and is maintained at 1.52 metres.
In addition to increasing sizes, internal viability is also growing.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of a central fuel deposit, a solution also adopted in former Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the malteter - which has a double system - rises to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these measures are of the version with engine 1.4, since the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements such as rear leds or the possibility to mount the panoramic crystal - is an improvement in accessing back places.
And it's that the doors that give access to the second line have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to 67 degrees from the first Jazz.
There are also new engines in this second generation of Jazz.
At the start of its marketing, this small model will account for two gas-fuels of 1,2 and 1,4 litres.
Both mechanisms incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves a lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refining and at the same time achieves a high pair throughout the engine system.
The first 1,2 litre machine gets power from 90 horses to 6,000 revolutions with a maximum of 114 Nm. to 4,900 rounds.
This propeller - which used to reach 78 horses - has a cost of 5.3 litres and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
With regard to the previous propeller, which in the previous generation had 83 horses, it is now worth 100.
This Jazz 1.4 of 100 horses achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 litres and 128 grams of CO2.
The 'beeja car' that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of technologies for disaster prevention Nissan has been inspired, this time, in nature, in particular, in the bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, taking as a basis the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which takes the first step in collision prevention technologies.
Engineers of the Advanced Technical Centre of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Advanced Science and Technology Research Centre of the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director-General for Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Mark Management, the BR23C is presented as an extension of the Nissan Security Escudo of four areas.
This robot intends to strengthen the ability to prevent collisions of brand vehicles.
During their flight, each baby creates its own personal space in an oval manner that looks very much like the Nissan Security Escudo.
But the most important are the eyes composed of the bee, able to see with an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, which allows it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To enjoy this visual function, engineers designed what has been called a laser locationr (Laser Range Finder).
This detects the obstacles that are located up to two meters in a 180-degree radio in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to an approach microprocessor which, immediately, is translated into the prevention of collision.
"When you detect an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels into the right angle or larger to avoid collision.
The greatest difference with any existing system is that the evasion manoeuvre is entirely instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the main engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot move up or down or down; it can only be moved in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways such as the bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and to act according to that data.
It is not necessary to store information or intuitive logic of previous manoeuvres, so it can work continuously with only a couple of dozen memory KBs.
This may surprise us, but we're not talking about memory gigs, not even megas."
This is the first step to develop new instantaneous pollution prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan is vaccinating that will be introduced into serial cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a satellite GPS navigation system to guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Pre-hypotecarse pre-filled pen
It must be acknowledged that the US Department of Treasures, in addition to being very liquid for injections, is not lacking in engineering.
Before the crisis, and in order to prevent Americans from embarking on empty mortgages on questionable solvency banks, they have created a threat and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
Either the 'Hotel of Bad Credits'... or the Laws.
The theoretical aspect of this accommodation and especially of its receptionist is to think of one, two and three times if it is time to ask for a credit.
And, above all, where to do it, what is probably your goal.
True, it has useful information, but little detail.
It's more than a page for adolescents than a place for all the public.
What happens when the game is complete?

Morgan Stanley sells participation to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into his capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will pay nine billion dollars to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a strong low rate of its stock.
One week after the discovery of a provisional agreement, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9,9 per cent of the ordinary shares of Morgan Stanley at a unit price of $25.25.25, or an amount of $33 billion.
The agreed price shall be less than 19 % of the accounting value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest six billion additional dollars with the purchase of convertible securities, which will ensure a 10 % return and a $31,25 conversion price.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global operation would be carried out on the basis of a unit price of $29, or 28 per cent above its current change.
Morgan Stanley's action, however, was 6.79 per cent to 23.07 dollars each at 17:00 GMT.
" This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to the status of banking, " explained Juan Mack, the Director-General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities, but he makes it pass under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much wiser behaviour than before.
The modalities presented last month also show that the agreement has been amended over the past few days: Morgan had announced that it would sell up to 20 per cent of its shares to Japan for almost $8.5 billion.
" A week ago, he explained in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, " we thought that participation would have been made only of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we want to minimize the risks and cover us."
Having as a basis the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its securities Morgan Stanley 7 % below its accounting value.
And the operation will be translated by a dilution of approximately 20% of the benefit by action.
The agreement provides that MUFG may convert within one year half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares if they are sold at more than 50 % above the conversion price, or 47 more or less, during a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that MUFG's capital will allow you to take investment opportunities, strengthen your balance and increase your liquidity.
A representative of the group, however, refused to comment on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should show a 15% solution ratio Ter One, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan has had to ease his balance since the end of August.
In the last weeks, the group was busy, which saw its rate in bags down to half while the security cost against a risk of deficits on its debt was low.
This cost came back last month but remained at a high level, about 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only "liver" of Wall Street's big investment banks after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's purchase, announced that it had raised $15,000 in part to Berkshire Hataway, Warren Buffett's group.

The 19 persons kidnapped have been released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the raptors of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight kidnapped Egyptian followers arrived in the desert ten days ago in Egypt's capital after being released from the moon in the afternoon.
By morning, they had been released by the Egyptian special forces in Chad.
All of them had a good look at their arrival at 1530 on a special plane on the Al-Maza military base, adjacent to El-Cairo International Airport.
Some helicopters immediately transported them to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of El Cairo, to be subjected to medical tests, so they could not speak to the press.
"Good health is found" and "no ransom has been paid to the kidnappers," said Egypt's Minister Zoheir Garana at the airport.
On September 19, these kingdoms fell into the power of 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying a Safari in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, at the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and then passed from one to another.
The group was composed of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanians - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Egyptian travel agency, responsible for the Safari organization.
An Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 members of the special forces, transported on two helicopters, had launched the attack on the night before the white.
" An exchange of shootings occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others had fled," said the officer who kept the anonymity.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "relamp" unit were sent to Sudan, where they had the support of German and Italian commands.
The Italian Foreign Minister, Franco Frattini, mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"It must be recognized that we have achieved this result through professionalism and the effectiveness of our men from secret services, from special forces," he said without entering into details.
He also reduced the payment of a ransom.
The previous Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol an entire field on which the kidnappers, who killed six of them, were found and arrested two of them.
He also stated that they were related to a rebel group in Darfur, the Movement for the Liberation of the Sudan Unit (SLA-U), a statement immediately rejected by this group.
Letter - The silent majority of culture
A discussion on cultural financing is done on manchettes and takes place in the current electoral campaign.
That's better.
But a sector of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will be raised to complain of the miserable sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical places that die of hunger?
What policy will be taken to remind the federal government of its monumental buildings and buildings?
Why do we not have true laws that actually preserve our heritage like Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros to restore it only the Chinese castle in the valley of Loira?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of the United States and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all of this in concert.
In Quebec, at the Federation of the Historical Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 favorable people regrouped in 211 historical, heritage, archives and geology societies are concerned about looking in history, preserving small amounts of private archives and preserving archaeological research.
These are often the dog guards of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and responsible people launch their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
For what, a monument for history and heritage?
The Governments of the Netherlands nationalize a part of the Fortis Bank.
The Netherlands states - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalisation of the Belgian-Holand Bank Fortis, which is seen in tears due to the impact of the US market mortgage crisis: the three countries will fully support this financial and insurance institution, which also has business in Hungary.
At the end of this week, the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands continued to hold consultations at a higher level with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's economic competence.
Fortis Bank is the first to experience the crisis in the euro area in the context of the international financial crisis that has occurred in several oils over a year ago, so the decisions taken with respect to the Bank can in some way be considered as prior.
According to the decision taken on Sunday morning, the three States will purchase approximately half (49 per cent) of the property owned by the Bank in its area.
The Bank will sell a portion of its business, including all of its activities - mainly insurance - purchased last year by the Dutch AGN Amró.
Fortis' actions began a strong decline last week and for the second half of the week important signs of crisis have already been seen in the institution.
However, analysts agree that with its 85 000 employees, this Bank is too large to allow it to rest.
The company's actions only on Friday decreased by 12 percent, this is the lowest point in the last 14 years.
Since January the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
Noting the current prices of the shares, the total value of the group's capital on the market is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the company's executives, this is not real.
The Bank's direction has brought the collapse of Fortis' actions to the insecurity of the North American market in relation to the adoption of the US package plan of $700 billion.
Monday's actions have already shown a slight increase.
Friday they appointed Filip Dierckx as the new director General of the bank.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a concrete offer.
The Belgian government had already ensured that investors had no reason to worry, they would not lose their money.
There has been no panic among the Bank's clients so far, they did not invade the bank offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has his own branch office in Hungary and has also bought lease companies.
Zorro in the gallinary
In the United States, life and health insurance companies, when they see the data on the purchase of drugs, often refuse to sign an insurance contract.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the market for personal data will be uncontrollable.
"There are personal data protection programmes, which in all cases lead to the approval of the given person.
The same must be in independent hands, because if not, we "trust the gallinary to the breast" - quote the Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the follow-up program for medical prescriptions.
Insurance companies rely on the price of insurance and the amount of compensation of the customer’s health status and if they believe that the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
They previously sent the client a medical check and signed with him the contract knowing the outcome of the check.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer's identification number, the list of medicines bought in the last year and in the middle of the year and the program itself concludes on the customer's diseases and health status.
For example, if you regularly take large doses of insulin to reduce cholesterol, it indicates that the level of fat in the blood is virtually inaccurately high, thus being included immediately in a high risk category.
There are many versions of the programme, some even establish a number of risks, so the insurance company, in addition to the administration, only has something to do, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
Among the disadvantages of the programme, for example, some medicines are multi-use, for example certain substances serve both to treat headaches and to treat heat waves and even antidepressants.
This latter is an important risk increase factor for insurance companies while the first ones are not.
Special companies were established to consult and process these data, which, prior to obtaining the necessary information from the pharmaceuticals, requested the patient's approval.
The authorities are already obliged to do so, although they have not received much from the ignorance so far.
Some companies have recently also developed the results of laboratory tests, and they are combined with drug consumption data to obtain more accurate information on the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to these data and at the same time it is more difficult to control their use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but only applies to insurance companies and health services.
The draft law which provides the authority with the right to control specialized companies for the provision of personal data is already before the Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: therefore he developed his programme, which will require the person's specific approval for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that such a person cannot refuse his approval, because unless insurance companies do not sign the contract with him.
So the gallons, in spite of everything, are exposed to the good will of the bear.
Marsella's Global Menu
The European Union doubles its trade with India
As the European Union and India are mutually commercial partners, this issue, in addition to the other problems in most of the world, dominated the order of the day of the ninth summit.
A French-Indian summit will also be held today to deal mainly with nuclear energy cooperation.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a great democratic development power that should have more voice and vote on international issues, the Member States have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
This question has not been addressed in the ninth summit launched yesterday in Marsella.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, vice president of the EU, President Manuel Barroso of the Commission and Javier Solana, the main representative of foreign policy, received Manmohan Singh, India's first Minister with whom they reached agreement to double in five years, i.e. an increase of more than one billion euros, their trade exchange.
Given that the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an extremely ambitious objective.
This legally harmonizes the twenty- twentieth bilateral civil aviation conventions with India, so that air transport can also fly in the future.
India is seeking to sign the free trade treaty with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The objective is balance, because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only the ninth place between the Union's trading partners.
The summit drew attention to global issues.
Both sides condemned the situation of Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism - all forms of it - and urged the convening of a United Nations conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalisation round was also stressed, although both parties had a great responsibility in their failure.
The EU has confirmed that it will adhere to its energy and climate programme, i.e. by 2020 it will reduce pollution emissions by at least 20 percent.
India also agrees with this, just as at the climate conference next year a global agreement should be reached and the production of greenhouse gas by 2050 would be reduced by 50 per cent.
They also wished to hamper the increase in food prices and supported the call for an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today, the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - at a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris trusts that French companies will receive charges of EUR 28 billion to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency information, the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian editors
Strong presence of Italian editors at the international exhibition of the book of Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian editors will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international sample of the book of Frankfurt is expected for this edition of more than 7mil exhibitors from 102 different countries who will occupy 171,790 square metres of the sample with more than 403,000 titles in exhibition and with Turkey as a guest of honour.
It will be the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Goods and Cultural Activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government at the opening ceremony of the Italian pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with an Italian point - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
A press conference will be held in the Room Struktur in the Buchmesse note 5.0: this will be the opportunity to present numbers, trends and perspectives on the status of editors in Italy.
According to data, the weight of foreign authors' books gradually decreases over the total Italian production, in particular for adults and adolescents.
I found Steve Fossett's plane the millionaire disappeared a year ago
The rest of Steve Fossett's plane has been found, the millionaire disappeared on 3 September 2007 while flying over the wilderness of Nevada.
The caves have been found on an altitude of 3,000 metres, in the area of the Mammoth Lakes Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
In the inside of the plane, there were no human remains.
Commissioner of Madeira County, John Anderson, has identified the remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that it is itself about what Steve Fossett was flying the day of his disappearance" said at a press conference.
The Commissioner has stated that no human remains have been found on the plane or around.
The millionaire, 63 years old, has been sentenced to death in February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) has informed that a few hours after the landing of the remains, a team of researchers has been sent to identify the device: it is itself the Bellanca 8kcab, disbanded since 3 September 2007, when Fossset withdrew from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from Nevada's confidence, some of Fosset's personal remains have been found by a couple near their Mammoth Lakes home.
It is two documents with the name of Fosset, the two issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash in cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had won a post in history thanks to a long series of prizes.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he had become the first man to complete the world round in an aerostatic globe: two single weeks of flight.
Three years later he had made the world round by plane and without stairs.
Among its records, it may also have flew to 15445 meters above the Andes, but with a baby.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Sub out of the schematics with original design and well established with defined lines and angles.
This is, in synthesis, Glk the last born among all the trucks in the "compact" field of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a new window in this sector.
Depending on the content outside the traditional, it will be unexpected and non-conventional, the communication accompanying the launch of the Glk sub, available in the Mercedes-Benz exhibition rooms since the next 17 October.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the start of the new car launched an independent communication mode through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi-posts, which was discussed in three different phases, which would dominate the central street of Milanese shopping, come As, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in a stereoscopic version and thanks to special gloves distributed in the adventure How will it be possible to see the new suv in almost real sizes and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the images will have the impression that the car goes out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative technology Elumina8 the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be recompensated in a single image.
No doubt Mercedes with this publication is trying to introduce something new in the stereotype of automobile communications.
Can this formula capture the interest of future buyers? Let's see.
is clear who are the Italian hooligans
In the Triveneto, there is a ban on access to sports events.
But who are those 150-200 girls and girls from which Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group that has been in Italy for years and that has so far, in fact, never created too many problems.
And they never met with the rival fans either.
The extraction of the group is right.
The promoters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
These of Sofia have joined a small group (small units, in fact) of Campania and Apulia.
They have flags of three colors where the city of origin of the soldiers appears: Saturday night has been removed so that they are not identified.
They're inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria, they have found a group of true Nazi fanatics, the Levskis.
Figc had made available 144 Italian fans for the party: all with names, therefore easy to control.
And the Minister of the Interior had already controlled them all: among those who had gone out to Sofia there was no one with a Daspo (a ban on access to sports events) at that time, no one had forbidden them to attend a stadium.
Four Italian fanatics, who had prior crime in stadiums, rejected the ticket as well as the trip.
The Ministry of the Interior is now waiting to read the acts that come from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give Daspo (a ban on access to sports events) for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the riots.
An international Daspo (a ban on access to sports events) that prevents not only Italian stadiums but also Europeans.
Our hooligans, they won't stand any longer in a stadium.
Good luck!
But now it is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty, others are added.
"We have to turn off this fire and not legitimize who behaves in this way," they support the Ministry of the Interior.
That's why, "good eyes open" especially in view of the National Party of Wednesdays in Lecce."
In Apulia there is also a small set of supporters from Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow, the Observatory will meet on Tuesday, the Cams that can also be counted with a section of the Asia (external information and security agency, i.e. the secret service, which deals with the problems in the stadiums.
"The Hearts of Duce-Duce and the raised arm during Mameli's impasse? In Bulgaria it is not a giant ...."
This is the thought (expressed in a little cheerful) of Domenico Mazzilli, the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (taken the post previously from Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferrizzi).
Mazzilli had been head of Trieste of public security, where there is a core of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not difficult to celebrate the Duke but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fanatics who have been ashamed.
"I don't do sociologists – add the Observer No.1 – the reactions are attributed to the countries in which the fact takes place.
So far this group has behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take into account the future.
But we are also talking about the silhouettes at the Himmeli temple: they are also not a myth, but if they are allowed, they are not education ...".
