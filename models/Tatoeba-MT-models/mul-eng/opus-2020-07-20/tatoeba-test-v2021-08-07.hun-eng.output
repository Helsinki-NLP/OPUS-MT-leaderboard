I made a fight for the neighbor.
I've got a ride for the neighbor.
I promised the neighbor I'd win.
I promise, it won't happen again.
I promise I'll see you soon.
I asked for your hand.
I pressed a bad button.
I'm making cream in the coffee.
I'm making tea in my coffee.
I'm sick of it.
I've got a box.
I picked up the key.
I put the rest in the refrigerator.
I put the food in the refrigerator.
I ate it fast.
I want to return to my words, which have been translated into other languages.
I've been running the whole thing this morning.
I ran as far as I could, but I missed my last assignment.
I got it.
I ran into your brother on the street.
I ran over to my mother.
I'm reading books in the house.
I'll read the letters.
I've read a lot of history.
I read something in a book.
I read this story in a book.
I appreciate your cooperation.
I really don't know where to start.
I'm saying I can't judge him!
I really don't think so.
I really don't want to do this.
I was having a really good time tonight.
I really like being alone.
I love city life very much.
I really love the bride, actually, I like this week of the year.
I'll be there for the girl.
I really like your website.
I got a letter from my mother yesterday.
I received his letter without delay.
I got your message.
I recently met an old friend of mine.
I recognized her face.
I suggest you learn French.
I grew up like a paradise.
I rejected the offer.
I'm sorry I went to Australia.
I'm staying.
I remember both of them.
I remember that too.
I remember the day we first met.
I remember Tom wearing a brown hat.
I reminded him of his duty.
I respect Tommy.
I'll be back in four years.
I put my ass at risk.
First, take these eggs out.
I'll be right back for you.
I'm five miles away today.
Fuck.
I've raised your horse, sir.
That's what I said, but I didn't really think about it.
I told you this wouldn't be good.
I didn't say anything.
Thank you.
I sat down and scared.
I was there with him.
I've been thinking about it.
I've been thinking about it.
I sat next to the driver.
My paradise is fruit or green?
I was sitting on the ground.
I've seen a bear drive.
I've seen a bear ride with a truck.
I saw a very good movie last week.
I saw Dana.
I saw him a week ago.
I saw it.
I saw John in the library.
I've seen more than Tom knows.
I saw one.
I saw something.
I saw it.
I saw it as if it was in the car.
I saw them.
I saw Tom dance with other girls.
I saw Tama today.
I saw your name on the list.
I cut the moss.
I was hoping it would happen in secret.
I stole it.
I secretly photographed him.
I see a house.
I see a rose.
I see an innocent and an innocent woman.
I'll see you soon.
I see this.
I understand what you're thinking.
I was in danger.
I gave you flowers.
I served Tom with special powers.
Six main parts of the table.
I've got six.
Is everybody okay?
Is everyone here?
No, Tommy, you're not that important.
It's all right in the office.
Is everything ready?
Is the fast bread really sick?
Is French harder than English?
Is it hard to get French?
Do you teach French in your schools?
Did you speak French?
Youtube's rape is a crime?
Is he sick or a doctor?
America?
Sir?
Is he my friend?
Is he tall?
I cut my hand with Tom, and I went.
I burned my head.
I should go there.
First, I should have asked Tom.
I should have asked Tom for help.
I should have been a movie star.
I should have been at the meeting.
I should've been there at the meeting.
I should've been more general.
I should have been much more precise.
I should have been a lot more basic.
I should've been there sooner.
I should've brought more food.
I should have come here first.
I should've done that last week.
I should've done this somewhere else.
I should have done it with you.
I should have helped Tom do that.
I should never have come to Boston.
I shouldn't have said anything.
I should have admitted to do that.
I should've seen it coming.
I should've stayed out of it.
I should've tried something else.
I shouldn't have left you alone.
I think I should've done this.
I should have followed your advice.
I should have said I didn't feel it.
I'm kidding, but no one's listening.
I just want to know what this is about.
Is that a snake?
Are you okay if I call Tom?
Is this a joke?
Is there cold in Germany?
Is that dangerous?
Is it easy to learn to talk to an expert?
You're done?
Are you going to eat tomorrow?
It's hard to speak English?
Is that binding?
Is that normal?
You mind if I sit here?
Do you?
Is that too late?
Is it true that Tom committed suicide?
Is it true that Tom killed himself?
You've been studying with an expert for a week, haven't you?
It's true that you've betrayed Tommy's daughter, isn't it?
Is it true that you love soda coffee?
Is that the time?
Can fruit be paid more than coffee?
I'm hungry, I'm hungry.
Laurie?
I'm sleeping with two pairs.
After nine nights, I slept with an hour last night.
I got drunk, and I got ready for school.
I slept nine hours.
I asked my boss.
I raised the boy.
Mary Tom's mother?
Cigarettes.
Will the week be okay?
Do I understand?
I caught a picture.
I ran into the house.
I ran into the house.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay now?
Didn't you have enough to ruin my life?
Well, isn't it gymorrhage?
They gave it to me in the afternoon.
Sometimes I'm sad.
Sometimes my brain hurts.
I get up sometimes.
Where's Paris?
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
I'm talking a little magic.
I speak a little English.
I speak a little English.
I'm talking about a little rice.
I'll talk to you about it.
I'm talking about Russians.
At least I speak French every day.
I speak French and English.
I speak Spanish.
I've been with him all day.
I've been with them all day.
I moved all my money.
I've spent all my money.
I moved all the money I had to buy the book.
I was happy for an hour until I found out where I had to go.
I spent the first phase of my life in the incubator.
I spent my early life in the Incubator.
I spent the afternoon with my friends.
I spent the whole day digging in front of my machine.
I've been sitting down for three years for a crime I didn't follow.
I've been sitting down for three years for what I didn't follow.
I told you too soon.
They're waiting for Citrus in my chest.
Can we get the rainwater?
Russia Europe or Asia?
Is he so important?
Is she your mother?
Is it close to Sicily Máltá?
I've had paper all day, and now I'm pregnant.
I began to doubt his claim.
I'm stuck.
The tea is more expensive than the tea?
Are you satisfied?
Is this the deal's cousin?
Titok?
Is that right?
Is that appropriate?
Is the body in the picture, or is there a photo?
Is the body in the picture or is it on?
Is this my baby?
Did they get this in the middle of it?
Is that a problem for you?
Is that really money?
Is there a scientific basis for this?
Did you count on something like that?
Is that how hard it is to understand?
Is that the problem?
Right?
But is that true?
Is that what everyone wants?
Is the cat in the chair, or is it under it?
Clear the part?
Is the competition so bad?
Is the microphone connected?
Is the museum open today?
Do they have doctors?
Are you free?
Is there a meter in your city?
Is there a lift here?
Any doubts?
Is there anything else about this?
Is there anything between you guys?
Is there anything else you want to know?
Do I have to do something?
You want to say something, Tom?
What's up?
Do you have a place to live?
Is there life before death?
Is there something you'd rather like?
Do you have a uranium in Iran?
Is the cook alive, or is he dead?
Is this baby boy or girl?
Is this going?
Isn't it ethical?
Is this a fake?
Is this death still alive?
Is that a salesman?
Is that a salesman?
Is that it?
Is this my place or yours?
Is that really alcohol-free?
Is this really Jankovics Tamás' funeral?
Is that a seat?
Is that the right word?
Is this the road to make a living?
Does that mean he wants to be crazy about something?
Is that hard to understand?
Is this the key you're looking for?
Is that worth it?
Is this your home love?
You call this a pet?
Is she your girlfriend?
Is that your money?
I still don't remember anything.
I still can't tell you why.
That was seven or eight years, exactly where were you?
I still don't understand anything.
I still don't know why you did it.
I still have plenty of time to play.
There's one or two more things you need to put in your skin.
I still need to get up in the morning.
I still think that's the best choice.
Tom's Christian?
Tom's fine?
Tom's a good guy?
Tom's a good teacher?
Tommy's alive?
- Tom America? - No, Canadians.
I don't know, I'll call and ask.
Tom's dead?
Is Tom here?
Are you kidding me?
Tom's gone?
Tom Mária's son?
Tom's ready?
Still sick?
I was standing with her.
I brought you today, but you weren't home.
I stopped talking.
I'm learning two hours every day from her grandmother.
I'm studying at school with a lot of interest.
I suggest you talk to Mari.
I suggest you talk to Tom.
I think you're already packed and ready for launch.
I must have heard this sound somewhere.
I swear I'm gonna hurt you.
I'm a regular drinker.
Two and a half miles a day.
Does your daughter feel better?
Are you doing a dangerous job?
Is your mother home?
Is your mom home?
No doubt you're not married to him.
This affects everyone.
It doesn't always end until we're out of it.
I'll take your place.
I'll work every day.
I spoke to Tom a couple of times.
They're just waiting for you.
He's out of nothing.
You'd better be your sister.
This goes with the love I feel about you.
It's a lot more crazy than I thought.
These two euros are the price.
It could be a problem.
It could be expensive.
It would be a shame to see all the work done.
He's obviously excavated.
It didn't hurt.
I wasn't wrong.
That didn't help much.
The ship didn't stop.
There's no way we're going to be talking about it.
It's cold to let you come.
You're not doing anything!
Everything that started and why.
It doesn't seem so complicated anymore.
That doesn't seem right.
You teach Chinese.
It's like I've been attacked.
I've come to realize that I missed him.
It was the last day.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for your confidence in me.
This happened at the beginning of the previous week.
This is exactly what happened on our wedding day, honey.
Something had to happen to be this.
It happened immediately.
That was when he was out.
It happened to me several times.
Sometimes it happens.
He's staying with everyone.
It's not good.
He's got his own value.
It's been raining for two years.
I think every single person should have a diet.
I think everybody's hungry.
I don't think he can help you.
I think you're gonna be okay with your neighbors.
I'll find your queen.
I think he took some movies.
I think I'm capable of it.
I don't think I could kill you.
I don't think I could kill him.
I don't think I understand.
I feel better.
I think there's an answer.
I think I'm taking Tom.
I think I'm dying.
I think I'm starting to lose my head.
I think I'm ready to change.
I think I need more time.
It's like I've seen a pack.
I think I still have time to do that before Tom's time.
I think that's better.
I think it's right.
Very little probability, I think you'll be able to do it yourself.
I think he's leaving.
I think it's time for a career change.
I feel like it's time to keep a quiet.
I don't think that's fair.
I think so.
I think Tom was the one who helped Mari.
I think it'd be better if you left now.
I think I'm thinking better.
I think my neighbor might have died.
I think you're gonna be okay with your neighbors.
I think there's someone in the door.
I think something's wrong.
I'm gonna find the cops.
I think he's home right now.
I think I'm thinking better.
I think he's coming.
I think Tom said something else.
I think you should forget this.
I think that would explain everything.
I think I'm drinking.
I think I'll be there.
I think there's no point in trying to convince him.
I think they've done a great job.
I think that's exactly what Tom wants.
I don't think that's gonna be enough.
I think this medicine will do you good.
I think time will solve this problem.
I think Tom was there already.
I think it's Tommy's supervisor.
I think Tom's still out of work.
I think Tom's probably hungry.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I think Tom needs more.
I think Tamás wants to do it tomorrow.
I think Tom will be able to help.
I think Tamás won.
I think we'll deal with him.
I think we should be patient.
I think we've turned into a bad direction.
I think we should be careful.
I think we're safe now.
I think you're all locked up now.
I think you called a bad number.
I think you know him.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know what the name of Tamás' girlfriend is.
I think you're gonna be okay.
I think you look great.
I think you'd like it.
I think you got it.
I think you should go in private.
I think you're the best girl I've ever seen.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I think your job is very good.
I think you're welcome.
I don't think you've been convincing enough.
I think you were right.
I thought about Tom.
I thought if we were going to eat somewhere, we'd get it.
I thought I could trust you.
I thought I'd go with him.
I thought I knew him.
I thought maybe something was going on.
I thought it was clear what I wanted.
I thought my head was worse.
I've been thinking about my future.
I had a good idea of holding the key under the trigger, but it didn't prove it.
I thought Tommy was still living in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought Tom was coming.
I thought Tom was still home.
I thought you were him.
I threatened the neighbor to kill him.
That hurts!
It hurts.
I'm under his influence.
It had a great effect on me.
It's dangerous!
It's a historical phenomenon.
It's hard to get through the practice that he was talking about.
It's hard for everyone to get into love.
It's hard for everyone to do it.
I have doubts as to whether it's going to work.
It's getting too late.
He's gone.
We're in half an hour after night.
Some people are hard to understand.
It's the best time to start a new business.
It's important that we promote our language in every way possible.
I mean, you're wrong.
It's in the kitchen.
That's great!
They're gone.
This is my bedroom.
We need to get ready for the future.
You need a good little rest.
It's never too late to learn.
I'm glad to see you again.
It's not easy to solve the problem.
You can't turn the trigger off.
This isn't the best solution.
That's not the right solution.
It's not too much to say he's a genius.
It's not a secret.
I'm not the one with Tom's problem.
It's not that expensive.
This is not the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not working.
Maybe he's lying.
They don't want to talk to you.
It's late.
Still moving.
Well, it's really bad today.
I love you so much!
Thirty feet long.
It's time to go to bed.
It's a very easy task for him.
You're going to die.
This is useful information.
The heat is great tonight.
It's very important that you wash your hands thoroughly after the baby's play.
It just didn't work.
It'll be dangerous.
It's gonna be time for us to go home.
He'll be ready when he needs to.
It'll be ready for you when you have to.
It's gonna take a little time to add to your eyebrows.
He'll soon catch up with you.
It's gonna work if I get rid of the polarities.
As a result, it looks bigger.
It looks good.
Looks like I don't need you here.
It's gonna be a mess.
Looks like you don't feel anything good here.
Looks like you've been thinking about everything.
That makes me sad.
That's what it means.
It could be a long time.
Maybe it's a trap.
It can save your life.
Maybe we'd enjoy it if we tried.
Maybe I'll be late.
You have to wash.
You have to report something.
It must have been love.
They must've been stolen.
You need to fix it.
It never existed.
It should never have happened.
But I lied to him that I didn't want to.
I told him I'd do the best I could.
I told him to come.
I told Tomina not to give up.
I told Tom where I got my bike.
I told you, but you didn't listen to me.
I told you I'm fine.
I told you not to go.
I told you three weeks ago.
I told you to like you, Tommy.
I'd have a question, too.
I've been through so much.
I've been in the cage for a long time.
I've got it.
I went on the 58th trip.
I was sure you were on our side.
I took my cat to the zoo yesterday.
I took my shoes off.
I've completely forgotten.
It'd probably be cheaper somewhere else.
The rain fell yesterday.
Yesterday.
There's so much.
I'll walk two hours a day.
I traveled all over Russia.
I've brought in the United States in a search-and-run.
It's actually working.
It's really sad.
I tried everything to keep him alive.
I tried to forget.
I tried to help Tominak.
I'd save my life, too.
I'm trying to keep you informed.
I'm trying to get my thoughts together.
That's nice.
It's a great cat.
It's a little early for Italianism, isn't it?
It's a horrible word.
It's a comfortable situation.
It's a dictionary.
Good plan, at least paper.
It's a pretty stone wall.
It's a pet dog.
It's half an hour.
It's a hot day.
It's a kitchen.
Kint's completely dark.
It's all mine.
It's all right, it's over.
That's nice and good, but will it work in practice?
That's all your fault.
It's been seven hours.
It's already in progress.
It's ten o'clock tonight.
One of my dreams was always that I was living with a couple.
Always the same note.
A environmental disaster.
It's an Osman business, Watson, an Osman, a dangerous business, and the more I see, the less he likes.
How bad!
Nice to meet you.
I'm glad Tommy's leaving.
It's a pretty big box.
It's a dream.
That's ridiculous.
It's just as art as much as science.
That's the past.
He's in school.
It's a very dangerous sport where a little mistake can lead to serious injury.
It's a very old book.
Money-saving.
It's a funny question.
That's terrible.
It was a crazy week.
It was a long day.
It was a wonderful trip.
It's a terrible day.
It's hard today.
That's what happened before.
It wasn't a week.
It's been two years since she left.
That's better.
It's better to lock the court at night.
Fireplace.
Me.
It's better to get to the bus.
That's Chinese to me.
There's a lock on Sunday.
It's closed every Sunday.
It's closed on Thursday.
It's closed on Thursday.
It's cold at home.
It's cold.
Kind's hiding.
Why don't you get yourself a bottle?
It's connected that the bear loves the honey.
Everything Tom did or didn't do.
That's totally normal.
All right now.
It's dangerous here.
It's deep here.
That's very nice.
It's ready.
It's not easier to start than to quit.
It's easy to be brave from Messer.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't love Mari.
It seemed to me to be an eternity.
Looks like the bus was ready.
That sounds totally ridiculous.
Looks like it was just yesterday that we went to school together.
Looks like nothing's changed.
It's very weird.
Looks like it.
Looks like he's lying.
Looks like Tom's not blind.
It's like you don't want this to happen to me.
I think you're worth it.
I think you're wrong.
Looks like we're going to be an extraordinary guest.
It's Chinese to prepare for a race.
That's exactly what they want.
Honey.
It's funny if they get the same pay for the same job.
It's not perfect.
He's out of the idealist.
This is yours.
You know, it's funny.
Let's get out of here.
You're starting to be perfect.
It's gonna be hard.
It won't be easy.
It's good to see you starved.
It's a good idea to be.
It's good to study.
It's great that he could come.
That's good.
It's not hard to come to that conclusion.
It's hard to believe that until now it was clear and clear.
It's hard to describe.
It's hard to find a way to sleep in this city.
It's hard to put it in words.
It's hard to say.
It's hard to steal a towel.
It's beautiful.
He's got a big head count.
Magas.
The kids are already in bed.
You're gonna stop with the money.
Tonight's more fun than usual.
That's illegal.
It's important.
It's important that parents stand on one side when the line is raised.
It's important that we help them get into trouble.
That's impossible for me.
You have to fill in here.
You can't get air in here.
It's impossible to meet your expectations.
It's impossible to make your terms.
I don't know what tomorrow will bring.
Unbelievably, you know?
That's inevitable.
It's inspiring.
It's just a feeling.
It's just earlier.
It's just a matter of time for Tom to get in trouble again.
It's just a phone.
I just don't want to die today.
It's pretty hard.
That's pretty serious.
It's really nice of you to go home.
It's nice to say that.
It's too late.
It's funny.
Like a seabed field, and the engineers, the spiders, and the cats were like flying creatures.
It's closed.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me!
It's me.
It's amazing how he lives.
It's too cold for the shower.
This is my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's what I think.
That's my skin color.
Now I'm on the line.
It's never too late for you to be what you could have been.
It's none of your business.
It's not a bad idea.
It's not a bank.
Not as protective as it sounds.
He didn't even bother.
That's not enough.
This isn't gonna happen.
You're not going to change Egypt.
It's not mine.
It's not my fault.
It can't be negotiated.
It's not that far.
It's not that simple.
This is not the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not what it looks like.
It doesn't matter what you do, but it's how you do it.
It's not important to get pregnant.
I didn't talk to you.
I didn't tell you.
I didn't tell you.
You don't have any reason to question the priest if you don't testify to a crime.
It doesn't make sense to wake up in the past.
I'm sorry.
He's obviously broken up.
Of course not.
It's obviously weird.
Obviously, it's very painful.
It doesn't matter if some of them keep their mouth shut.
It's okay if the man gets away.
- Three months has passed, and Tommy has already said that she is talking to France. - Well, she's so stupid. — What is it? — Dunning-Kruger-Effect.
Only three days.
The park is on the other side.
It sounds good!
It's over, isn't it?
It's over.
It's personal.
It's so sweet, like I'm getting out of smoke.
She cut out her tears.
It's amazing.
It's probably convincing.
It's pretty simple.
It is quite obvious that these misanthropical ideas aim to reveal in the assessment of the work force, despite the responsibility of imperialism for bloody wars that have been committed by them, and to ignore the idea of losing its own mind, as well as the violent behavior of people who have been involved in the war of the end.
Yeah, he's urgent.
There's rain in my heart.
It's a little big garden in Japan.
Really, isn't it?
That's really a big deal.
He's gone.
It's impossible to ask someone how much he's looking for.
They say they're beautiful girls.
They say they're leaving Tokyo soon.
Shit!
It's just overwhelming.
It's raining here.
He's in Boston now.
It's so good to stay here!
Still moving.
It's suicide.
It's technically possible.
This is the best book I've ever read.
This is the least I can do.
Probably possible.
It's the same for everyone.
The same old problem.
You still have to answer that.
It's time for us to take our seats.
It's time for us to get out of here.
It's time to go.
Time!
It's time to fix the problem.
I'm supposed to have my hair cut off.
It's an idea to relax.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
It's best time for us to do something about it.
Tom has his birthday today.
This is Tom's decision.
Tommy's word is against Mari's word.
There's already too much dark to get rid of.
That's sweet to me.
It's too hot for this.
It's too late.
It's too late to worry about this.
It's a typical ancient time.
It's a terrible thing to be scared of.
It's round, clumsy, and it's not harmonizing with anything, but at least they don't get out of the dark.
It's under the table.
Maybe not as stupid as you think.
It's not likely anything serious will happen.

It was just too easy.
I told you.
That's what I wanted.
It was almost a nightmare.
It was not long before John had an idea of an attack on him.
It wasn't a very interesting reign.
It wasn't easy for me.
I didn't just keep my promise.
It was a lunch break.
He wasn't interested.
I wasn't the one who locked the door.
It wasn't my fault.
It wasn't worth it.
It wasn't our fault.
It wasn't that bad.
It wasn't the first time they did it.

It takes five or ten years for technology to be prepared.
It's going to be back.
It's gonna happen.
He'll eat a week if he doesn't get up tomorrow.
This will threaten the welfare of the city.
We don't have to come back tomorrow.
You don't have to do that anymore.
You don't take much time.
It worked well.
It works perfectly on the iPhone home.
That would be dangerous.
It'd be the other one.
I wish I could get out of here.
It would be pointless.
That would have been better if it had already been arranged.
It wouldn't be brave, it would be stupid.
It would have been better if we hadn't done it.
I underestimated Tom.
I see.
I understand it's not easy for you, but don't worry.
I know what you're talking about, but I don't know what you're talking about.
I understand what you're saying, but I don't hear it.

I was in my dream.
I was crazy to trust Tom.
I was afraid I'd never see him again.
I'm afraid I'll never see you again.
I was alone.
You missed me already.
I missed you already.

Ten years later, they're out.
I had such a lovely look that I had to print the bed for a week.

I've had a little sleep.
I thought so.
I was just about to do this.

I was right here when I was ten, but you didn't.

I was in Boston when this happened.
I went to Rome.
I was in the hospital for three weeks.
I was just in the mail.
I'd just start writing a letter when I came home.
They've been kidnapped.
I'm ready to leave the meeting because of the shower.
I just made a toast.
I was married at the time.
It's the story that started.
I was nervous.
He almost hit a car.
I was perfect.
At first, I was nervous, but then I calmed down.
I didn't need it anymore.
I couldn't answer a question in the test.
I wasn't born here, but I grew up here.
I didn't laugh.
Then I wasn't ready for it.
I didn't sleep.
I didn't think so.
I was one of the best teachers in the class.
I was just kidding.
I was on the bus.
I was on the list.
I'm so scared of you.

I was sitting in Bern in a chair at the office of freedom when I was attacked by a sudden thought: if a man is free, he doesn't feel his own weight.
I sat with Tommy.
I couldn't talk.
I was with her.
I was still home then.
I've been in the shower for a few minutes.
It's amazing what I've learned.
I was surprised that I found the door open.
I was surprised when I found out that Tom was a Frenchman before.
They taught me to sit first and then ask questions.
I was the greatest man in the world.
I was the last one I saw him.
I was the only one who didn't call it.
I was the only one who survived.
I used to be there to get a good place.
I used to be there.
I'd like to think about it.

I wish I could fly!
If I could fly!
Even if I could do it alone!
I wish I could be a car.
I wish I had bought a ticket to the concert.
I wish I hadn't seen such a horrible movie!
I wish I could.
I wish I had learned harder in my younger years.
I wish I knew where he was.
I wish I were.
Even if I know as much as you do.
If I could be more honest.
I wouldn't be like that.
If only I could be different.
I wish I could raise my wife.
I'd like you to be our air-conditioned classroom.
I wish Tom would come home.
I want a good way.
I want you to have a birthday.
I wish you were here.
I wish you wouldn't have looked like you were very fun.
You wouldn't be right, but I know you're right.
I wish you had done that early in the morning.
I wish you'd let Tom finish his story.
Even if you don't.
I wish you wouldn't do that now.
I woke up.
I almost woke up.
I thought about what Tom wanted.
I felt like others would look just as much like me.
I'm thinking about how I could do better.
Well, that's how much you can do.
I'm hoping it works.
Are you sure about the weather tomorrow?
Is it home?
Is there any easier way to do this?
Is there a man named Tamás here?
I'm curious if Tom's gonna be here tomorrow.
I'm curious what happened to Paul.
What did the painter want to say with this?
I think the Sun or the Moon is bigger.
I'm curious if Tom can come or not.
Who's got this?
Who's responsible?
Why did you ask?
Why is that so expensive?
I want to know why Tommy didn't come to Mari's party.
I got it!
I'm not going to be home tonight.
I'm not coming.
That's why I'm not going to break up.
I'm not going to force you to go and do it, but the consequences will be if you don't.
I'm not going to force you to go and do it, but the consequences will be if you don't.

I'm working too much.
I suggest you get to the airport in time.
If I were in your place, I'd ask him.
I'd be crazy if I didn't tell him the truth.
I'd be stupid to tell him nothing.
I'd be much more productive if I didn't waste my time on the Internet.
They'd like to.
I'd do it if I had more time.
I'd love it, but I don't have time.
I'd go to the museum if it was my time.

I wouldn't say that.
I won't say it's right, and I won't say it's wrong.
I don't want to work with Tom.
I don't want you to get a bad impression on me.
I'd pay for it if I could see it.
