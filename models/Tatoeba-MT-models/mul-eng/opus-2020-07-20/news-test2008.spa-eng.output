European inflation has declined in food
The accelerated inflation, recorded in the euro area, is due primarily to a fair increase in the price of food products.
The price increase in November has been higher than expected in the 13 countries in the euro area, registering - after 2.6 percent of October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent - was announced by the Union Statistics Office in Luxembourg.
The official forecasts were only likely 3 percent - Bloomberg announced.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, British and Canadian banks, did not reduce the basic interest, provided that the reduction, together with the price increases in raw materials and the reduction of forced steel, would lead to a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to maintain the inflation rate below, but at least two per cent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: "You have to negotiate" on inflation so that it will not have to intervene on this subject later.
The inflation of 3.3 per cent, recorded in Germany, doubled the record for 12 years, while in Spain it increased from 3.6 to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation was released in the euro area as a result of food and energy price fluctuations.
The rate at the end of wheat increased by 88 per cent, and soybean tariff has reached its maximum level since 1973.
Similarly, much more was to be paid in 2007 for plant oil and milk products.
The price of crude oil in the world market increased this year by 52 percent, reaching the last month's black gold nearly $100 in the barrel.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will rise from 2.1 per cent to 2.5 per cent, in exchange for 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, annual inflation will be maintained in the next 3 or 4 months by approximately 3 per cent, but the average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, it is expected that during 2008 the ECB will reduce interest rates twice.
Gallup predicts a government crisis
After a long delay, for the beginning of December the support of the Youth Democratic Alliance increased significantly, reaching its maximum level since 2002, while the Gallup had never experienced such a low level - a 13 per cent - in the case of socialists.
The difference in the case of the parties' security voters - due to the strongest strength of the opposition electors - would mean support for more than two thirds (one 71 percent) in front of the support of a fifth party for socialists (about 20 percent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not even reach the limit necessary to have some parliamentary level: their support within the whole population is of two percent.
Among the safe voters there are one hundred more sympathy in both bands.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even in comparison with the lowest point in the past - it has never been so high, 41 per cent of those who judged the country's economic situation particularly poor, while another 46 per cent believe that the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimists about changing their own economic situation.
With regard to the next year, the majority of the population is experiencing the deterioration of the situation and only one tenth of the population expects an improvement.
In December, 71 per cent of the consultants, a figure higher than any previous Gallup survey, felt that the President of Government was doing better than his functions.
The 13 per cent of the consultants rely on or rely heavily on Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 per cent of the consultants.
54 per cent of the population does not fully trust the Head of Government and 27 per cent do not trust the President of the Democratic Youth Alliance.
One of the indicators of the political situation configuration is that, what proportion of society considers it possible to control the dissatisfaction experienced against the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While some 35 per cent felt it would be desirable to maintain power to the Government and the Head of Government, this proportion is currently only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (about 33 per cent) believes that the only solution is the holding of new elections.
The interest in the reference was characterized by the fact that 60 per cent of respondents to the question of participation replied that they would surely participate and 20 per cent said that they were likely to participate.
Comparably, in "a general election to be held on this Sunday", only 55 per cent of the population would participate safely and 15 per cent would probably believe their participation. Based on the current intentions of the electors, there is no doubt that the outcome of the popular consultation.
74 per cent of the population would deny the payment of study rights, 79 per cent of medical advice services and 84 per cent of hospital care.
If we observed only these proportions among the insured participants in the reference, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of the electors would refuse the introduction of study rights, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The dearest is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintupled its prices
The average price increase was maintained by 16 percent of the hypermarkets of the Budaörs gold triangle, with the difference that the VAT has not been increased this year.
Article of the Napi Economy
This year also increased in an average of 16 percent in the Buddhist gold trade triangle the usual Christmas Canal of the Napi newspaper, but in all hypermarkets there was a very high growth of thousands of HUFs.
As in December last year prices in food supermarkets had already been "dissipated", there was no evidence that there was a percentage drop in traffic compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obvious to consumers that what last year they could buy at a very price below the nine thousand HUF, they can't do it today even ten thousand.
Napi canasta in the hypermarkets studied exceeded a minimum of 91 HUF the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF.
And the highest value canasse was 10,573 HUF.
(In 2003 that canast cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of the unique liqueur and the fishery remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a strong increase in the cotton, cotton, and apple seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data from the Central Statistics Office, although in the Auchan we also found a kilo of bread at the price of 139 HUF.
The competition does not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was equally surprising in this store that the price of Coca-Cola with a two-litre convertible bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so this product, including the bottle price, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in Napi Auchan's canast was the best face, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with respect to Christmas prices last year, Cora increased by 15, while Tesco and Auchan with about 18 percent of the prices in the Napi canasta.
Comparing the values of the most expensive canast last year with that of the cheapest canast of this year, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between the cheapest of the last year and the most expensive of this year has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price increase was 1206 HUF, so during Christmas last year the increase in VAT was felt.
This process was precisely what destroyed trade, the supermarkets were apparently unable to decide on the price margin to apply for each product and to calculate the effect of changing consumer prices.
(If the trader plans the speed of the movement of a product, it may lose an important benefit within the margin adjusted to the volume of sales.)
The increase in the price of the Napi canast reached these extremes due to the increase in VAT, which was higher than 1720 HUF at the recorded value in 2006, while the cheaper the difference was only of 844 HUF.
This year did not produce such extremes, as the highest price from now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased by 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two navigable periods, a catastrophic increase in prices was recorded in less than 20 months, and in the hypermarkets, more than 30 per cent increased the price of first-needed consumer goods.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Statistics Office: this office, in the case of some first-needed foods, recorded a price increase of more than 30 per cent over 12 months.
For example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of eggs.)
According to the Canary Islands of Napi, in this latter case this seems almost impossible, since in the price of this product that was quite expensive last year compared to the base, it was recorded, in the worst cases, only 10 percent of price increases.
According to all the indexes, flour suppliers have a stronger position than eggs, which could impose a dramatic increase in prices even to multinationals.
Hypermarketers do not complain about the gold trade triangle, they constantly speak of positive results.
According to our experiences, most consumers of the three visited shops are no longer interested in prices.
From all products they buy large quantities, carrying the preserved food in pallets.
In the morning of the Wednesday morning, the three stores formed large chairs in front of the boxes because the number of customers increased rapidly.
However, we have information that, within the country, sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain about the investigation institutes because income remains below their schedules and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of electro-dominated ones.
In many hospitals it is saved with disinfectants
This year several thousand infections were first reported in hospitals due to the inappropriate application of antibiotics.
Reinforced hygiene conditions in hospitals, washing the beds and overloading of personnel do not favour the control of infections - says the chief medical officer of the National Center for Epidemiology.
In many hospitals it is even saved with disinfectants.
Not long ago a contact with MRSA was diagnosed in the traumatology department of János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of the bacteria resistant to antibiotics was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same kind of contact occurred in this same hospital at the beginning of the year.
A serious car accident was caused by a hospital and the same patient had to return to the hospital as a result of the infection with MRSA and since then there has been no significant surgical intervention due to the presence of the bacteria in its body.
Up to 10 December this year, cases of multiple-resisting hospital infections have been recorded in the National System Noscomialis Monitoring 1094, said Karolina Böröcz, chief medical officer of the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that in hospitals with full safety this number of infections caused by multi-resisting agents has not been reported.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) are due to the MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to methiciline-oxacilin.
A third of the human beings carry the bacteria of Staphyloccus aureus (SA) without causing any disease.
The infections produced by the SA (e.g., inflammation of the throat, friendshipalitis, Cutan infection, infections of wounds) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once the antibiotics are applied excessively or indirectly, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics are converted into very resistant bacteria to antibiotics and rapidly contact them in inadequate hospital conditions.
Serious hospital infections, such as infections of wounds or sepsis, may occur primarily in patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, in patients with weakened body, in elderly people or in people with low weight.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of János Hospital there is nothing special in the MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, the MRSA is only missing - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Antibiotics Resistant
"These patients are isolated, the nursing staff look at rubber and masks and there are appropriate antibiotics for their treatment," Tibor Nyulasi said.
Hospitalled patients are previously examined to verify the presence of MRSA in their body, but not even so can the infection be avoided in all cases.
Can not get folder: %s: %s
It would be possible to prevent MRSA's hospital infections in most cases, although the current national hospital conditions do not favour the prevention of training and contact with multi-resisting pathogen agents - says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection is essentially occurring in hospitals and elderly homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients carrying the MRSA in their body.
In Hungarian hospitals, however, the use of microbiological samples is not modest.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Box does not finance these medical examinations.
So that most of the cases come to the public light when there are already visible MRSA infections in the patient - said the departmental doctor of the epidemiological center.
The European Union is committed to the implementation of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to address pathological infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapy should be undertaken in order to prevent resistance to medications, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
The use of microbiological samples is even less common in the case of ambulatory patients or in basic assistance - Karolina Böröcz said.
Protect with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is infected from one patient to another through health personnel.
Therefore, they play a very important role in washing hands, using rubber gloves and masks, but also in this regard there are significant deficiencies in hospitals.
MRSA is infected by the transmission of cats and direct contact between persons, but in national hospital conditions it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
In addition, hospital rooms are often torn apart, beds are often very close, although patients should be separated at least for at least a distance of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, it can also be experienced - Karolina Böröcz added - that in less favourable economic conditions hospitals, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a greater likelihood of infection.
In the opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate prevention measures are carried out, fewer infections of this type are recorded or can be prevented from contacting the pathogen agent.
Government programme against MRSA
The treatment of contact with MRSA is a huge cost for the National Fund for Disease Security, which is why all countries are fighting against it.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce cases of MRSA.
The programme appears to be successful, according to the data provided, infections with MRSA show a trend of decline in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistance agents (including MRSA) and hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative control of the police commander's alcoholism caused by a fatal accident
The periodic official report on the case of the fatal accident caused by the district police commander XXII has been made.
It may be excluded from the possibility of driving Jews or in the state of halted by the then abandoned commander of the district police in XXII, who was arrested on Tuesday and caused the death of a transcontinent - reported the Friday Attila Morvia, a spokesman from the Capital General Prosecutor General, after the periodic report on the case was prepared.
The periodic report confirmed the results of primary alcohol control that had already been found that the former police commander had not consumed alcoholic beverages before leaving the flight.
The chief of the district police then, on Tuesday with his special vehicle on the Kossuth Layos street of the District XXII, met a 55-year-old man who wanted to cross the street, but not in the area designated for petons.
(This last fact, i.e. that the peton did not use the brain to cross the road, according to the rules of the Transit Code, there are no emerging circumstances, the driver must always take the step to double.)
The transcontinent lost his life after being hospitalized.
As a result, the district police officer resigned and requested his residency, as reported by the police, because he was very moved by the case.
The case investigation is carried out by the Budapest Investigation Office.
Attila Morva also said that the former police commander had been cooperating with the prosecutor’s prosecutors.
EUR 400 million more for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed three credit-limited agreements in Budapest on a total value of EUR 400 million to finance education, transport and the environment infrastructure, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance projects in the Hungarian budget for transport and environmental protection, which will be implemented from the grant of cohesion funds, from which the parties had previously signed a credit contract of EUR 100 million, the contract they had just signed on the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement is also intended to finance the budget of educational projects.
The EIB adopted a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose in Hungary, with a view to the use of the remaining EUR 150 million, the decision will be taken later, by extending the credit contract.
The parties signed a contract of EUR 50 million for innovation, which the budget will mainly use for the project of innovations and research at Debrecen University.
During the discussions they also covered the theme of the construction of the 4th Metro line.
The agreement was reached that for Hungary to finalise the details of the Metro financing with the EU, they will again address the issue whether or not it is necessary to amend the original contract and how to do so.
According to Janos Veres, this may take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed totally 113 projects in Hungary with EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest in the appropriations shall be adjusted to EURIBOR and the EIB shall provide an 8-year grace period without charge to the committee for maintaining the credit available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - the attention of all Europe is directed towards that Balkan country just mentioned.
What, where and who are buying on the EU market even cheaper, will soon be happening?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred goal for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly some Bulgaria, with its cheap ski resorts and beach chalets.
The mountain regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamproto and Vitosa are the most preferred, while in the beaches of Albena, the "Costa Dorada", the "Costa del Sol", the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for real estates around Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, late or early the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will awaken the interest of real estate promoters and will increasingly buy real estate in the particularly cheap area of Russia.
Similarly, the capital of Sofia can be attractive, commercial spaces and offices promise rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of Europe's most attractive golf parks, which could also be a destination highlighted during the other two stations, in addition to summer and winter.
Thus, the early investors are already making their purchases, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
According to analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria are also trying to change their life and way of life.
Most customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
The Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present, and there are traditionally many Russian customers on the beaches of the Black Sea and on the ice paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to install here buy new or renovated furniture at a price of between EUR 50 and EUR 100 billion or well old houses in bad condition between EUR 5 and EUR 15 billion, to renew them later.
They need good communication and access, and it is also important for them to be close to a large city, shops and generally a local doctor.
The second category is the purchasers of chalets (Bulgaria in December was included among the first 10 German vacation destinations).
The third group consists of real estate investors who make their purchases with a view to gaining medium or long-term benefits.
The price of capital property is constantly rising, as demand is growing.
Although Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, in the last five years these have suffered an annual increase of 21 percent
The increase in the price of real estate is considerably higher than the increase in wages.
Fodor and six hundred Hungarians
According to the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, the expert-level meetings will be concluded on Tuesday and Wednesday after official opening, the negotiations will continue at ministerial level on the post-2012 international climate regime.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries in the world will discuss the Bali Road Round, which is available for the post-mission reduction period, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, which will continue until 2012.
There are currently encouraging discussions on the particularness of developing countries and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that it does not currently wish to negotiate accurate figures, although it intends to reach agreement that, compared to the 1990 situation, by 2020, the emissions of greenhouse gases decreased by 25 to 40 per cent by 2020.
Another major theme of the conference is whether industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are or are not willing to provide material and technological assistance to the countries that need it.
A further agreement was reached on assistance to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be directed by a 16-member integrated management board, probably within the United Nations Environment Fund (GEF) - writes the "Piac is profit".
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister for Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to preserve its role in global climate protection and to promote the signing of the new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing to 20 per cent of its greenhouse gas emissions by 1990 level, regardless of whether or not the "after-2012 agreement" will be signed, and is willing to undertake to reduce even 30 per cent if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to undertake commitments in accordance with their responsibilities and capacities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries signatories to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committed to a decrease of 5.2 per cent, within which 15 EU Member States committed to the achievement of 8 per cent reduction.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases by 6 per cent over the period 1985-87, which our country will comply with - the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
It is very much in place in Bali, since within two years it will have to sign the international climate policy agreement for a long time, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force would slow down after 2012, in this case the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, which was needed in its most recent report by the IPCC, an international scientific association of the United Nations dealing with climate change, which had received the Nobel Peace Prize.
As a result, emission reduction would suffer a delay and would not prevent an increase of more than 2o C of the earth's average temperature, which according to scientists would have irreversibly and irreversibly consequences.
The British Army Recruited on YouTube
British army units in a video distributor publish recordings of filmed actions in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
The British Air Force (RAD) was the first to use YouTube services: the special units transferred to Afghanistan since March 2006 are loading videos on their actions against the Taliban - the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on helmets are controlled in the general Kandahar operation body, then sent to London to be loaded on the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
There have already been 139 recordings from Air Force soldiers that have been loaded in this way on the Internet and their "channel" has already been seen by over 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in spring 2007 under the name "headquarters defense" and published videos of both actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, while both the Ministry of the United Kingdom Community (Commonweight Office) and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
The air force had originally loaded the videos with recruitment objectives, but in the view of the Ministry of Defence, they also served to present to the public the real objective of the British army's presence abroad.
This type of propaganda virtually costs nothing compared to conventional employment television spots - the BBC declared the defence expert Gordon Mackenzie - in turn, obviously have some political message, since they specifically justify the reason for being military actions decided by the government.
The Americans prepared a video game
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the rapidly edited and censored recordings, video videos are also displayed in the distributor, for example about the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a few hypocritics, officials speak as a maximum of losses, without presenting the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, many videos already recorded in real operations have been posted from the Iraq and Afghanistan's war camps, but the British army is only recently taking advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form for recruitment with shooting video games, free downloadable, called America's Army, in which in a more or less real situation the player can be placed directly instead of soldiers.
Table and salad salad at the Ministry's Christmas party
The Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth does not seem very sensitive: instead of the Navy party, he will hold a working meeting for his colleagues who will be able to leave in 2007 with salad and coffee pastry.
There is a ministry that will celebrate its festival with live music, otherwise the sea atmosphere will create in the hearts of public officials with pitch and a brandy.
Festival, Christmas environment, concerts and buffet - so enjoy the power.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The largest Christmas festival will be held in the Ministry of Defence, but not for the staff of the Ministry.
The children of the wounded soldiers will be given a gift to the families of the soldiers currently carrying out missions abroad. A reception will also be offered for the press.
This card will be allocated to 25 million for the festival environment at the end of the year.
The National Promotion Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will celebrate a joyous festival with regard to the parties to the other charters
The MET party will be held in the House of Future, with a total budget of 4,320,000 HUF and six hundred ministerial workers are expected to be present at approximately three hundred and fifty.
At the party of the party, there will be a Christmas environment, artists will also act, and there will be lots of luck.
The NAF's presence was 4,700,000 HUF and the Wednesdays were held in the building of the National Administration of Justice Council (CNAJ) with musical and dinner concerts.
The rent of the room cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers from one of the ALF departments are also invited to another Christmas party that will host a competition management company called the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the complete building of the Theatro de la Commedia.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, since we cannot communicate with the person concerned.
Can be visited without a trace
The CNAJ building not only hosted the ANF festival, but also the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of Christmas held the dance of the day of Lucía on 7 December.
The CNAJ of them had nothing to do with the use of their facilities.
Fifty people participated in the dance.
The party began with the Minister's greetings and after the dinner there was a live music.
Responding to the question of [orgo] they reported: to attend the dance was not mandatory to wear or wear night clothing.
Health cards, work and local administrations are prepared for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and party for its staff in its own building with a budget of 400 000 HUF.
On the other hand, the Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth does not expect his colleagues for an official Navy party, but for a work meeting at the end of the year.
The participation of the hundreds of guests who - as you will inform the press department - will take only coffee and salad, so the party will not cost more than 350 000 HUF.
The Minister for Local Government, Gordon Bajnai, in exchange, will simply provide his colleagues at the Ministerial School for Local Government and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will celebrate a navies festival in its own workshop with 436 workers participating.
The Navy party will have a 2500 HUF budget per guest - from this budget will be paid the reception with buffet and a toast.
Since János Veres is the minister, MF workers celebrate Christmas in the same way every year.
Instead, there will be no festival atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial talk but also by the afternoon of its celebration.
The agricultural map will offer a New Year's reception on 20 January, and Christmas will not be celebrated in the Ministry.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park, and according to the map, there will be a 1000 HUF budget per person for hundreds of guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple foot reception, which will be invited only to specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a short ministerial health talk and end with a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas party - that is what the relevant press departments have informed him of.
In the Department of the Press of the Environment Map they were unable to report on the budget of the Ministry's Navy celebrations.
What is known is that for the festival to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts, more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike were gathering
The League Trade Unions and the National Federation of Working Commissions will be a fire committee on Friday to coordinate the strike of the moons that will last for an indefinite time.
A protest will be held on Saturday, while on Monday - the day on which the final vote on public health law will be held - the working party will begin.
With full safety this action will cause major difficulties in transport, as rail traffic will be completely stopped, and up to 13 hours workers from the Budapest collective transport company will also be arrested.
In the evening of Friday, the League Unions will inform you of the details of their strike on Mondays that will be held together with the National Federation of Working Commissions.
It will also be established by the LIGA and the National Trade Union Committee to coordinate the actions of the moon.
On Saturday a protest will be held, as soon as Monday's participants' unions will be held in jail for no time unless an agreement with the Government is reached.
This means that, on the day of parliamentary vote on public health law, they did not report the date of the end of the strike.
If the National Assembly violates public health law, unions shall immediately withdraw their appeal to the strike.
Instead, if the law is approved, the strike commissions will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the order of the National Assembly Mondays, it is also possible that only the public health law is voted at very late hours of the night, or at best close to midnight.
As a result of the strike that will begin Monday, there will be significant difficulties in transport: railways will stop working for an indefinite period of time, some of the collective transport of Budapest and more than half of the interurban bus transport of the Volan companies can be seen in the morning.
At the same time, in many parts of the country, half of the road will be closed.
A number of civil unions and organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League's website.
Some unions announced their strike at an indefinite time, others at a fixed time.
Until late Thursday the State Railway and the Free Trade Union (SLTF) were unable to reach an agreement even on minimum services, however, when Christmas celebrations were near, there were more and more people traveling on trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day to the 13 hours, workers from the collective transport company in Budapest, Budapest Airports from 7 to 9 a.m. will hold a four-hour strike at the LIGA trade unions in the Electric and thermal energy industry, the Educators unions called for a 2 hour strike and the Educational Union of Educators from 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Medical Association will be held nationally in alternate hours and the Democratic Union of the Workers of the Health and Social Sector (SDTSS), which is part of the Trade Cooperation Forum, will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four requests made by the League is that the Government withdraws its proposal on public health reform and submits a new concept to a social debate.
The second request is to gradually introduce the new form of calculation of pensions that will enter into force next year.
The third is to ensure, even before 2010, that, in the case of advanced pensions, there is a possibility that those who deserve it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) which is part of the League Trade Unions does not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economics and Transport on railway lines and wait for another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: Risk increases in the country by Hungarian Guard
According to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, formed in August this year with the support of the Movement by a Better Hungary, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region from several points of view.
The company's "warranty on risks" is written: in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the biggest political risk is the fact that "with the aggravation of the ethnic tensions existing between the Gitan and non-Gitana population of Hungary, even in the short term, there may be violent ethnic confrontations".
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is probably the result of an event of this nature - the representative of the research institute added.
They said that all of this was due to one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political leaders: "public life advocates gave him the public debate on the guitar problem to representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who could base their policy strategy on the existing discrepancy between guitars and Hungarians".
This aggravates the problem, hinders normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of the establishment of violent conflicts - estimated.
In addition, according to the Institute of Research, the activities of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of national and international media, "has significantly damaged Hungary's image abroad, particularly with regard to the country's stability and democratic development".
We recall that since the autumn of 2006, the reorganization of radical and extreme right groups in Hungary has been increasingly publicized and promoted, and that since the summer of 2007, many organizations have been established in the country which are self-defenced "national self-defence associations".
"The common feature of these groups is that they are self-defenced as civil organizations, while they openly proclaim the training of their members for defence - even armed - (civil defence, national defence, defence of the public order), bringing to the incompetence of the police, the army, that is, the State" - adds.
They said that all of this was done in accordance with the method of attempting to present a civilian to different political aspirations, based on the dissatisfaction of society with politics and political parties.
The emphasis on civility and the form of association in the case of such associations is not only to avoid legal problems of legal registration, but it is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk factor from the point of view of neighboring relationships.
"In recent months, many neighbouring States have referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while the ultranational political figures of certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungary policy with the establishment of the Hungarian Guard.
All of this affects the political stability of the region" - they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in the Central and Eastern Europe, so that political risks are increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard operates in a similar manner as the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) of the right.
The composition of the Bulgarian guard is due to the massive disturbances of the Gitans that occurred in one of the bars of Sofia (Polish Krasna).
Taking advantage of this situation, UNB decided to constitute the guard, arguing that the organization's objective is "national self-defence".
In his view, for the last 17 years there has been a "gitaneous terror" in Bulgaria, but the State remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has led to an encouraging discussion in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic confrontations that certain Roma organizations in Bulgaria have announced will constitute their own guard.
As the functioning of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that Hungarian Gitans also respond to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defence - can be read in the warning about the risks of the Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, director of Political Capital Investigations, said the news agency's question: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the risk change, they inform the public opinion, as in this case, by publishing their risk warning.
The game is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law defines exactly the days that are written with red numbers in the calendar and has already become a generalized practice around the festival days - that the next year will be less - the working days will be reorganised.
Even in the EU or North America, the parties are unifying.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national parties, State parties and festivals.
Festivals are fundamentally related to religious festivals and historical festivals.
We also celebrate the New Year: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is festival - this last of all so that those who attended the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven written parties with red numbers in the calendar.
It is nationally celebrated on 15 March in memory of the 1848 revolution and 23 October, a memorial day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20th, we celebrate the establishment of the State, on May 1st, on November 1st and 2nd, we remind our families and missing friends.
In addition, in our country there are two-day celebrations of the Resurrection Passover, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our State, National or Religious Festivals rarely coincide with a weekend, so it is often done when there is only one working day before or after the party.
In addition to the extended weekends, you can not leave your work or school during the previous weeks.
It is the Minister of Labour who rules in his specific decree when it is necessary to work directly to change the date directly before or after the party.
This legal standard is mandatory for all employers and employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
It is not mandatory for companies and services institutions to work continuously even during festivals because of their role.
This year's work order can only be changed around the end of the year: from 24 December, it is practically held in the country, since, according to the experience, most people are "sustained" during the holidays between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
The next year several of our parties will coincide with Wednesdays or weekends, so there will be less changes in working days than this year.
First, the agenda will be changed around the work party so that workers can rest within four days.
On Saturday, 26 April, it will be scheduled to work, so that on Friday, 2 May, it will be scheduled.
The other change is related to the 23rd of October: Saturday, 18th of October, it will have to work instead of Friday 24.
On the other hand, the coming year during the final anniversary of the year will be able to rest, since from 24 December it will not work in almost any part of the year, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six little inconsistency to hurt the lives of your colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, sound messages that we have never received, innocent lies that are passed on to us, all of which are part of our Folklore" daily at work.
You must decide whether to adapt to minor disorders or knowingly avoid confusing situations that may irritate others.
Councils.
I'm sorry, I forgot to warn you that you've been looking for the marketing department" - says one of your colleagues."
Why didn't you go to a date?
In the best case you feel it and try to fix the matter, best call the marketing department to tell them that you have forgotten to deliver the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases the matter is resolved by asking for forgiveness.
Before making oral explanations, it is worthwhile to meditate on the things that you can hurt your colleagues' lives and make conscious efforts to avoid them.
Do you take something that's not yours?
There's nothing more irritant than when you want to get a document, an office utility or your phone and you don't find them.
Do you remember yesterday that you put the graffiti on the table, but this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your lost bibliography at the table of one of your colleagues?
Don't leave anything to your colleagues without asking them, 'cause they'll rightly be mad at you for removing their things.
Don't get over or post-it from the office because it can be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they are exhausted before time.
You chisme about your colleagues' private life?
There is no good solution to stop noises that are already running.
Who, what are you doing, and with whom?
Where and why?
Don't pass on to the whole world the information (conjectors) you have about the particular life of your colleagues!
Don't abuse your colleague's trust when you share your most intimate secrets!
Fill in yourself what you have heard and not chisme about your colleague in his absence, although others also know the things about him.
Are you allowed to suffer from illness unjustly?
When you call the office by phone and say that you're sick and you're in trouble with your head, you feel bad or good, you feel that day you prefer to rest; you think others should do your work, your impossible tasks, your work in the end.
Don't ask your colleague!
If you know in advance that the next day you won't go to the office or something can happen to you, so you'll have to stay at home, communiques, so your colleagues or your boss won't have to face you the next day without you.
Tarares, recipes, telephone calls
You're tired of your work, but you're suddenly getting your colleagues' chances out of it?
Have you voluntarily heard a phone conversation that would have been better off not to listen to it?
Don't bother your colleagues with your taarers, songs, high-voice conversations (but when you do them above your head), panties, constant blasphems, expressing your disinterests in high-voice voice.
All of these can be disturbed, although they are not currently deepening in a project ( writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don't blame others if you haven't done anything in time, you forgot to send an important letter or a message!
Don't take any chance reincinding chaos in the office, nor the noise your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that damages others and you must fix the lack!
Ask how you can fix your lack!
Are you feeling too much at home at the office?
Jogging and zapatillas: very comfortable bed for the house, but not suitable for the office!
You don't see a jogging comfort even if your occupation allows it!
Don't be upset, respect your colleagues and yourself watching daily, elegant and beautiful clothes when your occupation so requires!
Interested losses if you want to meet public expectations
The car slows down on the usual roof in the morning.
Sounds like a strange compass on the radio: violence with electronic effects.
Volume up.
Change the rhythm of music and the previous tone is added down and then the voice of a female choir as a true joy intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays the Wings of Love of Zagar song.
National musical life has not damaged us much with quality electronic pop.
But now it looks completely different this deal when you're listening to Zagar's new record.
Yonderboi appeared. Some new and interesting songs from the subground [b2]digital [b3]national shortly changed the image and although again the rock style garage, guitar break, the national pop electricity has shown: there are news under the Sun.
Balázs Zsäer started his career in the city of Pécs, he played in the Yonderboi complex until he started his independent career perhaps because both can not be protagonists of the same group.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mix of jazz, of cheap and pop electronic music, he tried to triunfar, when he was asked for soundtracks [b4] cinematographics (pl.
Ferenc Török Season).
The wider audience was aware of the fact that in principle it only acted in small clubs when the magazine van2 selected its first album edited in 2002 among the fifty most important national discs, rating Zagar, together with Yonderboi as almost the only national trends trainer, was also able to sell in the western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his group are fashionable, but no one has asked them if they take this label with them or not.
The set responded how to react: it prepared a new and even better disk.
The recently released disc entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new paths for them, although the title itself intends to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
Because this title was one of the lines of the old set of Balázs Zsäer.
It's a good reference to the noise, the flight, but in addition to the noise of the music, it now appeared - according to the spirit and the trend of the time - the guitar that sounds stronger, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs the album was presented in the Millennium György League, the singer currently working in England with The Puzzle set.
The disc includes a true success of the channel mr2 Petõfi that lasts from the morning to the popular music night. This station led to the radio broadcasts the high-flight music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground").
It's all right (?).
hvg.hu questioned the Balázs Zzázer.
hvg.hu: After this new success comes the question: What are you interpreting, how much is a music dedicated to a selected audience?
Ballázs Zsäer: The definition of the selected public for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of tapes in light music; not mainstream and underground[b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
The so-called subterranean alternative music can also be boring, without meaning and can also be composed only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can come from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of the listeners also works with this spirit, regardless of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by Hungarian and foreign public?
B. Zs: In the foreign country, especially in the western part of us, the lighter music has larger traditions.
There, not only the generation of fifteen and twenty-year-olds attend the concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that take place around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public have in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are and how many people are listening to your music?
B.Zs: Of course I feel good to see more and more people attend our concerts.
But we've never made music for the market.
We're not composed of music for some purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the public is best felt in the concerts where there is mutual influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet I realize that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you will lose your interest.
hvg.hu: To what point do you intend to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works alone and made his career better for the west of us.
B.Zs: We do not follow his path, although sometimes they try to compare our music with that of him.
We work better on teamwork, trust each other's musical presence and let it develop.
In principle it was impossible to compare our work with Yonderboi's music, because many of us started our career in their group and then started another way.
hvg.hu: The success list of Mr2 Petõfi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people first heard the name Zagar in connection with this song.
Did you knowingly open this style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to make great successes and sell with these success our disc.
This song is something more than that.
We add it to the end of the disc, trying to relax after the sound organ of the disc and the most heavy themes.
hvg.hu: How have you selected the six songs?
Why just to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a choir in Google style.
Then came the idea of creating this heart of the soloists of good voice from our own national musical stage.
So it was created by the heart of six women - either Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judy Jay, Bori Peterfy, Ennikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Nemeth - who was then baptized as the Divines of Underground.
hvg.hu: Have you exactly composed the song or the girls changed some things?
Zs.B.: This song was there a long time ago in instrumental version and when we had all the material on the disc, we thought there was still something missing.
The deal attracted the song.
That night even recorded the song that the girls later learned.
Everything came practically to the first attempt and in a incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very excited then, but of course I also needed the Divas.
My voice wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: In both the concert and the disc it seems as if the girls were in the second floor.
There are no soloists (except Judy Jay's short solo), they don't have their own role, they sing all together and no more strongly than music, so music does not just follow their songs.
They are also located in the background on the stage.
intentionally?
B.Zs: They're in the bottom just because of technical problems.
Instead of consciously, we didn't want to distribute soloist papers.
The song also reads about it, about which we forget a few of our egos, who from where it has come and where it goes, because those tears of love lift us up.
I would have wanted to make others feel that kind of euphoric spirit that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: What else have you dedicated to?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition actually to no one, rather at the time of mixing there were more difficult parts.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma where I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want to work the groove and then, a little bit of everything was put in his place like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new disc?
Zs.B.: This changes constantly with concerts and because I've already "sold" the disc.
Now the Prophet is A Fire, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A bus driver risks thousands of millions of dollars because of his low-quality complex
A naughty traitor.
This is how it points to its former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the huge French banker of General Societé, also owned by the Czech Trade Bank.
For him, he lost about €5 billion.
However, it seems better that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and, of course, with good abilities.
It was not long ago, unlike all major Czech banks, that the crisis in the US mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character" was left to hear of his superiors, the very ones who sent him to the police.
But what is learned from Kerviel's responses is that the French media, such as the Le Monde newspaper, were dealing with a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than EUR 1,600 million because of his business.
Crisis not only in America
"All you want to do was earn money for my bank" ensures in your answers.
Exactly, in the summer, he managed to win 500 million euros during the American crisis.
This opportunity has already seen her come at the beginning of the year.
In February some news began to be heard about the sub-primary mortgage calls offered to low-income customers or those who had problems with payments in the past and that these customers would start having problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and warned correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, its profits exceeded EUR 1,600 million.
"When I win my first 500 million not know how to report it," Kerviel confides and adds, that nothing has been left to him, absolutely.
Throughout the interrogation, he stated that the records had been incorrect in such a way that they did not reach their discovery.
He even came to deceive the bosses, even when the Eurex Bolsa began to take an interest in his business.
The risk became beneficial
Was he afraid he'd find out?
Better, no.
"I thought I had won 1,600 million for the bank and that from that simple fact, it would make them happy."
Where did he get so much willpower to take that risk?
In my position it was time to work gradually.
He entered the General Society in 2000, just after finishing his studies in Lyon.
Its annual salary was managed between $11,000.
Two years later he was already a Bolsa driver's assistant and in 2005 he became a box driver with an annual salary of $90,000.
Even so I knew I'd never win as much as the others.
"In my first interview in 2005, I already noticed that they looked at me with caution.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described to the researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company, the first big success came.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won, during the bombings in London, playing down a €500 million title.
And this is supposed to be a start-up mechanism, and I wanted more.
If you want, we'll let you go
"This is like a snowball," said the police.
But it's said that the bosses knew about all this or that they'd rather suspect it.
"As soon as I got the money, my eyes were closed."
Only then came the attack at the beginning of this year.
One day he lost billions of euros.
After the end of the week in mid-January, I wanted to remove all the eggs.
When the moon came to work, he was no longer working at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros for its fault.
And how were they able to locate him?
He became suspicious from his vacations.
"I only chose four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn't have vacations is a runner who doesn't want anyone to take a look at his sender," Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has the potential to reach 365 billion
Government ministers of the Czech Republic signed with representatives of the European Commission yesterday a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can earn EUR 14 billion (about EUR 365 billion).
This is practically half the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007-2013.
Of the seven operational programmes, approximately 125 billion will be delivered to the regions.
Czech companies can obtain about 100 billion crowns from the Business and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will be for transport up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of operational programmes and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources available to the Czech Republic from the Fund.
This money increases the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructures, which will next year account for the amount of 90,800 million crowns.
The Business and Innovation Programme should serve entrepreneurs and companies for the acquisition of business innovation resources.
Companies should receive funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
With regard to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the recently imported countries that use them at least.
Twenty-year sentence for the representative of Nicaragua, ruled by the court
The Nicaraguan Appeals Tribunal ruled on Thursday the 20-year sentence for the country's representative, Arnaldo Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 for the disappearance of $100 billion (about 1,800 million) in 2003.
Despite this, a time later he was released from prison to go into house arrest in his garden not far from the Nicaraguan Metropolis.
It is not clear at these times, according to the AP agency, that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, is again among kings.
According to the President of the Appeals Tribunal, Ileana Pérez will be better dependent on prison officials if they let Germany end their sentence at home or if they do so again in prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated how German was constantly transferring government money to the account of a company in Panama.
This society was fiction and the account belonged, in fact, to its closest family members and partners.
Part of this money ended in the fund that Germany created to finance its campaign in the 2001 elections.
That is how we were approved by the budget.
That's right.
The State Budget was adopted.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first developed by this Government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
The budget for this year was already adopted with the support of ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not be allowed to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the government's vote of confidence, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional view, although most influential, calmly adopted the new law.
It's a big paradox.
Each government begins and ends with each chapter and budget split, likes or doesn't.
The budget is an important part of policy, but it conceals the flexibility of power between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore devotes special attention to them.
Political discussions are far more interesting than simple numbers.
The State budgets of the last Governments of the democracies suffered three shortcomings that could not be solved so easily for this year 2008:
The first of these is the high participation in mandatory laws, called as the expenses of the mandate holders who are not only pensions but also social benefits that have already been approved last year before the elections by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a consequence of the first deficit.
The third limit is the deficit of public funding, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Nevertheless, the highest risk is not in the deficit of the State budget.
This is public and relatively controlled.
The clock bomb, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and Community budget.
In order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from tax, taxes and bank credit, many have often issued disproportionately obligations with which they have made their payments disproportionately.
In recent years these debts have been paid through the massive sale of energy actions and other development networks that have received from the state and privatization.
They do not currently have this resource.
If we only say official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, some years ago, is going through stages of growth the same as the rest of the world, of which ČSSD is hunting.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to order the State's finances.
However, instead, the state continued to deteriorate.
The rest of the countries, with the exception of some, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have saved much more reasonably than our Republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to nations that are less threatened by poverty within global measures.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programmes that have, unfortunately, been useless in recent years.
And although they were able to eliminate some of the unexplainable populist costs adopted this year before the elections, if it does not change the age of retirement and pension reform, then it will be the end of any policy in this country and, governments who rule will only be a simple bureaucracy.
By exaggerating a little, we can say that politicians that are ruling will turn into officials, mechanical distributors of most of the money of taxes for retirement and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure on the normal expenditure of the mandaters.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion for 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary if the previous government had not exhausted in the past ten years.
We do not want the politicians in the government to become only officials, so we must be patient and give this weak government coalition, which is seen to be that the state can only spend what it can get from taxes and taxes, the peace for the preparation of other legislative reforms.
Only this will allow the success of the state budget to be achieved by the paulatine.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The United States Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial market.
The Monetary Mark will receive more than a hundred billion dollars through bids.
In these bids, banks highlight the types of interest which are capable of providing money.
For example, U.S. Fed will send $40 billion to bid, and then another $40 billion will be made available to the Central Banks of Europe and Switzerland.
Following the attacks of 11 September, it is the first time that central banks of different states agree in this coordinated process to protect and reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, i.e. the continued growth of the free capital deficit that banks could afford," wrote Bernard Baumohl in his report to customers, the consultant for the Economic Outlook Group.
"This coordinated action of central banks probably reduced the recession in the United States from 65 per cent to 50 per cent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on mortgaged loans, especially in the United States.
The economists still expect billions of dollars in losses.
"Central banks must really be afraid of what they are still waiting for when they decided to take this step," said AbN Amro's leading economist Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are afraid that they have the same access problems with loans and that they will therefore have to pay their customers more expensive.
This would reduce consumption and send the US economy to the recession with a different impact on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after not being able to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used for the money loan in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend money even when the Central Banks of the United States, Canada and Great Britain decreased their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as another drop of interest types," said Reuters agency Greg Salvaggio de la company Tempus Consulting.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by the central banks contributes to the start of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem of the collapse of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: The discussions of ecologists are incredible
Global climate change affects particularly developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke about the problem of global warming.
The criticism now emerged with the conclusion of the United Nations international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not green planet, he commented that the discussions of ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates an extraordinary mix of representatives of government and non-governmental organizations, but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and the reality.
"There the debates are only structured, are artificial fires of words, substitutes of the solution to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President during the presentation of his book stressed that this issue was very important to him and that is why he was interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because, as he said, "I often only meet with the characters of my ideas."
Interested parties can now be informed about their varied views.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he has, according to his opinion, sufficient assumptions as to write a book like this.
It is academic, with the ability to follow and judge a specialized entertainment, has experiences with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closure, he expressed his view that climate changes are constant and that their changes are normal, that there is no agreement between scientists on the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not so large and serious, nor represent possible disasters, and that efforts to influence climate development are useless, ineffective and cost-effective.
In addition, as an experienced man with totalitarianism, it is unacceptable to impose unproved opinions on others, which is a dangerous way to limit the freedom of others.
He once again explained that it is not against "reasonable environmental defenders but against environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at Hayes Institute.
600,000 people did not get to change their meat to drive
Six hundred thousand drivers passed the date and were therefore unable to change their old meat to drive whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can ask for change so that officials can spend time until the end of the year issuing the new meat.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that, after a new year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the road without the proper meat.
According to traffic, the meat has not changed primarily those who don't even want to drive it.
As the people announce a rapid decline in the change of meat, the metropolis offices are filled with requests and the interest in the new meat has increased.
The Board calculates about 2,000 customers per day.
There's a half-hour waiting on the wheels.
The new meat has not yet been removed in Prague about 14,000 drivers.
The issue of a new meat lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issue of meat within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay fifty crowns.
Drivers who are obliged to change their meat and do not reach the end of the year, but will travel to the streets without the valid meat will risk a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can fix the crime with an amnesty.
If it is an administrative offence, the fine will rise to 2,500 crowns.
According to the previous information, you could receive a lot of that person who doesn't go anywhere.
They could pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry called for offices to enter at a moderate rate of thousands of crowns, as maximum.
According to the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, thousands of crowns threaten no one.
According to him, the meat is a document in which people can decide whether or not to.
It is not the body of identity that each person must have.
People who don't want to drive should deliver the meat to drive.
Just bring it or send it by mail certified to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the meat released during the years 1964 and 1993 were left to be valid.
However, drivers should gradually change the other types of meat to drive.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the meat issued between 2001 and 2004 shall expire in December 2013.
According to Hanselka, it is about 2.6 million more documents.
The Court reduced the punishment for Berdych's fellow detectives
The former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Konıřík accused of complicity with the criminal David Berdych are going to pass between nine and ten years in prison.
The Supreme Court of Prague decided as a definitive remedy to the reduction of penalties, first to one year, and second to two years.
The department's detectives were called against organized crime, in principle, between 14 and 12 years of age.
Against today's decision, it can no longer be invoked, only by the revocation of the Supreme Court.
Berdych is also in this case accused, but he is primarily awaiting the verdict of the Court of First Instance.
Despite this in other processes, it has been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
Can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the participation of 19 people and the Supreme Court, today, withdrew to 16 of them.
Most of the accused's allegations were rejected by the investigation for alleged cases.
According to the headquarters of Central Bohemia, police members in accordance with Berdych provided information from police sources to criminals, covered the thefts, and helped members of the criminal group to avoid punishment.
These criminals delivered 30 percent of their slaves to Opava and Konyrík.
The charge concerns criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
As for the theft, its victims suffered serious health impacts but also were accused of abuse of power as public agents and without the permission of weapons.
In the domicile record, the police found guns, ammunition with steel core, a laser manager and a amplifier.
The criminal group, according to the charge, stole tens of millions of crowns.
With the exception of nearly twenty men in this process, the court has already recognized Berdych and other accused.
Other men related to the case of Berdych are still reporting other processes, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Pót and Maroš Šulej, who have now avoided the trial, are in prison in Ireland, where they are awaiting the final decision on their delivery to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
One account for changing children: 12 million
To change some children in the maternity home, the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants Třebić hospital 12 million crowns of compensation more than the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for parents, two million, and for children, a million.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 each father.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondréj Dostal, is not in principle in accordance with the proposal of Veleba.
"So much demand we do not approve, it is too high," Dostal said after today's meeting.
"In order for us to make an idea of this counter-proposal, we need the expert's report that the counterparty sent to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a reciprocal value.
We keep in mind that there will be hundreds of thousands for all" said Dostal.
The amount should be moved between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the case, the Jablonn family wanted, every month, not to create their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Vela was used as the basis for negotiating the compensation of the expert's report, only the hospital of Motol's office in Prague.
Girls' parents, according to psychologists and psychiatrists, suffered from psychological and stress at different levels and depth.
The stress situation was better supported by men, although they fought with crimes against girls.
Women bring him worse with the trauma that they are currently living and with regard to what is happening today, Veleba completed.
Verónica and Nicola were replaced by nurses in the Mother's House of Trebič last year, the ninth of December.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola and Čermákový and Príbislavic, and Verónica and Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jablonn.
The governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, delivered 100,000 crowns to each family at the end of October as compensation costs for the error committed in the hospital of Třbič that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are guaranteed by law as liability for damage.
In the case of errors, you should extract from the reserve fund and you can ask the administrator for help.
The court has so far recognized them as a proportionally low compensation, the amounts calculated according to the tables of hundreds of thousands and extraordinaryly a million crowns.
Polivka lost the kingdom of Valaquia
Bolek Polivka lost the battle on the Kingdom brand of Valaquia.
According to the court of the provincial court of Ostrava, it was the first to use the Kingdom brand of Valaquia but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polivka did not present today to the oral view.
According to your lawyer, the case is probably not over and your client will recover.
"The dispute consists of that Mr. Haribish and his team are some parishes of Bolek Polivka's popularity," said after the trial, Polivka's lawyer.
For him, in the words of the Kingdom of Valaquia, the image of the actor and comic is seen throughout the world.
The same idea has Harabish as well.
"We've been after us for ten years of work.
Search for money and invention of activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the plague is in the money.
"After years I have realized that the project is successful and that it could also receive something.
They want to live as parishes of our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the Kingdom brand of Valaquia was first used by Polivka in its television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then it was not intended to guide him to the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Haribish was able to edit the passport from the Kingdom of Valaquia.
From this comical source, a business and lucrative business was created by Haribish after the Kingdom of Valaquia.
In 1997, Polivka agreed to use her name and sign the passports and even offered her owners discounts to visitors from her farm and visitors to her shows.
Who's gonna sit on the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabiš used only a simple idea that Polivka made public on the stage for his own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polivka helped the popularity of the Valaquia Kingdom," the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Haribish and his team who have dedicated themselves to it.
The collaboration, among the disunited parties today, continued until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polivka in Vsetín.
Since then there have been conflicts between Polívka and Haribish whose culmination has resulted in the defeat of “rerere Boleslav I, the elected forever”.
The main role in the kingdom, through the media of Haribish, came from the singer Jarmila Šuláková, as the queen of the mother.
In 2002, Polivka filed a complaint against Haribish and his society that has so far been rejected by the court.
Something obviously could lead to the dispute, the tournament by the throne with its princesses, which is already preparing Haribish.
He should be the new king out of him.
You didn't want to reveal any more data or dates.
"We have no prize.
It should be something like the king's way to Moravia.
The king should be elected on a particular date.
Even Mr Polivka can present himself" added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: exceeded damage
To be honest, I never liked Peugeotu 206 too much.
Its departure characteristics were never special, the quality of the change box, manoeuvre, and also the product could be characterised as under the average.
But now there is in the market its successor, Peugeot 207, and this is much better.
This Combi called SW is a bit more advanced and to me, it's just that I think it's better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, about the head space in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the ride of the Combi means in this sense, that I will not suffer before the two meters of length.
Flying by the world
Step through the inside quickly so as not to repeat it too much.
It is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate the design invention even though the car already seems quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are the times when we complained of short seats and supported seats.
In addition to model 206, the lateral direction has improved considerably.
And the space?, and here you can feel how the road measures have grown.
In the Combi, the mentioned lack of space is missing in the head.
Wallet wallets
But the main thing in this vehicle is your suitcase.
This should be appreciated as very accessible (Thanks to the portable back door) and a well-shared storage.
Dead spaces are equipped with rubber mails that provide an ideal solution.
They do not bother, and they can be extended to the point of subjecting heavy objects.
But we're in the warehouse.
According to the tables, in basic mode, it has a capacity of 428 litres that is better than a average value compared to competition.
But not in comparison with the vehicle of the same type most sold in the Czech Republic, Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW to the new generation of the model Mladá Boleslav, we assume that the Peugeot remains in the cave with its 52 litres perceptibles.
For vacations abroad or for placing the child’s cookie is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I'd have to quote the room that remains quite flat after the back of the second line.
120 Horses on Four Horses
Our car test was equipped with a four-wave injecting pump on a 1.6 l capacity and 88 kW force.
And to be honest, that's how it should look like a 1600 that would lower the family five doors.
It's quiet, consumes little and, above all, has impulse.
If I compare it with the time of then's shells that seemed like if the escape tube was tapped by a trap, I can say that with it I can be impressed.
Prices respond
The car price is not for all bottles.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle and with a very good engine.
The basic car price with 1400 injection fuel per 329,900 crowns can still be purchased.
Our aggregates make it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The tested Premium type already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we would still have airbags in our heads, air conditioning, automatic cleanup, automated rear windows...
That is, the car with everything costs 531,900 crowns.
It's a lot, but look at the team plugins in Fabia and you'll get to a very similar number.
Now it's only time to decide which of the two brands.
Slovak students do not participate in English schools
In English schools children from Eastern European countries are attending and therefore the locals are afraid of more changes in schools.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans is now only a series of problems.
British schools even record cases where conflicts between immigrants and children of natives increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent, where conflicts between the natives and Slovak immigrants begin to grow.
Discussions, exorcism and bickering among students have already reached even their own parents.
The situation has reached as far as Chatham's police arrested an Slovak woman who was holding a pair of shoes for a student for ten years with a green beard.
In his defense he said that the girl was insulting her son with racist tone insults.
The police had to act also after an attack of two minor girls against a Slovak immigrant.
The girls arrested him with racist insults and shot him with stones.
"When we went home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and began to hide.
When I told him that he would leave us the addition of throwing us manganese and pearls, and then he lowered his pants and showed us his back," another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The complaints are on both sides.
One of the natives even referred to the conflict with the immigrants of Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show us how the environment in English schools begins to be quite tense.
In Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here for labor reasons.
About 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful Caribbean island
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your holidays can be achieved, whenever you choose correctly.
The sandy and expensive beaches, large waves or a quiet sea like a pond.
the palm trees and everything included with beds offering pizzas on the beach, frozen or varied cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf the role.
On the island of the Caribbean you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island is much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antillas.
In the Spanish era, Cuba came to be the bastion of America's conquest.
Colon called it, the most beautiful place human eye has ever seen.
The Habana became a warehouse and cargo port for the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and brought to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The National Hotel grew by the end of the 20th year.
He ordered him to build one of the heads of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that had been criminal in the United States (and therefore forbidden) was welcome and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were others
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High buildings were built in La Habana, where the cars were a symbol of worship in the 50th century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a factory in San Francisco de Paula, near La Habana, and Cojimar had his yacht.
At the walls of the Middle Bodeguita, they left their signatures the stars of the world of show and politics throughout America.
And today?
In the walls of the Bodeguita you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar of the National National Hotel, the cocktails are mixed according to their wishes.
And these cars have been worshiped since the 1950s, they are still operating by La Habana, because those Lada and Fiat that have arrived some time ago have been oxidising between these wetlands and wind salons.
Even when La Habana, in particular the old village, is being severely damaged, there are not so many wonderful colonial monuments around it.
Other places are metmorphosed in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last five years, new hotels have grown not only in La Habana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the unique world and that is highly valued by the lovers of the railway.
The sugar cane is transported from large plants to the sugar factories on narrow roads in steam or electric machinery.
Their cars for decades have not been discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose models of brothers in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where are you going?
The most known place for most visitors does not change.
And that's why you don't need to talk more about La Habana or Varadero.
Maybe just remember that in Hemingway's already mentioned factory there's a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, they shouldn't stop visiting him.
The valley of Viñales is the most picturesque coast of Cuba west of the island.
Exhibiting vegetation that grows in warm rock soils.
Mogotes, rock pillars, and rocks of high heights carved in the fall of the valley, and in their caves, fertile lands are accelerated by which rock formations that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where it is likely to grow the tobacco of the highest quality in Cuba.
Visiting some of the cleaning factories can be found with your final product.
Maybe someone seems to be interested that there was the Chinese side of the series, Major Zeman.
Trinidad
Old city I am abrogated that was founded not long after the Spanish colonization of the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
The wealth became beautiful with the constructions in the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by later French colonies, has only changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Serra de Escambray, is such a separate place that in the 50th century there was no road that would unite it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her to stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore nothing was destroyed, because everyone was happy to have where to live.
If you have more time to be in Trinidad than one evening, it is worth knowing interesting places in nearby areas such as the Playa de Ancón or the valley of sugar factories.
the night belongs to the House of Music, whose soul with its music is the silence of the morning.
Baracoa
Small town in the far west of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful of the island.
With certainty that opinion is already confirmed by the path itself.
The two roads that come there from Guantánamo must pass through high mountains and broken mountains, as well as by a nature that only knows man's action.
This eastern location of Cuba has been registered as Humanity Heritage by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Colón (in fact it is a cross that came 100 years later from the landing) and from the mountain, where the castle was found and there is now a hotel with its own name, the mountains and among them the most known, the Yunque.
Coffee, red, pure, the Sierra Maester, the Bay of the Cochinos and the island of Pinos, the Tropical Cabaret, the patron of Cuba, the Virgin of the Charity of the Cobre, the Saintery, the African religion that practiced the descendants of those slaves, all of which could fill many pages.
However, as it is said, it is better to see it sometimes.
Alliances are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment needed is what is affecting the start of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to American Defence Minister Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not as expected, the representatives of countries with troops in the southern part of the country entered Edinburgh (Escosia).
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban movement grow, today eight participating states discuss the plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States this week through its defence minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to do more, Britain saw as a priority the strengthening of the authority of the Afghan government and the distribution of development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is palpable but armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The following is to enable the population alone to start economic and security development," the Defence Minister, Des Browne, told the BBC station.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels according to data from the US Army is higher than in the last five years.
The number of violent acts increased in comparison with last year by 27 per cent, and in Helmand Province up to 60 per cent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, the fourth of which are in the south of the territory.
For the United States, however, allies have reached the same limit as the organization and equipment of the units.
They ask more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them," Gates said.
Similarly today, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hope spoke in a similar way.
"I am not happy to know what we have in the earth and the sky in Afghanistan.
We have a nine hundred soldiers and teams we would need, and that's a little," De Hoop told Reuters agency at the conclusion of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive
Among the participating countries in the past few months, there has been a policing of whether all allies do the maximum in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticised for passive reasons.
"Germans in Afghanistan have a relative number of replacements.
But they are located in a minimum area of violence and the fighting requirements there are not as high as ours, in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
The Sensacionalist newspaper Sun, this week called the German soldiers vagos.
"The Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are dedicated to playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing at the table tennis.
The German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph where the British army played a rugby game in the southern part of Afghanistan.
The debt of the State will reach the billion in 2009
For every Czech Republic, the State owes 84,000 crowns.
The total debt rose to 842,700 million dollars in September.
This year the government planned to spend 159,200 million crowns.
However, early in December the ministry reduced the plan to 152,800 million crowns by improving the state budget economy.
The State debt of the Czech Republic grew at the end of September at 842,700 million crowns.
In nine months of this year, it increased to 40,200 million crowns.
However, since June 13,400 million crowns have been reduced.
Today, the Ministry of Economy has confirmed its data on the debt of the state of October.
For each check, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
Last year, the State committed more than 111 million crowns.
"Now it seems that thanks to the low deficit of the next year, we could cross the border of the billion crowns until 2009.
The next year the debt should be moved between 900,000 million and the billions of crowns," said the iHNed.cz server, the economist of Patria Finance, David Marek.
Similarly, the economist of Next Finance, Vladimir Pikora, also sees it: "We could spend the billion during 2009.
Just when that will depend on the next budget we still do not know.
If the situation in the political scene changed and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed by 2010.
But I don't see that change," he added.
Doubt grows
The debt of the state creates debt in the central government and, above all, arises from the accumulation of the deficit of the state budget.
The debt of the state is paid by means of assets, State bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The internal debt of the state increased this year from 38.500 million to 719.400 million dollars.
The external debt has now increased from 1,700 million crowns to 123,300 million crowns.
The call for a negotiated state at the end of September contained 803,300 million crowns z since June was reduced to 13.700 million crowns.
The average government debt gain increased by 6.5 years.
"The total international debt from the first to the third quarter was created 13 percent, which is enormously given as the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated mainly from the obligations where there is an increase of 20 per cent.
It is bad that debt grows but on the other hand shows that it is going to negotiate until there is a pension reform," Pikora commented.
Better than expected
The state debt payment and debt management strategy for 2007 suggests that the government planned to spend 159.200 million dollars this year.
At the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152,800 million crowns thanks to the improvement of the state budget.
The amount consists, above all, of the state budget deficit that this year will be 76 million crowns instead of the projected 91,300 million crowns.
The rest consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency with some 13.300 million crowns, the 10 billion crowns reserve for pension payments, 43 billion crowns to finance state bonds and 1,800 million crowns in payments from the European Investment Bank.
I compared today before a court to Jartúm to have given a name to a pelican bear
The British professor, who was tried in Sudan for insult to Islam, was convicted on Thursday afternoon by a Jartúm court for 15 days of imprisonment and expulsion, indicated his lawyer.
The British was charged with leaving students from 6 to 7 years of age to give the name of Mahomet to a peluche bear when all representation of the Prophet of Islam is illegal.
It was a punishment of lategas.
This 54-year-old British school teacher in function of the Unity High School of Jartúm in Sudan has been detained on Sunday in his home and accused of being attentive to Islam and seduction under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, as a result of several complaints by students' parents before the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story goes back to September, when this teacher asks his students, from 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the use of the class pellets.
" Eight names come out of the children's mouth, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, " , says the school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 children from each 23 have chosen Mohamed as a preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have produced a book for the class with the photo of the mouse with the following legend " My name is Mohamed " .
The bear himself did not bear any label with this name, but the problem is simply the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, professor at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew well and that he would never have done anything that could be offensive to a religious faith, "but I'm sorry that he has asked the children to vote for a name, " it's just a " innocent mistake " .
Opinion divided by many students of the school teacher who describe it as " very attentive to their students " and " never talking about religion in class " .
We remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, written in 14 different English ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules that involve the use of this name?
Can we give it to a player, for example?
This is of course an interpretation issue.
Wednesday has not reached an agreement on the future status of the province during the last session of negotiations in Vienna.
Finally, the failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians have ended Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last session of discussions without being able to overcome their differences over the future status of the separatist province.
" It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status," said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger, during a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was " in play " , his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
" We do not expect violence for now but enter a very difficult period " , he added, pointing out that " there are obvious tensions " .
End of the mediation on 10 December
The media of the troika, which regroups the European Union, the United States and Russia, will be in Serbia and Kosovo for the last time.
The future of the province of 90 per cent of Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council from 10 December to 10 December.
The discussions of Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and final session of negotiations since the trip took place on a new United Nations mediation last August.
The US and Europeans believe that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on pursuing negotiations beyond this date.
" Russia was and is committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Botsane-Khartchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, the West view independence under the supervision of the European Union as the only viable solution.
Pristina is prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increasing autonomy.
" Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," announced the President of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Baden hotel where these "negotiations of the last opportunity" have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of Kosovo's rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has given part of his forces.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade " belongs to a past that has led to homicides and deportations."
"Effect dominated "
Serbian President Boris Tadic has considered that a commitment was always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of the province ' s independence.
Belgrade said in particular to fear a " dominant effect " in a region still weakened by the wars of the 1990s.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a commitment is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision belongs exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian allies had a right of veto.
" The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word "
" Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia " , Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica had declared.
" These negotiations have lasted for two years.
They must end up as they have begun: in the Security Council."
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the statute " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence on the part of Albanians would be " in consultation " with the West.
Bush begins an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the International Peace Conference held by himself on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a common declaration.
It was necessary that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to set up negotiations immediately in order to find a definitive regulation of the ageing point of 60 among their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do anything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must detonate " terrorist infrastructures " and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, reminding both parties of its obligations with regard to the roadmap for peace they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would " seek to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues " .
This name covers the three main threats to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the success of the Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the American President, Abbas stressed that future negotiations would be "globally and deeper" and referred to in all aspects of a regulation, namely " Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things " .
On his return to court, Olmert committed himself to what future negotiations would be "direct and continuing" and to make "an effort to end them in the course of 2008.
Bush established the term of office at the end of 2008 in its Palestinian and Israeli " vision " of two States.
Saudi Arabia revealed that she had made a commitment in this regard to Bush's part before she decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, sponsored by all Arab countries, which proposes peace for Israel to replace its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks " a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the root causes of the conflict and its central aspects " , according to Prince Sauud in his periodic Arab interview with healthy capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
As always in this type of events, official and Romanian versions are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the French National Police Inspectorate's investigation (IGPN), a police car circled on Sunday, shortly after the 17th Street of Luisa-Miguel, to Villaers-le-Bel.
"I was not in intervention but in patrol, and I was traveling to 40-50 km/h, without turning around, " explains a police source.
A green motorcycle from the Kawasaki brand, " unapproved, or not allowed to travel on the public road " (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circled " to all gas " .
"He pulled the police car on the left side, after a failure to follow the road to the right," the police said.
The control of alcohol on the vehicle's occupants has been shown to be negative.
The state of the car (the front of the ground down, parasitic apricots planted, parachuted) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère of Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for " involuntary murder and refusal of assistance " to the IGPN, co-founded with the Departmental Directorate of Public Security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor needs the investigation of the IFPN, at this stage, to clear the responsibility of the police.
According to the judge, three witnesses to the accident, on Sunday afternoon, confirmed " the police version, knowing that this minimotocycle had reached its left-hand side relatively quickly " .
Yesterday, a kind of noise, no doubt caused by the melting of the scissors on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been trapped in time for the police car to come to an end.
Vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to a technical restriction.
The bodies of both victims have been autopsy yesterday.
What happened just after that?
Yesterday, a noise circled rapidly by Villaers-le-Bel, according to which police would have gone very quickly from the site, not providing such relief to both young people.
The IGPN, being prudent, would also opt for " all serious deficiencies " with regard to this point.
" It is the aspect of the most difficult investigation, which requires more research, which must be very cautious," a police source said.
Liberation found an eye witness of these few moments that have followed the incident.
One of your windows that exactly gives the scene.
"Let's go down later, with my first nurse in the hospital, to try to re-animise them, has this witness.
There was nothing to do."
Then he saw "to a completely disappointed police officer, who was asleep.
Two others tried to re-enact one of the young, the room was talking on the phone."
Faced with the tension surrounding the scene quickly, and it seems that the people of the youth situation were certain that the police had been taken in a car by colleagues who had arrived at the site.
According to this witness, the rescuers arrived " approximately 20 minutes after police departure " .
They also practiced heart massages in the bathroom.
" I will not let you imagine that police services did not help young people.
These young people have been helped.
The bombers arrived later.
Everything has been done to try to save them," the prosecutor insisted on his part.
The tension rises in Pakistan
The Pakistani police repressed the first demonstrations on Monday since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, nearly 2,000 lawyers who were protesting against the measures taken under the emergency state have been injured by the lacrimogenic grenades used by the order forces, according to witnesses.
These last replayed with stone shots, shooting the police.
At least 350 lawyers have been interviewed.
Similar scenes to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police loaded and beaten lawyers.
Many would have been interrupted.
In Islamabad, the Supreme Court ' s lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, resulting in an wave of about 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets that provided access to the Supreme Court were blocked by Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other events would have taken place in Multitan (center) and Peshawar (Noroest).
The movement of lawyers collected support from the religious parties regrouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president urged the people to send flowers to judges who had spoken against the state of emergency and the losses to those who had made an oath before Musharraf " .
"Musharraf's promise is no longer fulfilled"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan refers directly to the measure of exemption declared on the afternoon.
It had to be delivered in the coming days on the legitimacy of the re-election to the presidential elections, on 6 October, to the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
" All we attended was illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the errors of the Supreme Court, " said the judge in The News newspaper.
The promise of Pervez Musharraf to leave the army head and become a " no more valuable civil president " after the establishment of the emergency state, said Monday to the Assistant Minister of Information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected that he would leave his military uniform from here on 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential mandate.
The Assistant Minister of Information also confirmed that January elections could be transferred.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government has deplored the country ' s persistent rumors that President Musharraf would have been assigned to reside by his deputy chief of the army.
More than one third of pregnant women remain unannounced
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as unplanned or survival births.
Still today, more than one pregnancy of every three (36%) is not foreseen, reveals a study carried out by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), four years after the vote of the Neuwirth Act which liberalized the arrest in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as unplanned or survival births.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or sterile still present a 5 % to 6 % failure index, estimates Ined.
The liberalisation of contraception, however, allowed a better " fertility domain ", according to the institute that notes that the rate of use of the pillage between women from 20 to 44 years ago was 5 per cent in 1970 to 60 per cent today.
Finally, eight generations of every ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated less or less per month for a couple of each five and if possible for the spring, judged period as the most pleasant time to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
More than seven hours of space work will be required for Scott Parazynski and his international space station crew crew members (ISS) to carry out the spectacular repair of an undisclosed and indispensable solar panel for the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit that has accumulated memories due to its duration, its distance from the living modules, of the speed with which it has been imagined, "captured" instruments by the astronauts to make repairs.
The problem appeared on Tuesday, when the astronauts had released from the Discovery launch module, a huge cylindrical piece that was soon to reach European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a type of landing engine for laboratories.
But you have to be able to provide them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move a module of electricity production with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present in the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After moving it, the crew started reorganizing the solar panels of the module with a depth of 76 metres.
And it's where one of the panels, which appears as accordions, has been damaged a little bit more or less than a meter by a cable that was drawn.
The release has been stopped so as not to damage the panel anymore.
Astronauts, who were beginning to conduct a control exit from the Discovery launch, and then to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go to the end of the 30-metre length of the tele-directed arm of the launcher added to the station to make repairs.
It's one of the best "spacewalker" in the Nasa.
High, resistant, very skilled, has the very developed torso and the long arms.
At 46 years of age, this trained doctor has been charged with "working" the solar panel "hered".
After inspecting the damage, he cut down the fable cable and installed types of "tables" in the damaged area.
He had helped the second " spacewalker " who had stayed close to the air's exception and, inside, by other astronauts like Peggy Whitson, the commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a hockey minibest surrounded with an insulator to avoid electroculation in the solar panels that produced several hundred volumes, has been designed and "capuched" by the astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski expected the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of its instruments and to return to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronomers took advantage of a medium of rest before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery launch for the return to Earth for the Wednesdays.
The title of EADS fined in Bolsa
The EADS action is currently under way to the Gulf of Paris, after the Aeronautics and Defence Group announced that it had to spend between EUR 1,2 and EUR 1.4 billion to face the A400M delays.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros in the Paris Bols.
The group has been obliged to review its forecast of the operational result for 2007 in response to delays generated by slow progress in the development of the A400M engine, which provides for the inaugural flight of the aircraft.
The cost of the delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, " rises between €1.2 and €1.4 billion, of which over €1 billion for Airbus, " announced the mother house of the European builder EADS.
Due to these burdens, EADS will be forced to announce new objectives of the 2007 operating result (EBIT) during the presentation of its quarterly results the next Thursday, adding no more precise accuracy.
The group also indicated that the estimate of the new charges was consistent with the delay of six months.
It should be recalled that the operational result of EADS was 86 per cent in 2006, mainly due to charges linked to the delays of another programme, the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group provided for the first delivery of A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The selection of status quo
No wonder on Sunday, at the end of the urns: the Russians will choose massively for the party of President Putin, united Russia.
By confirming its desire for stability, including authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
On three days of the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today gives the voters a television message on public chains, already registered but its content is kept secret.
This is done as the leader of the list for Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is revealed to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president left nothing to be transparent by receiving foreign embassies, happy to hand over a new burden on the accused West intruder - his pre-delegation theme during the campaign.
" We know the price of true democracy and want honest, more transparent and more open elections, elections without incidents," he added.
According to the opposition, we are very far from the truth.
Advertises a printed campaign.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there is no " ever such a dirty election until the time of Eltsin " .
After the repression of the last weekend's demonstrations, at the former world champion Gary Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, visits are prohibited according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mind of the Soviet man"
Following these undisclosed legislative elections there are two more open questions:
Who will take the lead in Putin?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first re-election of the presidential election on 2 March 2008; the candidates were to be informed by 23 December.
Selected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot request the third consecutive mandate.
Then there's no chance of success.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
The Head of the majority of parliamentarians and the very powerful Russian party that would choose the government and the president?
Whatever the legislative elections, such as the presidential elections, the power will be triumphed.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mind of the Soviets, they do not feel the owner of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov, of the State University of St. Petersburg, is moving further: civil society was delayed in this Christian country five centuries after Europe; the popular spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin restored the model of a pastoral state, perfectly accepted by the population, since this new parentalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic disadvantage, " estimated by María Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians " reject their personal responsibility " by their own will " of those who had recently tested after the establishment of the URSS.
"What do you think?"
The phenomenon affects all social areas, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of each 85 heads of Russian regions) direct the local lists of Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonyms of chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
On behalf of which the Russians will not vote by extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: " Why reflect?
What are in power is not too bad, why change them?"
A Hard Memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, Bad Arolsen's Nazi files, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitlerian regime, are free of access.
The 47 million files of archives, stored over 27 km from stations in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not until here only in a "humanity" term, i.e. individually and nominally, at the request of an ancient victim or of his rights-holders.
The eleven States responsible for their management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to searchers and historians.
Since the ratification process for this agreement has been completed by all States, opening has been effective since yesterday.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
Access by historians to Bad Arolsen will allow for search " particularly on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced workers " , Reto Meistern, director of these archives administered by the International Red Cross Commission (CICR).
To date, several States, such as Germany, have been opposed to the public opening of these nomination documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Just as the supposed homosexuality or the mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or detention orders established by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war in a practical manner: to meet the deported or underprivileged countries and, if possible, to give them proof of their internship, with a view to opening the way for their compensation.
Today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees are dealing with tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
" There is nothing fundamentally new to be expected of these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Anti-Semitism Research Centre at the Technische University of Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free change agreement in 2008
At present, the Indian bilateral trade has reached around EUR 60 billion per year.
The European Union is India's first trade partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free change agreement in 2008, the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian Homologist, Kamal Nath.
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the European Union had given their approval last April to the European Commission to begin negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Indo-European bilateral trade has already reached around EUR 60 billion per year.
The European Union is India's first trade partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trade partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
" A free exchange agreement will double most of the two economies " and " India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans " , Peter Mandelson explained.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the ten first products exported by India, the European Commissioner said. Asian and European giants are changing annually by " 47 billion euros of goods " and by "10 billion euros of services", Daniel Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, has said this week that bilateral trade "has not yet achieved its potential". The European Union and India will meet Friday for its eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns, offering 10 billion pounds in five weeks
The Bank of England was concerned about the current return of credit concerns, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds to the basic index of 5.75% in five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
" In order to alleviate the concerns under which financial market conditions will be particularly affected for the year, and to give banks greater certainty as to how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to provide an important proportion of its intended reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a open market operation for five weeks " , the Bank indicates in a communication.
The bank needs 10 billion euros (14 billion euros) to be placed on the market on 6 December at 12 a.m. 15 GMT, the basic index and until 10 January.
This is the first time it seems that the BoE English bank puts liquidity in the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These usually take place in a week.
The BoE adds in its communication that " is prepared to take other measures to keep the indexes " of interbank loans online with its basic index.
The interbank index per day was the Wednesdays of 5,829 %.
The index was established after three months at 6.6 %, higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts placed on the market by the Bank of England have been combined with an important index of penalties which had made it difficult for banks to recover.
According to some rumors, supported by the evolution of the euro-related freedom change, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts brought on the market by the European Central Bank, to the most profitable indexes and with a more secure discretion.
UMP and NC parties refuse to review the PS party's proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and the New Centre refused Thursday to discuss articles of the socialist law proposal on purchasing power, which was equivalent to a disassessment of the text.
In a socialist "nice" (meeting for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text referred to a decade of measures taken on Tuesday by the PS national office, including an increase of 50 per cent of the surplus for employment, the restoration of the TIPP (internal rate for oil products) fleet, a check-in or the restrictions on rentals.
Since UMP and NC have voted against the review of articles (180 votes against 115), the session has been raised at the end of the general debate that led to exchanges, sometimes live, between most and some hours of the television intervention of Nicolas Sarkozy on the acquisition power.
The head of MPs, Jean Marc Ayrault, announced that his group would represent the integrity of its proposals in the form of amendments to the draft legislative financing legislation examined by the Assembly next week.
A New Festival of Light
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter / producer announced the Vienna Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the British producer Melvin Benn Republic Festival.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who inspired, no more or less, the current movement of festivals in America," Charlie Jones of C3 entrusted to Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a summer destination for the campsite.
The festival would take place from 8 to 10 August in a private farm of 500 acres around 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Another time known under the name of Mean Fiddler, director of the Republic Festival, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989 he took the direction of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added Leeds Festival to his portfolio and then in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Festival Latitude of Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury of "more inspiring event " to which she has never attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says her company and Melvin Benn work in parallel to give the region a European-style event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the center of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
" We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited by this project.
Unfortunately, we are in low-class policies because of the current administration, pursues Charlie Jones.
" Fortunately, we could discuss with Melvin Benn and prepare ourselves to create a magnificent festival on an exceptional site that finally took place in Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurfaced the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at the Grand Park in Chicago, after being demarked in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross income of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These festivals have a place in the urban environment.
"Melvin Benn's European model is a camp festival, while ours are doing better in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give once a country festival impression into the European and urban way in the American way. "
Vineland is more or less on the middle road between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
" The Venezuelan community, including the mayor, actively supports the celebration of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter is denied to reveal the terms of the agreement, but says " that they are quite interesting to allow to invest in such a event and to attend a festival that, we hope, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the hotel offer at this festival is "very big", for example, 80 000 people from Bonnaro Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed at the time they went under pressure.
"Vineland will have the pleasure of rock, but music will be varied there, hoping to attract all sorts of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Award Top Independent Promoter from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.:
Montreal is in front of the Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood movies to Montreal when nothing more than Terminator is against that...
This seduction mission is part of the delegation's functions.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces " runaway productions " .
Is it hard to compete with the Governor?
"It must be prudent, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you'll go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best," he says.
The race to festivals
At the moment, Denis Turcotte's priority is despite the promotion of the film here.
The race to the Oskares is started.
All the festivals of the West Coast, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present the Czech films, give them value and ensure that the performers conduct interviews.
The teen years had a good image at 30° Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented to Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is in a folder in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four long meters and four short meters to the American Film Institute Festival this month.
Will there be a rally at the end of the year in the bag? Experts, divided by the crisis 'subpresse'.
In less than five weeks to defer the end of the exercise, investors are already shaking their hands, waiting for the traditional rally to come at the end of the year.
However, this year the experts do not know so clearly that this is going to happen.
Banif believes that "from the statistical point of view, December in bag often has a positive attitude.
However, forecasts should not be made solely on the basis of statistics, even though in the current context, uncertainty lies in the markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not party to the fact that the bus is racing in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the bourgeois market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest in the absence of guarantees, especially the fixed interest rate, which is affected by the return to quality values both in long-term and shorts".
Therefore, they believe that the bag will have a better lateral behaviour, not a avoidance of voltility "over everything because it is not known the impact of the likely decline of the Fed types, given the high level of cruelty and the risk of stimulating inflationist tensions".
Javier Barrio, responsible for sales of BPI in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to venture to say that there's going to be a rally.
"It's not the thing for many joys," the expert assures.
Ibex has lost approximately 4% since the maximum marked on 8 November when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Still not all experts have this very negative vision.
Juan Solana, analyst of Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year close to the 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of the maps and traditional contributions to pension plans that are produced every year at these dates.
However, the expert points out that things will be something different this year because he believes that the rally will move forward to the second week of December, after the moment of the Constitution.
The analyst does not think that the volatility will affect the market trend.
On the other hand, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inverses Banco, says that we are close to technical levels and "so we could see a draft of the index that could be inspired by the news coming from the US on the consequences of the crisis in the credit market".
The analyst trusts these to be positive.
Analysts agree on the time to choose the values that will be charged to lead Ibex to new maximum rates.
Solana, from Intermoney, says "This year it touches you with great values."
The expert would include the two large banks and some builders "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
In the meantime, Federico Olucha, of Investments Bank, ensures that the subsidies will come from the bank and the industrial sector.
Builders can also benefit from this rally, if they do.
"ACS takes several months to recover positions and we expect other builders such as Railway and FCC to follow their own path," explains the expert.
cyclic consumption will be protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the time of navigational sales.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, only two occasions in December has been a month ago.
The genuine end-of-year rally took place in 2003, the exercise in which the bourgeois market emerged from the crisis caused by the punctuation of the technological bourgeois.
This year, in which Ibex 35 recovered a 28.17%, December recorded a 6.68% score.
It will have to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profits (Ibex is currently up 8.36% since January) and if it is able to count with its final year round.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours a week
Popular has decided to renovate most of its offices.
In total, 200 are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These subsidiaries, which will operate under the popular brand Max, represent a big change for the bank.
It is also for the rest of the Spanish entities, as it is the first group that is decided to give the jump to the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 20.30 p.m. and to open the Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 20.30 p.m.
Another group that has also repeated on several occasions that wanted to expand the times of its subsidiaries, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
In the meantime, it is about to conclude an agreement with trade unions to close 75 per cent of their offices on Saturdays instead of opening one afternoon, although not to the public.
The results of the Popular experience will be decisive for other entities to point out whether or not to this initiative according to trade time periods.
This is precisely the objective that is pursued by Popular with the project.
Catch the particular customers moving through these areas to carry out their purchases, to the pymes, autonomouss and trades of the chosen streets to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 open offices throughout Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but remodeling existing ones.
To that end, the entity will modernise the resources already available in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile that customers present on the different roads.
In this way, the expansion of the watches is accompanied by a different design from the branch space and a new design, more modern, with more bright colors.
The commercial bank manager, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this restructuring does not entail a large investment, although a higher staff contract, since it takes place with about six local employees at eight or nine.
Offices, which will even count with spaces so that the pymes can meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And experience has been positive, according to Ángel Rivero.
The Survivors of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Grand Road of Madrid have been elected, and it seems that with certainty, according to Rivero.
Popular accounts are currently available with 2,500 subsidiaries.
And 60 others operating under the WorldCredit brand, specialized in immigrants, also with very wide hours, even opening Sundays and festivals.
In these areas of PopularMax, the BBVA model will not repeat, where several of its offices have a large non-financial product bank for their sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers,' says Rivero.
From now on, they have reached an agreement with Telephonic to sell mobiles, with external staff at the bank.
The first time the value in Bolsa from its rival Antena 3
We got it.
With that phrase, he expressed his satisfaction yesterday with Paolo Vasile, a delegate from Telecinco, at the end of the market, when he realized that the leading chain doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect pushed his joy: 'it's what I'm sorry, it's not because we've grown more but because we've dropped less,' he said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco concluded yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
That gain puts your loss in what we've been doing since the year 15.66%.
The value in Bolsa of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and participated by Vocento (other 13%) thus reaches EUR 4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg's data.
Its Antena 3, which last night dropped a 1,52% and accumulated a drop of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193,46 million.
The value of the other reported communications companies rose to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million Prisa (Cinco Day Editor) and 1,779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 must be that we're talking about two similar companies.
The fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we make it profitable in terms of hearing.
Telecinco announced last week that it is planned to become the first television series this year to exceed 1,000 million gross advertising revenue, according to the group's delegation's adviser, Giuseppe Tringali, the branch managing the advertising of the group.
In order to make this announced data real, the television chain would record an increase of 3.6 per cent in its advertising bill with respect to 965.4 million in 2006.
On the other hand, the net invoice of Antena 3 increased by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the period (up to 734.4 million) while net TV revenue increased by 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution in Bolsa de Telecinco is the high pay out that has so far remained: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the benefit among its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is ready to make the decision, this ratio may vary after buying 33% of Endemol in conjunction with its Mediaset matrix.
'We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always stated much more.
This year, I hope we are able to leave our shareholders happy, whom we have already valued with 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market offers samples at these moments of certain fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced their profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and in 2009, by 7%.
It should be explained that the projected increase in income from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
This same signature has reduced the expected gain of Antena 3 by 4.5 per cent in 2008 and 7.5 per cent in 2009.
3 opinions
It's the first time I've ever seen.
Ibersecuritys: it recommends buying both values based mainly on its high profitability by dividing and sustainable long-term potential.
It's not like I'm here.
The Madrid Box: see Telecinco (accumular) better than Antena 3 (keep) by the 'multiple Attractives' and business heights.
It's not like I'm here.
JPMorgan: It is recommended to inframpone in both cases with similar threats (sustained market and poor economic climate).
Congress approved the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary procedure, which ended today with the vote by the Congress on the amendments incorporated into the draft Senate, the Government has submitted to the public a regulation which will develop the new law, with the aim that both will enter into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by MEPs and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation in order to ensure the protection of investors and to provide detailed information on the activities of the entities for the effective functioning of the markets.
The Mifid, which amends the Valor Market Act, aims to modernise the financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various European Union supervisors.
The new regulation will allow financial advisory services to be provided to both specialized and legal entities and create a new type of financial services firm (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFIs), which are linked to securities companies, securities agencies and card management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for the execution of financial instruments is widened so that the regulated secondary markets are combined with multilateral trading systems and internalisation systems, which will compete with the current bus managers.
The Law also obliges investment services companies to disseminate on the market information on the key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and risk management and requires them to carry out a record of all operations carried out to facilitate the supervision of CMMV.
In its course by the Congress Economic Commission, several amendments were incorporated, including the fact that the debt held is considered to be a "complement" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated by what happened with the debt of high-risk mortgages in the United States (substantiation).
In addition, the transposition of the Directive was used to legally delimit the functions that diplomats can develop in Economics and Enterprises for 30 years after the adoption of the actual decree limiting professional functions reserved for economists in 1977.
The Senate, on the other hand, incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the intermediary, which will work on account of it, will not require the authorisation of the CNMV and will be able to provide its product and customer marketing services to different investment firms at the same time.
The Harmonised IPC increases five decades in November, up to 4.1%.
This indicator, which is later used in Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides progress on how prices have evolved in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide timely and quality data to producers in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the user for the Harmonised Consumer Price Index, but using various methods of statistical modelling to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of their publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator was only indicative, so it should not necessarily coincide with the final date, which will be known on the next 14 December.
"IPC will continue at relatively high levels"
The vice-president and Economic Minister, Pedro Solbes, said that the rise in a 4.1 per cent of the IPC in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time he pointed out that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in the Congress's passports that "although the figure is not good" the difference in Spain's inflation over the monetary union remains "more or less" the same in recent years.
It has also explained that in November "there has been less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not count on such a high rise.
"We looked forward to a figure around 4%," recognized the Minister of Economy with regard to today's progress.
Virgin plan to recover with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros in three years
Northern Rock's deposits have fallen more than 50% to 12 billion pounds (16,800 million euros) since it entered the crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At that time, there was a record record of over $25,000, a figure that had fallen progressively in two and a half months because of the mistrust of its clients and despite the hundreds of millions of money that the Government had offered and that would remain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would re-number the entity with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenue in British banks that are deposited in the next three years to achieve those remaining 18.000 million pounds until the goal of 30,000 million is achieved.
The group of Magnate Richard Branson, known for its so-called advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, aims to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually in advertising and marketing to achieve its aim.
Northern Rock appointed this week the offer of Virginia's company, in which three other companies participate, as their favorite to rescue him from the bank.
Arrested the mayor of Totana by allegedly frame of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has detained today at the first hour of the morning at the current mayor of the city of Totana (People's Party) for its alleged relationship with the apparent urban corruption rate this week.
In addition, one of the constables and the mayor of the municipality police has also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced last May with Juan Morales, the current popular Member, and until then the mayor of the municipality, and that according to sources of research consulted by the Cadena SER, it could be the 'head' of this line.
Officials continue to register municipal units and Urbanism Councils and no more detentions will take place in the coming hours.
In addition, the letter of Juan Morales, the main suspect of the stage of urban corruption, has been printed at the beginning of this week.
As well as yesterday he informed Cadena SER, to the lawyer of the Member 'popular' Juan Morales, who was so disappointed, he was arrested by leaving the Home of Morales with important documentation related to the trauma.
Moreover, the subject of the investigation, according to sources of research, is the alleged cover of Morales commissions instead of facilitating the signing of a urban convention with a Galilean construction company to recalibrate 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people arrested.
Welcome to the Headship of the PSOE for Toledo and to the Congress if they win
Former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of PSOE by Toledo for the next general elections and to be president of the Congress if the Socialists win the general elections.
This was announced in press round by the Secretary of the Organization of the PSOE, José Blanco, and his own Bono, after the meeting that he held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive has justified the offer to the former Minister because "it is important to count with the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he pointed out that "so it seems" that the weak political group will be the candidate of the Socialist Group to preside over the Congress if the Socialists win in the next elections.
It would be good to replace the President of the Congress with Manuel Marín, who published his decision on 15 November not to submit to the next general elections and to abandon his career in active policy to fight climate change in the university area.
The former Minister has recognized that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he should return to the political vanguard since he left it two years ago.
He also noted that, as citizens know who will be the vice-president of the economy if the PSOE wins the elections, its party has wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress in a "transparency act".
If he reaches his job, Bono expects to turn the House into "the house of respect and not the insult or cry" and to make "it seems more and more to the citizens".
"Sometimes it seems sad that the only place in Madrid where we can't speak peacefully and with our presence is Congress, at some point the President of the Government interrupted him at the Senate 26 times."
Also, he has had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his good work" and he has not wanted to see himself taking his place so as not to fall into what, as he has pointed out, his opponents could see as "prepotence".
Climate Promotion
Since the movement against climate change is subject to unwarranted persecution by both the sceptics of its predictions and those who prioritise other political and social struggles, it is required to show a coherence of iron.
And another leader of the movement who is president of the Government as Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than Islamic terrorism and even proposes to sign a "new contract with the planet".
This approach requires you to explain why the action, or inaction, of your Government has made a decisive contribution to Spain's failure to implement Kyoto.
Who are responsible for non-compliance, in which sectors have been produced and why his Government, the contract with the planet, has not prevented it.
In addition, it requires him to explain to the Spanish with the utmost clarity what measures he will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizens' habits will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to do, what economic consequences it will have.
Who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has not been nor will there be such explanations.
Exactly because it's about sacrifice and paying.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are impotence.
Costs, disadvantages and threats to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Even the centenium of the fuel proposed by the PSOE has seemed so dangerously dangerous to Zapatero that he has been urged to deny it.
I mean, it's trying to save the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With impressive sentences, commissions, committees, protocols, new duties.
By contracts with the planet, that master is so useful to the electoral campaigns that he neither speaks nor complains nor demands, but admires the myths and inspires terror.
Whenever it is limited to being a virtual contracting party and does not expect us to move on a bicycle or refresh us with the banana.
Arrested by the mayor and chief of the local police in Totana by a alleged coup d'état
The Civil Guard has detained the mayor of the murchin village of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the Secretary of the Association and a hostel businessman for possible urban crimes, have reported sources of research today.
He was arrested in his home and has been transferred to the Consisterio, whose units are now located alongside many agents, who have also attended the Urbanism Council and the municipal management company of the Industrial and Housing Land.
These three arrests took place six months ago in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the recalculation of more than 2 million hectares of Russian soil in urbanized areas so that the Gallagian company Nuaria could build 4,000 homes after the payment of illegal commissions during the past legislative period.
In addition, two other persons were not detained but are included in the summary, which teaches Judge No. 1 of Totana.
The first six arrests have taken place today.
According to the sources, the former director of Totana and today the autonomous parliamentarian of the PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has become imputed, just as the current novel of the former director, who lives in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur livee Manuel N.A., was detained in Nigrán (Pontevedra), like Pablo José M.G., director of Sole de Inmonauur, an integrated agency in the aforementioned Group, and through which the subsoils would have been carried out.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, practiced nine records, the majority of companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was then arrested in Totana, in particular, the owner of a company of highly known poultry products in the region, who could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing what would be the largest residential complex in the city of Totana, which would support the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonauur, dedicated to real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages live parkings in Coruña, Venezuela and the square of Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Preconit, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.
Things That Go Away
It's the first time I've ever seen.
If it seems to them, let's leave the Book of Mes, see if another 'premiology' and other competences occur.
I'm already running something.
Life is a change, people.
Of course, you are invited to propose inventions.
It's not like I'm here.
Our Finnish correspondent makes this comment yesterday in Finland's most important newspaper (in particular the PISA report on educational level in the world), Helsinki Sanomat, which refers to what they published on 18 November, the very day on which the criticism of the book of Blackburn appeared, curiously:
"The content of the philosophy signature has jumped to the public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokele's school.
The killer of the dead, a student of the bat, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Council responsible for the assignment of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, requested from the pages of the newspaper Helsinki Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes."
It's not like I'm here.
A colleague provides information on the introduction to the Criminal Code of Crimes on Internet Downloads:
A. The removal of a song would be a crime of six months a year.
On the other hand, if you steal discs at the store at a value of less than EUR 400, it is considered simply missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal up to EUR 1,000 in the store, the thief is already guilty, but the penalty remains below the tax on the download (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty remains below the download (art. 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participation in a tumourous kidney has a three-month penalty per year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and exchange would have a six-month penalty for two years
(Article 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted and unauthorized films is more punished than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Finally, if my colleague's right, someone's walking in his hand, a very long hand.
I'm sorry.
My head doctor sends me one of his articles on rare research: 'Money produces brain activity, especially if others receive less'.
In other words, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depend on what fellow workers earn.
The study has been conducted through magnetic resonances at Bonn University, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, director of the study and director of the Life&Brain Image Group Image group in Germany: "The strongest activation was performed when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed".
The researchers observed that if both were satisfied with the same payment, the activation was moderate, but if one received the double, the activation was higher.
I don't know if I'd need so much science this conclusion.
The Balcanese Tax
Carla del Ponte is eight years old, continuing relentlessly to war criminals of the Balkans since the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, located in La Haya.
Its mandate ends at the end of the year and Carla will go with an agricultural taste, because the main officials of Srebrenica's death - in which 8,000 Muslims died - the former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic continue to be released.
His names are on that list, which takes his title from the Swiss documentary by Marcel Schüpbach, 'The Carla List' (2006, not foreigners in Spain) who, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor in Belgrade in New York to persecute the Jewish criminals and pressure the governments involved to close the search.
What do I think I deserve?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in front of possible sinisters, implies an important cost which will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, the ancientness of the meat, the civil state, the type of vehicle to ensure or use it, among others.
Having the car is only the beginning.
And that, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we're talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between a insurance company and the insurance company.
This commitment is materialised in an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the first agreement instead of being liable for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a fine.
The first is the price of insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, the ancientness of the meat, the civil state, the type of vehicle to be ensured or the use it is made of, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so that the more likely to suffer an accident, the more costly it is to subscribe.
That is why 25 older women and women must pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a smaller index of synergy due to their discretion.
Also, by exaggerating the accounts, companies have come to the conclusion that married persons have less accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and hence the probability of having any kind of percussion.
As the frequency increases, the probability increases.
There are many variables that insurance policymakers take into account when establishing the price of the premium.
That is why the driver must carefully examine the situation in order to choose the car insurance that is best adapted to his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables at the time of choosing one or more types of insurance, so that you will, in addition to adapting to the features of the insurance, offer a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 years of age are faced with various accidents at the time of buying insurance at an affordable price, such as the reduced experience in driving and the ancientness of the meat.
Although the ideal to be safe is safe at all risks, there are other more economic options.
Precautionary drivers can choose for a full risk with franchise, so that they can obtain the coverage of insurance at all risk but at a more feasible price.
This type of agreement would suggest that the customer pays part of the amount of the synergy.
"The part of the value of the synergy that the client will contribute will be determined according to the value of the premium, which will be higher than that of the amount," says Luis Noguera, the top official in Spain of First Europe, an online insurance intermediary.
Another option is a security to third parties enlarged, so that the customer ensures protection against damage caused to third parties, although not before the causes in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and vehicle loss.
A council.
If you are under 25 years of age, try to be careful and avoid the sinisters as far as possible, as this will affect the bonus, which could reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the basic rate owned by the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is a charge on that basic rate.
"Banctions and penalties will depend on the company and its benefit.
If the company has had a good year, it can be allowed to increase the bonuses," Noguera explains.
After the fall of 25 years, drivers have it easier at the time to hire a security, as the synergy index is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, the most recommended is to buy a full risk with franchise.
"Of course, young people cannot make use of the experience previously acquired at the time of an accident, and even at the time of conduct," assures the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of conduct, once again the 'in the middle of the news'.
However, if the client is married but still has no children, it is preferable that he negotiates insurance at all risks, always and when his economic situation permits it, of course.
On the other hand, marriages with children are considered by insurance agents as the public with a lower rate of synergy, so the recharges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be one at all risk with franchise (may be EUR 300), or, where there is a high level of bonus, one to three-thirds extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
"They carry out a more relaxed conduct and have a greater purchasing power to allow the luxury of taking a larger amount of franchise," the Luis Noguera sentence.
For young people, insurance is recommended for all risks with franchise (i.e. EUR 150), or one to three-thirds of the adult population when there is a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver in front of possible sinisters, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to study adequately the insurance that suits us more according to our personal situation.
Celtic seeks in Milan a point worth the octaves
Milan and Celtic are measuring this Tuesday in San Siro looking for the point they need to achieve their respective goals in the closure of the ‘Champions’ league, as Italians serve them for the first time and the Scots to condemn their classification.
The Italians have taken ten points and have already certified on the fifth day their passage with an empathium in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to ensure that Shakhtar, with six, receives the Benfia, which has four, does not go ahead.
These two groups of Group D will be played one week before the end of the sixth day, as Milan has to debate the World Club in Japan, where it starts 13 in semifinals seeking a place for the end of 16.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the impact on Giuseppe Meazza seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out of a victory, because the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic knows that winning would be the first and will ensure a better cross in octaves.
As a whole, Gordon Strachan could even use a defeat to classify himself if Shakhtar did not win, but it cannot be trusted because at the same time as nine points the pass is for Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct battle.
Thus, the Milanists will try to torture him at night to the Scots, who trust to stand in eights a second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively after they were completely defeated in that round the past campaign with a Kaka gol in the distance (1-0) after the 0-0 of the year.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rosoneri' will be Shakhtar who only deserves the triumph, in case he loses Celtic, to stand in octaves and to follow the UEFA.
And it is that even though it is the last and no options to follow in the European maximum competition, it could achieve the third stage with a victory, with which the UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls race race in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver, Canada, before some 20,000 spectators, their first round since they were released in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before starting their concert at the GM Stadium Place de Vancouver that the group's meeting was "extended".
About 20,000 people attended the concert, which included a video on the history of the group that became angry at the end of the 1990s.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that collects its main achievements as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five integrated Spice Girls went out the stage by lighting up a few brazalets that had given them the husband of 'Push Spice', British footballist David Beckham.
The athlete was among the audience that surrounded GM Place, although Victoria's nerves had been banned days earlier.
At the beginning of the show, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British star "has not seen our dress, for nothing, so I'm nervous about what it's going to think of the show".
'Sporty Spice' whose group's output in 1998 "for differences between us" caused the resolution of the fifteenth two years later, also expressed its nervousness during a press encounter, two hours before the start of the show.
"It's forbidden to sit down.
I was nervous but I saw that the world's feeling has changed, the feeling by the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I am glad that I made the decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting that she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also pointed out that in time, "the things have been settled and we all love one another very much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl took place last time together in 1998.
To begin, according to CTV TV, the group arrived at Vancouver on a special plane from Virgin Airlines.
When he arrived at the airport, he was waiting for a child army.
Among the five are seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will act in California (USU), San José (4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
Madrid will act on 23 December.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing debate on the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk of the export of fuel to Western Europe by Russia.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so each rock between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the gas price, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A previous debate last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, a monopolical gas owner, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money that Ukraine should pay for the Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom said it would cost more in Ukraine, as it had committed to pay an extra 50% in 2008 for the gas coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it could be that Ukraine pays 40% more than the imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transits during the talks," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters news agency.
"The changes in gas prices should not relate to our arguments on the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] across Ukraine."
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut supply in Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a fall in exports to Western Europe, which quickly rose prices.
Russian gas represents the fourth part of the EU supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, but many of them are still not fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own supply with Turkish gas and other former Soviet countries in Central Asia.
NHS "should test foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to monitor previous criminal records of workers outside Europe, said one observer.
The recommendation of Auditor General Robert Black came after it was verified that a foreign doctor was related to the attack on the airport of Glasgow in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish NHS does not have the exact idea of the number of foreign staff with which it counts.
However, his report indicated other controls that were carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The auditor-general checked the number of foreign staff hired outside the European economic area, due to attacks at the airport of Glasgow.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep was shot at the gates of the airport's terminal building.
He was one of the three doctors who acted in the Old Bailey by video conference in October, accused of being hit by a car bomb in the United Kingdom.
NHS expects pre-employment checks on candidates to be carried out to ensure that they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the Scotland Health Board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out criminal checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside Great Britain.
The report of the Auditor-General recommends, among other measures, that meetings should be held under the direction of the Criminal Records Bureau, which assists employees with criminal controls in many countries outside Great Britain.
"Although we find some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review," says the report.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes: "Our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the NHS's foreign staff."
BMA President of Scotland, Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks operate in NHS Scotland but it is not clear what the added value of the recommendations made is," he explained.
The Scottish health authorities claim that there are currently 1,161 foreigners, most of them doctors and nurses.
But the general auditor warned that the number could be higher, in part because the associations have problems identifying which employees are with unlimited residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Aran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lotian were being carried out extensively.
This includes passport checks, work permit and qualifications check.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing foreign policy and pre-employment guide in NHS.
The health secretary, Nicola Sturgeon, said: "I had a great interest in carrying out this work because of the terrorist attack on the airport of Glasgow.
He added that the Scottish Government, together with health associations, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this would be reflected in the update of pre-employment control guides for all working groups, including foreigners, which were scheduled to be published next month.
Joy Division dominates cinema awards
Control, the biography film on the late vocalist of Joy Division, Ian Curtis, has won five prizes at the British Independent Film Festival, including the Galardon in the best film.
The trophies were also given to protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until it was selected for the role of Curtis, for Director Anton Corbín and co-protagonist Toby Kebell.
The actress Judi Dench was named best actress by the thriller "Notes of a scandal".
And Bond's protagonist, Daniel Craig won the prize of variety by placing a British film on the international scene.
The prizes were delivered at a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows the rise to the fame of Curtis with Joy Division, until his death in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film - in white and black - which has a sound band of The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced with only 3,000 pounds of star.
But he also won the Dutch photographer Corbín, already known by the cartoon icon of the U2 Joshua Tree album, graduated with two prizes – the best director and the best debut director.
The rock music was the center of another prize in the ceremony - like Julien Temple film on the vocalist of The Clash Joe Strummer, won the award to the best documentary.
The award to the best actor was taken by Viggo Mortensen for his role as the leader of the London Russian mafia, in the film David Cronenberg Promises of the East.
Ray Winston, who has a reputation for playing hard, received Richard Jarris' award for his contribution to British cinema.
The 50th, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming Indiana Jones's century "The Kingdom of the Crystal Cave".
Winston said he was proud to receive that prize, so named in honor of Harris, the star of Camelot and Harry Potter, died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, is really an honor."
The independent cinema prizes, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes cinematists, actors and festival organizers.
Sympathetics and events at the Bifa festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Arrest 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that 208 terrorists military forces were planning an imminent attack on oil installations, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning the missile contraband.
Sympathetics from Al-Qaeda have set up a campaign against the local monarchy, in partnership with the United States, since 2003 after Iraq's invasion.
An eight military cell formed by foreign residents planned an attack on a oil plant in the province of East, declared the television report.
Saudi Arabia created 35,000 effective forces to protect Abqaiq, the world's largest oil plant, following a failed Al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Minister of the Interior, said that 18 arrests belonged to a cell led by a "mission launching expert" who had entered the country.
The Minister said that the military had planned to enter eight projects in the country.
22 other detainees were planning killings of religious leaders and security forces.
The Government warned the religious leaders that they should be more active to stop the Saudis travelling to Iraq from joining as soldiers in Al-Qaeda to fight the allies and support the Muslim Shiita government, which is considered heirship by the most extreme Sudanese.
The Al-Qaeda militias are looking at many religious people in Saudi Arabia who have been designated by the authorities to support the policies of the real family, which dominates the government.
Soldiers - recruited by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda, born in Saudi Arabia, to reach the pro-western government of the country - had foreign residences associated with the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort of the security forces, since five months of work," said the Minister of the Interior on state television.
The arrests also include a "mediatic cell" of 16 people in Medina, whose aim was to promote "takfiri thought" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against the so-called faithless and apostate Muslims.
The arrest includes 32 other persons accused of providing support and financial support to the military.
Venus climate can give an idea of the future of the Earth
Venus could have once been an appropriate place for life, scientists said yesterday.
The data of a European spaceship in orbit showed the planet more like a jewel of Earth than had previously been observed.
Venus is the nearest planet to Earth.
The two planets have similar size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those made from Earth a habitable planet, now scientists believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the winter effect, the atmosphere erosion by solar radiation and the slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different kind of development.
Today the planet does not have water, the surface temperature is enough to slow down the flame and it is erosion by hurricane winds and hurricanes.
The results of the European Space Agency for Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, offer a overview of how Earth could develop catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor, of the Oxford University Physics Department and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, says: "It is clear why the climate in Venus is so different from the Earth, when two planets are so similar.
"Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario in which Venus began as Earth, possibly with a living environment millions of years ago."
Police recommend "rich uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, which they claim is enriched uranium, was decommissioned yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The effect could not be confirmed if it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (48,000 pounds).
Still Open
Mitt Romney says that it is not appropriate for presidential candidates to answer the questions of a snowmound.
However, the Republican candidates for the presidency may be able to hold a debate on YouTube, where common and current voters record questions in video and send them for their dissemination among candidates.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday, 28 November, were more ridiculous than the snow monasteries who asked Democrats about climate warming in the YouTube Republican party's debate.
But questions, and answers, this time reflected much of the Republican party's state of face to the elections next year.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, co-sponsored the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates to appeal.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, focused on immigration.
The theme is one of the most powerful topics for the Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to go up the dialogue when they heard ideas that pleased them: the stations noticed approval points when the candidates spoke with extreme arguments.
The most difficult exchanges of words at night were between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a point in the critical investigations of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to destroy Romney's reputation because he was pale with illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work in his home.
Both responded aggressively when they were asked if any candidate could support an "amnesty" (allowing the illegals to regulate their situation and giving them the opportunity to obtain citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, reached agreement on the subject.
No one has the word to be nominated, but they both stay on the race, perhaps because they both warned about immigration before others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This topic, coupled with the fear of Chinese toxic toys and other external concerns, helps the Republicans forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became uncomfortable when other topics appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr Romney discussed whether water immersion should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed in each word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to turn his attention to the fact that although the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, first in Iowa's most recent survey, thanks to his long-term Christian conservativeism, said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to answer if Jesus was in favor of him, the river said that Jesus was too intelligent as to be applied to the elections.
The race is not always open.
Mr. Huckabee is increasing in Iowa, consistent with liberal Ron Paul's fund-raising campaigns, and his warm statements of Wednesday's debate.
They both left the fund, because the two parties did not reach agreement on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the early and convincing party with a message of victory over the greatness of America, satisfying both parties.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Painful Workers
Gordon Brown has found another way to complain; but also emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
It does not appear to have been sold for influence, nor is it about exorbitant hotel accounts in Paris, nor extramarital tooth-suckles.
But it has been revealed that a rich business man has disbursed contributions to the British Labour Government party, of more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars), for nearly four years using false names, and that the party has not denounced it.
Two months ago, when the first minister called for an election, verbally insulting British intelligence saying that the polls did not influence their decision, the hope was that a strong and efficient government would provide it.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal democracy leads with growing engineering, because Mr. Brown's fear has become Stalin to be Mr. Bean.
Northern Rock's rescue, a problem bank, demonstrated regulatory weakness and poor judgment in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups together against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an imimaginable administrative trap.
A third of the generals who were removed started a fire in the chamber of the Lores, protesting against the courts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a medium-term employment.
Now they are the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of Labour (and former complicity) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown walks irrevocably towards the exit.
Governments can reach an inflation point after they are unable to rule.
People don't think of them as politicians, but they usually suspend their credibility when a new lot takes control.
Once it is clear that the first minister can't improve things, which is not too long for him, that suspension is more: public officials begin to fail; office ministers are exposed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is looking for defence and is not focused on it.
In part, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, it cannot be defended by arguing that it is new.
Even though I wanted to renegotiate Tony Blair, he was his superior.
The problems of Northern Rock and the registration tax of authority are related to the decisions Brown made as a cancellation of the error.
And even when it is not directly focused on Blairish's contracts - or "effective for partners", the investigation of the financing of political parties - voters may assume that it is.
However, Mr Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates aren't as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one has died, nor has he been directly rooted.
And the remedy, although painful, is to give what Mr Brown's natural Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compared his donations with gifts of charity, said that he did not want public recognition for his favour.
This may be so, but the decision doesn't make him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and there is a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have power.
Mr. Watt, who said he was aware of Mr. Abraham's agreement, and that he was not illegal, would obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, the fund-raising chief who was asked about the grants in October.
But Mr Brown has not so far been involved: there is nothing that would suggest he knew of these actions, although the amount of payments was made after he took control of the office in June.
Until now, the first minister has done half of the work.
He has been quick to condemn his party for violating the law, but is slowed down in making decisions on a family matter, a commission of inquiry on the matter - led, in good measure, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a police matter.
In addition, there are other things Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent and independent chief for the Committee on Standards in Public Life, since he has not had one in six months, and must also press for a genuine reform of the financing of the parties.
This will require a long-term cooperative work of workers with the Tories, and perhaps a rejection of the special financial situation that exists with unions - bitter measures for a party like Mr Brown.
But he must face some funny facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in the investigations; he is two years old to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with impeccable probation and strong competition.
Tiburone tartars
The mortgage crisis underpins the American credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's natural that some dorsal wings don't feel around.
Today, the US housing market is in crisis, the developers have their views on the country's credit cards market.
Analysts in Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses can reach $99 million if the mortgage crisis undermines other forms of consumer credit.
Contagion signs are coming.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortised or have more than 30 days of delay respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it took 1.4 million in its financing business to the American consumer, partly due to the weakness of card providers.
However, it is very early for panic.
Mortality and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, the third quarter of the crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates may be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the American law on persons' pensions (2005) led to a severe fall in the claims of pensioners, which in turn represented a large loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore, of mortgages) would be growing again, or may have been the conditions for the creditors had been improving.
The industry also reports solid payment rates, which show how much consumers pay their debts each month.
And confidence in credit cards and asset-supported values is strong enough, despite paralysing in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that the emission volumes for 2007 will be approximately 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of the crisis infection between the subprimary mortgages and the credit card market are certainly present: consumers like to charge credit cards now that credit institutions are losing.
However, the credit card issuers look more at the liquidity flow than the active values, so that falling prices do not necessarily result in a change in the creditors' credit capacity.
They can even work to benefit the stations.
The incentives for consumers to continue to be amortizing the mortgage indicate whether the properties are less valuable than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the card debt is listed in the priority list.
Card stations can also respond quickly and flexiblely to difficult conditions than mortgage lenders, changing types of interest or changing credit balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of rapid asset retreading.
"We're not going to wake up one day and reevaluate all the loans," says Gary Perlin, chief of Capital One Finance.
If a sudden sub-primary infection on the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If house prices are lower and a credit contract push America into recession, industry will undoubtedly face a more severe future.
You have to keep watching those dorsal wings.
British bankers convicted in the case of Enron
Three British bankers who were convicted of their responsibility for fraud with the former chief of Enron's financial office, Andrew Fastow, were declared guilty of these Wednesdays.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocents of seven fraud charges to compete with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to increase the cost of employees.
They were sent to court in January.
But during the hearing before Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. of the U.S. district, each was convicted as guilty of fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish PLC group in the Royal Bank, became famous in Britain for the two-year extradition procedures.
In the United States, its case marks the final flow of an investigation launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were to have warned Fastow in 2002 that it was the objective of a government investigation on the fall of Enron.
The charge against the bankers - doubled the "NatWest Tres" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraud scheme with Fastow and his former assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a firm controlled by Fastow, which was the artichoke of a thousand frauds in Enron, which helped her fall spiral in the neck.
In 2002, the bank valued the interests of the zero subsidy, but the three British knew that it would be worth it.
A company under Kopper's control bought the interest of the subsidy bank at $1 million.
Bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in that company.
According to the charge, Fastow falsely represented Enron, since the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its part in the subsidy.
But 20 million remained in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers accounted for 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the charge.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two conspiracy charges in the collapse of Enron.
The third British was arrested three months later.
Fastow is executing a 6-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is being punished for 3 years and a month in Texas.
Each of the three British banks is required to pay $1 million to live in the United States while the trial is held.
Enron, one of the seven largest companies of the nation, declared on bankroll in December 2001 after years of accounting, could not hide the debt of millions or make their business seem successful.
The collapse cost thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
Enron's founder, Kenneth Lay and former executive chief, Jeffrey Skilling were charged with debts over the years for their roles in the company's collapse.
Skilling is executing a sentence of more than 24 years.
Law's sentence for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of an attack on his heart last year.
We're not down in Moscow
The price of a Guffstream G550 plane, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
"He has up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, representative of Gulfstream.
"But nobody asks for that model of so many seats because it's for family private flights or for presidents of a company."
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream cabin last Friday in the Millionary Fair, a four-day consumption agency held at an event centre in the vicinity of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, 200 luxury suppliers had installed their exhibition stands, waiting to attract new Russians assembled to all kinds of products, from crafted yachts in the cab to car trailers of diamond-contained diamonds, from 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks carefully at a bright-arranged Porsche next to him."
"It's a nice car, but it's nothing and a necklace compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Fueled by oil supply, the Russian capital seemed to Dallas when he was in custody.
"We lived the same in 1890, when some retired Americans came together in Europe, where they were seen as materialists," says Marshall Goldman, senior professor of the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard University.
"As the health of the 70s and the Japanese in the 90s, the Russians are emerging as the world's largest consumers and consumers."
The most exclusive luxury brands in the world are looking for their part of the pastel.
In another location in Moscow, a conference will be held this week on the luxury industry with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by New York Times)
Russia has 53 million multi-billionaires making a total of $282 billion, according to the list Forbes of the richest people.
In addition, the second-class wealth includes 103,000 million Russians whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a local think tank.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of the Russians were below the level of subsistence.)
"There are hundreds of millions in Moscow - and that's why we're all here," says Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, the London jewellery.
She attended the fair for the first time with the Russian brand distributor, Soho Jewerry group.
"Women are impeccably prepared and men are very dignified."
Visiting the party on Sunday night, dressed in late afternoon, two breeders, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their customers and their own as millionaires.
"He looked at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infinite, Mercedes and Porsche," Yumatova said, who reeled off the design suit that he used as a red carpet vetering with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the type of buyers who would be willing to stay for several hours in a warehouse that mix brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum cuts, heated Mövenpick, swimming pools, Dubai apartments and Gund's Teddy oss.
The public can buy tickets of 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning what brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a stand of the Dutch real porcelain Delft, in front of a wall-size reconstruction of a painting of Rembrandt, made of steel painted by hand.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in bling-bling."
In fact, the sellers said that the rich Russians of more trajectory (10-15 years old, for Russian standards) have changed their tastes from the logos of limited editions, which would not be exposed in a commercial fair.
However, thousands of people — millions in effect, millions of tourists or tourists — fill the corridors every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the party last Thursday, Roman Ershaw, director-General of King Koil's Beds, said he sold two $70,000-dollar collection systems for each, silk, cachemira and cotton interested in gold children.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equipped high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the brilliant Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, company that changed luxury cars for particular requirements, said he had sold three car parcels in the form of chain brazalette for Rolls Royce Phantom, at $55,000 each.
He showed to the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with intertwined glass beams of Swarovski, so that it would be like a wheelchair wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
"The Russian millionaire who wants leather wheels or a photograph of his wife made of zirconium cubes, will not necessarily drive on those wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He's gonna keep the car in his garage, along with 30 or 40 other cars."
Even if many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian makes it clear that the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not mean exclusiveness, given the price oil of real estate properties.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, it's probably a millionaire, at least in the paper if it's not in effect," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who were not millions could at least pretend to be rich in support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red phone cabins (British style) filled with counterfeit billboards of a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors were stopped to collect money piles, asking their friends to take photos with their mobiles while resting on coins of money, or a couple of millions.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," says Karryev.
Surgeon surgery could be caused by a death in New Jersey
It was the day before Gracias Action when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the restaurant "A little healthier" and saw how an ambulance got up by White Cape Cod, two doors below West Scott Avenue.
Right away, a police patrol car appeared.
And then another one.
"Then you got the ambulance," said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant supervisor, that Wednesday.
"That was when I realized someone had died."
The authorities claimed that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41 years old, assistant to the Newark Police Department.
Now the researchers are trying to determine whether she died due to a procedure carried out by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by the police, but who works at the house of the 212 Av. West Scott.
The authorities still do not determine what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, but wait for the toxicological test, although the results will not be available for a few weeks. This will help to resolve the mysterious death that has been confined to the top lines of Newark's police.
Ms. Arroyo had been the assistant of the police director, Gary F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and his voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and tenaz," said Mr. McCarthy about Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
"She was my guard."
She protected me."
Mr. McCarthy said that Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Committee on the Control of Alcoholic Drinks, and left two children aged 14 and 11, and a daughter.
Eileen Walsh, the prosecutor of the Condado Union, Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives were trying to determine whether Mrs. Arroyo died from an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," said Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house about 3 P.M.
On November 21, they found Mrs. Arroyo in a sofa.
He was declared dead in the place.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have said little about their research or about the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh couldn't say if Mrs. Castro had been questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as medical advice.
Wednesday, no one answered the door in Mrs. Castro's house, where a rosal marchito is located in front of the house, and a thin side on the back.
A blue drum marked as "vainillina ethyl" - used as substitute for the vanilla in food and perfumes - was found at the corner of the car, next to a door leading to the sotan.
Two mountain bikes drop hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York police department, Ms. Arroyo was an invaluable help to get to know the new island city and its political culture.
"She would say, "you have to watch with this or that," he said.
"She was always here when I was, and also when she wasn't.
You're pregnant."
It is expected that the federal reserve will reduce the rates to raise the Bolsa
The shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to ease the credit conditions with cuts to interest rates, which increased with the comforting comments of the Vice-President of the Central Bank of the United States.
The bags were located in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two of Ben Bernanke, president of the reservation, stated that policymakers should be "flexible and pragmatic" in response to continued financial market tension.
In a clear effort to calm markets through growing samples of credit bags, Mr. Kohn said that recent turbulence was "in part invested by the improvement in the market in late September and during October".
If the trend continued, additional adjustments would increase in the financial conditions for real estate and business, Kohn said.
Comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital in the US markets and to make further cuts of interest type, to stabilize credit conditions.
Comments also helped calm Wall Street through bad news for the US economy, such as sales of houses that reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence were highlighted by a Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total labour, in a global cost reduction to compensate for the losses of its investments in the U.S. sub-primary mortgages.
Only 20 of these posts are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of the Dow Jones rose to 331 points, or 2.55%, to close to 13.289.40, while the wide S&P 500 index rose by 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index increased 165.5 points, or 2.7%, to 6.306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of first-order companies in Britain.
Germany's Dax index rose by 2.6%, and France's CAC40 was above 2.3%.
In the past, it was highlighted that credit tension in the markets was re-emerged after a strong demand for a three-month fund-raising by the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to European trading banks in a 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the implementation of the federal reserve and the ECB and to inject extra funds into the value markets in London increased the credit and rates of loans to three months "Libor" between the British banks, meaning the highest rate since September of 6.59 per cent, after a steady rise since 12 November.
England takes the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
There are two dilemmas here, each as difficult as the other.
Who should attack No. 6 by England at Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And no one is less important than the first trial against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the selection that is indemnity - with this particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the trainer, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the office of Hugh Morris, the director of England, is starting to fill out offers to become a national elector, and if not, in part time.
What does not achieve the sixth battle place will be unsuccessful, but life is often unfair and sport too.
It's not easy to pull what a man does on his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes because of a lack of luck more than by capacity.
Not only in cricket is the choice is difficult, since judgments are required that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair for Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another way if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and who know the business well, would have been promoted to the table: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a cricket player, unless he is in the occasion of crying or jumping to the next chance?
The figures, of course, have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to catch the captain's eye at the same time to take a "wicket" and a batter to get opportunities to change the order if he wants to have an impact as a player someday.
But catching the eye of the voters is more complicated.
There were many who improved the past season, for example, James Anderson, who certainly plays in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares himself "fit and bowls" as the wind in the networks.
Anderson took 32 first-class weekends in 33 courses for each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but they both had their high moments and could expect more of them.
Shah or Bopara games in the stadium of Asgiriya can be just an opinion issue.
Option can break or make a man's career, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Garreth Batty played in each test and did well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful careers, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who became an important player, and despite noting a double percentage against Australia, it can still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after further discussion at today's session in the Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and will favour Shah's greatest experience on the young Bopara's exuberance.
There are arguments for both.
In favor of Shah is its brilliant and valuable proof of the beginning of 88 in Bombay, 32 percent of the first class facing only 6 of Bopara, who, at 22, is seven younger years old, and has excellent precedents against spin bowling.
But Shah did only ten races in his two tournaments in May against West India in the Lords trial, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the voters when Vaughan claimed his place for the next meeting, it seemed that he had taken his "batting" something of an eland than in Bombay.
On the contrary, Essex's team is happy to live in swords.
He took nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summarized as when he turned his vehicle into an exhibition for the English car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, apparently a shock, but the first thing he did was to get his Vodafone (patrocinated, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked away, to tell him with excitement, "Do you see that?".
Bopara is the best player, it's including your rebalancing pass to have effects in your games that seem to satisfy it, because he beats it with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best moment, another.
Maybe that's the real art of the selection.
My invitation would give Bopar his opportunity, which does not mean that Shah doesn't oversold, as the tea leaves suggest, is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began to arrive at Baghdad yesterday, throwing out those who remained ineffective, without extension of the visa and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the soldiers who led them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus on an official train from the government consisting of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunita doctor.
"I returned today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and it's safe now."
"They say Mahdi's army has stopped killing people," he says, referring to the Chilean militia of the religious soldier Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops a moment's pause.
Qassim to Atwani, a 38-year-old teacher and teacher in the Sunite area of Amariah, returned with her two children because it was impossible to renew her vision in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in her country.
His neighbors called him by phone to tell him that an ally force from the United States helped get Al-Qaeda out of his boat to the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of Jordan's recent arrivals was the head of a Zionist and Chilean tribe who had been driven from his home in Sleikh to northern Baghdad by an attack of grenades, after urging the citizens to rise against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and the support of my companions."
"That's why I came back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62 years old.
Many said they were attracted by the increasing peace in the capital since the U.S. troops formed groups of "announced citizens", armed and working in cooperation with the US military to defend their neighbours.
But many have said that they have returned because of the denial of visas and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have been established in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years old and father of three children, voted in common doubt among the exiled, that Nouri al-Maliki, the first Chilean minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on the visas of refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe that they have fled the country because of the sectarian deaths.
"We were well until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop giving directions to the Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," the tsunami said.
"I can't believe in a government that supports criminals who burned my house after I left it."
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that the tsunamis have been expelled from the affected and vice versa, reducing tension.
There is the fear that a sudden wave of refugees will bring back the sectoral tensions and start the fight.
Little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and is also bright for the international guidance of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the sarilandese lack only one educational field.
"I explained for fifty times yesterday to a non-Sarlandese that we are not French" - that was the ironic motorcycle over itself of the smallest federal state for his 50th birthday.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg have a great role in the Sarre educational system that in a study of the Institute of the German Economy (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" took over the fifth place.
In this way, traditional higher schools have a good relationship with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
So far, students can finish their university career here with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, 15.6 per cent.
However, the number of students coming from Sarre is higher than the average in higher schools. Many of them do not have a bicycle.
"In Sarre the system of vocational education is being used," says Axel Plünnecke, an expert in the educational sector at the Institute of the German Economy (IW).
More than five young people do their homework in the Professional School. Thus, the Sarre is 7 percent higher than the national average.
On the contrary, the variety of possibilities for vocational and academic education is very wide.
The offer of the double race, in relation to the number of people, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and a growing demand, the number of titles in Engineering Sciences has decreased by a third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Ministry of Education of the Sarre required higher schools to make more publicity available for the specialities in Engineering Sciences.
"After the first PISA study, we carried out some reforms in general education schools," says a spokesman from the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government introduced comparative evidence throughout the country.
In order for children to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr", it has no cost. Meanwhile, this model also imitates other federal states.
The comparison with the next studies will show whether the performance of students has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of late students in school development decreased from 29 to 20 per cent.
But, in general, Sarre has not improved much more than other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
The PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field good results can be achieved.
Although the Sarlandese are not French, the language of the neighbors is a compulsory assignment in Secondary Education Institutes.
You need to change the time.
Nearly in Venezuela there will be another hourly wedding different from the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez allowed the clock to be changed in the South American country by delayed the average hour clock.
Currently Chávez is staying as a comic in Spain.
As the official Bulletin of the Venezuelan State has reported, according to the new law, the hour will be at least four hours of GMT.
In this way, the South American country will have an hourly wedding that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States will impose on the world on its day the obligation to change a full hour.
In addition, the Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the breaking of relations with his neighbouring country Colombia because of the action with mining.
The left-wing nationalist said he would not maintain any relationship with the head of state nor with the Colombian government until the conservative Alvaro Uribe continued to be the president of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do this," says Chávez, who is promoting a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, its power in the country could be extended to a large extent.
The reason for the conflict was the decision taken by Uribe by withdrawing Chávez's mandate in negotiations with the Marxist War in which the liberation of the hostages was dealt with.
Sunday Chávez said critically that the decision taken by Uribe has offended Venezuela.
There is also much to say about Chávez in Spain.
A new tone of call causes feelings in the country: "Why don't you cry?" is the phrase that has already downloaded half a million people.
This phrase was pronounced by the King of Spain, who was troubled by the ongoing interruptions by the peoples of the left in the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007 the decline in real wages threatened the Germans.
According to a forecast, this year a decline in the real wage threatens German employees despite a strong bond.
Experts present a large number of reasons for a pessimist.
According to the estimates of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should count in 2007 with a real balance sheet lower than the previous year.
"The blame for this is the poor change in wages, the increase in taxes on added value and the taxion of food and energy prices," reported Gustav Horn of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Economic Cycles.
New unemployment insurance charges may also apply to employees.
Minister of Finance Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Nue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention of reducing the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3 per cent over one year was just and reasonable.
Of course, the Labour Office has no need to re-enter into an unpleasant situation, asking for credits and grants to the Federal State, in accordance with the words of a political party of the German social-democratic party.
On Tuesday, the inflation rate with the price explosion in the food sector and the oil derivatives sector was publicized and reached the highest level for 13 years.
Compared to last year's prices, these are increasing by 3%.
Venus: brother sweet of the Earth.
Although the atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the most planet like the Earth, something that has not yet been planted. The "Venus Express" European probe discovered rays in the atmosphere and remolins in the fields, the same as they also appear in winter on Earth.
For three decades, researchers have suspected that there could be rabies in Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. In Venus the rays call a height of 54 kilometres from one cloud and behind the other, reports Cris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles to the scientific journal " nature".
According to the famous model of the origin of Urey-Miller's life, the rays caused life on Earth: storms could have caused reactions in the ocean that, in turn, had given rise to amino acids that are the basic components of life.
In Venus this is not the case: if one day had lived there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution," explains Sean Solomon of the Washington Carnegie Institute.
Today, on the surface of Venus there can be no life: the atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and on the surface there are 500°C temperatures, oscillating so that temperatures can be reached below zero.
"Probably, Venus is a "diabolic" witch of the Earth, but it remains a witch," said Russell.
The main objective of the "Venus Express" mission is to answer the question why Venus, so similar to Earth for its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
As there have been no special missions since the 1990s, only for research on this planet, the launch of Venus-Express in November 2005 was a very important step in Venus's investigation.
The latest results of research that will be presented in many articles of " nature", according to researchers, are not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
"This also shows that the nearby planets have more common features with the Earth than we had assumed," the ESA reported.
Despite the already known storm winds in the North Pole, researchers have also discovered in the southern polar region a voortics formed by the clouds that rotate faster.
This phenomenon reminds us of wind flows in the high ground air layers of the poles, as described by a team of researchers by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has almost the mass equal to the Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometres it is almost such large.
This planet is also called a white star or an orbital star around the Sun almost 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day in Venus equals 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars is not very similar to Earth, scientists are on the basis that both planets have been formed under the same conditions.
In the two planets water had been collected that remained in the oceans on Earth, but in Venus it was dissociated in the universe.
While carbon dioxide has been converted into carbon stones on Earth, in Venus forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's myth with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insisted on the end of the fight between the parties by Dalai Lama's reception in the Federal Chancellor.
He directly criticized the German Social Democrat Party for his attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the morning in September.
Horst Koehler, Federal President, was concerned about Germany's reputation and therefore demanded that the great coalition end that fight by the reception of Dalai Lama.
"In this case we must not present ourselves as a divided nation," Koehler told the newspaper "Handelsblatt".
At the same time, Koehler showed his understanding of the reception of Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Democratic Union Party) in September.
"Although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely cautious to me," Koehler said.
The whole world knows that Germany has to act with great balance in the field of foreign policy, highlighting the Federal President, defending Merkel for the challenge he received when he made a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance from the traditional course of one China policy.
China also knows," Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Minister for Foreign Affairs (Social-Democratic Party), had expressed his hatred for the reception of Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its incoherent foreign policy.
The reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellor caused great misunderstanding in the Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbruck (Social-Democratic Party), the Minister for Finance of Germany, but also, according to information sources in the magazine "Spiegel", concluded the so-called strategic dialogue of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the head of the Chinese government, asked Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize this receipt of Dalai Lama as a mistake.
affirming China's position, Wen Jiabao said that China would not accept that European politicians would receive the religious leader of Tibetans in their official position.
The actions and words of Dalai Lama have shown that it is attempting to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces.
Schaeuble warns that there will be disturbances such as those in France.
Battles with the police on the streets, shots, car fire: Wolfgang Schaeubble warned that there would be disturbances such as the case in France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to prevent social satisfaction in Germany from moving to the streets.
Barricated, the vandals shot with guns at the police: after serious disturbances caused by young people in France, the Federal Minister for Interior Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Part of the Democratic Union) fears similar trends in Germany.
"We have to be certain that the social problems of our country do not take the form of violence."
"That's what we have to take seriously," said the newspaper "Nue Presse," published in Hannover.
Not all young people develop in the constant change of social reality.
The Federal State, federal states and municipalities are already working together to address these problems, Schaeubble said.
This is not limited to the integration of immigrants.
"From the Summit of Integration to the Islamic Conference: all of this is already giving its first fruits."
It is still early to give the end of the alarm.
At the same time, Schaeuble indicated that German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as they do in France.
Young people have experienced serious street disturbances with the police in the north of Paris last night.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Tolouse.
Kenan Kolat, President of the Turkish Community in Germany, called for greater efforts by the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the disturbances in France, warns of an imitator effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the peer index among young people under 25 years of age is above average.
It must be taken care of that there are more vocational training positions.
Kolat emphasizes: "We have to give a perspective to young people."
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany, more than in France, there is "a great social control in families", greater than the French country.
In addition, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat thinks, "But in spite of everything, we have to be careful."
"It is necessary to give young people the opportunity to get a job or vocational training as soon as possible."
As long as the night in the Parisian suburbs, Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of police took part in the action, a helicopter flying through the territory.
The responsible authorities reported three arrests, as well as burned bases and cars.
Since the day before, a team of nearly 1,000 police officers is in charge of security.
After seeing a surprise, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister for Internal Affairs, announced that the police would take strict measures until necessary.
On Monday night, about 80 police officers were injured by disturbances in Villaers-le-Bel.
The disturbances continued the following night in Tolouse.
The disturbance began on Sunday by a traffic accident, where two young people died.
According to information provided by the tax office, the death of young people was not the responsibility of the police.
In the kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The very far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor shows that the coalition on content reached its last point and that there is no need to wait for anything more than it.
But in which country does the Cancillar really live?
After its desperate action, indifference and lack of content in the general debate of the Lower Chamber, it must be said that she does not live in the country that she should be governed by.
With regard to the challenge that had been made to him because he had repeatedly dedicated himself to actions in foreign policy, the Chancellor rejected him with a budgetary phrase.
He said that this would be a provincial way and thus showed that he did not want to understand what was in the interest of critics.
In the Lower Chamber, a very clear statement was made to all that the appeal was appropriate.
There was no need to feel a minimum interest, nor any kind of feeling about the country's problems.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself in this way: a very high policy that runs in foreign policy and remains there without achieving anything concrete.
One example: the prevention of climate change: most of the decisions taken in Heiligengamm were praised by themselves, but it does not say anything about how these goals should be achieved here on climate issues.
In general, this way of praising itself - two years ago the head of the Democratic Union Party has not been able to allow so much modesty.
So he's busy with expressions to get people to get a boost.
And thus damages your public image by pragmatic design with which it solves problems without going through the branches.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke, internal problems are seemingly insignificant.
The poverty of children and the concerns of workers with low wages?
The only thing that is dedicated is to talk about this subject using subordinated prayers.
It's amazing how many times it's wrong to talk about the supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to make a more or less good phrase.
It begins to wonder "as if it had been in an unknown territory", when it was more specific information.
The attack section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, were faced with a heated discussion of the presidential presidential candidates of YouTube and now only one candidate from the outside should be afraid.
The tensions between the candidates are already noted from a principle.
Mitt Romney complained to his opponent Rudy Giuliani that he had converted to New York in "a shelter for illegal immigrants".
This, for its part, answered with serious complaints: "I want to say that his own house was a "port" for the illegals." Giuliani answered the former governor of Massachusetts saying that he was the one who used illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates are victims of attacks: as the group of Republicans has no clear preference so far, the eight presidential pre-presidents take advantage of the debate in the CNN, especially in order to discredit their opponents.
The small 30-second video, surrounded by Internet users who were sent to Youtube, also doesn't have much content.
"With this sort of isolation we let Hitler get to power," was John McCain's reply to his opponent Ron Paul, the only meeting he insisted on immediately withdrawing Iraq's troops.
Romney also receives many criticisms by the veterans of the war in Vietnam, when it is refused to recognize how torture " Waterboarding ", a method of interrogation, by letting a person hide his death.
Public reactions in the St. Petersburg room in Florida show that while both the most important topics of the campaign are others, not only the war in Iraq or the debate on torture.
The public was always very proud when they praised conservative values and refused to raise taxes.
This can be seen better where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney explains, guilty and apologized to the people and the television audience for having been advocate of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, did not know what to say when asked what he thought of the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time, Musharraf ruled without uniforms.
One day after his resignation as chief of the army, the Pakistani President was sworn as president.
That was the end of the eight years of military government in Pakistan.
Thursday Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, took an oath for a second 5-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
Wednesday, he transferred his military commander's mandate to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially by the US.
Eight years after power was made with an incorrigible military attack, the former general ruled for the first time the state as a civilian chief.
With his resignation at the head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf met the main conditions of the opposition and the West.
The other requirement is the end of the state of exclusion, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayum, the state's general prosecutor, after the Musharraf vow, will soon cancel the state of the exception and will meet the second condition of the west.
Since the State of Exemption was declared in the Supreme Court there have been a number of private lawmakers from Musharraf. The Supreme Court rejected all resources prior to the newly challenged election of the Head of Government on 6 October.
In the meantime, five soldiers died and four others were wounded in an attack on a military train in the Watistan region of the North.
According to information from the military carrier, a bomb exploded in one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
Back the Founders of Krautrock.
The most famous German band in the 1970s continued its activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a restaurant, a copy of "Live 1974" was written in the best time of the band.
They were already very popular in foreign countries at that time.
The assistance of these three ladies to an official food caused the feeling.
Each of them has their cajita, their cables, and above all their buttons.
In the middle is set Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed with a white shirt.
On his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
On the right, looking at the audience, he is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years old, who is very busy with the control panel.
Everyone contributes with their sounds, including rhythms.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds turn into a piece of music.
This doesn't seem to bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock's fans was the fact that the Harmonia band would do music again.
What has to be raised here is the following: the exact questions have shown that the name of the band has taken place in the minds of the people, but it was not so special that after 32 years the public was so surprised.
But why can't the Germans also complain about their live legend of the 1970s?
Above all, because Krautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry granted the "Echo" music award to the members of the Can 2003 colony for their work of life, the amazing faces of German pop artists could be seen in the room.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf and Neu!, they all opened their mouth with surprise.
Later, Michael Rother spent time on the stage during the concerts of Red Hot Chili Peppers as if he had been an old friend (from the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the third only existed for two years and in those times it did not have a great effect on the public, however, it was subsequently obtained thanks to others.
A while ago Moebius and Rodelius had made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, who promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the Berlin Schabuehne zone.
Later, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf who was sponsored by a church.
For a while, Rother had a job at Kraftwerk and then he worked as a guitarist in the New band! He managed to improve the reputation of this German band that was too radical at those times.
In 1973, Rother continued his music at the Forst exile in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as refugees in the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain of his position.
That was rather a life of an artist full of surprises.
According to them, one day a band of Ottenstein's song association appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for the art.
There were also disadvantages in using the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Music von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn't just to get to know himself.
The "Live 1974" CD was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Some remember that almost 50 people participated in this recording.
Then Rother expressed his desire to promote harmony and do it once and for all.
For Rodelius and Moebius this requirement is against customs.
In 1975 the band announced its separation.
Rother finished his essay on esoteric themes and made sure that he existed with albums such as "Flammingen Herzen".
Cluster has lived for eight years, and since then he has been more successful than he has had Harmonia.
The direct recording of the album in Griessmer, that must be appreciated by Greenemeyer.
His music company Greenland was set up as the goal of developing this German own contribution to preserve it as the live music.
Like the work of Roedelius, also the band Neu! was again discovered.
The presentation of Harmonia as a band takes place at the World Cultural House in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures at the Wordtronics festival.
There's Julian Cope, the English, the old punk and the author of the "Krautrick Sampler" manual.
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
Thus, all the influence of Krautrock on the next pop music are present.
Harmony takes the position of a super-band, a place that was empty.
Brian Eno's phrase accompanied by special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, to which it belongs the future."
There are photos where Harmonia and producers appear in a castle.
The history of the development of the legend is shown in the projections of photos in white and black, where instruments are seen with cables.
There are three veterans in the bottom who started improvising again.
They do nothing but set the microphones to the organ and battery so that they can produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects devices they had built with their own hands.
Currently electronic music is just like I had to be.
Three people deep in the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Bárbara Morgenstern, in a musical environment, it shakes, and at a good time of emphasis sings "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock has always been a term of English origin.
But it was never about rock.
The origin of the gender was not sought in the blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or by stealing from the artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Who here shouts "e68!" is also right, but now Harmonia maintains peace.
The scenario reflects very well on what is already evident.
Where's the beginning and where's the music?
That can break one of the nerves or give you a quick moments of luck.
Richard Gere just needs more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are re-dedicated to the war in the Balkans.
But they didn't have much conviction.
Or the concepts are very fixed in actions and shoots or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, war criminals, still hiding in the Balkans mountain, but precisely there, in the inner darkness of the country during the war of Bosnia, the actor Richard Gere was discovered again.
Finally, we had lost sight of the most beautiful man in the 1980s, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant roles and little importance in films for women and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see perhaps the film "The Hunting Party- when a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why today the titles of the films have to be so long and fired?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the view: in the background, its role of reporting in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if the destination and the cinema industry had not been so merciful with him. He was a man whose best times of life had passed, as a monument of the ruin of his decade had so far preserved most of his charm.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is German production and will also be presented this week, are only a series of films that have not been successful about the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moerderischer Frieden" can be spoken in a few words: it is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serb from Kosovo's franchisors, one of whom acts very fast and that also leads to her to love her.
The meaning of the film is lost by actions and shootings, although we observe that Serbs are no longer presented as the only guilty.
The film is like the German series "Alarm for Cobra 11" without autopsy, but in a war situation.
The example of "The Hunting Party" can be investigated, because there was never really a good film on the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and another lead author (Richard Shepard in two positions), the story of U.S. reporters in the war who are going to detect a war criminal Serb called "serious", could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now".
Thus, stories are surprisingly similar: small teams go to the mountain twice to do something that the army can't do and every time a trip takes place.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when at the beginning they introduce us to Simon Hunt, to whom they don't just let you be a cynic with heart.
No, the guide also provides for a loving adventure with a Muslim Bosnian who will then be killed.
Then "The Hunting Party" is far away from the reality, especially when in the last five minutes the reporters with an impressive speed achieve what they could not achieve for five years the NATO, the CIA and all the world's head hunters, who were capturing the war criminal and leaving them to the Muslim Bosnians in a fair way.
It is so bad that they wish to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, a deep human.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadzić and Mladić are still free, and stresses that Americans and French are not really concerned about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so one comes to the head of a very famous poem from Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great horrors of his face, sharing his feelings with him, which is hard to be bad."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they prove that hard is good.
The problem is not only in the nature of war films in the Balkans.
A few years ago a newspaper published that all the films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are cheap.
It can also be added that there has never been a good movie about South Africa.
Almost always has a rule: when a star is set by a region of crisis or mine fields, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arguette, "On the other hand at all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Hungary Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Probably all these conflicts took place in a short space of time.
They've had to spend at least ten years until Hollywood stole a good movie about the holocaust with the film "The Schindler List".
Some films already need more time. Classics such as the war works in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" were not held in their time by unanimity as the master works.
Today we may know too much about global conflicts, and therefore in our time every murder (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that's because guided authors don't have the least repair (which is necessary for power) in telling good stories.
"Ser or not" or "The Great dictator" came to an end so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn't know that the Nazi regime was really bad.
Maybe you shouldn't be a good person to round a movie.
Maybe you should be like novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic view and far away from an artist.
When he was asked about the parallelisms between his new historic "Lemprière Dictionary" and the war in the Balkans, he replied, "It is only due to some things never change."
Large cities will always be in danger, men will always be brutally killed and in Yugoslavia the war will always reign.
Von Beust receives the negative criticism of the Olympics.
The mayor of Hamburg received many criticisms of politics and economy for not applying for the Summer Olympics.
Many want to continue to fight for competition in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that it must be realistic to appreciate the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, director General of Hamburg's Chamber of Commerce, expressed this decline as "not good for economic location".
In recent times no other project in the big city has promoted both motivation and the idea of the organization of the Olympic Games.
"Without this objective, political momentum could not be maintained, sport at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz asked the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "which refers to another time".
Wednesday, mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statement that the ambitions of Hamburg in the organisation of the Summer Olympics would not be carried out until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the request for Olympic Games, but decides on it by the German Federation of Olympic Sports", says von Beust at WELT Online.
He referred to the decision of the Sportbund, which was expected at the beginning of December, on Munich's request for the 2028 Olympic Games.
"This preference means for us that in this period of time, which we have so far thought to have until 2028, from a realistic point of view, we will have no opportunity."
Despite everything, this dream didn't end forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) laments von Beut's statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for Olympic Games.
"It's too soon to let go of the opportunity, if the plans are now broken," said Wednesday Günter Ploß, HSB's director.
A rejection of the application is contrary to the statement made by the head of the Senate that he made in a reception due to the general meeting of the German Public Federation for the Sports of Higher Schools (ddd).
There von Beust described Hamburg's application for Universitys 2015 not as "a replacement" of the Olympics in Hamburg.
Only last week, the Federation of Sport of the Higher Schools appointed Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The German Social-Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) rejected the Senate that it did not use such valuable time for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate delayed the development of the small village of Grasbrook, because it was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, members of the German Social-Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always required integrated planning from Olimpia for the small Grasbrook and then the use of built houses, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg's request for the 2012 Summer Olympics was very enthusiastic.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
They're not wooden boxes.
Whoever's related to the terms of Sweden and the box of wood, thinks in Ikea, but doesn't think in Andy Warhol.
Oh, yeah?
The wooden boxes currently produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on the Warhol's work list.
Most of the ninety-four Brillo-Box "type" of this list are false.
After a few months the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes of 1968 by Andy Warhol, the Modern Museum of Stockholm carried out internal investigations and reached disappointing conclusions: the six Brillo-Boxes, which the former director of the Museum Pontis Hultén gave to the Modern Museum, are false, and almost one hundred others of Stockholm's "type" are in circulation in the international art market, they also result.
Prehistoric history is too complicated with a confused relationship between the artistic productions and the pathogens.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted the wooden boxes of red, blue and white, with the same sample that had yellow powder cartons "Brillo".
According to Warhol, at the exhibition of his works in 1968 at the Modern Museum were hundreds of Brillo cajas of cardboard. These were not done by Warhol (because of expenses), but were brought directly from the "Brillo" card factory.
It was not about works of art, but about examples (which were only objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed in Sweden to produce a glass-cash of wood, but were not exposed at the Modern Museum.
Witnesses of those times now mention that almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of the art and the substation as the originals of the "Brillo-Boxes" of the "Stocolmo" type authorized by Andy Warhol.
Some of them were purchased in excess of $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the museum Pontis Hultén made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost a hundred wooden boxes that Warhol left.
But in fact, 105 boxes were produced in the same year in 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had been dead for 3 years.
Lars Byström, chief of the conservatives of the Modern Museum, invested six Brillo-Boxes property of the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. They first printed and measured their cuts and then painted them in the oil with the pen.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies shows that painting was applied with a wheel without printing the printed plates directly. Moreover, it is not about painting the oil, but about acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorised by the artist and must be removed from the official list of Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol," says Lars Nittve, director of the Modern Museum Museum and adds that if the "Andy Warhol Art" Authentication Commission in New York will not reach any conclusion, the Modern Museum will classify these six boxes as copies/exposure objects".
Already in July The Commission for Authentication formally announced that it accepts these "serious accusations" in the case of apple powder boxes.
But since then everything has remained absolutely silent.
Rebellious soldiers race in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers had arrived at a hotel in Manila and had demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Citizen Antonio Trillanes, who complains to the president, corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that he could not answer for shedding blood.
The government's loyal soldiers had seized the hotel using lacrimogen gas.
Almost two hundred soldiers had been trapped in the building for hours.
Nearly half of them, including Trillanes, had the Jewish trial for attempting a state strike in 2003 that ended with a failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, so that he could immediately deposit himself with about 30 sympathetic people.
Apparently, the military police who had to monitor him had passed through their ranks and followed their command.
They entered the hotel "Penísula" and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood around the Nobel Hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Bureau.
Norberto Gonzales, National Security Council, condemned the conduct of soldiers.
"People are hot," Trillanes said.
"We call people to pass through our ranks."
General Danilo Lim, who had previously led the elite team Scout Reangers, said that within a short time the other military troops wanted to follow the lead.
The big government critics called on Thursday to a great protest against the president.
For months his government has been receiving complaints of corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a place that attracted all attention to the team that was attempting against Arroyo.
The erection failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempts of coup attacks against the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet will be the largest shareholder of Versatel.
The United Internet provided more than 20 per cent of the shares of the Versatel telecommunications company.
Wednesday the company reported that the average price for an action was 14,46 euros.
It has only 20.05 percent of the social capital.
There were many speculations about the company's absorption.
There are also options to increase the financial share in Versatel.
United Internet reported that this step would accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market (digital subscription line).
Wednesdays had already made assumptions about entry into business, after which the Bank of Brendenberg increased its participation in the Duessseldorf network operator by 5 per cent to 15.1 per cent.
In the financial market, this means that the financial institution maintains the securities of participation for a third party.
United Internet already participated with almost 10 percent of the Drillish telecommunications company on the previous day.
Drillisch in the capital expansion measure placed 17.4 million new shares with a value of EUR 106.4 million.
United Internet has purchased 5.15 million shares for EUR 31.4 million.
In addition, companies started negotiations on trade cooperation in DSL products.
"We will continue our collaboration," explained the United Internet portal.
The two companies founded a company together with MSP, to acquire the Freenet competitor.
The United Internet Thursday reported that at the beginning, the two companies wanted to be happy with the participation of 10 percent in Freenet and did not exercise their right, i.e. they did 18.49 percent in Freenet.
This meant that both companies maintained all the options, especially participation in Freenet anonymous society.
The United Internet and Freenet negotiations on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
So far the United Internet and Drillish holding had directly 6.01 percent of Freenet's participation.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch would reach the other four percent.
The right to buy 18,49 per cent of Vatas investment company was already agreed in August.
