The social map of the Ivanov area is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Changes include the maintenance of public passenger transport benefits.
Since 24 September, there has been a change in the organization of the welfare of citizens using the social map of the inhabitants of the Ivano region.
As reported by the Press Service of the Russian Government on the Ivano Region, the changes include the maintenance of public passenger transport benefits and the introduction of a social card payment scheme in accordance with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 of the National Payment System.
The social map of the inhabitants of the Ivanov area is thus recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions for its application are changed.
Yes, the completion limit is now set, not on travel as before, but on the amount of money, with winter and summer periods, not more than 400 rubles in summer, not more than 800 rubles in the current month.
Now social card holders will have to monitor the number of remaining travel and the rest of the money.
The value of the profitable travel for citizens shall be 1/2 of the rate applicable to the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of travel is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The social card supplement chart remains early, from 24 previous months to 23 current months.
There will be a number of benefits for the new course of social card travel.
Yes, there is an opportunity to take a detailed account of the cost of money on a social card with accuracy to the head.
In addition, there is an opportunity for the return of estimated but unexploded funds.
We also add that the inter-account scheme with carriers is transparent, as half the cost of travel is paid by citizens, and the same amount is paid back to the carrier.
No commission will be taken when the cash card is submitted.
In turn, Vasili Silkin, Deputy Director of the Department of Road Economy and Transport of the Ivanov Region, reported that in 2014 more than 33 million social-card trips were carried out in the region, and nearly 25 million trips were made in 2015.
More than 470 million rubles are provided in the regional budget for the benefit of citizens using the social map.
As of 1 September, over 312 million rubles were recovered for these purposes.
At the time of the call, 911 teachers were admitted to killing a friend
During a call in 911 loud, almost without a gun, the teacher of the Shawn Lamb told the police that he had shot his friend and that the staff who would come to his house needed him.
Lamb stressed that there is a pessic at home who lives, but probably is upset, and said that the contact of missing family members can be found on her phone.
Inside the house, the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a note that was carefully written by the hands on the white letter of the book: "I'm sorry, I wish I'd just come back, I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," says the representative of the bodies signed by Lambo.
Nothing indicated that Lamb, who conducted two online courses at the University of Delta in Cleveland, Mississippi, had been able to visit 300 miles in a university campus, where the police consider it to be the police, shot all the respected teacher of the story of Ethan Schmidt at his office.
The chief of police at the University of Delta Linne Baford reported that the university staff had learned of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported Lamb made that real call in 911 shortly thereafter.
At the end of the day, the victim was found to be more than one: Lamb ended with him as the police surrounded him.
The next day after the shooting at the school, the students and teachers were forced to stand outside the doors, the authorities were still trying to put a picture of the motive that led to Lamba.
Information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as by students and staff who knew it, helped create a portrait of a talented but perhaps a concerned teacher.
The students told me they were waiting for his job with patience.
The police in Gota, where Prentiss was killed, reported that he was not charged with violence or criminal cases.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in his written book, in which he expressed appreciation for the “precious people” with whom he moved into his teaching life.
They both taught the schools of social sciences and history, which included 17 teachers, and many students attended lessons from one another.
At the same time, there were some assumptions about the issue.
A student who had a good reputation for Lambe, Brandon Bevers, reported that he was also said to be upset and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that at the end of the course 2014-15, Lamb told him how he struggled with stress.
Earlier, Lamb had asked the University of Delta to give him a leave of illness, saying he had some health problems.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in university rules of employment meant that the level of a doctor who was so busy with Lamb would not guarantee him automatic recognition of his teacher's position.
The president of the University of William Laforz reported that he did not know anything about the conflict between Lambo and Schmidt, but "of course, Mr. Lamba had something in mind."
These are issues that Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
The police attacked after Lamba, after he fled from the camp, when he was sent back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot 38 caliber gun at the back of the house, one mile south of his parents' home in Greenville, Mississippi, reported to the corner of Washington Metel Johnson.
His car with the engine was still on the way.
It was not long before Lamb came to this house, although Johnson said she thought he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in those countries.
Lamb began to work at a university, with 3,500 students in the city with a population of about 12,000 in 2009, teaching geography and pedagogical.
He received a degree of pedagogical science in the same year.
A former friend of Lamba described him as a wise, charismatic, and happy man.
Carl Houston told me she was 15, and Lambu was 20 when they met with common friends.
She and her friend had studied in senior classes, and he was a younger boy who had been trying to learn to play guitar for a few years.
In those years he was successful in women.
All the girls were hiding when he was a couple," says Houston, now 40 who lives in Jackson, in the province of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss at the moment of the events, we can see they've been meeting for a while.
During the call at 911, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there is no record of their marriage registration.
There was a song by the name of Latting, who lived with them in Gota in a kirip house, the back of which is on the channel.
According to the police, the dog is all right.
Former husband Prentiss, Sean O'Stin, reported that they were divorced 15 years ago but remained friends, and that they have a daughter who is now 19 years old.
"She's quite excited," O'Stin said about the daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he didn't meet Lambo, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blue.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both spoke at one summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at concerts.
O'Stin told me his daughter was writing music and poetry.
Prentiss was a nurse and worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, Barmen and the Cooperative Co-ordinator of entertainment programs at The Julep Room in Gothé, said that he had seen Lamba and Prentiss on the evening of 5 September when Lamb finished playing guitar and losing armament for a number of visitors.
No suspects were observed.
"It's just a happy couple," he said.
We enjoyed each other and looked for each other.
I mean, they were both very strict.
Schmidt, the deceased teacher, was a high-ranking seminar and specialized in the history of indigenous Americans and colonial America, told Don Ann Mitchell, an English teacher in the same school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the University of Kansas, Emporia, and was the president of the student brotherhood and of the student self-government.
About 900 people, including university teachers, staff, students and members of the community, attended the Memorial celebration of the candles on Tuesday evening at the University of Delta, Cleveland.
The wife of Schmidt Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Employment is resumed in the middle.
"We're trying to get our students back," said Laforz.
The crisis is over.
Today's welcome.
Amy and Rohelio Solis are reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report helped prepare the authors of the Associated Press Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with a police statement that Lamba had arrived in service 911 after the murder of Schmidt, and that, although Lamb had spoken about Prentiss as his wife when he called in 911, information about their marital status was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer staff at the holiday season
Toys R Us reports that there will not be as many staff members as in the past year, with toys and goods for children, to ensure that staff and temporary staff are allowed to work more hours.
The company reports that it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and offices throughout the country, less than 45,000 who were hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company reported that it would start consultations with the complainants this month and would increase the number of staff from October to December.
Although the season of purchase is still close to a few months before the holidays, companies are ready to hire temporary staff to have enough state in stores and to sell, download and supply goods.
Michael J. Fox is looking at "study" with Princess Diana.
The film's "Back in the Future" Prime Minister was a grand event for Michael J. Fox.
It was still remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the cinema and waited for the arrival of the royal family, I noticed that a place with me was free, and here I was taken by the princess Diana - a few with me," he said in a trailer to the shortly going out on the screen of a documentary film "Back in time".
The film begins, and here I come to the point that I literally stand at the edge of my hands and in a fake dress from seeing Princess Welsh.
"Back in time" - a documentary film on "Back in the Future" - includes interviews with Fox, Lee Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert earthquake and executive director Steven Spiilberg.
The film president "Back to the Future" was 30 years ago.
"For me," says Spielberg, "it's definitely the biggest movie of travel ever taken."
"Back in time" will be available on VOD, DVD and some cinematographs in October.
UN chapter states that the military solution does not exist in Syria
In response to Russia ' s military support, the Secretary-General, Mr. Ghi Mun, stated that for almost five years the conflict “does not exist”, and the increase in arms would only increase violence and suffering for millions of people.
The Head of the United Nations called upon all participants, including the United Nations Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Mr. Gi Mun said at the press conference in the middle that he was planning a meeting with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the five permanent members of the Council -- the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France at the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the differences in the Council, as well as among the Syrian and local authorities, “have created an unsolved situation”.
Mr. Gi Mun urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they had demonstrated in resolving the issue of the Iran nuclear programme and in considering the Syrian crisis.
8 survey results showing that Donald Tramp is not missing
Some have tried to bring him a lawyer’s license.
Others got away from him. I realized it was a joke.
And some ask for scandals.
However, as some Republicans strive to overcome the high position of Donald Trampa as a result of the investigations, they failed (peace).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys have demonstrated the advantage of Donald Trampa in two figures, and some have begun to ask thoroughly what it means for the maggot of immutableness in the view of the chances of obtaining nomination.
Of course, it's just the beginning of a chosen cycle.
None of this means that the tramp has the chance to nominate the Republican Party.
The experts point out that, at the time, Rika Perry had introduced its dominant popularity in 2011 to Germany, not one of which had failed to defeat one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in general elections.
But external groups, such as the “Political Committee” of Jaba Bush, and the Economic Conservative Group of the “Strengthening Club” recognize the unsatisfying force of the trampa and begin to deliver their dollars to cover it.
Here are a number of surveys that speak of what can be seen as immutable -- not just an interim phase:
The retinas of the sympathies for Trapa were 180 degrees.
Immediately before Donald Tramp announced his application in mid-June, a study at the University of Monmouth showed that only two of the 10 Republicans had a positive attitude to this phenomenon in the area of inevitability.
By mid-July, that was 40 per cent.
It was 52 per cent early in August.
Six of the 10 Republicans are now in favour of Donald Trampu.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all of these indicators are above the initial stages.
The Quinnipac survey in Iowa last week found that 60 per cent of the Republicans there were positive in terms of the Trip.
Two thirds of the votes in favour of the GOP would set up the trampo as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey conducted last week, 67 per cent of Republicans said that they had either been “sustained” or “satisfaction” if they had become a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "stabilized" if he'd become a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as the tramp (43 per cent say they would deal with "average" against 40 per cent of those who say the same about the tramp).
The next one at the east level?
Marco Rubio, with only 21 per cent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republicans say they will be "not satisfied" or "destructed", if they like the Jab Bush school as a candidate.
The majority of Republicans do not consider the Trompa temperature to be a problem.
While the trampa is widely critical of its strength and frustration, 52 per cent of voters across the country believe that there is an appropriate temperature to be president, as shown by the ABC News/Washington post held on Monday.
The same figure is the first in a closed congregation in the state of Iowa, where 52 per cent of the Republicans think it is the same person who may be the main commander, according to Quinnipic last week.
However, 44 per cent believe that he is not the person who can be effective at the post and nearly six of the 10 independent voters say that his temperature is not suitable for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
The electors-republicists are accustomed to this idea.
When they hope for their shorts, electors think that Trump is a monster.
On the question of who was the most likely winner in the GOP appointment, 4 out of 10 said that the tramp was favorite, according to the CNN/ORC survey last week.
That's not what it was when four of the 10 were put on Jeff Bush at the end of July.
Full payment: GOP voters had not previously had the right magic crystal.
At the same time, during the previous cycle, four of the 10 Republicans elected Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 per cent supported the possible candidate Mitt Romani.
However, this shows that many GOP voters consider the Trampa campaign to be credible.
Even if the Republicans were to settle around the second candidate, the tramp would remain in front of all the others.
Some indications indicate that such a disband is almost always on the advantage of the trampa, and that not supporting the trampa is equally distributed among the more than ten other candidates.
But a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth in early September shows that in a hypothetical confrontation between the tramp and the majority of other candidates, the tramp is almost always supported by the majority.
He controls Carly Fiorino at 13 points, Marco Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jéba Bush at 19 points and, finally, Randa Paula, John Kesic and Chris Christi at 33 points.
He's got nothing to do with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to deal with?
Ben Carson detained a businessman at all 19 points in the hypothetical exorcism of "one by one".
More than half of Donald Trampa's supporters say they've been thinking.
The new CBS/NYT survey, held on Tuesday, shows that only half of the voters who support the tramp say they are confident in their votes.
Obviously, many can happen and change the situation, and no one can actually say that he never thinks.
46 per cent said they left the door open for other candidates.
However, the most intense competition in the trampa right now is with my colleague, neurosurgery Ben Carson, but the voters who say they've thought they'd rather choose the trampa.
Six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with the Immigration Treaty.
Since Donald Tramp two months ago called immigrants from Mexico "enforcers" in his speech opening the campaign, the subject of immigration became the most relevant in the 2016 talks.
Some are concerned that the Trompa era will open up the key voters of Latin American origin from the Republican party and mix the rebrending.
However, according to the ABC/Post survey held on Monday, six of the 10 Republicans said that they agreed with the Treaty on Immigration.
Thus, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position until immigration draws general attention.
Disillusionment by the Government takes on new traffic.
Donald Tramp and Ben Carson are now considering support for about half of the electoral voters, mainly because of their author status.
Six of the 10 Republicans in the new ABC/Post survey on Monday declare that they want a political author rather than a person with experience in government work.
And they're also bound to Washington.
The question of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa, two weeks ago, shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed by the activities of the Republicans in the Congress, with 54 per cent being “unsatisfied” and 21 per cent being “unsatisfied”.
The Government will decide on the index of pensions in October.
Deputy Prime Minister RF Olga Goldec said that the Government is now looking for options for the implementation of the law on the indexation of pensions in 2016 at the real level of inflation, the GDR is sending.
She noted that the decision should be made by 8 October, at the time of the draft budget for the next year in the Government.
In addition, the cabinet discussed the option of extending the decision to freeze the pension of Russians.
The hungry person noted that the amount of pension savings amounted to 350 billion rubles.
This is about the total amount of pension index for the following year.
According to the vice-president, there is no final decision on who should pay contributions for unemployed citizens.
A thief believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong to the socially vulnerable categories of citizens, it is not fair to pay for him.
The former media reported that there were two options for budget balance in the cabinet.
Why are the ages often painted and adorned?
The doctor-of-almologist Tatyan Levashova answers:
Our century is a wide range of eyeglasses that protect them from the many small particles on which they sit.
Having forgotten the regular cleaning of the century, we often contribute to the development of bleafart.
Simple exit:
Do not shake your eyes with your hands, wear a special light lamp for a century;
Not once or twice a day clean up the end of the century from those stored in it for the day of the valuables.
Cleaning procedures must also be complemented by hot compresses with openings (salpheaic, rosary), passing through the thick secret of the railways, and then the mass of the centuries that should be carried out by round movements of thumbs;
You can't use a magic mask, you can't use the drinking equipment.
They dry and dry up the skin and contribute to a more narrowing of the secret of the railways.
Psychiatric claims that Korean nuclear weapons have created an atom bomb.
The North Korean authorities reported that the main nuclear reactor in the country was a nuclear complex in Yoongbwe, working "in full power".
The report was posted on the website of the country's Central Telegraph Agency.
It is noted that the CDR is ready at any time to respond to “aggression and nuclear threat” and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons “both in quantity and quality”.
The last nuclear test was carried out by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
The reactor ' s full recovery plans have not been reported since.
Psychiatric claims he's been able to create an atom bomb.
Also, the CDR has repeatedly tested the radius of medium and small distances, says polt.ru.
Girinowski needed to remove the mention of the brothers from the Russian Federation.
The LDR leader Vladimir Girinowski believes that the national level should be removed from the list of brothers' union.
He said this at the meeting of the Lord, reporting on the Russian News Service.
Who are these people now?
Fascists and murderers!
"It's the longest game in the world, the longest in the world, not even sportsmen," said Girinowski.
The delegation considers it necessary to delete all the quadrilaterals containing the line:
In 2014, Girinowski stated that the current gym should be referred to "God, the King of Food", and the Russian tricolor replaces the imperial flag, writes polt.ru.
Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Basar Assad urged all forces to join in combating terrorism.
Assassin is confident that if Europe is to deal with the refugee problem, they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The issue is not whether Europe accepts or does not accept refugees, but whether it is necessary to address the root causes of this problem.
If Europeans are concerned about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
That is our view on the issue.
"That's the question of refugees," he said in the RT interview.
We must continue the dialogue in the name of consensus.
However, if we want real success, they can't be done until people die until blood transfusions continue and people don't feel completely safe.
"So we can reach consensus, but we can't achieve anything until we win terrorism in Syria," Assad stressed.
Remember, about 500 thousand migrants, including from Syria, have arrived in the countries of the European Union this year.
The European Commission stated that the current migration crisis in the world was the largest since World War II.
It is not excluded that there may be thousands of combatants from the Islamic State extremist group coming to Europe.
The members of the terrorist organization banned in Russia may use the situation to create their networks in the EU for terrorist activities.
The inhabitants of the German city set up a holiday for refugees.
In recent months Germany has become a leader of the reception of refugees, although it has recently sought border control to prevent their floods.
According to the authorities, some 800 thousand migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts call it a significant number.
Since September more than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country.
Correspondence Bi-bi-si Jenny Hill is located in Darmstadt, a city where migrants are highly hosted.
Jeremy Corbin debates in the Prime Minister ' s session
After the elections, Mr. Corbin's debate at the Prime Minister's session was expected with great impatience.
The new leader of the Liberian Party, Jeremy Corbin, will soon take the lead in the Prime Minister's session, first with the strength of David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin spoke with the first of the six outstanding questions on the second half of the day; he said that the press and members of Parliament would be closely monitored by the Leiborist Party.
He called for “lower theatre and more facts” on a weekly demonstration.
He also stated that some meetings could be missed by leaving their colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary trial of Mr. Corbin as head; it will be held after the appointment of the tennis court and his words at the annual Tread Union Congress on Tuesday.
At that time, the decision of the leader of the Liberians to stand silent during the national service year of Tuesday, while the 75-year-old Brittany Beatva was critical of a number of conservative members of Parliament and was the subject of several excellent articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbin ' s decision not to play a public game drew attention
The Press Secretary, Mr. Corbin, said that he was "stabilized in the mail" and recognized the "Heroism of the Royal VVS in Battle for Britain".
However, Mr. Corbin Owen Smith, a member of the tennis club, reported to BBC 2 that he would advise the leader of the Liberians to follow the national “independence” from his conviction that the monarchy had to be abolished.
Almost ten tennis ministers refused to play on Mr. Corbin's team, resulting in differences in economic, defence and international policy, while at least one sixth of Parliamentary party members supported him as a leader.
Political correspondent BBC Robin Brant says that political differences also "copy" in the lobbying party after Mr. Corbin was appointed as a European Union post and limited payment by the Government.
Mr. Corbin said at the Tred-Union Conference that the Leiborist Party had made amendments aimed at eliminating the very idea of restrictions in general.
Several hours later, Mr. Smith, the Minister of Labour and Pensions, said that there was “full clarity” in the party because it was opposed only to government plans to reduce the ceiling from 26,000 to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth lead of the Liberians, with whom David Cameron will meet in the "curricular cave" for the last ten years since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the Liberians, who promised another policy approach, stated that he had “taken collective resources” to get Mr. Cameron ' s ideas and received more than 30,000 proposals.
A member of Parliament from the district of Yellowton North said that the issues raised by the Prime Minister were of a different nature, and that he would also refrain from responding and sharing in the quantity rather than focusing on serious issues, such as poverty, inequality and the problems faced by youth.
Mr. Corbin said that Angela Iggle, Minister of Economics of the Ten Commandments, would place him on the question of Prime Minister when he was absent, for example when Mr. Cameron was outside the border.
He also drew the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor whenever possible, saying that he had called on the speaker of the House of Commons of John Berk to discuss the matter.
As a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron stated that he wanted to leave the political style of the peace-keeping, often associated with the Prime Minister's procedure, but admitted a few years later that he had failed.
Since the first transition in 1990, the question of the Prime Minister has become a key indicator of leadership, their ability to manage the House of the Community and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although criticism has claimed that this has turned into a caricature and requires massive reforms.
"Shutdown in Yoburg" Young People Who Learn From the Photography
Johannesburg Business Centre is a complex place for homeless people.
However, one group of former non-advisors found a way to develop a remixture and to work on life.
"I was taken out of Yoburg" is a non-profit study that teaches homeless young people to take photos of neighborhoods and work on it.
BBC News met with one of the first sponsors of the project.

Sterling's Pound is growing as it grows in Britain
The interest on growth in the UK grew, while the FTSE 100 index was raised on the proposal to buy SABMiller.
Since June, the number of bonuses in Britain has increased by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The rate of growth has been the highest since 2009 and has been met as a transfer to an earlier period of forecasting for possible increase in cotton.
The pound of sterlings grew by more than 1 per cent for the dollar and amounted to $1,555 and 0.84 per cent for the euro, amounting to €1,3730.
FTSE 100 increases to 6229.21 per cent.
In general, SABMiller shares were allocated, which increased by 20 per cent, thanks to the offer of purchase from the AB InBev competitor.
The transaction would unite the world's two largest beer companies, gathering brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares grew by 0.9% on the basis of encouraging news from the competitive group of producers of the Richemont luxury class.
The latest sales data on Richemont took over all expectations and showed that sales in China - on the key market for Burberry - began to grow again.
The Glencore shares grew by 5 per cent after the top-ranking giant claimed that it had received $2.5 billion by placing the shares, which had been made under the debt reduction strategy.
Mondi's library and packaging group shares were indexed by 4.3 per cent after Goldman Sachs reduced the group's rating to “sale”.
JD Sports has grown after a company reporting an 83 per cent increase in the amount of $46.6 million for the year.
Chief JD Sports says higher wages can slow down expansion.
Executive Director JD Sports Peter Kaugill says that increasing minimum wages for British workers means “more purchasing capacity in potential consumers’ karma”.
However, it is unlikely that such purchasing capacity would exceed the cost of labour, he says.
The cost could have an impact on the JD Sports enlargement plan, adding that it could mean a reduction in the number of additional holidays.
Metcash launchs a low-pressure campaign against Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the pressure of Aldi in South Australia and Western Australia.
The usual food supplier for the initiative launched the IGA market share protection campaign in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of the future impact of Aldi $700 million.
While Aldi is preparing to open two optimum warehouses and the first 120 stores in South and Western Australia at the beginning of the following year, the Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and advance the IGA brand through marketing in leading media and social networks and in the Adelade Show type activities.
The campaign is attended by IGA dealers and suppliers, such as Simmo's seafarer from Dansboro, who offers discounts in IGA stores, and the owners of stores selling tickets to the football league South Australia.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its strategy of protection on 29 September, when this optimum supplier of food, spirit drinks and agricultural products will hold its annual day of investor strategy.
There is little money left because in South Australia and Western Australia, IGA stores account for nearly 30 per cent of all Metcash stores and show a higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South and West Australia are known as conventional routes, so the market here is more favourable for IGA athletes than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in the USA and 24 per cent in WA compared to about 14 per cent in the eastern states.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi will take up 5 per cent of the food market in these two states for 12 months after the opening of its first stores, taking the success of all the players present, but mainly of the independent players.
In a report published this week, Morgan Stanley, analyst Tom Kirat, believes that IGA can lose $360 million a year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, with sales of $500 million and 600 million in these markets, respectively.
The loss of profits and sales of food at the high level of the permanent cost of Metcash may be approximately 13 million dollars to the payment of interest and taxes, he said.
At the same time, Metcash lost market share in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and this was when a recent study by Morgan Survey revealed that IGA had the most loyal buyers.
Morgan Stanley believes that the sales of Metcash food will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent in 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglas, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, noted that Metcash could " disappear for decades.
The Metcash company refused to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas ' s comments.
However, it is assumed that a member of the Board of Directors of Metcash was in contact with Mr. Douglas last week.
The share of IGA on the market decreased from 18 to 14 per cent in 2010 and the income of Metcash from the food business, which the company placed on about 1200 IGA producers, fell to 43 per cent compared with 2012 due to the operating delivery and pressure on sales and profitability indicators.
However, the company is not expected to spend more than $150 million annually on the basis of the price comparison of the different prices in the Coles and Woolworths thousands of positions per week and to assist IGA producers in refurbishing their trading venues, as well as offering a rapidly expanding association of fresh products and a wider range of food products.
Director-General Metcash Ien Morris said that the price comparison and refurbishment of trading venues would take place, and he hoped that the company would receive an increase in net income in 2017, first in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakisa supports President Tennis Australia Steve Hilli
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves the beginnings, not the criticisms of his conduct.
Tanasi Kokkinakis has recently suffered in a scandal around his second Nik Kyrios and deserves more than criticism, as President Tennis Australia Steve Hill said.
Cockinakis, a young man in a talented duet and often called "Special Ks", was at the center of attention because of the late overcrowding of Cyrus with Stone Wavrink on the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly thereafter, during a fire-qualification match in Cincinnati, the judge had to separate Cockinakis and his opponent, Rayan Harrison, and Harrison had said, "The van had to be put on Kirios' boots, and I had to put on that boy's boots."
C As soon as Cockinakis was last seen with a smashing rocket after the judge had rescued Rishar Gaske from possible attacks on US Open, Hilli was reportedly protecting Cockinakis.
Youth is currently in Glasgow, meeting Sam Grotto on the right to be the second after Bernard Tommy in the semi-final Cuba Davis v. Britain.
"I've been through a lot of things, that's what Tanasi was involved in the conflict," said Hilli.
He really broke the rocket when he got his foot on US Open, but he wasn't the first game that broke the rocket when hopes broke, and I know Tanasi's good enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he has been very well in enough provocation situations in the United States, with Harrison and so on, and I'm sure he deserves confidence.
It's surrounded by a great team, a beautiful family, and I just think it's a little unfair.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he's working very hard, he's a great team, he's never had any problems with other games, he's respected outside the court, he's trained very intensively, he's a highly targeted and developed young man, and I think he should be valued.
Hilli also supported the decision to forgive Cyrus for the important game that began on Friday, believing that “a mutual agreement” was the right outcome for everyone, but considering that a young man from Canberra would return to the team as a long-term player.
"First of all, we want the team to focus its full attention on the mother rather than on the conflicts around [Cyrus]," Hilil said.
And I think that Nick has taken the power very fast that people prove the type of Feder and Marrey, he's growing up in public eyes, he's making a number of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to help him realize the consequences of his actions, and I think he needs to be taken out of focus for a while so that he can think about them, and that's best for the team and best for him.
The Migration Crisis in Europe: Hungary announces an emergency, closes the border, keeps the migrants
On Tuesday, Hungary closed the border with Serbia on the southern border and detained those who were trying to enter the country illegally to stop the flow of migrants.
There were hundreds of migrants at the border crossing the border, and the Serbian authorities reacted badly.
He stopped at an uncertain time on the road between the checkpoints of the two countries, the people who fled from armed violence in their families broke down the courts and found themselves on the ground.
However, frustration grew.
When they were surrounded by a police helicopter, the migrants shouted, "Open the border!" and cried out to the Hungarian police for a special appointment.
Some protestors rejected food and water.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Serbia declared the "unacceptable" expulsion of migrants from Hungary when they were increasingly from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution to the problem rather than the harm it causes.
We need to negotiate with Brussels and other countries on the next day," Ivica Dachic said in Prague.
The elections at the Hungarian-Serbian border began the following day after a block from 28 countries were unable to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to hold a common responsibility for 40,000 asylum seekers in completed Italy and Greece and expressed the hope that a future agreement would be reached (in the next month or by the end of the year) whereby the Member States of the European Union would adopt another 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
Germany's Chancellor Angel Merkel and Austria had to collect on Tuesday the European Union's extraordinary summit to discuss the immigration crisis covering the continent.
Hungary, however, does not hope for rapid action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency situation announced on Tuesday in the two southern regions gave the authorities more authority to act on the crisis, which enabled them to block the roads and speed up the cases of asylum delivery.
At that time, the Foreign Minister of Hungary, Peter Ciarto, said that his country was also planning to bring a wave-drop-out in Romania to cover the flow of migrants across the country, now that it ended the Serbian border.
Correspondent CBS News Charlie Dagata reported that even prisoners had been subjected to urgent work to end the ban on collusion between Hungary and Serbia.
In the last few months, Hungary has become the main “twisted place” and point of crossing the Euro-Mediterranean border for immigrants, many of which are refugees - victims of war in Syria and the countries of the Middle East.
Nevertheless, the Prime Minister of the country, Victor Orban, insists that most arrivals in the country are economic migrants seeking a better life, not refugees, who are victims of war acts that have the right to protection, and that view is very much different from the opinions of other EU countries, namely Germany.
The new laws entered into force in Hungary in full night are now considered to be a violation of or damage to a 4-metre (13-foot) ban on footing built by the Government along the southern border with Serbia and include longer periods of imprisonment for persons accused of trafficking.
“Because of the situation resulting from mass migration, the Hungarian Government announces an emergency situation”, said the representative of the Government of Zoltan Kovač in the southern city of Seged.
We make it clear that illegal cross-border crossing is a crime.
Parliament is still required to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected for the next week, but the Associated Press reporters who are at the border have been monitoring the presence of armed soldiers in front of the teeth of vehicles and dogs.
Dr. Bakondi, National Security Council, reported that 45 persons who tried to cross the border had been arrested by the competent authorities and 15 others within the country.
They crossed the border, broke the court, were now under police custody and accused of administrative violations under new laws.
The authorities are quick to rehabilitate the assembly.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven crossings on the border with Serbia on Tuesday morning to block one of the crossings of a railway train surrounded by a rolling train.
The riots broke through the border of the city of Ríoske, Hungary, just as the Hungarians set up an office space for people to pass through the metal containers, and the mobs forced one another to break in.
There were about 20 people in the area, and thousands of people were injured.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway from Serbia to Hungary and announced that food and water would be denied until they were left in Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders was reduced twice in the national survey
Former secretary, Hillary Clinton, continues to hold a double advantage in the country-wide nomination of democratics, but Senator Bernie Sanders has reached it.
Clinton is now supported by 47 per cent of primary democratic voters (up to 58 per cent) and Sanders is the second with 27 per cent (up to 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Bayden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to participate in the presidential run, receives 15 per cent of the support of the first democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the initial elections, most democratic voters said that they were too early to say that they had identified with the candidate they would support.
Clinton's parties are more confident in their election than they would like to support other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey last month, Clinton has lost some support from certain demographic groups, and Sanders has received some bonus.
Clinton maintains a great advantage between women and the dead, but this advantage has been reduced.
She's a lot of support between men, and Sanders is leaving her at least 5 points.
The preference given by Clinton to democratic electors up to 50 years has disappeared, and they and Sanders are now at the same time.
However, Clinton still has a great advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton condemned Sanders as a double-number of liberals, but Sanders is now privileged to 5 points in this group.
Nearly half of the primary democratic voters throughout the country say that they would have supported Clinton with enthusiasm if she had become a candidate for this party.
Fourthly, she would be supported with some reservations, and 15 per cent more would be supported only because she was a candidate.
Six per cent would not support it.
It may be surprising that the current partners of Clinton are more enthusiastic about her account.
Among those who do not currently support Clinton's views, only about a quarter of enthusiasm would support her.
While 48 per cent of primary democratic voters say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm, a smaller number of Republican voters speak the same way about their leader, Donald Trampe (35 per cent).
When Clinton's parties are asked the open question why they want to see her candidate, the most popular response - that she has the experience (16 per cent), then that she is now the president's time (13 per cent) and that she is the best candidate at this post (10 per cent).
Clinton's partners also talk about its association with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
It is also called according to the issues and opportunities for elections.
Since the Vice-President is thinking of potential participation in the elections, 57 per cent of the former Democrats would like him to join the race, although the third believes he should not.
When asked who they would like to see in the second place among the candidates from the party, the first democratic voters in most cases call Byden.
More than half of Clinton's clients say they would choose Byden second, that's more than Sanders.
If Byden decides not to present his candidate from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders would be increased from 20 points with Byden among the runners to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five per cent of Democrats see a candidate in Clinton with the best chance of winning a general election, but this figure has decreased by 78 per cent in the past month.
Byeden showed that there was a great drop in second place, but the percentage of those who considered him the most likely candidate has increased.
Nevertheless, in response to the question that most importantly in the candidate, voters choose options other than opportunities to be elected.
Similarly in the past month, none of the candidates for democratics or potential candidates were unacceptable to these original voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have shown good results in some key characteristics among primary voters from their party.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders, and Byden to be honest and trustworthy with good leadership.
One of the three leads in honesty, while the strong side of Clinton in its leadership qualities.
Thirty per cent of primary democratic voters do not consider Clinton to be honest and trustworthy, twice as much as those who speak the same way about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent do not have a certain opinion on this account.
First Democrats are also generally considered to be similar ideological views of Clinton, Sanders and Byden.
In all of this, about four democratic electors have no idea of Sanders.
Although questions about the personal e-mail box and the server of Hillary Clinton continue to be in the residence of her headmaster, most primary democratic voters are satisfied with its explanation and believe that this did not have a negative impact on their overall view of it.
But that's the other story in American society as a whole.
Half of the Americans today are not satisfied with its explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
The public's views were divided in March shortly after this story became known.
Most Americans say that e-mail polls have never influenced their general opinion about Clinton, although 36 per cent say that their views have been distorted.
In general, more than six of the 10 people who claim that they have been mistaken about Clinton.
Although Clinton is considered to be honest and worthy of the trust of the electors from her party, this continues to be a problem for her among the registered voters in general: only 32 per cent consider her to be honest and trustworthy, at eight points below the previous month and at 15 per month.
Sixty-two per cent of registered voters do not consider it fair and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 registered electors throughout the country do not consider the trampa to be honest and trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump both, however, get good notes on leadership.
Six protested candidates from Byden, Carson and Bush showed a better outcome for honesty.
Most see in Sanders a more honest man than there is, but as for Carson, many have no idea of him.
The error rate for the election of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 per cent.
As a result of the national survey, Ben Carson approached Donald Trampu
Ben Carson came to Donald Trampu at the latest CBS/New York Times
The two candidates took half the votes of the voters in the new review, leaving all the others in the search for resistance under their feet.
The electors throughout the country continue to support the Trampa mass, with a 23 per cent increase in support from the recent CBS survey, which was launched in the past month, up to 27 per cent of the survey held on Tuesday.
But Carson took from 6% to 23% for the same period.
The request also showed that Carson was receiving support from all demographic groups, which delayed the trampa in the electoral group of the Republicans with higher education.
The remaining candidates, with the exception of Carli Fiorina and Governor Ohojo John Kasic, were dismissed with governor of Wisconsin, Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10 per cent in the past month to 2 per cent.
The former Governor of Florida, David Bush, former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Hakabi, and Senator of Florida Marco Rubio, have a third seat of 6 per cent.
An error for the election of 376 electors in this latest survey was 6 per cent plus minus 6 per cent, and the survey was held in September.
A recent CNN/ORC survey published last week showed Carson's growth in surveys, showing 19 per cent of the population's support, with 32 per cent of the support of the tramp.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post also showed that the tramp is significantly overboard by Carson.
With regard to the increase in Carson's support last week, Tramp made a number of critical developments in the address of the former neurosurgery, even when Carson apologized for his doubts about Trampa's faith.
"We need the energy," Tramp said last Saturday while the campaign was closed in Iowa.
Five members of the brothers were charged with the death of Baruch College.
About two years after the death of a college student at the time of the fraternity ritual in the mountains of Poko, Pennsylvania, a murder charge was filed against five people.
"The members of the P.D.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.R. Baruch brutally attacked Chana "Micla" Deng during the September 2013 attack and did not bring him to the hospital, which resulted in his death," they reported to the police.
Officials say that the student with his eyes closed and 30 pounds of sand behind his back has been interpreted several times before he tried to reach his goals by going around the surface.
Mr. Deng finally apologized for his headache and then went unconscious.
The P.D.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P. didn't call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and they were waiting for some time before he was sent to the hospital to speak to the police.
However, they found time to change Denga's clothes, find his symptoms in Google and contact Andy Mengo, the national president of the brotherhood, to ask for advice, as he told the police chief Chris Wagner at the press conference.
"At this point, the members of the brothers began to transfer personal property, in fact, by placing the welfare of the brothers above Michael Deng's health," said Chief Wagner.
He couldn't save, and he ended up in the next morning.
According to the Resurrection Report, Deng received several dumb headaches, coughs, and beads.
" Too many families have suffered as at least one student dies every year since 1970," said Douglas Fairberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
The brothers and their members must bear responsibility, and this step by the authorities is very important.
The Consequences of the Monroasts have been charged with the third murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Menga, were charged with violence against the news and crime.
“We would like to draw on responsibility not only for individual participants, but, if there is an organization that has authorized all of this officially or informally, as well,” Wagner said at the press conference on Tuesday.
Collegiate Baruch banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood excluded the local office from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
There is a rise in rates, and the market for bees will rise, the availability of bonds will rise and the economy will fall into recession.
That's what we know.
We don't know how long it'll take to get there, and how long it'll last.
In particular, history has little to do with time.
The recession took place 11 months after the first increase and for all 86 months.
The strength of the Federal Reserve to raise rates often, although not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
Therefore, the Administration of the Central Bank of the United States emphasizes that investors should not focus on when they start to raise taxes and on how much they will adapt.
Actually, there's a lot of change in the game.
In the end, however, market participants may find that the whole range of increases is being exceeded.
“The first increase in the Federal Reserve with the emergence of a global financial crisis will certainly be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the "pearl money" era," reported Julian Jassop, the leading international economic specialist in Capital Economics, in his comments to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect that the gradual return of interest rates in the United States to a more normal level, but still low levels will be a seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that the consequences will not be.
Here is how some areas of the economy could respond to historical trends:
As has already seen the market over the past month or around the past month, the expectation of an increase in rates can lead to some degree of instability.
However, the effects are usually not so dramatic when the rate is increased.
"It is unlikely that the income from the shares would be compromised for 12-24 months after the first leap, which is likely to reflect a delay in monetary policy," the Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of higher rates of the Federal Reserve.
If, in particular, the market for the last 35 years is significantly changing - about 14 per cent - by increasing rates, it remains sufficient for 250 days (meaning 2.6 per cent) then, after the loss of 500 days, it returns to normal status with the average income of 14.4 per cent for the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, the principal trading strategy specialist in the New Asset Management published in Barron's.
Deutsche says that the cost-effectiveness of the book has a tendency not to become more pronounced at the rate-up stage, and the income from the shares has begun to decrease.
Reactions are a fact of economic life, but rising rates often contribute to them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed in conditions that have not existed before and could speed up the recession.
Most importantly, the gross domestic product will be almost in its lowest point during the existence of a higher rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases, only twice the nominal annual GDP has been under 4.5 per cent since 1950.
Even though it was 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, few believed that it was long, while the third quarter held only 1.5 per cent, according to Atlanta Fed.
The increase in rates on such a unstable economic background may be risky and raises the question “will this time be a second time”, reports Deutsche.
Market participants are preparing to increase the rate of the federal reserve system throughout the year, with their view being attached to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in the rate at the meeting, the Führer trade is only about 25 per cent likely.
“In our 1950 study, all the rates increases to this day were in the supercircle of increasing financial interest in GDP covering pre-response peaks very quickly after recovery,” says the report.
On the contrary, this was an extremely slow recovery after the worst resuscitation in the selected period.
The current cycle at the moment is the longest expected by the Federal Reserve System since the end of the last recession; the record has been 35 months, and it has been 74 months and has not yet been completed.
The fixed income has also become unstable while the market is expected to increase rates, and this scenario is somewhat similar to the one that is implemented for shares.
The principal difference is that the effect will be faster than that of actions when the Federal system changes its strategic course.
In the case of conditions, it appears that income changes the vector immediately after the first increase/reduction of rates in the cycle.
At the end of the cycle of increasing the rate of return, the bonds are falling immediately," reports Deutsche.
Strategic experts from Charles Schwab believe that increasing rates will lead to a close approach to long-term and short-term debt levels by making blood worse.
High-income conditions often lead to a better climate, although "we're still afraid of income fluctuations," says Katy Jones, an analysis of fixed income in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already been adapted to the expected results of the federal system's policy.
“In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflation expectations, there are indications that the market has developed a more robust monetary policy perspective,” she wrote.
The interest rates for short-term loans have been raised, resulting in higher income, higher credit advances, and increased flexibility - all market characteristics of the federal system ' s policies.
In general, companies leading their major business in the United States are benefiting from an increase in interest rates and local production is becoming more attractive.
International companies with a large number of debt will be in a bad mood, as the growing dollar makes their production more expensive in the world market area and their debt more expensive in financial terms.
"History shows that "quality" actions demonstrate the efficiency of the above market within three months of initial increases," Goldman Sachs reported to customers.
Firms with a stable financial status combined with the unstable state as a result of each higher rate in 1994, 1999 and 2004 averaged at 5 per cent points.
High-income companies as well as low-voltility shares have also shown better efficiency than low-quality shares, averaged at 4 (percent) and 3 (percent) respectively.
The debt will become a big issue.
Companies with a high percentage of debt with a floating rate lose most, says Goldman.
In addition to pure burgeoning transactions, consumers will benefit from an increasing dollar.
The contributors could also see profits through higher income, although experts are spending as much time as possible.
" BBC Radio 3 - a copy of Classic FM," - a member of parliament of conservatives Andrew Bingham
Member of Parliament of Conservatives Andrew Bingham critically criticised the standard reduction station
Proves that it is becoming less and less different from the commercial competitor
Also targeted at BBC Music Awards, saying that the prize was only compatible with Brits.
Member of Parliament, Damien Collins, who was upset at The Voice with the same criticism, was not original
"BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM," said the leader of parliament members, encouraging the television company to prove that it does anything that commercial companies don't do.
The parliament member of the Conservatives, Andrew Bingham, also announced the BBC leadership, which seems to be the public radio station "stupid" and is becoming less different from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "enlightenment" - but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
It also focused on the BBC Music Awards Awards held last December.
BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brits under another name.
So if you're trying to do something else -- here's two examples, that first came to my mind, in which you're actually just copying what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director-General of BBC rejected the charge, claiming that BBC Radio 3 was going far ahead of his commercial opponent when it came to live music and audition.
What I know about Radio 3, I don't know about classical music anymore.
And his dedication to live statements and the creation of music in fact is no longer equal to anyone.
"It's also very important, I think, the interest of Radio 3 in the search for new music and in the promotion of new products," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davy claimed that radio stations had to work much more to attract audiences than in the past because the British were less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only child in BBC who was attacked by five commercial competitors during the hearing of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
A member of the parliament of Tori Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a musical show of talent that BBC purchased at the Dutch Talpa Media for a oriented price of 22 million sterling pounds.
See why this programme is often discussed with regard to the lack of originality and excellent features?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, which, as judges, participated in the Paloma Feit and Boy Georges, was made in "the typical BBC style".
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "get a hit in his own house" next time she was going to start a fun project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to prevent the order of the new season The Voice in the future or the use of money by those who pay the licence to other forms of entertainment.
The increase in internet sales has been peaked in August, and the wine may be the Black Friday.
The first three months of 2015 saw an increase in online sales by seven per cent.
Last month, the most moderate growth has been observed since it began to be observed in 2000
Online sales were activated three years ago by using mobile equipment for shopping
Experts are convinced that November's Black Friday could help prevent trauma
For about ten years, virtual jumps have been testing the bomb, turning many central streets in Britain into a city of sight.
However, experts say that there have now been signs of online sales imbalances, after only seven per cent increase over the first three months of 2015.
The overall cost of online shopping in August has shown a minimal increase since they began to be fixed in 2000, with an increase of only five per cent.
Experts say that there have now been signs of online sales imbalances after only seven per cent increase over the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the pace of growth in the previous years and return to the year 2000, they have always found a reasonable explanation," said Guardian Andy Malkahi, editor of the IMMRG sales index.
He explained that online sales had been activated three years ago when buyers began using their mobile phones for purchases.
This meant that more people had the opportunity to buy online and that they could do so under any circumstances, for example, by sitting on a couch.
But now it's going to go to bed, and you can see a decrease (growth).
The phenomenon of the Black Friday, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for slowing down.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from buying an event that took place on the last Friday of November.
In the past year, the buyers in the number five times the average speeded up to computers to make good use of offers, thus breaking down a number of sellers' websites.
Experts believe that the Black Friday, when buyers enter this war for the sake of good purchases, could prevent people from jumping.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, nearly 1 pound of sterlings per 5 people are online.
With regard to products such as television and stereos, more than one third of them are sold via the Internet.
At the same time, more than four people buy clothes and dress online than in fashion shops in central streets.
The Muslim Horonite killed in the fall of the crane in Mecca, and the Ben Laden family were subject to sanctions
Muslims carry 29 dead bodies on the streets, as the first funerals begin in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partially blamed the accident on the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that 394 people were also injured in total after the seizure of the cow
Hundreds of Muslims from all over have gone to the streets to bury 29 of the victims who were killed as a result of the cracking of the skull into the main mosque of Mecca.
The passengers, mainly in the white at the funerals, filled the passage to pay tribute to the first of the victims who had been sent to the Al-Moaisse camp for the last time.
The main process went on to the sacred place, where the former construction site broke down and fell to the ground a few days earlier.
The bodies were handed out for burial, and at the same time, the king of Saudi Arabia had destroyed a construction company belonging to the Ben Laden family, in which the accident also affected 394 people.
29 dead bodies in the main room were carried by the streets
Among the missing were the father of the four children, Kasim Akram of Bolton, the Great Manchester, who was on his first romantic trip when he broke his skull.
Mr. Akram was in the Main Hall with his parents before the start of the annual course.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hague in Mecca will continue as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binladin Group should not have left the bullet of the cow raised in the unemployed.
In the Arabic version of the decree published by the Saudi Press State Agency, Binladin Group is said to be partly responsible for the infringement.
The English editorial of the news agency did not mention this detail, but reported that the company's leaders had been prevented from crossing the country.
Earlier this week, Salman had promised to explain the reason for the fall of the rabbit in the Main Hall, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered to go to jail this month.
Binladin Group did not make any claims on the infringement of the cow, and its representatives were not available for comments.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and inappropriate agreements with the meteorological service.
Ten of the cranes are surrounded by the main Mekki mekka, in the scope of the building work that is taking the Binladin Group.
The family of Ben Laden has been part of the close family of Saudi Arabia for decades and has been leading major construction projects.
The peaceful leader of Al-Qaida Usama Ben Laden was the son-in-law of whom the family rejected in the 1990s.
The accident took place in a strong wind and was almost a few days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in the Holocaust, which was compulsory at least once in life for every hardworking Muslim.
Officials reported that 158 people remained in the hospital.
Officials have decided to pay one million Rials (about 174,000 pounds) to relatives who have lost their families, and the same amount will not be reimbursed.
The remaining wounded will receive half of this amount.

Because, according to the B&Q owner company, British experts are increasingly demanding teachers to carry out household chores.
Veronic Lori, the new Director-General of Kingfisher, who owns the household equipment network, reported that this trend is a major incentive for qualified teachers from Eastern Europe who offer services at minimum prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specialized in master goods and to close 60 B&Q stores simultaneously.
Ms. Lori said that she would like to see more women in the B&Q store staff, as eight out of ten orders for purchases in the store were taken by weak sex representatives.
Most of the staff are now men.
She said that the latest demographic trends, which would be characterized by increasing the number of households belonging to the same women, who were more involved in the construction of their homes than in the past, should not be overlooked.
Ms. Lori said: "In our stores, men still work very well.
There is a need to take steps to achieve the balance.
In general, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on acquired goods are made by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Ms. Lori, one of the five women in the role of leading British companies whose shares are included in the FTSE100 index, has also changed the composition of the Group of Heads of Government, meeting with the Directors of the Equal Number of Men and Women.
Kingfisher is hardly the only company in which 50 per cent of women managers, including the Director-General and the Director-General, are women.
Ms. Lori said: "It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
Finding suitable women in the Board of Directors was difficult.
After the group had incurred the cost of closing shops, Kingfisher showed a decrease in income and sales per year.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, owned by Screwfix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new stores.
Time of decision on the percentage rate of the United States Federal Reserve
The World monitors the United Nations Reserve Bank meeting, which will discuss the most important decision in two days - to raise or have no percentage for the first time in the last decade.
The survey of 80 economists, conducted by Reuters, found that almost half of those who thought that the Federal Reserve would go on this last week now believe that it would still be temporary and maintain the current range level of 0 to 0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve reduced the rate to zero.
For the first time, we would like the main bank to move from a zero note and start the process of normalizing interest rates," said Anhel Kille, a staff member of the Peterson International Economics Institute.
The US economy works effectively, and economic growth adds trillion dollars to the balance sheet, while inflation is small.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision affects the world economy.
He warned the markets that they should be prepared to make changes, but all of them were convinced that all chances of such a move would be met.
The decision will be made at 20 a.m. CET Thursday.
The new Balkan route: refugees are coming to the EU through Croatia.
"Open up!" - hundreds of refugees are scheduled for the Horgosh checkpoint at the Serbian-Wenger border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has closed the border for immigrants.
Refugees have already begun to expand other routes in the EU.
One of them is across Romania in a closed border with Serbia.
Secondly, through Croatia and Slovenia, Austria.
According to some data, buses that have taken refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now being sent to the city of Shida at the Croatian border.
The leaders were ordered by the authorities to follow without delay.
Serbia's Minister for Internal Affairs of Nebojša Stéanovic assures him that his country is doing everything it can to help refugees, but its opportunities are limited:
Our work is to protect Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people to ensure a human relationship with them.
But this is already a general European problem.
To solve it simply, no country in Europe will succeed alone, and so a smaller country like Serbia.
Belgrade requests Budapest to open the border for refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But the Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban is not surprised:
If a person is called a refugee, he must fill in Serbia the necessary documents for that purpose.
And if he doesn't, they won't let him in our country because Serbia is completely safe.
Hungary has already brought 175-kilometer border crossing with Serbia.
But Orban is not meant to do so: he plans to raise the same threat to Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Wangelis Meymarakis: "Europe wants to help us."
For a number of years, Vanguelis Meimaracis has been involved in the law-centred Governments, which, in the view of the left, have brought the country to the financial crisis.
Now he became a temporary leader of the New Democracy Party, breaking the Cyprus challenges.
A few days before the elections, he met a journalist named Euroonius.
Euronius: Mr. Meymarakis, welcome to Euronius!
Hungarian Maymarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronius: Nine months ago your party suffered a devastating blow by joining the SIRIZA coalition, but now, the judge for an excuse, "New Democracy" compared it to popularity.
What's changed in this time?
Wangelis Meymarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Zipras lied a lot in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had benefited from the budget and the prospects for economic growth.
The country now has a budgetary deficit and a high level of unemployment.
The investors left because Mr. Cipras had cursed them.
In the past nine months, Greece had been able to assess the situation in which the country was in January and Mr. Cyprus ' s false promises.
And now they can easily compare what has been promised to happen in real life.
The situation has improved considerably since January, with the majority of Greek citizens doing so.
Euronius: But you say that in the event of the election victory, you will strive for alliances with other parties, including SIRIZ.
Wangelis Meimaracis: The fact that, as we have understood in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still in operation, political forces and all the ruling parties have gathered together in order to implement the programme they have reached without giving up their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that only at this stage will cooperation between political forces and institutions allow the country to move forward.
Euronius: Your party has voted in support of the agreement between Mr. Cyprus and the creditors of the country.
If you become a new Prime Minister on Monday, will you implement this agreement, or will you try to change it at least in part?
We have actually voted in favour of the movement of Greece on the European road because we are well aware of the harmful effects of the EU's departure.
Europe now helps us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their production, we have solidarity funds, the Hungarian package and the banking sector.
All of this would have been lost if there had not been a treaty with Europe.
However, the current measures have been a result of Mr. Cipras ' s successful negotiations.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek Government wants to arrange for the first year, it is reasonable and understandable that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue programme, then I am convinced that all the commitments made that may not be fulfilled because of the recession can be a subject of negotiations, but only after a certain time.
It would be a mistake to believe that in the first year of the new agreement, we can return to negotiations with our creditors, as they expect full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to trust them, we must continue privatization, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed upon, continue to benefit from EU funding and large investment opportunities that we must open up for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Government of Cyprus has not presented any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we have clarified by discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give you an example of the income of farmers.
We have explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be fully taxed sooner.
We were told that the Ministers of Cyprus never talked about it.
That is, Greek ministers were not prepared and badly informed and therefore failed to negotiate and concluded an unsuccessful agreement.
Euronius: If you win the election, you will soon be on one table with Mr. Younger, the Netherlands, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them be different from what your predecessor Antonis Samaras told them?
Vangelis Meymarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that by the end of 2014, we have tried best to implement the 2012 agreement dealing with the heavy coal.
We have made progress in reform.
Of course, we did not get the necessary determination and speeds, but we acted in an emergency.
The market fell, and there was no apparent potential buyers ready to pay the price of the Greek Government.
I was a Parliamentarian at the time, and I was able to agree with the views of the three parliamentary groups, which were then made up of the majority of the Government.
Despite their serious ideological differences on key legislative projects, we have been working in Parliament, with populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations that have taken place.
We have been able to lead the country to a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the early general elections resulting from the December presidential elections.
Euronius: The last week on Greece's territory is the mass flow of refugees.
What do you think of the situation and the reaction of the European countries in which these people are seeking?
Hungarian Maymarakis: The refugee crisis is a bomb of slow action that we must have done after the election victory.
The reason for the failure of the Government of Syria to act in this situation is as follows.
Such issues need to be addressed because, if you are faced with a problem, only emergency measures remain.
And we're in that situation right now.
Even the Interim Government, which changed Syria, has done more in seven days than Mr. Cyprus has done in seven months.
I am confident that these actions of the Interim Government, which provides valuable assistance to the President of the Republic, who called for the EU summit, will allow for a solution.
We need to see how many refugees can leave the country, and note that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some emergency events that have taken place with them.
This is a deeply humanitarian issue, and we will maintain the position that European policies should take in this new situation.
The relevant decision should be taken at EU summits, and the United Nations should be included.
We also need better coordination, more effective border control and reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be able to deal with this serious problem.
Euronius: Mr. Maymarakis, thank you for the interview.
Wangelis Meymarakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful town of Drozkovka Donezko, during the course of the criminal investigation of the Chief Police Department, the suspect, who had been a 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the town of Kryvo Rog (Dnepropetrovs district), was shot at at night in the joint use of alcohol and the conflict in the village of the Upper Yasinovat region of Donetskina, fired from the car in its opposition.

The man who opened the shooting at the University of Delta left a note of apology
After the shooting and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning, and before he shot and killed his colleague the same day, Shennon Lamb wrote a note stating that he "sined" about the first murder and wished to "all come back" to the competent authorities on Tuesday.
The police in the city of Gota, Mississippi, reported that the teacher of geography and public science at the University of Delta called at 911 a.m. in the service about 10 o'clock in the morning.
On Monday, he reported he shot someone.
Lamb told the inspector that the police had to send people home to him.
He reported, "I killed my wife last night," and also mentioned that there was a peach in the house, which "no one's shaking" but probably upset.
The police were interested in the name of the caller, but he didn't call him.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened the shooting.
When I arrived at the crime scene, the police discovered Amy Prentiss' body, 41 years old, and a note from Lamba, 45 years old, saying: "I'm sorry I want to come back all the way back.
I loved Amy and she was the only one who ever loved me.
He wrote a note, Lamb passed 300 miles to the University of Delta, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and on Monday night when the police surrounded him, he ended up with him.
The director of the University of William Laforz reported that he had no knowledge of any conflict between Lambo and Schmidt, but "in Mr. Lamba there was clearly something in mind."
Despite the information received on Monday that Lamb had proposed a novel between Prentiss and Schmidt, the official services reported on Tuesday that “no information or evidence” of the “love triangle”.
The Prentiss called out as the "good man" Sean O'Stin, who reported that he had been married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Stin said that he and Prentiss had a daughter who was 19, and she was "slow."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were best friends.
According to Lindsey Noulz, whose newspaper San Gerald calls his close friend Prentiss, the last one was working from house to house via the Internet.
Noulz told Prentiss that he had a dog by the Lattning call, and that she had met Lambo for about three years.
Noulz said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called his relatives on Monday some time to say, "He won't go to jail."
The same night, when the police got him on the corner of Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods, and shot him there.
According to a summary of the University's website, Lamb received at the University of Delta a degree of pedagogical science at the University of Delt.
Stars Lost Their Success
Acter (left), in a photo with his son Redmond (right), survived several difficult years.
In 2001, he fought leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his multi-year life satellite Farru Fosset, who died from cancer.
It is reported that the actor also suffered from drug addiction and was arrested in 2008.
All of this, of course, played its part.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United has been elected for several months because of a double revolution.
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places at the time of the League of Championships, in which Manchester United lost PSV in Indonesia.
While the protector survives on this issue, which is why he will not be able to go to the field for at least six months, Louis Van Gal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again in this season.
The trauma occurred during the indiscriminate subjugation of Hector Moreno at the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw returned to the PSV zone.
They helped him in the field for nine minutes and gave him oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gal said, "He's in a double battle, and he's in the hospital."
They're moving it to Manchester tomorrow or tomorrow, and then they're operating.
It's terrible -- the young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18 years, overcome great difficulties and became fantastic, and that's what happened.
He had a oxygen mask on his desk.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double pass, it's in six months, and a guy can't play in a group phase.
I hope he can play again in this season.
The sea said he didn't get a red card and no pens were assigned.
Arbitr Nicola Ricoli didn't order Mexicans.
Van Gal thinks the Italian judge has made a mistake.
Judge yourself when I say it's a pen and a red card.
It was a very bad sweater with two legs.
She writes in her Twitter: "Thanks to all of your messages, let's not describe how I'm tired, my way to recovery begins, I'll be back stronger than I was."
More on the subject: Manchester United survives an accident with Luko Shaw in a PSV game
The protection of English will be further encouraged to adjust to the European Championship in France next June.
Philip Coku, a PSV trainer, said, "It's a very heavy trauma."
When any game comes up with such a tragedy, it's all very disturbing.
It was never the intention of our players to torture the opponent.
Moreno took over his leg when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team under the leadership of Van Gala at the 2014 Peace Championship.
"It's very difficult for him now because he didn't intend to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that it's a very heavy trauma, you feel bad," said Koku.
I didn't have a chance to see myself.
The only thing I could see was that the sword that flew in the other direction, so it looked like he (Moren) was bitten by it, but I didn't see the floor under Luke.
In a meeting with SBS6 Moreno, he said, "I know it's like, I know how hard it is to carry it.
I'm so sorry.
Andres Guardado from the PSV was also sent to the hospital after his encounter with Chris Smolling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Loracse?
Every parent takes one thing very quickly: if your child likes a book, it'll take some time before you know it's almost boring.
Let's see if you're just not David Cameron.
In response to the question of the representative of the company involved in the child-retirement organization in the canical, the Prime Minister selected Loraks, an environmental statement written by Dr. Sioux in 1971.
This was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a comment published on the company SuperCamps website, and he continues: "This is a happy, exciting, unusual story with a strong message I like to read to my children, because it always contains any image or message we miss."
However, it is good, in addition to the last paragraph, in which Cameroon is supposed to re-examine the content of the book, but in fact it relates to the composition of the same film taken out in 2012, with new personnel and details added to diversify enough short original content.
"In the high walls of the city of Vonnuzville, where there were no greens and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to kiss the heart of Audrey-girls of his dream, fulfill her desire to see this tree," we read in the text a story of love unknown to Dr. Suzu (now known as Theodor Siezel), who died in 1991.
If this seems not to be suspicious enough, Cameron's text is read almost like a short presentation of the Lorax film, which is posted on the Internet Movie Database: "In the high walls of the city, the worldville, where everything was artificial and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted is hoping to win the heart of Audrey - the girls of his dreams."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, in general recognition, is an active parent, so ignorant of the book, in which a boy named he knows how to destroy the environment of the hungry fruit eater and the neighbor of Nahoquins, despite the protests of Loraks (named Loraks), is a mixture of smiles that “speaks on behalf of trees”.
Most recently, such an uncomplicated PR task was sent to the executive, never to read a book about Loracs 20 times.
The representative of Dahn Stryt stated that the text was likely obtained from the Cameroon office in the electoral area.
The SuperCamps company confirmed that the text was received from Cameroon's headquarters, but further comments were not followed.
For Adam Lita, it was obvious that there was a risk of not falling into England, but that was still a difficult issue.
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if we look at the collection that England has chosen for this tour, it is unlikely that the re-examination in the test series with the 3-0 account of the previous one would be possible for me.
I wouldn't have excluded the win in my field either.
The Alister Kuka Commander may have been less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are games in which the attackers have a virtual acceptance of rounded swords and a strong collective opinion; they will not bring reproach from 2012 but only youth.
Moen Ali is turned into a ball that gives rounds, and Adil Rashid, even if he is unknown to the test level, is an attacking option.
More on the subject: Adam Lite chose from England for the test critique and replaced by Alex Heilz
The decision to exclude Adam Lita from me, his principal trainer in Yorkshire, is understood to be difficult to analyse.
His seven test mothers had two good attacks on difficult conditions, but apparently but the harsh reality that gambling was assessed by the judges on the ground.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, that led to this announcement, because (and I said this earlier) games are the best choice for themselves.
He was half a year old, and Lita could have waited for a longer career, but he was in his own jurisdiction.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
The principal trainer of England's collection, Trevor Baileys, had a good voice about his mood, even when he didn't show what he was capable of, and that doesn't surprise me; he was first a team game, and then everything else.
The question, how long will it take before a test critic leaves himself a hard question?
Lite played seven games, like Sam Robson to him, and Nick Compton was nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play in his field and abroad.
The only thing you could regret is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Prime Minister when Lite was in the best shape, but this lost opportunity in the past.
There's Alex Hills, and he's the smartman I appreciate very much.
He's an unpredictable cricket who we saw at the Yorkshire Club at the beginning of this season when he hired 236 in a match against us at Trent Bridge, which was already something.
It must be given at least the same opportunity as those before it, but it will, of course, depend on the composition of the OAU team.
My wish to put Moena in line with Cook as an open-steam, which would give me the opportunity to insert an additional backbone, while maintaining four speeds, I think, and I am not against it at all.
I don't see why an ex-game can't kill a sword there, but this left has already shown that he's a damn good cricket.
Moen, maybe not all that is needed for his own Woostershire graph, but it's a third number for them, and there's no big difference here.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test matts with a "third kitten" before he went out as an open in 2001.
He won three hundred and did not look.
Zafar Ansari comes to the congregation as a reserve partner, and my immediate community, he has shown me to be a very promising young man.
People can look at his exemplary statistics -- on average 31 with a bit and 35 with a sword -- and think that this is a risk rate, but among the backbones of a little "for" and choose the youth.
He'll learn a lot in this tournament.
In addition to the collection, England plans to make a practical supplement to the training team.
The appointment of Mahele Jaauordin, a Sri Lankan poet, as a consultant for testing mothers could be a master step.
He is one of the best guys in the game, which will give him the richest experience in all possible circumstances and in any attack.
Paul Collingwood is included in the game where the white sword is used and will provide both energy and free pace in the set.
I have always felt that he was born to be involved in international crime, whether it is a game or a training work, and like Mahela, he has little intelligence.
Sometimes new votes in the panel, even if they say what has already been said, may be given new forces by the team.
My colleague Colly, on Darlem Ben Stokes' team, has been left alone for one day, Ruth has been given a similar break with Australia, and I am not, for example, trying this problem.
Although not all agree with this, coaches and players do not establish a schedule.
And you have to remember how toys, their positions depend on results.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
The British exit camp in the EU can win if the economy is depressed by 2017
David Cameron's unintended policy on the renewal of the negotiations on the preservation of Britain in the EU is increasingly challenging every day, even without regard to the choice of generic Jeremy, "Yes or No?" -- Corbin of the Leborist Leader or the non-TUC on Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbins and the Greatest Farage.
The friendly European diplomat explained on days that the situation in which the EU is currently experiencing a variety of crises is not all of its own production - some of the countries parties are on the threshold of the British self-centered agenda of the current proliferation of agreements and agreements that they do not primarily want.
At the annual meeting in Briton, TUC decided that he would not want them in any case if they destroyed social protection.
We could even call it the "Selfi Dave and George" program.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are filmed at the summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photographing themselves on the ground of a known local monument, in or without a local brand company, and then visiting the house and saying that they are attracting allies to reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wishes to be interested in maintaining Britain's external contacts under the roof of the European Union - "Don't leave us together with France," says Berlin, suggesting that discouraged ministers and officials in some capitals come to understand when they are all equal, we will either stay or go.
Angela Merkel, a very careful German Chancellor, is a union, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before the situation gets worse for her, as she collapsed for those living in Tetcher (11 years), Mitterran (14) and Kolya (16).
The head of France, Olland, France, is before the conversion or replacement in 2017.
He's losing power, too.
Poland can soon receive the Nationalist Government of the Right, Spain, to the Left.
It is difficult to see them falling from the skin to help "selfi Brits", whose energy could be lost to the prevention of Scotland's departure from Britain - which they also do not want because there are similar separatist trends in most of them.
So some of these ministers may even plan to issue a deliberately useless note in SNP during a referendum campaign in Britain in 2017 in order to facilitate the EU's exit process, my friend suggests.
"The review was an idea-fix" and "British did not receive any value from the renewed negotiations."
Europeans in their plight know what a hit-and-run can be, and how sceptical about the EU is the media-magnants, unlike Tony Benn's runtime in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 to 2:1.
They can hardly remember Boris Johnson, a Europorteur-born member who celebrated his "right EU bananas" in the early 1990s in Brussels.
Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They have included a fire company from fear-to-flag taxes, telephone hackers and pseudo-residents, who control most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was of the same opinion as they were, but he reported to himself that when you're in a fight fuel cell, you have to give her bananas to take her away and don't give her a kiss on a chain and a cup of tea.
In fact, Millibend was more binding than Blair himself in opposition to Cameroon's concept of a referendum, as Blair had been guided by the principles of the re-enactment of the EU, which had been preserved by the French and Dutch voters in 2005, who had issued it as a win ticket.
The press didn't forgive him.
But my dear Jeremy Corbin, who fell behind me in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he no longer has time to spend on me - it looks like he's risking repeating the 80th-century "Boy of Merdock" strategy again -- a mistake and now.
This may take time, but he must develop a consistent strategy for interaction with the press, not with me, but perfectly with Andrew Marrom, whose vision in the VVS he was sitting in the evening.
The official position of Corbin for Europe is that I call evolution a delicate call.
He says he wants us to remain in the reformed EU.
In fact, most people outside the traditionalist trend of the Ukip and a wider circle of "small English side" between the mountains can probably say "yes".
That's the same thing that Hillary-Benn, but not Bennet, said on radio and TV this week, and his internal combatants refused to acknowledge that the appointment of Corbin, the carrying John McDonnele, the "Tenive" finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his great-grandfather was away from all his power on TV because of his lack of loyalty to colleagues at the Liberian office, not too far away and did not lose his post in the Cabinet of Ministers.
Beatty Hillary was more attractive.
But the fight to remain “in any circumstances” - Benna’s phrase - is not what McDonnell said, and not what J.K. said to the Peruvians and Members of Parliament at a private meeting on Monday evenings, in general opinion.
In order to inform us of democracy and his "boy" Corbin, remember, he has even me - the discipline of the message remains important in the cycle of seven days a week, especially in the waters of social networks, barriers and trades.
It is reasonable not to allow Cameroon to leave Europe as simply as possible, allowing it to accept as appropriate the support of Liberians during a referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But MacDonnell's and Corbin's major mistake about membership in the EU - within the 'Bennit' economy of the fortified economy - is no longer the issue of esoteric debate among left-wing dissidents, for which the narcissist, born of a minor difference, is a central principle in doctrinal disputes.
With regard to his allegations of Nato-Tom Watson, it is disturbing that J.K. will not attack outside - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to bring it to their leaders in their homes.
Why does Paris or Berlin have a political capital - they also have suspicious voters - at Britain's reception when it can be pointless?
The United States has already been very disappointed by the weak military actions of the British people in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Government of the Towers in power has reduced the costs that I have been reminded of on Monday at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts critically review electronic cigarettes from Public Health England
Statements by the Government of the Agency that electronic cigarettes were less than 95 per cent worth of smoking than were made at the meeting of 12 persons, some of whom were associated with tobacco industry as reported by researchers.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet identified the evidence used by the Public Health England (PHE) in their electronic cigarette report.
The PHE published an important report - "reversive tissue" last month, calling it "the overall review of evidence".
However, some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the link between some experts with tobacco industry.
In the editorial article in Lancet's medical journal last month, "extraordinary shock evidence", which was based on PHE's main conclusion.
In article BMJ, two other researchers asked whether these statements had “firm or oral grounds”.
Martin McKy, teacher of European Health Organization at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, said: "The fundamental principle of health should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
According to them, the public is expected that the PHE statement that “the current best estimate shows that electronic cigarettes are about 95 per cent less valuable than tobacco” is based on a detailed discussion of evidence and modelling.
In fact, it is the only meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a multi-tritical analysis model of decision-making to combine their views on the harm caused by various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in scientific publications.
McKy and Kepwell reported that one of the congregation sponsors was a company called EuroSwiss Health, the Director-General who had previously reported that he had received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also confirmed the BAT certificates in the field of health in the Sustainable Development Report.
One of the 12 persons at the meeting announced funding from an electronic cigarette manufacturer, who was not mentioned as having received before from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
A reasonable explanation was not provided for the election of members of the Council, but a number of prominent electronic cigarettes parties were included, some of whom also claimed the funding of the industry in the publication.
It is unknown whether other participants have experience in tobacco management.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the PHE.
The scientific article, published by the Panel, “excellently agreed” that there is a lack of “high evidence of the adverse effects of most of the products on most criteria”, wrote McKi and Capell.
However, none of these links and restrictions were affected in the PHE report.
McKi and Capell said that the PHE statements that "there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are expensive to bring children or smokers to smoking" are premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at PHE, said that BMJ had already responded.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are much less valuable than tobacco."
One of the two who smoked all their lives died from his addiction.
All the evidence suggests that health threats from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to examine the far-reaching effects.
PHE has a clear responsibility to inform the public about what proves and what does not prove this evidence, especially where there have been doubts about the relative danger compared with tobacco.
About 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related diseases, and smoking affects NHS by $2 billion a year.
Clearly, although electronic cigarettes are not safe, they are only part of the damage caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our tasks before the nation.
Former Head Channel 4 believes that BBC should stop EastEnders series.
The former Head of Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that BBC should stop publishing programs such as East Enders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would be far away from such a successful show as the sweet opera on the Albert Square.
Johnson noted that licensees should be used only to create programmes that are not issued by other British telecoms.
He criticised BBC that the company had made the transfer of public information, which would probably only look at a small part of the audience, at a time when competitors had a high rating show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After the Director-General of BBC Tony Hall said that the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noted that he had failed to cooperate with BBC during Channel 4.
"I cannot separate myself from the idea that BBC is preparing for launch and transmitting transfers that could show competitive companies that do not receive subsidies," Johnson told members of the Committee on Communications of the House of Lords in the light of the further ruling of the BBC.
If you keep the license collection that I do not consider a good decision in the medium and long term, the company should leave only those programs that are not issued and are not going to be issued by other companies.
Show The Voice is going out in efer in springtime because the creators want to get as much support as possible in the future.
The idea that no one else could show it is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should go to finance transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, East Enders is another; it is widely known that they are their own production.
Other channels would certainly be far away from her.
I don't understand how this can be a public matter.
I don't think that's something that's going to undermine BBC.
The serial entrepreneur Johnson, who led Channel 4 in 2004-2010, accused BBC of being indicted “on account of staff ambitions and their belief that it was the best way to obtain long-term support”.
His comments on BBC's most popular show are re-enacted with comments by Executive Director Sky Tony Bolla, who, in his lecture on MacTaggarta's memory in Edinburgh in 2003, invited BBC to sell East Enders series.
Johnson noted that lower public BBC transfers " continue to go to BBC4, which often cannot be assessed by the auditor, but therefore the company's function is carried out, and this may be presented as an argument in the Hungarian preaches justifying income from licensees at 4 billion pounds: "No, of course, we do all these outstanding transfers that no one sees."
They will be placed in a garden, where no one will ever look at them.
Regarding the licensing assembly, Johnson informed the Committee: " I call on you to find a more aggressive system with regard to who will get the most from it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year is a huge amount, but for people whose 150 pounds are big money, I'm interested, they think so because they don't look very much and listen to BBC.
Former Executive Director of Sky and Channel 5 David Elstein, who also spoke before the Committee on Monday, said that BBC should review Rita's mission for "information, education and entertainment".
He noted that only a small portion of the BBC released material is currently formally classified as educational, in his words, 1 per cent of the television content and 0.1 per cent on the radio, and that the company should support the initiative of Australian and Canadian intelligence companies under the “information, education and entertainment”.
On the issue of partnership, Elstein noted that BBC should make more efforts in areas such as the "External Concerts" (only part of them, he said, are on TV) and to enter into alliances with commercial intelligence companies to make them available for online review.
Sonogenesis enables brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how slow movement changes when they are influenced by sound impulses.
Scientists have developed red with a genetically modified nervous system that can be managed using sound waves.
Crossword puzzles change the direction of movement at a time when they are influenced by sound impulses, too high for human ears to hear.
Impulsions are affected by the activation of neurons, genetically modified to use membranes that respond to ultraviolet waves.
More on the theme: Students manage brain activity through the light
The researchers said that the reds demonstrated the potential of a new method called "synogenetics", which is used to stimulate certain brain, heart and muscle cells, while the ultrasound source is available outside the body.
Schrikant Chalasani, a scientist at the Institute of Solka, La Hoya, California, told Guardian that this methodology could at one time replace the profound stimulation of the brain - an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent to the brain and which is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Reds usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani discovered that they began to react when they were placed in liquids containing microscopic dust.
He discovered that the lungs are strengthening ultrasound waves that then penetrate the red body.
Strong ultraviolet waves affect the structure called the ion channels TRP-4, found in the membranes of some red cells.
The ultrasound waves allow these ion channels to be opened and stimulate cells associated with them are reported in the Nature Communications report.
In order to create a nematodes that can be managed by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetically modified reds, so their motor neurons used ion channels TRP-4.
While ultrasound was used to affect modified organs, sound waves were forced by microscopic pumps and introduced into red bodies by activating modified motor neurons.
This approach is similar to what is used in the “optogenetics” — a new direction that enables scientists to include and disable neurons using light impulses.
Chalasani claims that compared with this method, sonogenetics may have some advantages.
Unlike the light that is delivered to the required site of the ophthalmic brain, the low frequency ultrasound waves pass safely through the body’s tissues, so they do not need to be carried inside the shell.
"We believe that, in order to treat some neurological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses can at the time make human neurons sensitive to ultraviolet signal," Chalasani said.
He added that, in addition, the methodology can be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.
The forbidden torture equipment is right on your side!
Declarations are made on British arms trade
Consider the role of Amnesty International in protest against the disarmament.
Killer drones!
Blowing waves of railway canals!
Castet bombs!
Electric light bulbs that cause irreparable pain but do not leave traces!
There is no doubt that this announcement of the largest international arms show, prepared by Amnesty International, was designed to draw attention to the intention of the British Government to “disarm” the repressive regimes in the centre of ExCeL in Dockland with the exhibition of defence technologies and security systems.
More on: DSEI Arms Exhibition: The authoritarian regimes go to London
However, the special campaign also led to the sudden appearance of many posts on bus stops and on metro journeys that require their attention again.
"An important announcement going on the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?" - written on one of them by the London Metro font with the image of the DLR line turning into a tank.
In September of this year, a large number of arms dealers are burning at the DLR line. Passengers are asking for help to mix arms.
300 posters were drawn by artists who performed their work at the Museum of Cruel Design at the Banksi Dismalland Park.
The collection, called the Special Patrol Group, has helped to spread them across London using the “composing of advertising sites”, the 6-pound set of key keys, which is said to be “appropriately accessible to the third commercial space on bus stop planets”.
London transporters are not happy with such "vandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the family announcements issued by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator for the exhibitions of Cruel Designs and lecturer at Essex University, artists become more demanding and seek to bring political art to the audience outside the gallery.
Many artists begin to work with activists of protest movements, realizing that they have to go to the real world because of their art if they want to influence society.
Another post against the display of weapons welcome by passengers in the subway.
Amnesty's video was screened more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by a VCCP agency working in pro bono, with a graphic designer and sound artist also working free of charge.
Recruitment director, VCCP Matt Lever, was hit by an advertising silence around the exhibition of weapons, passing through the ExCel calendar, and he thought, "Let them set up a campaign they are trying to avoid."
They were thinking of creating a more realistic and hytro-corporative advertising, but "filling her house with bright colors and animation became more exciting business".
"They have helped us to pay attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment on exhibitions," says Tom Davis of Amnesty.
We now need the Government of Great Britain to take action and ensure that this torture equipment will not be sold directly at our disposal.
It is possible that the most creative art on the issue of arms is within ExCeL, where participants are marketing phantastic empemetic production.
In the Saab press release, information on the order to "AT4CS RS for shooting with a stick" was published by the United States Army.
It includes “not having an amalgamation of cumulative warfare, which brings uninterrupted internal defence action”.
Whatever he does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules of Living in Student Communities
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student society as a normal 19-year-old, still believing in burden and moral relativism, but I'm just now reminding myself of the scars that I've shed on those I've shed -- and many long complaints on others.
What I have learned is that the eight simple rules can be explained.
The transition to society can vary from the drop in the nerve to the absolutely scary one.
He's encouraging pain: to tell people where you took the academic vacation and where you took it, why you support Corbin and why you're "true, I don't love or hate "Marmat," because, seriously, the child, it's just a friendly extract HAHAHA, I'll be with you."
Breathe.
And help others to overcome them is also asking questions and showing interest.
This will support the discussion and help you to find people who like you, not those you would never even talk to, even if they were angry with you, and who would spread the fire.
Let's give people space.
People’s homes are often turned into drinking facilities, semi-smokers, and places of common friendship, but they are also the place where people dress and dress lower.
More on the subject: You don't even think of starting a university in relation to
Introverts in universities are unfair.
Your room must be a refugee, but many communities form a culture of chatting from one room to the other, which contributes to friendship, community, and lasting friendships.
It can be a person who tries to regain power.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I need you to go, and I was able to restore the energy I spent on society with you."
Try to feel when the customer is upset by the crowd, not getting in touch with him, but sending text messages.
Come on, stick it. Do it.
A young man in my community followed this principle: If the door was not closed, he was invited to come.
He saw something.
Take your friends with you for a walk.
Since you're starting a university life on the peak of the popular show of Bake-Off, you're going to put people at the door to present and present a piece of chocolate pie -- not that strange anymore, it doesn't remember the 1950s with them "I'm sorry, we're neighbors, I gave you something, and now you're tired, and I'm going to ask you personal questions."
Offering a home cleaning is a great way to get married.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to greet you, and as a result, your face will likely be associated with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good you are.
Badly hidden stones of pain, drought, and thirst will soon make people become sleepy when you come to them.
Eating is a typical crime in student communities.
Of course, taking some chicken is a thief, but if it's a cow, take a taste of milk for a cow?
Get in touch with the owner of the milk.
Sooner or later, he's offering you not to slow down, even if it's in the kitchen.
If someone steals your stuff, it's disgusting, and I'm feeling you, but try to be more mature than my neighbor who's put in his milk fluid to wash his clothes so that he can get rid of his brother without asking.
She's in prison now.
You don't have to make noises that will make people sleep or learn.
Not only to be a nice person, but also because you're the same people who talk about glass houses.
A girl in my corridor asked her neighbor to have a drum and bass guitar sound, as it was three hours in the morning, and she had an examination tomorrow morning.
In response, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he finally shut the door on 5: 00 a.m., she kindly allowed him to sleep for two hours and then stole his music and closed the door for three hours.
Isn't it romantic if your future husband moved into the same society as you?
On the contrary, it wouldn't be extraordinary, until the locker was removed, it wouldn't be surprising if you took a neighbor for your future wife, got in touch with them, broke relationships, and should have seen him every day, and maybe watch how he's getting along with all your common friends?
Of course, you won't show your heart, but if your burning neighbor is not exactly your future husband, try to cool your own beer.
At the alarming moment when you realize that someone left keys inside his own closed room, the border between the shock and the trauma is darker than it seems.
A good joke is fun, but it turns into a contradiction for the seconds considered.
Teach a valuable and interesting lesson about safety, turning something off - but never hold a piece of a toothpaste room and a shampoo.
Close the door and drop the keys in the glass with the water that you'll put into the morozilica, but don't pull the other thing off the Blue-Tack for more than two times.
iOS 9: how to set up a new operating system on iPhone after Apple's update
A new operating system may be requested to select the General and then the Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will allow you to jump and set it up.
Some have encountered problems after the installation, when an error report has been made telling them that the “renewal of the annex” has failed.
In order to avoid this, users are advised to wait or wait until life is quiet or try to recover through iTunes.
The phone calls will allow you to pass the whole process to the end.
The process may include the removal of applications to increase the free space, but Apple has minimised the likelihood of this action, reduced the size of the update, and has simplified implementation through special silence, which proposes to remove the applications and re-establish them after the process has been completed.
Be assured that when your phone is up-to-date, there is a need or a set of devices to prevent battery charging.
If you are too low, Apple will stop updating because the phone set in the process may lead to updates.

Washington responded to Russia's military activity by telephone.
U.S. Secretary John Kerry called his Russian colleague Sergey Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, the military support given by Moscow to the President of Assad leads only to the expansion of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk to a Russian colleague, writes PJ Media.
U.S. Secretary John Kerry called the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
PJ Media reports on this.
"Secret Kerry made it clear that the continued support of the President of Asad from Russia creates the risk of tension and the extension of the conflict, as well as has a negative impact on our overall goal of combating extremism - if we also do not continue to focus on seeking ways to resolve the Syrian conflict through direct transfer of power," the representatives of the United States Department said.
They also noted that Kerry had repeatedly stressed the commitment of the United States to combat the Islamic State in a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad would never be a member of her.
In addition, the United States "will be pleased with Russia's constructive role in attempting to oppose the Islamic State".
The representatives of the White House said on a small Friday that they did not know exactly what Russian troops were doing in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss the matter with Moscow.
In addition, the press secretary of the White House, Josh Ernest, noted that the time for a telephone conversation between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet gone: "When the President decides that the telephone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, he will wake up and try to make this call."
Barak Obama himself considered Russia ' s decision to increase the support of the Assad regime for the “missing rate”.
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him that it was a mistake that continued support for Asad would only make the situation worse.
"But he did not listen to my warnings, and the situation deteriorated," said the president of the United States.
Importees are exempt from customs duties.
Mine-economic development is intended to temporarily release imported ejaculates and other means of transport for breathing and sport from customs duties and taxes.
The relevant changes in the list of goods for temporary free of charge were prepared by the Ministry of Transport of the RF Government.
The information was reported by the Assistant Minister for Economic Development Elena Laschkina.
In June 2015, RF Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, following his visit to Crimea, ordered a number of offices -- Minéconomdition, Mintrans RF, Minkulturi, MID, MIC, FSB, FTS, Rosturism — to prepare proposals to create favourable conditions for hunting in coastal areas of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the lack of infrastructure to store, maintain and maintain toys.
Owners prefer to keep their courts outside the border - about €200 million per year will be punished by European States for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of buildings.
The Minoronomy of Russia prepared a draft decision by the Council of the European Economic Commission, entitled "To make changes to the List of Goods provisionally imported with full conditional exemption from customs duties and taxes", which provides for full exemption from customs duties, taxes on imported games and other recreational facilities for recreation and sports.
In the view of the Ministry, this will undoubtedly contribute to the creation of favourable conditions for the development of hunting in coastal areas in the country, Laskina noted.
The issue was addressed by the Subcommission on Customs Tariff, Non-Tarif Control, Measures to Protect External Trade of the Government ' s Economic Development and Integration Commission, which was held in September, and was also approved by the departments after the discussion.
As noted by the representative of the Minéconomdation, the proposed measure of full-time release on imports is, in fact, beneficial.
Thus, following the adoption of the protocol to the meeting of the Sub-Commission in the Government of the Russian Federation, the Minoro-Development Council would propose to the Eurasian Economic Commission for Discussion with EEA member States, Laschkina explained.
The list of imported goods that are fully exempt from customs duties includes goods necessary for the promotion of external economic activities and international cooperation, for the use of science, culture, cinema, sport and tourism, for international assistance and for the provision of equipment (personal computers, writing machines), control and measuring equipment, loading equipment, driving equipment and decorations, transport laboratories and master cars, vehicles, motor vehicles, sports aircraft, equipment, equipment, equipment, equipment, equipment, equipment, equipment and equipment.
In the press service of Mintrans RF " Disclaimers" said that mandatory provisions had been made on the seaports of Kerchi, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Eupaturia, which provided for a simplified procedure for the formation and departure of small, sports and commercial vessels in the seaport.
The Mintrans command the Captains of the port of Crimea to ensure the easy application of the entry of small, sportable and seaports and the exit of listed vessels from the port of the sea.
Mintrans has also prepared draft provisions by the Government of the RFI on the approval of the coastal waters of Crimea.
With regard to Yalta and Feodosia, orders have already been adopted, the remaining in the course of the agreement, noted in the press office.
In the view of Mintrans, the governor, the classification and the exhibition, the registration of minor vessels used for non-commercial purposes should be carried out by the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia it was extremely difficult to hold a lift because of the weak infrastructure.
Looking south of Italy and France, it is the whole continuously developing industry in which a large number of people are involved.
In Russia, it's actually all right.
Our beach is a small, unique piece of land that can be operated around the clock - the Black Sea in Sochi, Gelendzica, Novorossian, Anap.
However, it is a major difficulty that the border service rules are very strict in this area: a mass of permits is needed to be established in order to be able to pass through.
At the same time, in Russia, you were even going somewhere.

The World Bank has allocated Ukraine a loan of $500 million.
The World Bank approved a new loan project for Ukraine of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
The press service of the international organization was notified.
“New funding will support a number of priority measures in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine”, the Communication said.
The Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Zimyao Fanh said that banking sector reforms would help restore real-life loans and stimulate economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank had observed the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problem, Fan is calling upon the Government of Ukraine to speed up reform.
Earlier, the Government of Poland had approved a loan of €100 million in Ukraine, transmitting the RIA News.
Prisons are asked to create separate blocks for transmitters.
Other issues will be discussed in the Public Council at the Federal Criminal Service (FSIN) for the protection of the rights of judges in October 2015.
A member of the Council of Vladislav Grib told of this.
In his view, depending on the total number of convicted persons in Russia who have not been convicted of sex, individual cameras, blocks or even (if there are so many) may be provided for a special colony for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Gribb stresses that to determine the punishment of citizens in such isolated places may only be followed by appropriate medical expertise, which will prove that the criminal is actually a person who identifies himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib was confident that the isolation of transiters from other prisoners would ensure the security of the reparation.
According to him, the proposed practice works abroad: special blocks are provided in the SIZO (where the defendants are before the court's decision) and in the correctional institutions.
Today it is the only way out of working with such criminals.
It is necessary to isolate them in particular, such as the presence of transiters and transmitters in ordinary chambers, that is a problem for their families and seafarers.
The reduction of traffic from the cameras is guaranteed, says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on the size of the city, the number of offenders with an indefinite field, it is necessary to calculate where to distribute them.
SIZO is not exactly needed - only cameras, bars in prisons.
Yeah, a separate column is possible if there's a lot of transmitters.
As Gribb explained, 50 or 100 people could be held in the block, and if a special corps was established in Russia alone, prisoners' sentences would be available from any region.
Citizens are in SIZO at the crime scene, so the arrival of transiters or transmitters from other entities during the investigation and the judicial process is not realistic, and here is the practice for those who have already been convicted in a particular colony - yes, says Gribb.
Remember, the persecution of law enforcement officers was unable to determine in which male or female investigators were detained for the storage of drugs by 24-year-old Dmitria Kojukova (known as Alina Davis), for which a man with a girl was not arrested outside.
He was released from the house under a visa.
This news has been widely discussed in social networks and media, as the mechanism for the content of transiters in SIZO and the colonies in Russia has not yet been fully discussed.
The Russian human rights defender, activist LGBT movement (LGBT-Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual) Nikolai Alexeev supported the idea of setting up special places to punish transiters, noting that it is also possible for foreign nationals to be identified in a colony - male or female - depending on their own wishes.
In view of the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yes, this is a very small percentage, but the problem exists, as is the issue of security in prisons for homosexuals, says Alexev.
Prisons should be safe, so certain blocks could be made in the name of this and for homosexuals, more than they are in prisons than transiters.
At the same time, Alexev is skeptical that many citizens in Russia are willing to give themselves over to transsexuals in order to fall apart from the ordinary colony.
Of course, medical evidence can be provided before people can be placed in a colony for transmitters, but it is not always clear.
For example, in the United States, one of Chelsea Manning's prisoners looked like a man and already in prison said that he wanted to change his mind, Alexev said.
A man can feel himself comfortable.
As long as there are no separate places to punish transiters, however, I doubt that prison officials will think seriously about the safety of such persons and avoid their orientation or sexual identification.
At the same time, the international expert on reproductive health in the territory of RF Boris Lordkippanide noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of trans-sexuals in the colony could seriously slow down the beginning of the punishment of convicted persons.
The Commission is created - the issue of sex, the psychiatry conducts long observation, not one test on which a high-end conclusion is made.
Today's psychiatry possibilities allow that.
That is why, even before sex, potential patients always undergo such experiments - they show exactly whether the exchange of sex with the surgical intervention is the necessary measure, says Lordkippanid.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how this system will be implemented with regard to the convicted, since the average of such a survey lasts a month.
Doctors, although the overall idea of creating separate blocks for transsexuals has also been supported, there is also doubt that, in the current economic context, it will be appropriate to provide funds for the construction of new premises, medical expertise, transgenders in Russia.
It is difficult to consider that there is no official statistics, but if it is taken into account that homosexuals in Russia are around 5%, it can be said that there are even fewer transmitters than those who have this denial and still commit crimes, a very small number, Lordkippanid said.
Now, at the request of the colony of homosexuals, transmitters can obtain certain conditions of content.
Michael Antipov won a Junior World Championship on chess.
In Hunty Mansieska, a peace campaign was completed for teens up to 20 years.
The end of the preamble was more impressive.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and he became Russian Michael Antipov, who was unable to force Polish Jana-Chistof Dudu, who would probably go to the title.
The girl won the Ukrainian chess team, Natalie Bucks.
The World Championship on Chess, which has since September in Hunty-Mansiesk, already in the middle of the tournament, has been said to have lost almost all of the mind, since the representative of Poland, Jan-Kschistof Duda, who has delivered a series of four victories (servations under the Swiss system in 13 towers), is convinced of the leadership.
In view of the fact that Duda was a rating-favorite of the empire, even though it was considered one of the most promising young shashmatists, the likelihood that he would lose his good fortune was very low.
And even when Duda released the revolution and allowed Russian Mikhail Antipuov to cut off to 0.5 balls, he remained apparently a favorite in the fight for the title.
For Antipoou to be a leader, it was necessary to win the 13th tour constantly.
But it wouldn't even help if you won't win your party.
In addition, this obligation of victory could, of course, be attributed to the game of a Russian chess player and lead to uncomplicated mistakes.
Fortunately, Michael Antipov managed to avoid them.
He had no doubt dealt with the French Rambaldi, and he was forced to wait for his party to end when he met Benjamin Bok.
Luckily, for Antipova, the Polish chessman was opposed to the Dutch outlaw.
Thus, Anthipov and Dud took the same number of glasses as 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipov had the best additional indicators.
That is why the leadership of the Hunty Mansie Autonomic Area, the governor of Natalya Komarova, has traditionally given great attention to the development of shamat in the region, has made a major contribution.
And here's not the story of the intrepid girl.
The Tournament Leader - Natalie Buxe (Ukraine) - was not enough to lose the title in the last race for success and success.
Thus, the victory of the Russians, Alina Bivol, did not allow her to conquer Bucks.
The Russian sports team remained second with the departure of the champion in 0.5 ball.
A change in the regional structure, however.
The Company unites the Privatian and Ural regions in one of the largest Vulgao-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East - in the region of the East.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
As the director of the "Wimplecoma" Michael Slobodin noted, changes are being made to "be a strong player on the market", to develop a company "in new, not always favourable external conditions".
Mr. Slobodin, in his telephony, explained that he intended to reduce the "ten per cent" of staff in Russia.
The rospute supervisor checked 78 Moscow's tasteful Burger King and issued 367 prescriptions.

At first, they wanted 17% indexation, and now they want 10%, and also billions of budget subsidies, he says.
We're saying it's wrong, it's too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, give up expensive individuals, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money on the left and right.
He added that the FAS had its “very stricter” proposals that are currently being discussed in the Government.
Polymetal is looking at the possible net account option with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of performing a full payment option of $300 million, the gold companies reported.

Summer has time until 3 October to implement options or to require payment.
The details of the negotiations in Polymetal are not disclosed.
The option was concluded in the context of the purchase of the Polymetal project "Kizal" in Kazakhstan.

Minpromtorg: Direct food aid will not be a model card in the SSR.
The Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia, Victor Evtukhov, reported that the local food aid programme would not be an example of the food distribution system existing in the SSR.
This is about the current local food aid to the population and the support of an effective domestic product producer.
I'm asking you not to speculate on the word "food card".
In particular, it would be desirable to note that the proposed product cards should not be accompanied by a long-term ceiling deficit, a card distribution system, with the number of products obtained.
As long as we have proposed the concept, if it is approved, we will propose amendments to the legislation," Mr. Evtukhov said.
“E” has previously written that the food card programme for the poor has been introduced to the Government.

In the current year, the study of the Association of Russian Managers of Top 1,000 Russian Managers is conducted 16 times.
As a tool to assess the professional representation of Russian senior managers, the study results from the work of the Russian administrations for the year by identifying leaders in the industries and functionalities.
The initial pool of candidates is made up of the laurettes of the previous year's rating.
The winners of last year are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate for the current year's rating and to appoint members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates included in the initial list is invited to appoint up to ten new managers from other companies, which would be appropriate to add to the total number of candidates.
The following executives may be sent to the company: the Director of Finance, the Director of Commerce, the Director of Marketing, the Director of Staff, the IT Director, the Director of Public and Corporate Relations, the Director of Government Relations, the Director of Corporate Management.
Each proposed expert shall be invited to participate in the rating and shall be allowed to appoint its management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.
The promotion of industrial applications is based on the sectoral classification of the Managers Association: information technology, commercial banks, forestry and forestry industry, machinery, medicine, metallurgy, multi-professional holdings, professional services, communications, services and the production of consumer goods, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant is provided with a login and password for access to www.top1000.amr.ru where they see information about the other participants and can leave their assessments on the proposed criteria for each functional direction.
The rating methodology is based on the principle of "Best Choices of Best": Top Managers are evaluated by top managers, and functional managers are evaluated by functional managers.
Such a principle would allow for the maximum authentic assessment of the professional representation of a colleague.
The final results of the rating are approved at the meetings of the expert commissions.
All candidates for the current year's rating and multiple candidates for the rating last year are invited to the expert commissions ' open meetings.
The commissions are organized on a functional basis: the Commission on the approval of the list of senior managers and eight committees on the approval of executive direction managers.
The meetings of the expert commissions are invited to approve the lists submitted in alphabetical order (the places remain strictly in accordance with the internet assessment and are closed to the publication of the rating) or to make updates to them in accordance with the list of applied reserve candidates.
The names of companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the rules of "E".
At the time of publication of the rating, changes may be made to the status of managers and companies.
The rate for investment is 10-13 per cent.
According to experts, small and medium-sized business credit markets in January-April of the current year averaged 40 per cent.
What, according to your assessment, is the situation today?
Following the panic settings at the end of 2014, the level of the IRB credit declined significantly at the beginning of 2015.
The reason is understandable: a sharp increase in interest rates.
No one benefited from 25-30 per cent of the year's credit.
If the bank had been able to raise all its potential problems in the future, from time to time, it would not be possible to do so now: taxes and so on.
For business, the current level of lending for SMEs is taxable.
For a large part of the investment projects, the current level is unacceptable from the point of view of their coverage.
The rate of 10-13 per cent would allow businesses to invest in a wide range of projects and create attractive income.
According to your estimates, how much do you expect credit providers to be satisfied with?
The situation has improved slightly since the decrease in the percentage rate of the CB.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, as we have seen, clients have become very much involved in credit management.
Firstly, business does not understand the prospects for its development and future income.
Today's business has one outcome: it is necessary to learn to work, focusing on the current economic situation in the country and region.
It is necessary to monitor the current results more closely, control the movement of funds.
At the same time, new technologies should be used to modernise equipment, reduce production costs and energy security.
All of this eventually enables companies to produce more competitively and keep business even in an unstable economic situation.
What key trends in the SME credit market will be strengthened and will impact its development by the end of 2015?
Will the percentage change?
The forecast of lowering the average rate will depend much on the central bank's policy, and the regulator is now showing consistency in reducing the key rate.
However, the radical decline in credit prices for SMEs is not worth it.
In the current situation, first of all, inflation is an increase in the percentage required to obtain real income.
In addition, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even when the rates of CB are reduced.
In terms of time-limits, traditional small and medium-sized enterprises, limited both in terms of cash delivery and in terms of economic behaviour adjustments, will inevitably pose a greater risk for creditors.
I wouldn't have expected a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country's economy.
New Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
That is how the word Mazda is written by Japanese hieroglyphics.
Beautiful, romantic and simultaneously difficult for those who are accustomed to chirillics or latrines.
As well as the new cross-section CX-5, as well as any other model of the brand: without insulation it is attractive, technically done inside.
Japan has been able, by its “Japan”, to be responsible for the products of the Eastern Sun to the full state of the east.
How appropriate are the arguments for the use of cars from other countries, and the person agrees in principle with these arguments, but the whole discussion is based on the final phrase: "But this is the Japanese car!
And don't worry about anything!
Such people must probably love not only technology but also more Japanese.
Sitting down from the Bashe walk, getting food, collecting cats and wearing your mate - not in kimono, of course, but on the corner of the street Japanese fashion: sweet, creative and very unexpected.
Please, the Japanese school form is the only form that girls have with satisfaction and after school.
It has amazing properties: simultaneously and sensitive and strong.
And when a girl is older, she's a little girl.
The main change in the outer CX-5 is the radar grid with five horizontal lines.
But where the shape of the car changes significantly the shape of the new front and rear frames, the vehicle is currently known in the engine stream.
As in the past, Mazda CX-5 looks very similar.
The silhouette is harmonious, the shapes are sensitive, but the outside has a tendency to be rigid.
There's no need to challenge the police.
The role CX-5, one of the most secure in the world, can only be tested by hundreds of Japanese consolations.
The diesel engine of 2.2 l provides a high-speed hot spot in a wide range of speeds.
At this point, the fuel consumption of this engine is 175 C. - 5.9 C. Total. A strong aggregate is made up of exclusively automatic transmission and full input.
Black boots, black bed, black bag...
To add a little black shirt to this picture, you can select the legislators with a print from the police note Not Cross.
In addition, in Mazda, the maximum effort has been made to prevent CX-5 from happening in your own DTP.
In order to further enhance the comfort, while maintaining excellent governance, the infrastructure has been redesigned by the construction of front and rear amortizers, as well as optimised the form of front-hand plugs.
The system of full leadership was adapted under Russian conditions.
The noise from the road and the engine at high speeds is reduced by 13 per cent.
A buyer in a flower or pool is as sweet as a budget seat.
It's another case if a girl goes into a shopping mall with an original picture.
For example, from a computer game in the role fighter's genre.
Her attention will then be given to nothing less than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has improved construction, both in front and back seats, which provides optimal space storage and for large plates, and for long legs, who has what it has.
Still long-distancers appreciate that the front of the central tunnel is now soft and not on board ships in the air.
The largest set of active safety systems in Mazda is proposed for CX-5.
To identify the potential threat, radars, lasers and cameras are used here.
There is also an adaptive lighting, and a warning of land-flowing, and monitoring of dead zones, and safe braking.
The Mazda CX-5 is one of the best bakers in the class.
It has at least a suitable minimum of 561. The last seats are in proportion to 4:2:4. Each section is provided with a separate supply line and increases the bag size by 1560.
Hero multifilm in Japan is called "kigurums."
It's especially interesting to look like chigurum-pijam.
She's got everything!
Of course he's sleeping.
But it's still a pleasure to have small children.
Or just play such a game on the street...
It's so healthy when it's possible to choose a suit, a way of behavior or a car.
Thank you for helping in the preparation of the Kawaicat store.
Kiev's disarmed the atomic unit.
Kiev officially rejected Ukraine's cooperation with Russia on the restructuring of the EMCDDA.
The Supreme Council, in the middle of the second attempt, still voted in favour of an agreement with Moscow.
The third and fourth blocks were still signed in 2010-2012, but the project was not yet successful.
In the middle of the Supreme Council, Ukraine adopted a law extending the 2010-2012 agreement with the FF on the construction of a third and fourth block on the ACE Hämelnica.
The draft law was passed only by the Government in the second vote, for the first time, by 210 MPs, at a minimum of 226, but then by 234 Members of Parliament were voting on the draft.
The ECE Hmelnice for the target project was to have four GHGs with reactors of the EWE type, but only two could be built.
The negotiations with Moscow on restructuring led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement by 2010 and the Council adopted the relevant laws in 2011-2012.
Since no funds were available in the Ukrainian budget, block construction was expected to be credited by the Russian side, but the funds had not been allocated.
Following the conversion to Kiev in February 2014, and following this freeze in relation to the two countries, Kiev began to develop relations with Moscow in the atomic industry, declaring its refusal to cooperate on the ACE Hmelnica and on the construction project in Ukraine of the nuclear fuel industry.
The only area in which relations have been maintained is the purchase of fuel in the RFCs for active Ukrainian ECEs (encouraged about half of the country's electricity production), as well as the Russian NECE "Energoat" replaces Russian supplies with something.
The plans for the construction of the ACE Hmelnik with another contractor in Ukraine have not been rejected until finally: negotiations with Czech Skoda JS were made in Kiev in 2014.
The United Nations is opposed to the use of military force in resolving the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Mr. Ghi Mun, during the press conference, reported that the situation in Syria could not be resolved by military means.
"No military decision," the AP replies to the question of Syria ' s military support from Russia.
Mr. Gi Mun also reported that a meeting would be held with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Permanent Members of the United Nations Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will hold a meeting with the heads of the MDGs of the United Nations Permanent Members of the UN later this month.
"The meeting will be in Syria," he said.
Earlier today, the Deputy Head of the Russian Federation, Nicolai Boddanovski, reported that Genthab did not exclude the possibility of establishing a future WVS base in Syria.
There's still no such plans.
"But it could be," said Mr. Godanowski.
“E” has previously reported that the United States does not trust President Vladimir Putin of Russia, who stated that military assistance to the official Damascus is necessary to combat the prohibited RF terrorist group “Islamic State”.
For more details of the United States' doubts about Russia's assistance in Syria, read in the article “E” “Russian military presence in Syria is worried about Washington”.
In the PAOBSE, the possible meeting of the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentarians is reported.
The head of the delegation of Ukraine to the Parliamentary Assembly (PA) OBSE Arthur Gerasimov reported on the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentarians to discuss the situation in eastern Ukraine.
"What I know is that a certain meeting is planned this year, possibly between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentarian delegations," Mr. Gerasimov said.
He also called for the implementation of the minimum agreements and "to return to the normal viability of our countries".
On the question of whether, in his view, dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level, in the Normandy form or in the form of a contact group at the PAOBSE area, Mr. Gerasimov noted that dialogue had been conducted, there were minority agreements.
At the same time, it is policy-based that all kinds of dialogue are supported in Kiev.
The former representative of Ukraine, ex-President of the country of Leonid Kuchma, said that the so-called Danube and the Luganese Republic had not substantially changed their positions in the triangular negotiations, but the dialogue had become more positive.
The parties gave orders.
Yesterday, the Electoral Commission of the Netherlands introduced the results of the elections in the municipal area by distributing 12 parliamentary mandates on the party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of violations during the elections were raised by representatives of the CPRF accused of the election of “infection of counterfeiting”.
The comments of the opposition were not accepted.
Together, he rejected the Communist Party of Russia in the organization of a referendum on the cancellation of multi-s private houses.
The city election officially presented the results of the elections at the foot of the Netherlands in the municipal electoral district.
The list of voters in the Netherlands included 1,03 million people, 746.7 thousand votes in the local commissions, and 268 thousand voters voted in elections.
More than 11.7 thousand people were injured and 24 were killed.
12 mandates were distributed to political parties yesterday, depending on their votes.
On the list of six MPs, six are placed in the pride of Dmitri Suvakov, Dmitri Krasnov, Vasili Shuprano, Elizaveta Solonchenko, Veceslav Rasteryaev and Igoru Nagorno.
The only mandate of the LDR was received by the leader of the party of Vladimir Girinowski.
The two mandates of the CPRF are distributed between Vladimir Bulan and Mr. Alexander Tarnaev.
The three mandates of "Justice of Russia" are granted to Alexander of the Russian Federation, Igor of Goddanov and Mikhail Shalugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates must be determined whether they will work as MPs in the words of the city: if they refuse the mandate, they will be transferred to the next candidate on the list.
The President of Gorisbirkom, Alexander Maceev, informed the members of the commission that he had made reservations to "send the telegram to Jirinov and others" on the subject of a rejection of the mandates.
In adopting the Protocol on the outcome of the elections, the representatives of the CPRF declared numerous violations.
A member of the Gorisbirkom, with the right to vote by CPRF Leonid Krassonguktski, proposed not to recognize the results of the vote in the four districts No.21-24, recalling that the Chief of the Administration of the Sormov area had been closed to the building of the administration, where four district commissions had been held.
Within a long time, neither the MPs, nor the candidates, nor the observers, could go through it, but the resonance scandal with the noise of the radio department’s doors was shown on the telefer.
At the meetings of the Committees, all observers and members of the Commission, with the right to vote, had the opportunity to attend.
The head stopped access only when the vote was completed and the local commissions had not yet arrived to give their ballots.
This was done to prevent various prosecutions.
"The head was repaired, and all meetings could be attended by interested persons," said a member of the top election of Natalie Andruchin.
The communists claimed that the administration building had been illegally detained for more than four hours by a member of the Human Rights Council, for which a statement was sent to the Investigation Committee.
The opposition also argued that a number of WIKs on the election day began to print the urine at 6-7 hours in the morning, offering them tickets for a timely vote.
The members of the commissions, with the right to vote and observers, had not been informed, so they had come to the beginning of the elections on 8 a.m.
The Communists are convinced that in the morning prior to the opening of the electoral sites in the urn, the ballots could be uncontrollable.
However, in the election that has already discussed more than 124 complaints for various reasons, Alexander Maceeva said that no violations of unexploded ballots had been found.
The members of the Commission did not support the proposal of her colleague, Maria Poopov, from "S just Russia", to take the initiative to adopt amendments to regional legislation in order to clearly set the time for the opening of the scrolls with urgent ballots, which then fall into the Urn.
"In the course of your own initiative, you should go to the CIC," said Mrs. Pope Alexander Maceev.
At the end of the meeting, a member of the CPRF, Sergei Samhoin, who called for the election to ignore ten complaints and to cover the falsification of the elections.
"You're not here on a mitten, please make an appointment!" said the president of the election.
The Protocol was thus adopted in almost uniformly.
The general results of the elections should be approved by 27 September, after the first city meeting of the Sixth Assembly was scheduled for three weeks.
In addition to identifying the results of the elections, the City Electoral Commission rejected the Russian Communist Party's registration of the group's initiative to conduct a local referendum.
According to the documents, the parties were going to discuss two issues for the people below: whether they agreed that the meetings at the multi-square house should be “cut off immediately” and the rates for residential and municipal services “sustain until 2020”.
However, the lawyer explained that the treatment of the Russian Communists was contrary to the law.
FedEx is a mixed character, lowering forecasts for 2016.
FedEx was reported to have been poor results in the last quarter, and the delivery service giant reduced the forecast of annual revenue due to the decline in demand for freight services and the increase in the cost of its domestic transport unit.
The company also stated that it is planning to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx reported that it would hire 50,000 temporary workers at the festival.
Its share increased by approximately 2.5 per cent on the provisional market in 45 minutes before the opening of the beer in the middle.
FedEx Corp stated that it is planning to earn from $10.40 to $10.90 in the financial year, which ends in the next May, at 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
The analysts assumed $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
Despite an average rate of 4.9 per cent on 4 January, the decrease in the forecast is observed, and the increase in land transport of heavy goods or goods started in November.
The company stated that it was still planning to increase the interest rate compared with last year by reducing costs, increasing gross income and increasing online trade.
The president and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company “worked stablely with the weak, compared to forecasting, economic conditions, especially in production and world trade”.
The plans to hire the workforce at the festival were announced on the following day after the contest, UPS, that they were planning to hire additional 95,000 staff, approximately as much as they had taken on work last year.
For the quarter ended 31 August, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 per cent more than a year earlier.
The share income was $2.42, near the average of $2.44 for the share carried out by Zacks Investment Research by 12 analysts.
The income increased by 5 per cent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from the fall in the emergency international transport sector, resulting in a lack of gross income in its unit of expertise.
However, the volume of online purchases has greatly improved the results in FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, land transport cuts increased by 29 per cent, but operating income remained overall without changes due to higher costs of major management and self-insurance.
The unit of express transfer received higher income due to higher basic rates, while the labour cost increased in the freight sector.
In the provisional markets, for example, before the opening of the FedEx stock exchange, the shares fell to $3.85 or 2.5 per cent - to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday, fell 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent lower record since 11 June.
At the most expected meeting of the Federal Reserve System leaders for a few years, two days this week will be held at the 27-foot table of the Honduran green tree, deciding whether to raise the key percentage rate for the first time in almost ten years.
At the same time, a large number of enhanced rooms for meetings in two high-level areas will depend on the United States ' s impressive image.
This map is a reminder that the President of the Federal Reserve System, Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues, must put the country's economic interests above all.
The Central Bank received two orders from the Congress: maximising employment in the United States and maintaining stable prices here.
However, since the Great Recession, the Heads of the Federal System have acknowledged that there is a third unwritten order: financial stability.
And this third order could be an unknown factor in a nearly-exploited decision to announce on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to withdraw from an unprecedented incentive that has provided almost a zero-short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even if most data show reliable economic growth, recent global financial market shocks can still be maintained by the federal system's careful leaders to increase flexibility by raising the base rate on the federal funds, even at the fourth percentage point.
"It is clear that the labour and inflation markets will be the first and most important subject of consideration," said Lindsey M. Peggs, chief economist of the Brooklyn company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise taxes, increasing uncertainty around the world market would be sufficient to give them reason to wait further," she noted.
There is no consensus on what is done in the Federal Reserve System, which is itself causing financial market collapse.
About half of the economists recently questioned by Bloomberg predicted a rise in percentage rates this week.
Financial markets, however, are expected to be maintained by the Federal system, while the key indicator shows only about 30 per cent of the risk of rapid recovery.
This could lead to a fall in the market of shares if the Federal system raises the rate, provided that those who make decisions do not break the promise that the next increase will be soon.
On Tuesday, the Dou-Johns index rose to 228.89 paragraphs, or 1.4 per cent, to 16,599.85.
It was hoped that the federal system's strategy would leave a mark this week, said John London, the lead economist of Moody's Capital Markets Research.
"It would be a surprise if the federal system would raise the rates at this time," he noted.
If the leadership of the Federal Reserve System does so, "they will have to go far enough to adopt their strategy in order to keep financial markets in their hands, so as not to panic."
Other experts argued that the increase in rates could bring financial markets calm, as this would create uncertainty about how the Federal system would operate.
A month ago, the Federal system seemed to have been able to raise the rate of 0.25 per cent this month, making the first small step in the slow down of financial conditions, which could confirm the amount of recovery of the United States.
Yellen stated early in the summer that she expected to increase the rate this year, despite the Liberian complaint that there was a need for greater economic progress.
While new jobs in August were slowing down, the labour market was stable in this year.
Unemployment decreased to 5.1 per cent last month, which is the lowest rate for over seven years, and almost at the level that is considered to be full-time in the Federal system.
The increase in wages shows signs of rapid growth.
And although inflation continues to be below the annual central bank, the Federal system's leadership has shown that, for a key reason, it has become a temporary effect on the price for oil.
The economy “can be achieved at even higher rates, and they need to take into account the reduction of the labour market,” noted Ian Sheferdson, chief economist Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world became third at the end of the last month, after China made its currency.
The Dou-Johns' average index for industrial companies' actions fell to 16 per cent on record in May, as investors feared that the slowdown of the Chinese economy could slow the world's growth.
The market has partially restored its position this month, and the Dou-Johns index is now about 10% below the high value of May.
In order to guide the Federal Reserve System, market reimbursement is further complicated by the simple calculation of the rate increase.
"In the absence of information about what has happened on the financial markets and news on the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, they would have been closing the gap at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher, UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Federal Reserve Officer.
Now, according to his forecasts, they will wait at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
"There is a great uncertainty about the consequences of the American economy and they have almost no reliable data after recent developments in China," Oliner said.
The world economy is not in the main concern of the Federal system, and it should not be taken into account technically when making such decisions.
However, the Federal Reserve System has, in fact, become the world financial authority.
The influence of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous.
Only a hint from the then President, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013 that the Federal Reserve System could “suckle” its financial expansion, led to market disturbances throughout the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined with one another, it would be expected that the Heads of the Federal Reserve System would not only monitor developments everywhere but also consult with representatives of other Central Banks and experts in order to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process was “faster than science”, noted Zakari Karabell, director of Investnet Inc, a company that is engaged in global status management strategies.
Jeffry Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that “in the history of the Federal Reserve System, there were cases of excessive response to the movement of the financial market which did not appear to be related to economic principles”.
Lacker, a member of the influential Federal Committee on the Open Market, for example, made decisions 1998-99.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Federal system to lower its base rate by 0.75 per cent at three meetings, "without limited identified impacts for growth in the United States," Lacker said.
In the fall of the Federal System leaders, these reductions were rejected.
The federal reserve system should focus on stability only during major crises, such as market abuse in 2008,” said Adam S. Pozen, former member of the Bank of England's Percentage Tax Committee.
The last panic and the close approach to this level, he said.
"Of course, you wouldn't want to be in a situation where you're afraid of growing rates because the markets are experiencing stress," said Posen, president of their World Economic Institute.
The Federal Reserve System Act has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and I do not think that they should be informed of the events until it is changed.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown.
The market/store will be opened in 1997 and belongs to LAX-C Inc.
It is often known as the Italian Costco, LAX-C, an optical Italian market, which also sells for the public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown, not in Taiwan.
The market/store is a store where you can buy all the time that offers the main environmental selection of fresh, frozen and dried products, popular Thai and Asian cuisine, kitchenware, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There's even a car department if you need to buy oil for the engine.
The store is huge, and it will take more time to read the whole series.
If shopping makes you hungry, buy food in LAX-C BBQ Express.
The Colinary Division in the store (good and bad) is located near the casino and offers various options for the output.
What is suggested: Something is necessary - what is acceptable - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Prices for goods are reasonable, and quite a lot of goods are sold out.
Fresh production includes delicate Asian and local Thai grasses, fruit and many others.
The catch is different as the catch crew cleans and separates the fish and even burns it for you, if you like.
A good part of the store is placed under an insatiable morozil unit, where you will find frozen leaves of carrots, hot tubs and galangals, pancakes, fish, meat, meat and vegetables, piglets, eggs, local colbasses, polyfabricates and many others.

Mr. Sergei Narishkin believes that the United States intends to destabilize the situation in the Middle East so that the wave of refugees can flee to Europe.
According to Interfax, he expressed this opinion to journalists in Ulan Battor during the annual session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I am not a side of conspiratoral theories, but the question is itself: is it not Europe the ultimate goal of those who in recent years have destabilized the situation in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East?" - he asked.
"It is a belief that someone has imagined and knew that the flows of refugees, these unhappy and oppressed people who survive death will be settled in the beneficiary countries of the EU," he added.
Narishkin wondered: "Did many European political leaders express themselves openly about the causes of this crisis, the wave of refugees that is now literally stalking their countries?"
"No, old Europe, with a rare exception, prefers to keep quiet," he concluded.
In Narishkin ' s view, NATO supports many European values and norms of international law.
"Europe, unfortunately, has already taken a long and unpredictably view and looks at how the NATO standard military swams and moral ideals and basic principles and norms of international law are being violated," he stressed.
Government forces and their lawful military formations are opposed to the mutiny of Islamists.
Later, the “Islamic State” terrorist group in Russia joined the opposition of the Syrian Government.
The United States dollar supports rebels who oppose Assad and IG.
The official Damascus considers such rebels to be terrorists.
The President of Syria called the unappreciative West of Russia.
The West's claims to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are in fact based on the fact that they are sovereign States.
This opinion was expressed by Syrian President Basar Assad in the interview of RT, the First Channel, Russia 24, the NTV, Russia today, the TASS, the Interfax and the Russian newspaper.
Assad said, the West did not accept partners and sovereign States.
In those countries, he would like to select one person and place one in the position of another who would act in the interests of the Western countries rather than in the interests of his family.
Assad drew attention to the sharp development of Western media with the beginning of Ukraine's transformation.
In his statement, Russian President Vladimir Putin “has turned from the other West into the enemy, the king, the dictator, who overcomes the Russian opposition that has come to power in a non-democratic manner, despite having been elected as a result of democratic elections recognised in the West”.
Putin called on the world community to unite forces with Assad to fight against the Islamic State.
Commenting on the Permanent Statements of the West that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the President would come to the authorities with the consent of the people through the elections, and if so, at the request of the people, rather than at the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva communiqué.
"If the people want him to stay, the president will stay, and otherwise he should leave immediately," he stressed.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and reminded them of their cooperation.
Syria is also fighting terrorism in conjunction with the neighbouring Iraq.
With regard to military support from Iran, the Syrian leader noted that the country supported the Syrian State in politics, economy and military affairs.
He denied that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tegeran's giving us military technology.
"Of course, there is a place for the exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been done," he explained.
With regard to the rest of the States, we are open to cooperation with any of them when there is a strong desire to fight terrorism.
"We do not see this in the case of a so-called anti-terrorist and anti-hygienic coalition, reported by the United States," Assad said.
The number of casualties exceeded 230 thousand, an estimated 11.5 million refugees.
Part of the territory was occupied by the terrorist group “Islamic State”, banned in Russia.
The international coalition, headed by the United States, is responsible for air damage from IG positions.

Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Policy: Peace: Lenta.ru
The United States Secretary-General, John Kerry, spoke on the phone with the Foreign Minister of Russia, Sergey Lavrov.
Reuters reports on this with reference to the representative of the Department of Justice, John Kirby.
It is noted that the theme of the session was a conflict in Syria.
However, Kiribati did not submit additional details.
In addition, he stated that the United States had tools for "the further isolation of Russia" if it would support Syria's President, Bashar Assad, transmitted the RIA News.
As reported by the Russian MID, Lavrov refocused on the need to create a single front to combat terrorist groups in the territory of the country.
There was also discussion on ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis that could reduce pressure on the Korean peninsula.
In addition, some issues of a bilateral nature were addressed.
Former U.S. officials stated that Russia had increased its military presence in Syria and expressed concern about strengthening Moscow ' s support for Asad.

Borodia called the information from the U.S. newspaper on Strelkov.
The former president of the Government of the so-called Dominican People ' s Republic of Alexander Borodia examined the information published in The Washington Post, U.S.A.
He said this in a telephone interview with the Lents.ru correspondent.
A note at Washington Post is beautiful that everything is turned clean.
The former Minister for the Defence of DNA, Igorya Strelkova, of course, was not connected and he "went out" with the territory of the Republic of Danube in a very modest manner, without a credit without three cash flows that were attributed to him by various personnel," he noted.
According to Bordoya, the story of the shooting in the interview with the U.S. reporter really went wrong.
"Yes, I said that Strelkova was urgently required to leave the territory of the people's Republic of Denmark," said the former head of the Government of the DNA.
Bordeaux stressed that he did not know why the American edition correspondent had decided to write that Strelkov was taken to the territory of Russia “connected”.
I suspect it's a provocation.
If this is not a cause, this is a surprising misunderstanding of words because I stressed that the Arrows had gone alone," Borodia noted.
"It's the key to me, and the arrow," he concluded.
Previously on The Washington Post, an article had been quoted by Bordoya as saying that he had brought the Arrow out of Russia in a forced manner.
According to this edition, Borodha noted that he had to contact his partner.
The Polish authorities started looking for a trip with a gold Nazi.
The Polish foresters began to cut trees over the underground tunnel, where, according to some data, they were traveling with the gold of the Third Reich.
The work began on Tuesday, September 15, Reuters reported.
According to military experts, forest clearance is necessary to verify the reliability of rail hearings with tanks.
There may be weapons and valuable minerals on the inside.
On 31 August, the Governor of the Polish Government of the Netherlands, Thomas Smolarz (Tomasz Smolarz), suggested that the new evidence of the existence of a gold voyage is beyond doubt.
However, the authorities decided to cover the search area.
Three days earlier, the Deputy Minister of Culture of Poland, Peter Jukhovski, stated that local explorers with “99 per cent probability” found the same trip with the gold of the Third Reich, mentioned in the legends.
Juhwski noted that if the assumptions were confirmed and the valuables were found, they would be owned by the State, while Russia would not be transferred.
In mid-August, two clients of the legal firm approached the authorities of the Polish town of Walbji with a message that they had found a trip to the frozen tunnel at a depth of 70 metres.
The main drug user of the RF proposed to prohibit the sale of tobacco to people up to 21.
Russia's main drug user proposed that tobacco be prohibited until 21 years of age.
Eugenia Brown noted that “any psychoactive substance — tobacco, alcohol, drugs — has been particularly harmful to this age.”
So he said in a direct effer of the Radio station, "Govorit Moscow", commenting on the fact that Svfeda Valentina Matwienko supported the idea of prohibiting the sale of alcohol to young people.
Man's creating an imbalance.
You've been serving in the army for 18 years, and you've been physically ready for that.
He has been mentally prepared for a full life in society since the age of 21.
"It is known from scientific data that the brain finally creates its biochemistry for only 21 years," Brown noted.
Former member of the Social Chamber and project leader Sultan Hamsaev reported to the Information, that Matvienko supported the initiative to increase the value of alcohol sales and "recorded, together with the Social Chamber, to raise this issue once again at the top of the House of Parliament".
According to the activist, a working group will soon be established in the Federal Council for the drafting of the bill under the leadership of Matvienko.
The Bible has been requested to verify the conformity of the Child Information Protection Act
Mr. Novosibirska called on the Regional Prosecutor to check the Bible in accordance with the federal law on the protection of children from information that affects their health and development, with a statement made on 16 September by the correspondent Sib. fm.
The author of the application stated that on 26 August 2015 he had acquired the Chinese City magazine in the Red Bible, published by the Russian Bible Society in 2013.
In the book, he discovered fragments that, in his view, violate the FZ "Protection of Children from Information That Affects Their Health and Development".
The statement was adopted on 16 September to consider the city of Novosibirsk.
The response to the treatment of the inhabitants of Novosibirska will take place within 30 days.
It's not too far to ban the book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, the complainant made a comment by Correspondence Sib.fm.
Moreover, this is a fundamental issue that will bring society to an end.
It will begin reading the Bible, which has not been done before.
The Brazilian Pediatric Union of Rio Grande promotes healthy food for breast-feeding
The Brazilian Pediatric Organization of the SPRS has developed a scandal that helps women to be convinced of the need for a full diet during breast-feeding: this means showing the images of young pregnant women described in the images of harmful food.
The milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates from which children receive all the nutrients they need to produce a strong immune system.
The high energy needs of pregnant and breast-feeding women are recommended to increase the daily calorie rate by about 500 calories per day.
However, recent studies have shown that one increase in calories is not the only change in diet that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, professor of health at the Beelor Medical College in Texas found that the health of pregnant women is particularly affected by the expression of gender in children and prevents their development of obeses.
Unfortunately, the adverse effect of ill-health on the immune system of the child has been identified.
A school bus was on its way to Hamburg.
Near Hamburg, the trip took place at a school bus that shot the train.
The 23-year-old driver, aware that he could not escape the train, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute later, they had an eye contact.
One of the students stopped him on the video.
Because of the emergency situation among the disciples, panic broke out.
Some children began to cry and run around.
The route is still blocked.
According to the police, no one was miraculously injured except one passenger who was injured.
An accident damage was estimated at 300 thousand euros.
Doctors call for a ban on the box.
The guidance of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) was to prohibit boxing in the country after the death of the local sportsman David Browne-young.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died from the trauma that he received in a match with the Philippinesman Carlo Magali.
One of the regional titles of the International Boxer Federation (IBF) in the weight category up to 57.15 kg last Friday was completed by the winner of the 12th round of Magali.
Brown fell into the hospital with brain injury.
His condition was considered critical, and he was attached to a life-sustaining device.
At the professional race, Brown won 22 victories, suffered two injuries, and one battle ended.
He's got two kids left.
This has already been the second case among Australian boxers in the past six months.
A 23-year-old student, Bradon Smith, died in March of the trauma at Ring.
AMA now recommends not to engage in this form of sport, but rather, from its point of view, to ban it at all.
I understand that this is happening indiscriminately, said Vice-President Steven Pernis.
However, as the box now exists, there will always be situations where a sportsman receives bleeding or brain injury, leading to death or serious injury.
For that reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure that combines practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Narishkin called on the PSO OBSE to abolish sanctions against the RF parliamentarians.
Mr. Spicer of the RF Sergei Narishkin called for the illegal introduction of sanctions against parliamentarians.
He said that, speaking at the PAS session in Ulan-Bator.
We appreciate this as unacceptable actions, such as the introduction of the value of parliamentary diplomacy.
“And this should not be repeated, because it is a manifestation of political intolerance and disregard for the principles of open international dialogue,” he said.
In addition, Narishkin invited the OASE participants to re-establish the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's get back to politics.
Let us return dialogue and the right to the practice of the international community.
Let's return humanitarian ideas to democratic peace order.
"The two ways never ended well," he said.
In a speech from the Parliamentary Assembly, the speaker of the Russian Assembly invited parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on the members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security challenges.
"Firstly, by resolving the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate call of our inter-parliamentary group," Narishkin said.
He also noted the need to give due attention to the OSCE.
"This is almost the only common area where they are still discussing how to adjust the situation in Ukraine," policy stressed.
Remember, the session of the Parliamentary Assembly was opened on Tuesday, 15 September, in Ulan Battor and extended until 18 September.
It's been a pleasure to win a couple of days.
The champion of peace in the light attic of Sergey Schubenkov.
This season can be referred to as a triumphal event for a 24-year-old bat from Barnaul Sergei Shubenkova.
It has managed to win at the European commander's command, to set up several records, and to become the world's champion, the first in history of the local barbaric press.
In addition, a sportsman has recently won the final stage of the Brilliant League, a third place in general.
The "New News" asked Shubenko to share his impressions from the coming season.
Sergey, is the season not over for you yet?
Yes, I am going to talk about World War Games that will be held in Korea in October, and then I will think about breathing.
True, I'm going to be home now in Barnaule, and being home is all the same.
It's easier than to fight for peace every week.
You said something that the sun is a favorite time of the year for you.
By the end of August, September began a wonderful time.
After the main start of the season, the burden of responsibility is gone.
You can be excited about the "depressive".
Plus, you know, I'll leave soon enough...
And there's a disability?
Anyway, the season is special, the mass of positive emotions...
The stability to the end of the season is always burning.
And it doesn't matter what he did more - he won or he won.
Every rehearsal is stress.
The constant flights, the journeys, all don't go unnoticed by the body.
You get up physically and emotionally.
But now I have emotions, of course, on the floor.
That's where I'm just happy!
When you finish the peace champions in Beijing, do you get back frequently?
It's alive.
Yeah, you reporters, don't let me forget that.
But in fact, I think that the evil sportsman who lives with the old wins is going through his successful escapes again and again.
It's been a pleasure to win a couple of days - and we have to move on.
Was the preparation of this remarkable season very different from the usual?
I can't say something like that was special.
We were ready to start in December, but I missed the winter season.
He started home in Barnaule, then at meetings, and then came home again.
It's just as usual.
But with the trainer, the task was to try to get to a new level that I had not yet been.
In practice, they spent most of their winter time setting the base.
They ran the cross-crazy, practiced public physical training, including heavy training, and attended, and we walked back and forth.
Then they were trained in barbaric training, and they took a lot of practice.
So, what do the opponents say, they followed?
I'm always trying to do this, and there's no problem in the Internet with this.
He saw a winter champion in Europe, and there in the barbaric press all five of them took the French!
I thought again: something has to be done, fun this company.
With every start in this season, you bought and acquired results.
Did that give you confidence?
I've got all the last seasons in the same scheme.
It's not like I ran into 13.20 and then it's 13.50.
I'm always cutting my shape gradually.
The main thing you wanted to do is to get out of 13 seconds.
All the work was directed primarily to this result.
But the paradox is that you feel like you're ready to move, but you're not always ready to show your readiness.
How was it, for example, on the Olympics in London?
I, if it's true, that semi-final escape (Shubens couldn't get to the end. - "NI") was trying to forget immediately.
It's been very good. I could really get out of 13 seconds.
Even if I were to repeat my best score at that moment, I would be a bronze player.
But it didn't.
Your first champion of peace remember?
How's it going?
It was in Taghu.
I really wanted to go to the finish, it was such a program.
And he went straight from the morning to the early hours of the morning.
Then he realized that beating his head and carrying a broken head meant that he would never escape.
After two years at the World Championships in Moscow, he's gone to the end with a better time.
I well remember my feelings before the decisive escape: I wanted to win the gold!
How can it be that, with the development of an adequate speed, it is possible not to lose the head yet, not to give up?
And here's the most difficult thing.
It needs to be very precise, focused on technology so as not to lose the barriers.
He noticed that when you're hurt, not by the result, but by the process, it's so much easier.
And the last time you feel like you're running away, you're getting yourself!
The truth is, it's worth it.
Many of our planes from the depths after the first major achievements are trying to move close to the capital.
There's never been such a thought?
It's better at home.
I don't even think I'm where I'm going without my coach, who do I need?
Maybe it'd be nice to have better conditions, but I'm trying to be content with what I have.
C Klews, you've been together for a long time?
At 12 years of age, from the time he came to a light airport.
I started training his wife, who worked with the children, and then she passed me on.
I started with the press, then in the long run, three.
The children's multiplicity was -- it was when they drew the sword, they pulled it out of the place...
In the 14th he tried to run with the barriers, and I liked it.
The first step was to comply with the second level of growth.
That's it.
There's never been fear in front of the bars?
It's been a while since we got to deal with them.
But there was always much work to do.
How much he suffered over one stroke!
But there's never going to be any children from this routine.
The technique has to get away all the time - so I can wake up at night, I'll get up right away and run through the bars.
Everyone who saw your escape in Beijing claims it was a very beautiful escape.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
I don't usually look at my escapes, but I couldn't stay here.
But we need to work more effectively - there are no limits to perfection.
Don't you fear now that victory by the Olympic Games will be on the shoulders of heavy cargo?
As they say, I try to be reasonable in my expectations.
Once you've chosen this road, it means you've got to go to the end.
My trainer likes to repeat: if you're not weak, no additional burden should be felt.
And I totally agree with him.
Old Kushanašvili
Well, I'm not so upset that I'm going to lose my reaction to an interview in Ukraine.
People are confused, I understand, their bread isn't raw.
And although I wasn't covered by the flag, at the same time, I spoke here a million times, and I didn't call anyone directly.
All of my psych friends are dead in a second where they're gone.
Presing, to whom I'm so strong, that I even look like a couple, I think people have grown up.
It's a joke, it's a joke, it's a joke, and it's a bunch of bullets, and it's gonna be all right.
But I need to know, I'm not a roommate, I'm a bitch, I'm a gouby, I'm an old man, I'm a kid, I'm afraid.
Another case is no support.
I don't have any illusions, but now...
I've always had the best self-sustainment, so taste it.
And giving passports like Fred Derst or Monson can only be made up.
I'd better be a better journalist, I'd be out of work.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanašvili described the Russian events as follows:
What they did with the Crimean Peninsula is a crime.
That's what they call annexia.
I believe that the reference to the undermining of the Crots has been made to sign something, in no way does it appear in the overall picture of human society.
It's like coming to the neighborhood and taking his apartment...
The war from Kremlin has gone, and it's only going to end there.
I'm practically 100% convinced that, as in the summer of 2008, it started with a call from a blind man from the Kremlin.
I have an idea who it might be...
Cobzon's not so much to live.
I don't understand, he's the greatest artist, why he needs to shake Putin's hands.
What, he's losing the apartment?
Well, get him a memory.
Of course, people remembered him as a disappointment to their little family.
And the reconciliation now depends only on Vladimira Vladimrovich.
Sunrise Seven leads in the ranking despite the attempts of the ninth to expose the defeat of leaders at Today Show
The withdrawal of Carla Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson in Canberra to inform the effect of the Liberal Party's statement on the release of the leader's seat was unable to strongly oppose the rating today.
The ninth show was broadcast from the capital of the state following the explosion of Malcolm Ternbull, Tony Ebbot.
The contest, Sunrise, led by David Kohm and Samantha Armitage, was launched in London in the weekly series of international communications, which also includes Dubai, New York, Nicaragua-Folles and Cancun.
This torture seems to have been of no importance to Australian television audiences, since Sunrise's audience was 397,000 viewers in the five largest cities compared to Today's. 339,000.
Today it took a little more than its rating on Monday (317,000) and on Tuesday (283,000), but its figures were lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today's been falling apart with Sunrise in recent months.
Today, there were 318,000 in August compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, there were between 40,000 and 50,000 conflicts.
By September Sunrise had 349 000 views against 314,000 today.
That's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change affect more than Parliament today, boys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the clarification!
Published on Monday, 14 September 2015.
An important news for the Seventh was the stirring debate of 800 Words from the former series of stars Packed to the Raffers Eric Thompson.
A new drama about the recently married father of the family, who decided to move to New Zealand along the border with his two children, gathered an audience of 1,219 million.
Critics have wondered if Tomson could deal with a popular show alone without the stars of Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
The result of yesterday night is a rough answer to yes.
The X Factor Seven remained in strong positions with 1,136 million viewers, easy to use The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726,000).
For the seventh, success and failure were mixed on the second night of Chase Australia.
The first half (from 17:00 to 17:30) of a new television set, which led by Andrew O'Kifi, gathered 446,000 viewers.
The second half (from 17:30 to 18:00) drew to 623 000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuarar (613 000).
On Monday evening, the first half of Chase Australia collected 520,000 spectators and the second half of the 720,000.
Hot Seat collected 620,000.
The fall of Chase Australia's ratings on the second night will make the ninth silence realize that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5.30.
Chase Australia is the replacement of the Million Dollar Minutes, which failed to replay MacGuara show.

Three finalists agree that "Holostak" Sam Wood is an ideal guy, but who will he choose?
The secret reveals?...
Lana Jeffon-Fellow, Sara Mackey and Snejana Marcoski may have been able to guess who's winning the "Holostjaka".
The woman with whom Sam Wood is finally staying in Holostake is surrounded by a secret.
And the three who come to the finish of the girl, of course, will keep the secret of one of them who was given his last breath.
But when we met Saro Mackey, the Snowy Markoski, and Lana Jeffons-Fellows on the day that the three girls were to be left two, they may have given an unexpected indication of the winner.
Sam Wood keeps the silence to the very end, which will be held in Thursday
All three women come in a ridiculous manner, explaining why Wood is an ideal man who is reminded of his sense of honor, diligence, family values, and viability as why each of them would be happy to be his satellite.
But in their answers to the question, "If you don't, who should get the last rose of the Wood?" they could hardly have shown who really had a heart attack "Holostaka".
Jason Fellouse and Marcoski no doubt called McKay the ideal couple for Wood.
From the first day on, Sarah and Sam had a good relationship.
"Since I've been a participant, I've felt the energy (Saray) and Sam's energy and understood that they are very suitable for each other, and during all the show there has been no doubt about it," Jason-Fellow said.
"Sara is a very open man, easy and happy with her," added Marcoski.
I saw them together, and there's really tension between them.
They feel beautiful and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks that Sam Wood and Sam will get a great deal of money.
McKay himself said that thanks to house witnessing last week, she realized that Wood might be the "man of the world".
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and relatives, I realized that it was not just a game - I trusted him with all my heart," she says.
The question of who should choose Voodoo, if not her, was answered with a bad answer.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I love both girls the same way, and Snejana and Lana deserve it equally.
Show The Bachelor leaves by midnight at 19.30 on Ten.

Gerard Heine had several options for starting a career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle took a keen interest in them after their move to the United States, as did many other clubs who sent applications after an impressive open day of training last year.
But Hein chose San Francisco 49ers and trainer Jim Tomsula, and it seemed to be a wise decision.
Some of the coaches would leave Heina on the back of the game for the rest of the sword lost, which the former Australian league player had allowed for the first return of the Panta in a winning game with Minnesoto with account 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in her game and gave Heina another chance to return the pen and also to play it after the tragedy of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula showed himself on the good side and after the game, in the dispersion.
Instead of putting the news to rest in the presence of the team, he subjugated them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Heina at the post-major press conference.
The Special Reporter of the 49er Club, Kam Inman, reported that Hein also received support from the coordinator of the special team, Thomas McGoy, who advised him to forget about the lost sword and think about the next game.
Jared Hein lost his sword on the back of a panta team of Minneso Vikings during the first quarter.
At the beginning of the debate in NHL Hein and his numerous Australian worshipers were obviously not counted.
It was seen that Hein was running out of the field after losing his sword, and he later told the leading show "Hamish and Andy" at the Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not present himself with a more successful start for a career in the NFL.
"That's the case, you're just thinking about the next game and everything," said Hahn.
Hein compared his failure to the debate in the Origin game series in 2007, when the cat blouse in his accounting area brought Quinsland to trial.
Finally, this experience was very useful for a 27-year-old game.

In 2003, Mikhail Hodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under the threat of the use of weapons at the Siberian airport.
Openly challenged by President Vladimir Putin, Hodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated, and his attempts to develop democracy were interrupted.
There have been contact with migrants at Hungary's border with the police.
Refugees have set up protests at Serbia's border near the Hungarian Reske population, which have grown in contact with law enforcement officials.
As a result, the Hungarian police used water and exhaust gas, Reuters transmitted.
Migrants are throwing police stones and attempting to strike the border on the border.
In response to aggressive acts by migrants and their attempts to violate the border, police are encouraged to support the meeting place.
According to the Agency France-Presse, refugees were able to flee through the police line, after which dozens of migrants had fled to Hungary.
Some refugees are leaving the Serbian-Vengerian border on the way to Belgrade and the Croatia border, reports Bi-bi-cy.
The authorities of the countries allowed migrants to arrive in the Croatian territory and ensure that they were transported from there to the country where they were needed.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On 15 September, the Hungarian Parliament violated the legislation on migration and border protection.
Amendments include the involvement of the military in the protection of the State, the criminal persecution of those who illegally cross the border, as well as the rapid procedure for examining asylum requests.
The Hungarian court has already recognized one migrant as guilty of an illegal crossing of the Hungarian-Serb border, for which he will be deported and will not be able to return to Hungary within one year.
The Hungarian Parliament is also planning to consider, in the near future, the transfer of the functions of the country's parliament to the Hungarian armed forces.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began construction of a 175-km-long fence along the border with Serbia to prevent the flow of migrants and refugees in the country.
The largest in the history of the United States cyberattack was recognized by the Russians.
The largest in U.S. cyberattack in history, Russian Vladimir Drinkman, admitted that more than 160 million credit cards were stolen, reports Reuters.
During the trial in the federal court, New Jersey Drinkman agreed in a speech to obtain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
At the meeting, the Russians discussed a discussion with three Russian citizens and Ukrainian citizens, who were accused of cyberattacks by 15 companies.
The total damage to the actions of the accused was estimated at $300 million.
"Effects such as Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to break our computer networks pose a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security," said U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman.
Drinkman was sentenced to 30 years in prison, as well as millions of dollars in taxes.
When sentenced, the court will take into account the recognition of Russia and may reduce its time.
The Drinkman Court declares on 15 January.
Vladimira Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At that time, another suspect, Dmitri Smiljane, was arrested.
His last guilt is denied in the crimes he has committed.
Kerry warned Lavrov about the risks with the support of Russia's Basar Assad regime.
During a telephone conversation with the head of the Russian media, Sergey Lavre, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, warned that Russia's support for Syrian President Basara Assada would increase the conflict in the country.
“The Secretary of State Kerry understood that Russia's support to President Asad is threatening to undermine and increase the conflict, as well as to undermine our common goal of combating extremism, unless we focus on seeking a solution to the conflict in Syria through effective political transition,” a communication published on the U.S. Department of Justice.
Kerry confirmed the commitment of the United States to combat the “Islamic State” group (which was banned in Russia by the Supreme Court) in a coalition of more than 60 States.
According to the secretary, Assad "can never be a trusted member" of the coalition.
Kerry also stressed during the telephone conversation that the conflict in Syria could only be resolved by political transition from Asada.
In the White House, Russia was threatened by isolation because of the support of the Assad regime.
The pressure of the White Secretary of the House of Joshua Ernest threatened Russia's isolation if it did not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest proposed joining the international coalition, which is carrying out an anti-terrorism operation against the Islamic State.
In recent times, the media have often reported the presence of Russian military personnel in the Syrian territory.
The head of the Russian media, Sergei Lavrov, stated that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and have helped the Syrians to acquire technology to use it against Islamists.
Four were killed when the police discovered the shooting of rabies by protestors in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when the police started shooting the renining bullets in the dust protesting against the proposed new constitution of the country, as the official environmental representative said.
Violence took place on Tuesday evening in the Rupanda district, about 175 miles west of Katmandu, capital of the country.
Basnu Prassad Dhakal, head of the district police, reported that more than 1,000 protesters were gathered in one of the police offices, some were throwing stones and shooting bombs.
Mr. Dhakal reported that the police had used the exhaust gas and then fired in the air before the gas was dropped.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is not surprising why rabies, who are known to be killed, but traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, have caused such high deaths.
This meeting was the last of several weeks of intense protests in the southern, northern part of Nepal, where the representatives of the Madazi people said that the new provinces formed under the new constitution would reduce their political influence.
The protests have also taken place in the west of Nepal, among the citizens of Taru, who want to have their own state.
At least 40 persons, including eleven police officers, have been killed in brutal attacks, beginning with 10
On August, when four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into the province, which was a decisive step towards a new constitution, it was a very controversial issue in Nepal, which had been centralized for several centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been under way since 2008, but legislators have accelerated the process following a devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted in favour of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and the officials said that the new chapter would be signed by the resurrection.
Sayansk plans to establish a business at 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest town in the Irkutsk area.
It was developed in the 1970s as a centre of the chemical industry, with a development of infrastructure that required systematic support.
A year ago, Sayansk led a new mayor - Oleg Borovski.
On the results of the first year of work, on new projects and prospects, he told the Correspondence of the Area.
Oleg Valerievic, why did you start working as a mayor?
First of all, I learned from the results of the audit of financial and household activities and initiated an independent audit of local budget expenditure.
The municipal property audit was then carried out.
One of the first practical steps has been the reduction of the dossier by five days.
Previously, bookstores had been able to walk for months.
Activities to improve the income base and optimisation of expenditure have been developed.
In November last year, a outstanding meeting of the Government was held in Sayansk, where issues of socio-economic development were discussed in the Territory.
There was no project-accounting documentation (PSD) in the city.
Without that, Sayansk could not participate in federal programmes.
We started training on roads, children's garden, North Canaling Collector and Water.
Road work in two locations is now underway.
How are the city implemented by the President of the RFC on the construction of children's gardens?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
Such positive demography has not been observed in the city for the past 27 years.
So the issue of the security of places in children's gardens today is one of the most relevant.
Since 1 September, children's capital repair No. 10, calculated at 320 locations, has been closed.
The estimated cost of repair is 86 million rubles.
He's never received any such funds in the city before.
Last year, after the repairs, the children's garden No. 23, which is now visited by 200 children, was opened.
The repair was made under regional and local budget funding, with more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the assistance of the local government, funds were sought for furniture and equipment, assistance and the National Initiatives programme.
There is a plan to start the construction of a new child garden in 2016.
With its introduction, we are planning to eliminate children from the age of six to three years.
We don't have rules for children from three to seven years of age.
Are investors interested in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city must, above all, be done by the Sayan enterprises, that is, they must be provided with work.
The 60-quarter house for orphans in the Leningrad micro-region is already under operation in October.
With regard to construction, I will add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of Priangarja, which has joined the economic-class housing programme.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 block sections will begin in the near future.
In all, we have declared the construction of 10,000 sq.m homes that wish to participate in the programme very much.
One of the conditions for housing must not be nearly 30,000 rubles per square metre, and this value is "under the key" section.
If we deal with these issues, we will continue to participate in the programme.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
In its time, the Sayan swine complex was built on its territory, which was sold in 2004.
We're working with the Attorney General to reverse this deal.
More than the land under the property is in federal property.
There is work with Moscow, the issue of the transfer of 88 g to the regional property, with the subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
He is a potential investor, ready to build and launch 1.5 billion rubles.
With a pig complex, we will have 900 jobs, which will become a great support for the city.
Is there a social partnership institution in Sayansk?
We have 140 social and economic partnerships.
A few projects have been successfully implemented through the active social position of business representatives.
They provide sensitive support to enterprises such as the "Wost-Centre", the New ZIM, OO "Sayan Broller", OOC, the leadership of these companies is rejected for all treatment.
Directly to the City of OO 'Sayan Broiler', the city of the child city was awarded, and the East-Centre company had repaired a horse court where experts were dealing with children with hypateries, spending more than 1 million rubles on it.
Thanks to sponsors, the territory of the city of ZAGSA has been well established.
The sponsors helped to mark the city's day.
As in the old days, there was a meeting of city collectors and organizations.
The city airport, the book of Sayan poets, was released.
The first builders and the people who have made a serious contribution to Sayanska's development have been subjected to jubilee medals.
The mexicans also participate in the work of the City Welfare Fund.
The first step was to acquire tools for young talented musicians.
In nine months, more than 800 thousand rubles were directed to support talented children, to help children in need of expensive treatment, to support children from small-scale families.
How are the social problems addressed in Sayansk?
The city doesn't catch doctors and pedagogists.
The provision of housing professionals is of great importance to the decision-making process.
In the past year, we had five doctoral wards, four pedagogues in the office.
We are working on a housing program with the possibility of privatizing it over five years.
The plans include the replanning of the building, which will build another eight bedrooms for the pedagogues.
Teachers and doctors are also participating in the "Jilla for the Russian Family".
In the future, the building of a house for budget staff.
Most importantly, there is a workable team in the city, with which I can deal with the most complex issues.
It is important to make the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not cease.
The potential in Sayanska and our region is great.
A draft law on the indexation of pensions was introduced in the mind of increasing prices.
A draft legislation for indexing social pensions has been introduced to the Lord from 1 February each year, taking into account price increases.
The author of the document, a member of the Justice of Russia, also proposes an additional index of pensions on 1 April, if the rate of growth of the living minimum exceeds the rate of increase in the price of goods and services.
The index of pensions, in accordance with the current legislation, shall be produced annually from 1 April, taking into account the rate of growth of the pensioner's living minimum in the RFF for the past year.
The bill introduced in the House below provides for the introduction of social pension indexation, taking into account the rate of growth in consumer prices.
The first index is transferred to 1 February and the second to 1 April.
The Head of the PAOBSE declared Mogerini not to impose sanctions on parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the High Representative of the European Union on Foreign Affairs, Federique Mogerini Spiccher PA OBSE Ilcka Kanerva stated that sanctions against legislators participating in the activities of the Assembly would not be allowed.
The journalists were informed by a member of the Russian delegation at the annual session of the PA OSCE in Ulan Batoré Nicolai Kovalev.
According to the TAS, the position of Canerva was supported by the signatures of European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Greece.
"There has already been enough support," Kovalev said.
He had previously stated that the Head of the OSCE had expressed his intention to collect the signatures of MPs, which indicated the inadmissibility of the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians.
In particular, Kovalev, Kanerva promised to address the problem at the level of the EU's leadership structures and to “send the request”.
NHC reports that the probability of a cyclone to the south of the Isle of Green Mass is 60 per cent
The narrow front of the low-pressure area, approximately 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern end of the Green Sea, is likely to be 60 per cent of the conversion to a tropical cycle over the next 48 hours, reported on Tuesday at the National Urban Centre of the United States.
Another clear area of low pressure is about the middle of the Green Isles and the Small Antillean Islands, which is also 60 per cent likely to form a tropical cycle in the next two days, reports the Mayo sympathies.
Google is launching a double-supply campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced the launch of a double bid to collect 11 million dollars for humanitarian organizations helping refugees from war-distorted and united countries.
Google has used a non-characterized personal approach, advertising a campaign to collect donations in its blogs.
Instead of making a statement by one of the leaders, Google Rita Masud, a member of the family who had fled from Kabul when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
"We got on suspicious journeys and buses, we're suffering hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I got it.
But as the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has intensified, many people like my family desperately need help.
The contributions will be made to four non-commercial organizations dealing with refugees and migrants: "Flights Without Borders", the International Committee of Rescue, the Organization of Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that it would double the first $5.5 million donations until the amount on google.com/refugeelief would reach $11 million.
Europe is faced with the strongest refugee crisis since the Second World War, caused by most of the four-year civil war in Syria, resulting in more than 4 million people being displaced this year.
Many also flee from the armed conflicts of Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetes with low age may help surgery
The beneficial effect of post-nutrition surgery in patients with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years, according to the new study.
However, it is still early to claim that diabetics with low age live longer after surgery than those receiving non-surgery treatment.
"The statistics of death have not yet been shown," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on ovarian surgery, who wrote about a new study in the column of editor JAMA Surgery.
The surgery of ovarian surgery, or baritarian surgery, uses various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the sense of hunger and limit the ability of the organisms to eat.
In a few years, baritarian surgery has demonstrated its effectiveness in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but major studies have been carried out among people with a morbidity with a body mass index (IMT) 35 or above.
IMT, the weight of growth, is considered normal from 18.5 to 24.9.
IMT 25 or above refers to human beings as being outlawed, and more than 30 people with IMTs are considered to be adults.
You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study from the Taiwanian Min-Sheng General hospital, the data collected since 2007 were used to compare two types of bariartic surgery, such as cold and handy gastrointestinal disorders, with type 2 diabetes treatment in people with low age.
The IMT's average participation in the study of those who have been involved in surgery was from 31 to 24.5 at the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, IMT in those who received non-surgery treatment from diabetes remains approximately 29.
Among those who carried out the operation, 36 per cent were treated entirely from diabetes and 28 per cent.
In the drug treatment group, only 1 per cent of total diabetes treatment was observed and approximately 2 per cent was partially.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad” LPNP cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group”, the authors said.
Researchers have also controlled blood haemoglobin levels of A1s that reflect blood sugar levels in the dynamics.
Gemglobin A1c better maintain less than 7%, says researchers.
After surgery, the mean haemoglobin level of A1c decreased from approximately 9 per cent to about 6 per cent.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, approximately 8 per cent.
However, the best GHG monitoring indicators reflected by the good levels of A1c haemoglobin did not reduce the mortality rate in five years, according to Dr. Chi-Cheng Su and his colleague.
The study group also compared the mean results of two types of surgical treatment.
In the fifth year, compared to the group with the semi-manufacturer, the group lost more weight (18.7 kg against 14.2 kg), increased IMT (7.4 against 5.1) and A1s (3.1 per cent against 2.1 per cent), and was closer to the total remission of diabetes (46.9 per cent against 16.7%).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of the surgical method in part of life after five years, there is evidence that the study of people with excessive body mass in Sweden actually leads to an increase in life expectancy, as reported by Blackstone of the College of Medicine at Finix, University of Arizona.
According to the Swedish study for people with ageing who had chosen a baritarian intervention, the risk of death for 15 years was approximately 29 per cent lower than the group in which more traditional methods were used.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that it had addressed fewer than 35 IMT people involved in this process.
“The report is very important here because it claims that such surgical intervention is safe in a low IMT group where there is no increased risk of death or early illness,” she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should be seriously involved in weight as long as the IMT of the patient falls in range from 27 to 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long to let people take this seriously," she said.
It seems to me that as soon as they dig up the genetic changes that are taking place in their bodies of age and diabetes, it is very difficult to turn it back.
In Mutish, the kidnappers brought nine million rubles out of the house.
In Mutish, the kidnappers attacked the people of the underground house and stole 9 million rubles and three women's shoes.
The Interfax informs about this with reference to the press service of the MDG RF.
The incident happened on Tuesday morning.
Two strangers, through the open door, entered the house on the street of Gork, joined a 20-year-old boy at home and, threatening both legs, killed 9 million rubles and three rubles.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million 265,000 rubles, a criminal offence under the “Rasboy”.
Fans in Europe are at risk of being homeless.
Only 23 Petersburg hotels have the right to accommodate tourists who will come to see the World Football Championship in 2018.
The rest of the guests have not yet been able to obtain the appropriate permission.
Experts believe that this is a very disturbing sign.
In the face of the world's premise, authorities will have to imagine how to expel all guests of the city.
"Rosbalta" believes that the cost of renting the dry rooms will rise to 10-30 per cent, and after the dry-house champion will have to pay.
The Football World Championship has forced the authorities to pay attention to the status of Russian guests.
According to the law written in particular under the preamble, each Peterburg hotel must carry out a classification procedure and prove that the declared number of stars and service levels are consistent.
It is now understandable that not everyone can do this: the furnaces are so frightened that they are often not even sending documents at the request of the Federal Anti-Fraud Service in Petersburg.
As UFAS Head Vadim Vladimirov said, the department has studied 138 hotels and is now planning 34 cases with the host, many of whom simply did not respond to anti-immopolitors.
There are signs that the leadership of three dozen companies has been deceptively misleading by placing some of the stars in the advertisement, Vladimirov noted.
The problem is that, on account of each number, no one can lose before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football champion, the patients will take over all the Petersburg wards.
Tourists can now calculate 30.5 thousand numbers in the city.
According to Smolno, in Peterburg 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotel, 100-two-and-three-one-star, 550-star.
According to the first Deputy Committee on Tourism Development, Nana Gwichii, there were only 23 hotels at the moment, so many checks were carried out by Peterburg.
And here, if a hotel has ordered such a procedure in regional enterprises, the situation is unknown.
There may be more to the previous classification, but no one knows about it.
"The last six years have not been much sought for classification," recognized the Director of the North-West Office of the Russian Federation of the Ekaterin Shadskaya Tourism Industry.
This is due to a high season in which customers earn more money and do not want to engage in other activities.
Another reason is that the budgets did not include audit costs, which could cover the hotel, depending on the status of 30 to 100 thousand rubles and more.
In recent times, however, hotel managers have been active and have applied for classification, Chadskaya has confirmed.
Otters must succeed until 1 July 2016, otherwise they will not only pay taxes, but still not have the right to work at the world champions.
It is already known that depending on the star, a fixed number fee will be set at the hotel during the tournament.
The formulas to be calculated will be published in the following year.
This is done to prevent price reductions of 200-300 per cent, as is the case, during the Petersburg Economic Forum.
We need to have a conscience and do not let it grow twice, but we need to let the departures work.
"I think growth will be up to 50%," explained President Gennadi Lamshin of the Russian hospitality association.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov is not convinced that price fixing is in line with the understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how much is involved in economic theory, but I hope this measure is justified.
"That's the best unsatisfied journey," he said.
I don't know what's going to happen to popular girls' hostels.
Members of the Lord have introduced a bill that prohibits hotels in homes.
We are confident that this law will not be passed or that it will not apply to Petersburg.
"We will stop the point of view that hotels should be kept," Nana Guachi believes.
However, she said that the owners of the Ministries should be prepared to break the Housing Code in any case.
If the Lord approves the draft legislation, about 80 per cent of the guests are closed in Petersburg, and at this point there are 1.5 thousand numbers.
According to the President of the Federation of Restaurants and Otters of the North West Leonida Garbara, there are no two-star and three-star hotels in Petersburg that once and for all have been trained by football patients, so there is a crossing on the side of the hotel with four and five stars.
The situation is similar when “75,000 pipes sit in the 80th millennium stage”.
This can be fixed as a time for mini-tattles.
Their possible prohibition, the expert says, "Idiotism," "I think it's weird that some people can live in the rooms, and that's why they can't come here."
If the hotel is used as a community, I agree it's wrong.
But if you're like a hotel where guests arrive for a short time, why don't you?
Ministries are at risk of losing the World Football Championship and because of their lack of space.
Hundreds of small hotels simply fail to pass the classification, causing it to grow on its own.
By the summer of 2016, all the city's guests will be ordered to work.
"Companys that can carry out this procedure not so much, so they will reject less paid orders from the mine, and will choose those who travel," said Gennadi Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, for example, Moscow and Volgograd, there have been a significant increase in the number of polls carried out at the moment.
The cause of the Petersburg delay is linked to the constant suspension in the Government ' s tourist block, which does not contribute to the smooth work.
Experts believe that, if all of the Petersburg hotels are not aware of the need to pay attention to the local hotels and the house of rest.
For example, the 300-year-old Peterburg can mobilize a river fleet, so there are tourists who can live in the city.
In addition, many patients are prepared to arrive at the train stations in which they can stay overnight.
"The main thing is not to make so many guests that they'll leave later," said Gennadi Lamshin.
A large population will also be used during the football race.
The most likely place in the city will be to create a reserve of private rooms.
Retirement rates will rise by 10-30%.
"It is obvious that the first to go to live near the stadium," noted a specialist at the Agency for Development and Research in the Inability of Larissa Bragina.
Thus, rent prices may not return to the previous level after the campaign, especially in sleeping areas.
This will also contribute to the construction of new transport connections in the city's districts, she stressed.
It is also worth noting the human qualities of the bourgeois.
For example, Leonid Garbar was convinced that Peterburg was always a hospitable town where people were not just talking about the road, but could still make a mini-currency trip.
There's a problem.
My dad met a family from Murmanska in the 1970s, a father, a mother, and two children.
Some nights they found it difficult to sleep with the guests, so they had to sleep on the floor.
"And the pope brought them to our communiqué to sleep," said the fellow.
True, he added that the city’s inhabitants are now not left without such an impact on their home.
But may the mistakes of the Lord, the mistakes of the hotel and governments have to be remembered in 2018?
Girinov's "sil" Amurian area.
He was excited to see the ceremony at the Lord's Evening Meal.
He did such things when our generation had just learned to trade newspapers, and so far it is in a beautiful form.
The theme of the statement, of course, is "LDR protest against the results of the elections in the Amorian region".
Protocols do not bother - because they are something; other protocols, except signed elections, in the LDR, the judge at all, no.
Here he takes up his second place, 'Iwana, 'Abram!' and cries out: 'You are the winner of the elections!'
And here's nothing to mention about Rodney, and then, after the fires with the president, he's introduced a fraction from the conference room, literally, "You're all with the fronts of your balls and doors."
Press, of course, focuses not on Abramov, but on the scandal and demarcation of the factions as a result of this scandal and harassment.
The real Wolfowic was beautiful and elegantly beautiful to the Amurian region along with Abram.
For the whole country, this is a regular outcome of the "Podonics" style, but not a political party protest against the results of specific elections.
And the group formally urged, and the elections, if you believe the party site and the Facebook page of Ivan Abramov, are not recognized, but the leader is obviously coming down.
She presents the dead to Amura herself to protect her dead, and she herself is blessing against the "One Russia" in general and in no way worthy of the family.
An excellent decision not to lose a person, and in the present and not shown scandal, don't go.
Another case is that Abram himself is now in a strange situation.
In addition to his departure from the government, he did not expect anything, and he did not have alternative protocols on his hands.
It is not in public attention, on the one hand, and on the other hand, for the narrow circle, it has become a formal cause and a source of frustration for a respected champion, and that it is also a circle of domestic emissions to the E.R. and UNF.
And here, of course, he needs to think seriously about what to do.
Because of the main benefit of the elections, policy number 2 of the region and candidate number 1 in the single area, it can be converted into a money that has successfully been used by its own party leader and super-exploiter for the UNF itself and foreign party leadership.
This is not the case with Jirinov, it should be considered and closely monitored.
It's still growing and growing before him.
The news was that the LDR would return to the hall during the next plenary.
It's a bathroom that we've never had before.
Only Abram's subject was buried.
It's really beautiful.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe."
Europe cannot accept all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for the end of violence in refugee countries.
The question of the continuing refugee crisis was raised at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Cooperation in Oxford, on ethics studies, at the beginning of its 10-day visit to Great Britain.
He stated that, in existing circumstances, the interests of mankind should be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, although this was a source of excitement, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was not adequate.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he noted in his own words.
Dalia Lama, while highly critical of the actions taken by Germany and Austria in connection with the crisis, stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"The concern of thousands of refugees is great, but at the same time you must think about long-term decisions, such as to bring this world and this development, mainly through education, in these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we must think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
With regard to violence, Dalia-Lam also commented on George Bush's actions after terrorist acts 9/11, stating that the United States had launched a series of controlled incidents.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in the letter to President Bush and told him that the solution could be through non-violent efforts.
I know that his intentions were good, but he used force, and that led to unexpected consequences," Dalia-Lam said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have been exposed to hand-extinguishing equipment for the past 4 years
Toxicological centres in the United States reported an increase of almost 400 per cent since 2010, the number of children under 12 years of age who have been exposed to a high respiratory tract, as reported by the Tokyo Centre of Georgia.
According to Dr. Haylord Lopez, director of the state of Georgia’s toxicological centre, cases of children under 12 years of hand-disinfecting fluids reported in toxicological centers increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
“Children have more contact with these substances, and unfortunately some percentage of them are sent to the emergency office,” said Lopes CNN.
He said that some children were drinking out of liquidity, and some were doing it to impress their friends or to argue for social networks.
The videos on Youtube show that adolescents drink the defining fluid as a drink.
Adolescents are reported to have mixed the disincentive fluid with alcohol-containing fluids to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted by the sweet smell of liquid.
"The kid doesn't think it can hurt him," Lopes reported.
Many of the most attractive (designated hand liquids) are those that are flavoured.
There are dissipating fluids for hands with the scent of a club, a vineyard, an orange, which is very attractive for children.
The disinfecting fluid for hand contains from 45 to 95 per cent of breath.
Young children, in particular, may be exposed to alcohol abuse by a few abortions.
"It's a high concentration drink," said Fox 4 in Kansas City Dr. Steven Thornton, chief doctor of the toxicological center at Kansas University Hospital.
You wouldn't just leave a bottle of whiskey, but people would keep these disinfectives for their hands, and if children get to them, it's a quick way to use a lot of alcohol.
Naiza Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently gave birth to a hand-drawn arm with a club room in about four floors, was sent to a quick relief office.
The level of alcohol in her blood was 179 times more than that of an adult who is legally considered to be in the state of alcohol abuse, according to Dr. Chris Ritchi, a medical doctor who has treated her in the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
I tried hard to keep my word and couldn't go when she was sent to the office of emergency assistance.
The doctors watched her all night in a separate child clinic so that she would not miss any signs of brain trauma, as the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol.
"It was very scary," said the CNN Order of Scott, mother of Naige.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-smokers or disinfectants, in addition to cutting off desensitized fluids for children's reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant fluids are linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after passing the disinfectant containing a toxic unexploded ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol as a deadly agent rather than an ethyl alcohol, which was indicated as an active substance.
In January, three fourth-class students in northern New York spoke to disarm their "opposite" teacher by "spreading antibacterial substances in the classroom", according to the police report.
The teacher had a strong allergy on the hands of the disinfectors, and she refused to hold them in her class.
The police consider the failure of the plan to be a “free talk” and address the issues of discipline in the school area.
As the oldest child library in Barnaule became a family club.
On the back of the boots into their outer child library, N.K. Crusoe's chest was a strange shade.
The kids who come after the books are trying to fix it with the confectionery.
A number of generations have already been in this library for 95 years.
The first readers of the 20th century were the first to have read aloud here, placed shows in the words of Micah, conducted literature victors, and reregistered with Lenin.
The census continued for four years, and, as wrote in 1939 in the newspaper "Union Stalinez", with each day the “friendship between the Hope of the Constantinuary Krupenary and Friends of the Child Library of the City of Barnauła” became ever stronger.
Hope Constantinov even once sent his childhood photo to a distant Barnival friend.
And when the Barnaulists asked if it was not against Hope Constantinov that the library would adopt her name, she wrote that it was not.
The letter was long burned at the museum, and first - century readers had to explain that it was a serious profile that attracted the library building.
In the years of the reconstruction, people often called on different ones and wondered, ‘ Why is the child’s library not changed? ’
Let the library be the name of a good child writer without a political beauty!
The library staff moved, thought, and decided to leave everything as it was.
"Brussels" is, please, the most famous and beloved library in Barnaule, like "Lenka" in Moscow.
On the ground in the library is a road from a burning bush.
"The Wall of the Injurious City" is a favorite subject of artist Ollie Moscow.
Earlier, Ola was the manager of the legal firm, came to work at eight, went to five, and was only the love of the rest of the managers.
And then there was an announcement on the Internet: "Illustrator for books."
The book was written by a little American girl, and it was called "My Cancer Mommy" - "My mom's cancer."
Ola did an illustration, and she thought: Life can end at any time, and no wonder there will be no miracle in it unless you create them yourself.
Now she works in the library, pictures the children’s books from all over the world, and begins talking.
Traditionally, children seem to be losing interest in the book that they live in some virtual space...
But to us children are reading, and their parents understand the importance of reading, the director of the library of Tatian Kushvid.
In recent years, we've even had such a moment of confidence that a child library is needed, and it's going to live - kids come here!
I think I'm interested in reading back.
The library looks at a large exhibition with an updated photo exhibition.
On one occasion, new photos of readers were taken to the library of the entire family — Mom, Dad, and the children.
The library is happy that the popes have become increasingly involved with the children.
If the child has been reading all the Chukovo in two years, he needs more books at an older age.
But now the law prohibits the eight-year-old Underground to issue books from category 12+.
In order to obtain such a book, the child must bring it to his parents - they come back, then they return, and gradually they become some kind of family club.
In the library there is a treasure - a self-evolutionary collection that has been with eggs and vegetables, to bring Corolenko into the annex to the magazine "Niva", the 1936 "Murzilka" subpoena.
Now we are not just the conceptual space of the Temple of the Book, we are now open to movement, we are trying to be a special place: not home, not work, not school, explains Tatian Kushvid.
We can come together to respect, play, dance.
We've made a game area for the little ones. The kids just have to play, and the arm is turning to the book!
Some of our parents wear clothes and they don't want to go.
Mothers often come with bicycles - and we're glad that they put the library first among all the other places that have to come with the little ones.
Tatiana Kushvid says: Modern children like us sometimes like classic children's literature:
“The challenge is now being developed, and many attention is given to authors who are related to generations.”
And when talking about little kids, it's important for them to be some hero who travels from one book to the other.
Children don't want to leave with their heroes.
The library regularly publishes books for parents that discuss what is happening in the children’s literature today, which books should be focused on and why.
The booklets are so attractive and interesting that adults are interested, but this library is not for them at all.
The delivery of books outside the reading room is prohibited by adults.
It's just a child's privilege.
...In the next room, the library has a square hole with an old wooden garden in the basement, in the library.
The stairs will be hidden under your steps - it's a very old time machine.
With the book of your childhood, you're meeting with old friends. Hello, well, we don't change.
Ellie's still on the way, with the warm chirp, the Tola Rizikov tapes are burning the bells, and Malchiš-Kibalchiš has not told the cursed troops of the Army of China - that's what he has to say.
Books like passwords, you can get to know them everywhere.
There are in the warehouses and these books -- for example, the evolutionary collection was made with eggs and vegetables.
Or send the Royalenko in an annex to the "Niva" magazine.
Or "Murzilki" backup in 1936.
When the pages were old, they were beautiful in the blue.
This publication is not for sale.
It's because of our future collection, I'm all dreaming I'm going to get a pension and take a lot of kids' books.
But kids don't act like that anymore, and the beauty in the old books isn't very bright, and the themes... you're opening the first page, and there's Lenin, the party, the cosmos.
Now it says, "Why did we all write this "Pionary Truth"?
But it was equally interesting to tell the Russian Planet Galina Ilasova, who led the library.
"Murzilki" pages have been late for years.
Galina Vassilievna's got the bookstore all her life.
She knows what color ball in Buratheno, what year of training Harry Potter became the captain of Griffindora's team at the speedy champions, where Carlson uses the speaker for the bike, and who works for the father of Alice Selesne.
The library pays little, and everyone who can live without these books is very quick to find another profession.
Only the most reliable are the educators, the pedagogues, the cultists of the book.
They can still be known for their sweetness - it is thought to be the professional character of a child librarian.
If he kissed you in the first minute of the conversation, it's professional.
I really like the children's books: I like them to be in order to stand up and beautiful on the floor, and I still love to read them, says Galina Vassilievna.
I read everything: military, historical behavior, stories, fantasy.
Reading modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think my childhood was all different.
The books were the most interesting and fascinating of all that happened to me then.
And since I loved them for no reason, I was told that the library is a garbage dump.
And I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.
I hope the books will always be, despite the leadership.
And I'm glad when our former readers bring children and grandchildren...
Listen to me: There's no difference in Seltic
Griffiths examined the differences in Seltique after Dale admitted that Hoops was in a bad condition, but he'll fix it.
Harts will protest against the claims of the Scottish Football Association to Nelson, and Warberton is afraid of signing contracts in January that might violate the unity of the team.
Dons has increased the advantage of Seltic up to five points.
The Adam Runi Penalty in the first team gave Aberdeen a little advantage over Gamilton in Pittodra, which allowed Dons to get rid of Seltic for five o'clock.
Griffiths to monitor divergent discussions
This led to hearing of differences in Selticke, which were cut off by Griffiths, who said that he and his teammates were not suffering from any stronger criticism, preparing to meet with the Dutch League leaders.
I don't think we feel tense, I think his toys are trying.
The Dutch are cute because the Scottish don't fight for the title-de-Bur
The former Rangers semi-protector and former member of the Dutch congregation, Ronald de Burr, said that Dutch football patients had lost interest in Seltic because he did not meet the title of the Rangers.
De Bur, currently a representative of the Aixes, said: "In the Netherlands, the most exciting moments of the Seltic game are no longer indicated, and why?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
People here are not just talking about the return of Rangers.
They're talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what interests them.
The Old Company games are very exciting, and not only people in Scotland want to see these games.
"I'll change everything," said Dale.
Ronny Dale admitted that Seltic was in trouble, but the Norwegian coach was trying to change everything.
According to Malmyo and, as a result, the League of Champions soon followed the 10 footballers Aberdina, who are now on the top of the table for five o'clock.
However, Dale said, "In "Celite" there were bad times and earlier, and we'll get out again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I understand it's very boring, and there's no people very, very bad or upset about what's going on.
And so do we, but we have to keep going.
And we really need Seltic support because this game is getting much better.
Staying together now is so important.
Warberton with Unbelievably Waiting for January's Transfers
Despite the views expressed a couple of weeks ago, assuming that he had identified some of the objectives of the January transfers, the Ranger boss Mark Warberton was untrustworthy about the January campaign, claiming that he did not want to destroy the unity of the team.
The former attacker, Brandford, said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
As for games coming in summer, you have a period before the beginning of the season to adapt to what you have seen in our own group in this season.
The command works really well.
Sometimes it is more harmful to add unnecessary toys to what you really need.
A mouse who's interested in Seltik, he's focused on completing his career.
The attacker Sunsey Micha, associated with Seltic during the transfer window, pointed out that he could leave the football after the end of his contract with Lebedia.
A 29-year-old player suffered from a two-year boating problem and could not leave Wales this summer.
Harts is going to oppose SFA for Nelson's statements.
"Harts" said with account 2:1 when they removed Patterson, and started playing 3:2, but the protective red card was rejected later; it was the third red card Colum, cancelled in eight months.
Nelson does not deny his words, claiming: "I have not raised doubts about ethics, I have not commented on the game."
Griffiths tried to escape the Tanks.
The direct player of the Hybernian team received an answer after he admitted that he had sung a song with a lamentable word about the former player, Harts, Rudy Skacell.
The incident took place in the village of Roseburn, Edinburgh, before the beginning of the Edinburgh Debt in Tennessee in March 2014.
"It was a pig, and it was hot," said the attacker, adding, "I can't say with confidence that I wasn't going back to the tank if he wasn't playing "Seltik."
Donnelly: Tannadis Council is confident in the "Daddy United" management
Simon Donnelly argues that the Board of Directors of the Danish United States is still convinced that the management team will change the situation better, but it is agreed that the deterioration of the situation in the field should be over.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We're going to get the kids out again," Donnelly said.
Macinez is glad that he won "unbelievably" in Hamilton.
Derek McKinness acknowledged that his command "Aberdin" had come unexpectedly to fight Hamilton Assisis to win the seventh victory in the premise of the League, which placed them at five o'clock above Seltica, above the tournament table, thanks to Adam Runi's first panel.
McInness said, "There's no team here that's gonna win something like a dope, or they're campaigning a lion who didn't win a meeting like that."
The unemployment rate among the Scottish population has not changed, while it is growing in the United Kingdom as a whole
UNTAET in Scotland remained at the level of 164,000 persons for the period from May to July, while the total number of unemployed in the United Kingdom increased from 10,000 to 1.82 million for the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9 per cent, was above the United Kingdom by 5.5 per cent, as shown by the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell to 12,000 people in three months, while the number of workers is now 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland has decreased to 74.0%, above average in 73.5 per cent in the United Kingdom.
Minister for Scotland David Mandell, commenting on the latest figures, noted: "The Government's long-term plan laid the foundation for strengthening the economy."
Almost a year has passed since Scotland decided to remain in the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the labour market in Scotland in terms of employment growth and unemployment reduction.
Why I'm a witness to the murder in Oklahoma.
Today, apart from legal interference at a later stage, I will see how human beings are being punished.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in a prison cell in Oklahoma, where Richard Glossip will be punished with a fatal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
The first request was made in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
About that day, I became afraid.
Why do you do that?
I agreed, as I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed story of the death penalty.
This would offer a unique race.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend the U.S. executions, and since those who want more than a place, the results of the dark lotteries decide who will be elected.
In Oklahoma, the number of press places has decreased from 12 to five.
Whoever was chosen, he'll look at it with no emotion.
I can't do this.
I'll sit with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and we'll have our own relationship with him after a few months of phone calls and a visit of two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims that I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed to take a block and a hand to write what I see.
I must try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of being rude to me on Twitter.
It's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he likes to get access.
I'm sorry about her.
She admitted that she could "be better-formed" herself, but she still thinks I'm wrong about what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip didn't agree with what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he said it.
I told him he could pull me out of his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international edition journalist to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that greed will help to eliminate the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, a reporter from Haffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the suggestions I have written.
I won't be able to enter here in detail again.
I can't say with confidence that Richard Glossip is not guilty.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treize made him guilty of a crime.
But I believe there is a greater likelihood that he is not responsible for murder.
I am firmly convinced that the death penalty was not enough.
I think his punishment is wrong.
And from this race, I'll see how he's gonna die.
I can't say I'm going to be completely objective.
There will be other reporters to which you can turn.
From me you know what it's like to see how a person I love dies without need.
Follow-up police have negotiated elections from the Canning River
The Canning-Wilt town complex has been able to negotiate man to choose from the Canning River and to remain dry.
The officer of the police intended to leave the police, but did not suspect, he stopped in the cold water in a few yards from the police officer trying to "be able to get him out of the beach".
The Kanning Weila police were called on Tuesday because of the illegal invasion of the foreign territory in Buckingham.
When the police noticed the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by breaking into Canning.
But he didn't go far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I'm not going out, let's get me,' said senior Sergeant Chandall Casldian.
The Constituent of Laklan Perhavez did not want to make the shape difficult, so he used a more secure approach - "professive police talks".
"Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape," said senior Sergeant Casledian.
The football champion Ben Kazins just remembered that.
In 2006, Kazins went to Kuwait to avoid meetings with the police patrol to check on alcohol and tried to cross the Sudan.
His efforts have been futile, but the locals have been forced to steal the baton of Ben Kazins.
Peter Mudy accuses the soldiers of trying to spy and threatens to get out of the horse race.
Peter Mudi accused the Stairs of Racing Victoria of trying to put a spy into his horseyard last year and threatened to leave the horse sport immediately.
His mission had become friends and staff of the Racing Victoria ethics department, which he accused of having organized a campaign against him personally, and the removal of Lady Tatai from the start because of a violation of the rules of use of medicinal products on the day of the start, in the middle, was the last member.
Mudi informed Fairfax Media that he was always making every effort to participate in the jumps, and he was in a difficult situation when it came to the positive outcome of the Leader's attempt on the cobalt, which he could not explain.
He kept the language about suspicions in spying for a year and didn't want it to look like a green vineyard.
"I haven't been going to talk about it for a long time, but sometimes it's getting you out of the car that you don't stop anymore," Mudi said.
They know it's gone.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to face the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home today, and I'm going to get some sleep.
I want to go with a very high head and I want my owners to know that I do everything I can for them.
When they start to think it's wrong, I'm gonna have to stop being a coach.
Then I have to think about what to do with my license.
Earlier, Mudi sensitously said during an interview at racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy on his horse.
"A year ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart lived in a room with a man I'll call if they ask, and offered him a job in my horse shop to share information about what I'm doing in my horseyard," Mudi said on Racing.com.
They obviously think I'm a witch.
If that is the case, they should all make statements because they have failed to accept me.
Robert Rollston, former President of RVL, David Mudi, current President of RVL, and Bernard Sondy, former Executive Director of RVL, have known this all the time and they know now.
Should that not make me think that the case is personal?
Should not RVL gather courage and call for an answer to what is going on in this business, other than coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Is that how bad I am for this profession?
Maybe people there think it is.
Maybe they should get me a license and get me out of here, and I'm not sure what I'm talking about right now can make them think about it.
But I've come to the point where I'm equal, and that's what's gonna profit me.
That's what I'm afraid of right now.
I will give them pressure and responsibility for decision-making.
I have support from the family, and I can leave.
The trainer's arrival only grew during a long investigation of the case with Cobalt and Lidari, and the last removal of evil from the start forced him to declare that he could "remove his license on the table".
Mudi, more well aware of the fact that he had prepared an infamous Black Caviar champion, called for the use of medical equipment on the day of the “smooth” encounter after the pressure on the feet of the gang was brought to the ground, which was a violation of the rules.
That's a breach of the rules of jumps.
"I must take full responsibility for this," he said.
One of my wrong employees made her stick.
She could've gotten a compression last night.
She could've got it yesterday as it was.
She was with him on the day of the escape.
Judi may be disqualified for three months in accordance with the rules on the use of medical equipment on the day of exposure to compression, for which the Stuartes opened the investigation.
It's anecdotes.
People who make these rules know nothing about bad things.
"We all understand that we need rules, but it's gone too far," said Mudi.
The driver who visited and hid from the scene in Cobrama was arrested
The police arrested a man who, on the way out, had hit a motorcycle in Cobrama and fled from the scene.
Motorcyclists were brought on a helicopter at the Royal Melbourne hospital with serious injuries after his car broke down at Murray Valley Hayway on Saturday morning.
The police said that the driver walked away without staying to help the injured motorcycle.
On Monday, 50-year-old residents of the town of Natalia were sent to the police in Shepparton.
It is expected that he will be charged with leaving the scene, neglecting assistance and violating other traffic rules.
A 40-year-old motorcyclist lives in a stable hospital.
Trainer Melbourn Storm, Craig Bellami v. v. the defendants in the use of violent arrests
Trainer Melbourn Storm, Craig Bellamy called his team's reconnaissance of the sword as "a link to the agenda" by the two favorites of the NRL champion.
Coach "Sidney Rusters" Trent Robinson stated that the judges allowed "Storm" to "fight" with his team during the sudden victory of "Storm" at the end of the qualifying game in Sydney on Friday evening.
Trainer "Brisban Broncos" Wayne Bennet made a clear impression on "Storm" after his team won the final qualifying tournament at "Nosern Queensland Caubois" on Saturday, when he called this game "typical" for the law enforcement and said that two of the Queensland team were not "very successful" in the manual grasp.
The Belgians protected the capture of the sword by their team and said that they were just focusing on the "contact" by catching the sword.
Belgium added that he was fully convinced of the criticism of his team by the two leading trainers, as this meant that they were worried about the possible breach by the Storm.
"It's still breathing - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about harsh receptions when they were playing us with account 24:2," Bella said in the middle.
I can order that we haven't changed anything throughout the year in our systems or techniques of protection, just for the last six weeks, we have given special attention to contacts when the sword is caught, and this has been a turning point for us.
Trent has been there for three years, and he's clearly training a great team, so he's probably not used to play, and it's been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how this always happens this time of the year.
Bellami supported Bennet's idea of a football match, reminding his teacher that St. George Illavar Dragons won the 2010 championship, showing the "scoff" football.
Wayne's talking about a football catch.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening, and see how impressive their game was," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010, St. George was not critical of the team, calling it a team, and Wayne said it would never matter to him.
But now he has a team that can show what he thinks is an impressive football, especially for his young defenders with their speed.
It's a football that you'd like to play when you have such games.
He made this comment in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style -- not every team has two semi-protectors like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play that way.
This gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're a little worried about the game with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when they got to the big game.
Bellamy also noted that the game "Storma" and "Rosters" was a relationship with a larger number of glasses than the game "Broncos" and "Cauboux".
The game "Broncos," probably was good, I haven't seen her yet, but what was the account? 16-12?
In our game he was 20:18, there were two more attempts-- and what, is that an impressive football?
Or consider the impressive breakouts and failed attempts?
It's a routine for me.
If they mention us, it means that we can meet them at some point.
At the end of this weekend, as they won the right to accept either Nort Queensland Caubois, or Cronella Sharks on the AAMI Park pre-trial terminal, the tickets will be issued on Tuesday morning.
Serbs accused of storing drugs were committed in the amount of $200,000
A man who was threatened with a life imprisonment for trying to get 40 kilograms of cocaine delivered to Queensland by a contractor was released at a loan of $200,000.
Marco Maximovic, aged 29, was one of the five arrested last month after the federal police discovered 100 kilograms of drugs on the Solay River, a South American port via Vanuatu and returned to Kumer in August.
During the mornings, Maximovic and his associates saw the docks and later met them at Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of drugs in Toyota Echo's car.
Despite the threat of a life-threatening period for the use of drugs in the quantity available for sale, the counsel of Maximovich argues that the evidence that the last attempt to steal the entire party is missing and that the man could be in the coffee without any intention.
Judge of the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, questioned that Maximovic had to leave under oath.
Finally, there is contact with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court in the middle.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his location.
The mother and father of Maximovic were offered a joint loan of $200,000 for his release.
“It is evident from both of them that the amount of $200,000 is too large a financial burden for them,” said Judge Fwanagan.
But one such measure was insufficient as a guarantee that he would not disappear, the judge added.
The maximum allowant was allowed to be released on the condition that he will receive both his Australian passport and Serbian passports every day and will be reported to the police at 6 o'clock until 6 o'clock in the morning.
Photo by Cacícaris: "I'm going to pick up Greece, which was before the last second."
The chief Greek collective trainer Fotois Kacicaris gave his due command after the Eurobasket-2015 finals of March 1/4 with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the judge of the game made some mistakes.
It was a big game -- quoted by AFP Cacikaris.
We're ready for a great game to meet the Spaniards.
Efforts were made to open up the defence, but the defence errors identified the trial.
It's crazy, but I'm proud of my kids.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: "I'll be assigned to the CSC."
CSCA novelist Joel Freeland said he doesn't believe in the curse of soldiers.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to overcome the negative trend and finally win Euroliga in the next season.
I spoke to trainer Dimitris Itudis several times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team, says "R-Sport" Frieda. - Actually, I'm going to be entrusted with the role of Sashi Kauna, who left the team, both in protective facilities and in a three-second attack from the zone, and I think I can handle it.
Yeah, I'm gonna need some time to re-establish the central position, but I've played Forvarda more in the NBA.
Now it's going to have to be more opposed to the bigger opposition center, but I've been busy before, so I think, and I'm going to do it now.
The army had won Euroligu for the last time in 2008.
From that time on, they went to the Four Finals, but they couldn't show their best basketball every time.
It would be the idea that the team had caught up with someone.
In this game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's complicated, I understand all the disappointment of the club and its patients.
But we have a great team now, and if we're going to show the best we can, we have a good chance to win Euroligae, I really think so.
He always wanted to win this title, and the Mosquis have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of the CSCA.
As for the spell, I'm not a sovereign, and I don't believe in any curse.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you unite these two things, it's possible.
I don't have any certain rituals before playing, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as I can.
Louis Enrique: "I'm going to have a fight with Rome."
The principal trainer of Barcelona, Luis Enrique, failed to hide that he returned to Rome on the 1st round of the group tournament League of Champions with Rome with special feelings.
According to the instructor, the eyepiece of his current and former team would be very rare for him.
We remember that Luis Enrique trained "wolk" in 2011/12, but he was unable to demonstrate himself to the best part of Italy's capital.
I have returned to Rome a few years ago, which I have gained some experience. - The official website of WEEFA brings up the words of Luis Enrique.
I have a very warm memory with Rome.
It's gonna be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
The main thing is to start the league champions with a victory.
The August meeting of Cuban Joana Gamper does not affect the action of the team in the near-major.
I'm waiting for Rome, the game she showed in the A series against Juventus.
It's a strong team that's capable of pressing and knowing what to do with the sword.
Vadim Scripenko: "Krasnodar" has different options for attacks."
The chief trainer ' s duty, "Ural" Vadim Scripenko, in front of the 9th Prime Minister's round with "Krasnodar", noted the diversity of the opposing team ' s attack schemes.
According to the instructor, there are several models of the game in their arsenal.
The unit will be held on 21 September and will begin at 16.30 p.m. in Moscow.
As we will play with the "Crassador" we will still see, the official Urala website introduces the word Scriptenko.
We've got a whole week of training.
This team has different options for attacks, many of which carry out its attacks, while we are not slow, so I think it will be a very interesting game.
In front of this game, given that Krasnodar is playing the game of the League of Europe against Dortmund, we are working very hard to prepare for victory.
Roher Kanyas: "The House of Astana can pick the eye in whom it fits."
After the 1st round of the Group Tournament League with Benfiko (0:2), the Astana champion Roher Kanyas expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team's game in the future.
According to the Havbek, in its field of austenance, eyes can be selected in any opponent.
Despite the fact that the match has become hard for us, I can say that we played well, the official website of WEEFA has brought the word Kanyas.
"Benfika" is higher than class, but at home, I think we can count on it to pick their eyes.
That's real.
But she had to start thinking about Galatasara and then about Atletico.
In the home games, we can pick eyes in anyone.
Rafael Bennetis: "I'll do it again as many times as possible: Christian Ronaldo is the best in the world."
Chief Trainer Reale Bennis expressed satisfaction with the great victory in the 1st round of the Group Tournament League with the Shafter (4:0).
The Specialist handed down the rightful forum for Christian Ronald, who became the author of three heads.
Matt was not easy, because Shatter was capable of controlling the sword - the official website of WEEFA is Bennisa.
The opponent did not have a lot of moments, but their contracts were always in danger.
I'm not saying that Real played ideal, but we had great opportunities.
I'm glad we didn't miss the sword and killed four.
Christian Ronald confirmed his rank.
It's the best game in the world, I'll repeat it a few times.
Jordan Alba: "Christina Ronalda can't be compared to Messi."
The Barcelone Defender, Jordan Alba, believes that no one can compare with his sole associate, Lionel Messie.
According to Spanish, the "Real" forum for Christian Ronald can't do that either.
The Messiah on five heads above the rest, is quoted by Le Figaro Albu.
Even Christian Ronald.
With Leo on the field, I can't compare him to anyone.
Daniel De Rossi: Barcelona has not only unique style but also bright individualities.
Daniel De Rossi, a member of the "Rome" champion's team tournament League with Barcelona, noted the importance of competitiveness and intimidation in the game with such a strong opponent.
The meeting will be held tomorrow, beginning at 21.45 p.m. in Moscow.
Remember, the CE will carry out its text translation.
Barcelona is a special opponent, a good team with beautiful games, quoted by the official website WEFA De Rossi.
It's hard to play with the blue-ranges, because they have not only unique style but also bright individualities.
To leave them, we have to go all the way through the game and encourage each other.
The Messiah was almost always successful when he was in custody, so we need to keep our compatience and organization.
Eating is expected to start with the SCA in the "Slovan" match.
The SCA, Ilya Ejov, stressed the hope of entering the army team at the next KHL champion's match.
Ejov went up on the ice instead of Mikko Koskina at the 23rd minute at 0:3 and reflected all the holes on his neck, the fourth floor of SCA passed after he replaced the back of the sixth field game.
The next team match will be on the march against Slovene.
I hope I'm going to go to the next matte at the start-up, which is the R-Sport.
I'm not an expert on shoplifters, I'm a thief, we don't have to show the missing heads again, so it's hard to track.
"Dinamo" was a good game, everyone had bad matches.
The command's all gone.
I'd better miss it better, but the team won.
Shafarz fell into the hospital with viral infection.
Lucy Shafarzov was hospitalized with a bacterial infection, reports AFP.
The Czech tennisist is currently at the clinic in Brno.
The deadlines for the rehabilitation of finalist Roland Garros-2015 are still unknown.
We also remember that on Monday, Shafarzhov was on one strike at the WTA rating and is now the fifth missile of the world.
Steven Hogg used a girl's phone to stop pedophiles from sending photos
Pedophil used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to expose violence against children.
Stephen Hogg took a phone call from a girl while she was sleeping, registered in the Internet service, where she received a number of inappropriate images of children sent to her by other users.
The girl woke up, discovered a phone crash, and found it in the hands of a hot Hogg.
She checked it out and found shocking photos, and immediately turned her mother to that.
The police came and saw five images, then studied the computers found at the address, and found the “relevant” requests in the search system using words to detect inappropriate images of children.
Hogg then said to the police that he did it because it could "take the pedophiles" and then he would "bet he's a cop to scare them."
Judge Elid Robertson told the judge of the sheriff in Denmark: "He said that it was a strike, he was forced to scare people.
He acknowledged that he had made requests for a computer, but said that it was because he wanted to become a police officer to threaten the pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversation with an unknown person who sent pictures to him and what he requested to send more photographs.
He said he did it to deceive them.
He said he had problems with his head when he was five and said he wanted to see the images of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When the girl found the photo on the phone, she called her mother, cried and cried.
She saw inappropriate images on the phone, and then an eye rate was made with the accused.
The girl was interrogated and reported that the accused used the computer and the Pleisteshn to talk to the girls who looked very young to him.
Hogg, 23 of the Ward Road, in Denmark, recognized himself as guilty of the charges made in the production of inappropriate photographs of children on 14 June last year, violating the conditions of detention on 25 January of this year and not appearing in court on 24 March of that year.
Lawyer Gregor Sim requested that Hogga not be included in the list of persons who committed sexual offences, as it can be shown that the crime was not a “significant sexual element”.
Sheriff Alister Carmicle sentenced him until October, before he received a response from the social services.
Hogg was released under the charge of this case, but he was taken into custody before hearings of other cases.
It was included in the list of persons who committed sexual crimes before the date of the sentence.
President Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe is not reading in parliament.
Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African government leader, had already fallen from a ledger this year.
He didn't hurt, but a video from the fall scene was currently distributed on social networks.
Parliament's opening was also outraged by Parliamentary opponents' statements that they had received anonymous threats from Mugabe's abuse during treatment.
A month ago, they informed the President during his address to the nation in parliament, namely that Mugabe repeated it on Tuesday.
A member of the Parliament of the Movement for Democratic Change Innocent Gonoze stated that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones with a warning not to interrupt Mugabe.
"The message came with a number that was not reflected, but it was entitled "Death," he reported to journalists at the end of Mugabe's speech.
It warned the noted members that inconsistencies would end in Parliament's building, and as soon as they left, Parliament's incompatibility would not act.
A member of Parliament stated that the party headed by Morgan Cwangarhi was “anxious” with threats to its policies.
Hewlett-Packard reduced to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard plans to reduce from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs under its programme of restructuring and reduction of service costs.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will be divided into two companies registered at the branch, separating computers and printers from faster developmental equipment and service sectors.
As a result of the expected reduction in employment, the estimated figure is approximately $2.7 billion, starting from the fourth quarter, as stated in the Hewlett-Packard statement.
“This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise”, said Mag Witman, President and Director General Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less focused and less focused than Hewlett-Packard is now, and the business portfolio will be wider and deeper, which will help the company move to a new business style," Witman said.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our clients worldwide.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual allocation of over US$50 billion and will focus on providing companies with previously unencumbered integrated technology solutions, a company's statement is reported.
This is how a company founded in the 1930s by the exhibitors of the Stanford University of Billo Hylett and Dave Pacard for the production of electrical equipment was described as “the place of the birth of the Crimea Valley”.
Hewlett Packard is in the process of reorganization with a view to moving from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This step, the second step in the world of the manufacturer of personal computers and one of the largest technical companies in the United States, is the most recent event in this sector, which is based on the conviction that the specialized companies are working better.
Captain "Arsenala" Michael Arteta says his roommates must support injured Jack Wilcher in front of the game with "Dinamo Zagreb"
In his discussion with Wilshire Wenger also emphasized that only September was yet to come, and that if Wilshire's recovery was to be planned, nothing would prevent him from returning to the game of Christmas.
In the most favourable development of the case, Wilsher will have at least four games in England and, in the light of what happened, his participation in the European Championship will remain the subject for the next summer.
The most recent problem was that Wilshire had probably completed the previous season with the only trauma of the boat and was going back to the usual aggressive style of the game during pre-trial training.
Wenger, "This trauma doesn't threaten his career."
It's just not until the end of the bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just a coincidence.
It is not related to the boats or the injuries that occurred before.
This may be related to the medical point of view, but as Wenger has admitted, there is a risk of additional harm to any game returning to the middle of the season.
There is also a negative trend.
According to the Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire had 23 different traumas that occurred with him six years ago from his debut.
In addition, he played only 65 of the 157 "Arsenala" games in league for the last five seasons.
If you look at the Arsenala scale more widely, it can be noted that in six of the eight seasons beginning in 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two Premier League clubs, the most missed due to the trauma of the day.
Wenger recognizes the likelihood of an outbreak in the line, but Arsenal believes that the improvement of trauma statistics in the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, when you get back into the stream after the trauma, you've been vulnerable for some time, so you need to regain strength and get a competitive advantage," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to make it.
I hope he'll recover physically, I'm sure he'll be the one he deserves.
Arsenal starts a campaign in the League of Champions in the middle of the match with Dinamo-Zagreb and continues on Saturday with Chelsea and the next Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger is about to rotate the team.
Rector Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey did not come to Croatia, so they will play Matthew Debushi and Artet as soon as possible.
Perhaps Wenger will also join Kirana Gibbs and Olivia Giru instead of Nacho Moreal and Theo Volcotta.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and to give little attention to the games she needs," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal has an unconditional preference in Group F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is among the most impressive in Europe.
"Dinamo" didn't miss one of the 41 mothers since they got to spend the last season as "Unconquerable".
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was affected by a 3.2-ball earthquake on the Richter scale.
It was 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is convinced that Arsenal took the lesson received in the past season when the team suffered an attack in the game of the League of Championships from Monaco, and remains with little hope of bringing the club to victory at the Kubka Championships final.
"It's an incredible drive," observed Wenger.
Arsenal has never done that before.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm on the move.
We have ambitions, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious lessons from men
The lack of such stories is reflected, especially in the light of the desperate need for men in openness, now more than ever, when the level of suicide among young men is at a maximum of 15 years.
In 2013, this was the only major cause of the death of men between 20 and 45 years of age in the United Kingdom, and men were three times more likely than women.
In an attempt to address the problem of "Campia against Unlucky Life" the 2015 Year of Men announced that men would face cultural challenges that would not allow men to seek help when they need it.
The company is at the centre of this battle to deal with this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students with symptoms of depression revealed that there are insufficient numbers of "normal" friends" in the patient.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of healthy friends is twice as likely to result in mental disorders.
But, of course, to work, first of all, it has to be.
In a time when communication is managed by social networks, when content is preferred, rapid response is often more valuable than content.
Our digital life doubles the need to speak of a strong, loving and successful person, even if he is truly a king of unity.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, imagination, social status, the whole of our internal values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship, which has a stronger impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire recently noted, the producer of the video game, you don't buy any more luck for money.
The dignity of Friends is that they attract this attention.
Each person was determined, not by his own work, but by the personality that appeared in the company of friends.
Yumor Joey and Chandler's constant hugs, the moments of looking at the football on comfortable chairs, the breath of Ross on Rachel -- all is because men can feel it, even if they often refrain from studying their feelings.
As a Samaritan officer told me, "...my role as an listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal is stressing how even very few social friends can benefit."
Often, those men who approach us feel that they are not able to talk to their friends.
The old learning "live with it" is as strong as the feeling that open discussion of problems can be understood as weakness".
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I'm trying to propose longer-term working mechanisms for overcoming.
It stressed the masculinity of male friendships.
With regard to my mission, the status of a stranger living on the phone helps people at times of despair, but long-term support comes from close family and friends.
So if you visit FriendsFest in Comedy Central in these exits, where the holiday has completely restored decorations, why not take your friends to the Central Perk.
Or even better - if you see a single person in Starbucks, kiss and say "Privacy".
Don't worry about the benefits that a friendship can bring.
The Series Friends show Comedy Central from the beginning and to the end, all 236 series, by #FriendsFest
Di Maria's killing the ball by helping the PSJ to play Malmyo.
Anhel di Maria and Blaise Matthews and Edinson Kawani celebrates the dead cats in the mouth of Malmyo.
Anhel di Maria, in the debate in the League of Champions, killed a bullet that allowed the PSJ to easily wear Malmyo on Tuesday.
Here's a report on the mother and the reaction of the game.
Anhel di Maria and Edison Kavani did their business when "Pari San-German" began their game in the League of Champions with a very comfortable victory of 2:0 against "Malme" at the Park de Prens Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria killed a sword less than four minutes after his first game in the League of Champions was started as a game of the PSP to lead the French champions, but they lost a number of opportunities before they finally increased their advantage when Kavani killed him at 61.
In addition to Real Madrid and the Dutch Shafter in Group A, Paris had to take a good start in the game against the Swedish champions because they were aimed, not at the playoff qualification, but for the series of successful games of the last three seasons, where they came up to the fourth.
They worked on the glasses, but at the same time it was not the best decision by Lauren Blana to consider the gold Abrahamimovic to be useless in the attack and later to replace him in the field against the team from his hometown and club, where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win the house or in the guests of the League of Champions, so to win with account 2:0, to deliver problems to the opponents and to play a great part in protection -- it's a good start, even if there's still moments we need to work through the season," said Blan.
It's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did, even though I'm sorry we didn't kill one or two cats anymore.
Ibrahimovic returned after a trauma in one of the money teams, which brought her nothing with account 2:2 in the bag with Bordo in the first league at the exits, but he retired to the back floor of Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentinan attacker noted as a game capable of re-emerged PSP in Europe, after he was kidnapped in Manchester United last month, and he proved why when he fled from Marco Verratti behind the protection of the Malmyo and had successfully completed the attack by sending sword beside John Willand to the front corner.
However, if anyone was waiting for the easy and great victory of the PSJ then, they had to be disappointed.
Malmyo, who won Seltik in the playoffs to get to this stage, with nine world-level games in the field at the beginning of the game, five defenders and two opposing players in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But with the exception of the attack by Nicolas Jürdzic, with the sword flying at the next stage against Kevin Trappa at 34 minutes, they attacked quite a bit.
Therefore, in time, the PSP itself was subjected to ineffective transfers and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who was unable to carry out at least five attempts, and then was unable to process the sword killed by Kavani immediately after the rehearsal of the game.
However, he proved to be much more skillful in the exact passports, and it was a passport from Ibrahimovic, who was sent by D. Maria with a sword tied to his arrest at the foot of Villaland for 52 minutes.
The second round was finally killed after an hour's notice, thanks to Kavani, the surgeon killed his sixth sword in the season after Ibrahimovic set up a sword sent to the center of the field from the left wing of Maxwell.
This led to the end of any ideas that had been in the "Malme" about the return of the game, and only taking over the sword by Wildan from a close distance did not allow David Luis to increase the final account before the replacement of Ezekiel Lavessi did not count the goal at the very end of the match.
Trainer Age Harreide later acknowledged that PSG was a class above his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last game in the League of Champions was held in December last year."
Since then, we've only played in Swedish league, not that level.
Qualifications are not enough.
It's "Paris"!
It was a great match with them.

White House confirms the visit of Si Zingpin in Washington.
The White House confirmed on Tuesday in an official note that the head of China would come with an official visit to the United States at the end of this month.
This visit - the first visit to Si Cinpin in Washington - will be held on 25 September and will be the next visit to President Barak Obama's visit to Beijing last November, the statement says.

The lost bunker on the Kutuzsows has received two years of colony.
In addition, the court partially satisfied the civilian demands of Dani Mirzoev on the amount of 1.2 million rubles.
The Dorogomilov Court of Moscow sentenced Dani Mirzoev, who died as a motorcyclist at the Kutuz Objec in Moscow.
According to the Russian News Service, Mirzoev was sentenced to two years of deprivation of liberty in the colony.
It was recognized as responsible under the article “The violation of road traffic rules and the operation of vehicles”.
In addition, the court partially satisfied the civilian claims of 1.2 million rubles.
During the trial, the prosecutor asked Mirzoeva to be sentenced to three years in prison and to seek full compensation for eight million rubles.
An accident that occurred on 22 May took place about three hours a night in the area of house 30 on the Kutuz Observat.
The BMW vehicle, on which Mirzoev was located, overhauled the driving force and hit the motorcycle on the surface.
From the traumas of men in 1989, the birth of a man was on the scene.
Friends of the lost social networks reported that the BMW driver was driving at high speed and went to the meeting area before the DPR.
Fearing that the driver was trying to get away from responsibility, the bikers had arranged a motorcycle race from the Roaring Mountains to the GUMVD building in Moscow in Petrovke, 38.
Shortly thereafter it became known that the result of the investigation had been retained by the alleged ICT prosecutor.
In Moscow, a man was detained by a thief in the temple.
He felt calm and did nothing wrong, and the police handed him immediate psychiatric assistance to his doctors.
The capital police arrested the residents of Moscow, who had entered one of the temples without clothing.
That's what the Moscow agency reports.
As told by the head of the press service GU MVD on Moscow by Andrey Galiacberov, an incident took place on Tuesday, 15 September, about 16.00 at the Kazakhstan branch.
In the temple of Saint Nicolaus, a naked man was seen.
He believed in himself and did not act in any way against him.
There was a lot of police on the spot.
Lawyers were waiting for doctors from Brigadier Brigadiers for immediate psychiatric assistance and were sent to a man.
They had a 26-year-old resident of Moscow.
Over 40 orders and orders were signed by Vladimir Yakushov.
More than 40 resolutions and orders were signed by the Governor of the Tumen region, Vladimir Yakosov, at the meeting of the President of the regional government.
Some of these concern the allocation of funds for educational and medical institutions in municipal education areas.
In particular, the acquisition of a bus for one of the schools in the Nizhnetavdin region is aimed at the capital repair of the district hospital in the Kazansk region.
As indicated in the accompanying documents, money will be spent on the completion of the capital repair of the second phase of the therapeutic office.
The repair of hot and cold water, water supply, electricity and equipment networks, ventilation systems will be carried out in the building phase, refurbishing premises, implementing a package of anti-personnel security and energy conservation activities.
There is a second forum in the regions of Russia and Belarus.
From 17 to 18 September, the second forum for the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Socia, where the delegation of Yemen will participate with the Governor.
The future event in Socia and the interim results of cooperation are described by the Honourable General Council of the Republic of Belarus in Tumani Vladimir Shugla, who is elected by the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorovic, what are the tasks of the Conciliation Forum?
The scale of action in Socio reflects the industrial policy of the United States.
It is focused on fruitful cooperation between the regions - important links between the two States.
It is planned that the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, and President of the Republic of Belarus, will take part in the plenary meeting.
The experience of the regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policy, the regulatory and legal protection and programmes of the United States will be discussed in plenary and section meetings.
The Governor of the Tumen area is represented in the forum.
I think this is evidence of the successful and sustainable interregional cooperation of the region and Belarus.
The Forum will also be attended by representatives of profiles ministries and agencies, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs.
Trade brands and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tuman region, will work.
I hope that the Forum will help to conclude new useful contracts and agreements.
I add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk last June.
More than two delegations, including 19 regions of Russia, participated in his work.
At the same time, a very important treaty on cooperation between the Tumen and the Minist regions was signed.
The importance of our work also relates to the fact that a regular seminar was held in Tumena at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus.
In addition, the APC delegation of the Tumen region was in the Republic of Belarus with a view to studying the experience of Belarus in training for agriculture, identifying additional focal points and organizing new investment projects in the area of the agro-industrial complex.
You recently met with the head of the region and the head of town administration.
What topics were discussed?
During a meeting with the governor of the Tuman region, Vladimir Yakoshov spoke on cooperation with the Republic of Belarus in contemporary circumstances.
The issue of the delivery of Belarusian agricultural technology and the use of financial mechanisms will be addressed - they need to reduce the cost of machinery for the final consumer.
The problems were discussed in the Tumen trading house of Belsina and the options for the prevention of losses.
The issues are important, as investment projects must work well and bring benefits to the region.
Further OAS passenger-grass technology services have been discussed, the development of the OAS service centre, established in Tumani on the OAO TPATP basis.
The discussion has continued to prepare for the visit of the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus by the end of the current year.
Another theme of the session was the conclusion of the agreement on trade, economic, scientific and cultural cooperation in the Timmen region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamic of relations promises to rise to a new level.
These issues were also addressed by the Regional Centre.
During a meeting with the mayor of Tumeni, Alexander Moor, we talked about updating the Tuman bus park.
About 100 buses are already breathing on the floor, so a new part of the vehicle from Belarus is required to work on gas, environmentally clean fuel.
Another aspect: The Tuman oil plant works with one of the leading oil producers of the OAO, Moglievliftmash, receiving complexes.
In my view, this activity could become more active, taking into account the programmes for setting up new elevators at the regional centre.
I add that the Council met with the Governor of the Kurgan region, Alexé Kokorin, during which the issue of increased trade and supply of modern Belarusian technology in Zaural was discussed.
At the end of September, a meeting was scheduled with the Governor of Oman.
The expanded consular area consists of five entities of the RFS, but the Tuman can be referred to as its own headquarters.
The region is a pool of many prospective projects, including the work of the decent gender council.
In general, such meetings are meaningful and good that allows for a direct and rapid solution to many of the problems, taking their burden away and developing mutual cooperation.
In the current context, it is vital not to destroy the task by continuing to work for the future.
The goal of Damon to focus on the ethnic diversity of people involved in film production
Matt Damon spoke with the U.S. president, Effi Brown, saying that it was not necessary to take into account the ethnic composition.
During the resurrection of the Project Greenlight show on HBO channel, a prominent actor defeated Brown when she tried to highlight the need for alternative points of view to the main black heroin in the project selected for the script.
"Many things are appropriate when you're doing casting for the film itself, not for the show," said Damon.
The wounded Brown didn't believe his ear, he was forced to call out "Oh, nothing." Well, it's all the while an actor from "Marsiana" commented in a direct ephere.
For the discussion of the finalists of the show to Damon and Brown, colleagues from Ben Afflek and Brother Farelli joined.
"I would like the participants - no matter who will be the director - to think about what harmonies they're going to keep," Brown said at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black person is a prostitute who kills a white container.
The director of the Dear White People film said that the film directors became Leo Angelos and Christine Brancachcho; Damon was very opposed, saying, "We can then get what we want."
Following this discussion on television, social networks were exposed to negative comments from Damon.
Twitter user MrsPooni angrily said of the video: "The explanation of the magnitude of diversity from Matt Damon is the only black man in the TOKOE BELOE room, which is sick."
Twitter picked up more than 5,000 rhevits and 4,000 liquecs.
Damon's statements appear as once when the literacy of racial issues in the media is the most urgent issue on the subject of public debate.
After a youth named Michael Brown was shot by the police in 2014, the Black Live Matter movement gained popularity throughout the country, calling on legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the color population.
In February, the Prince mentioned this movement at the time of the presentation of the candidates for the "Album Year" at the Grammy Awards ceremony.
"Albums are still important," he said.
Like books and lives of black people, albums are still important.
Recently, the leaders of the Black Live Matter movement have issued an official statement in response to the question of Fox News Elizabeth Hasselbeck's staff on whether this group will be considered as a group of haters.
"The Black Live Matter Network is a group of love," the movement leaders reported.
It was recently announced that Damon was included in the list of business actors, promoters and media agents invited to visit the Pope of Rome to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
I don't know if the actor accepted the invitation and met Papoy.
"American Ninja Warrior" rewards the first champion
The professional scaler and assistant of Officer Eizek Kaliero became the first winner of the American Ninja Warrior show on Monday evening, leaving home at $1 million.
At this sports show, the seventh season, which had just ended, no participants had been able to go through all stages of the march with obstacles.
At the end of the season, two participants, Caldero and Jeff Britten, arrived at the final round.
The final task included a 75 foot-long walk in 30 seconds.
Brittany served for the first time and became the first athlete in the entire history of the American Ninja Warrior, the last phase 4, but Kallio met with the task for three seconds more quickly than he had won.
After the victory with the dishonest work, Caldero, who was shocked that he had won millions of dollars, gave an interview with E!News.
"It's amazing to think about it, but I never worked and lived more than $10,000 a year," commented Eizek to journalists E! such a serious drop in my income.
And on the other hand, I've never even imagined myself like this... the future is unknown.
Executive director Kent Wiid met with journalists The Hollywood Reporter to talk about the final and why Britten, who first passed the traversa, won't get any money prize.
According to the rules, money is the fastest participant.
"If more than one final player gets the fastest of them," said Wood.
Although money is a wonderful reward and lives change, it still brings great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels that way.
He was happy about what he did.
He's got tons of surveillance calls from fans.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He's a hero for his children and women.
Jeff told me, "If I'm tempted to lose someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would feel the same if we changed our roles.
The show "America Ninja Warrior" will be back with the eighth season, which will begin filming the spring of 2016.
"Detrot Tigers" quietly handle "Minnest Twins"
MINEPOLIS - The second half of the season was not particularly happy for Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, Tigers is currently taking the lead in the Central Division of American League.
All I'm demanding is to make the move, Tigers and Blade won on Tuesday at Minnesota Twins with a 5-4 outcome at the Target Field.
Twins had the chance to cut off a semi-game from Houston Astros and take a second place in the playoff for the number of eyes after the winners.
For detroiters, let's even one night, it was the return of the word on letter F, which separated most of them from the second half of the season.
"Everything that wins is fun, no matter how they get," reported Brad Osmus, manager of Tigers.
Pitcher Tigers, Alfredo Simon, made his contribution to support the attack, which led Detroit to pick up three glasses in the first two inches, then add another one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a drinker in 6 1/3 inches and missed three wounds.
It was only his third quality start in nine exits.
"I just want to finish a year with good indicators," said Simon.
The pies can't be played in each game, so I want to go into the game deeper.
Victor Martinez, the appointed triggerer for Tigers, was killed three times and won two wounds -- the first RBI from mid-August.
It was the first day with three hits since four hits in the game against Seattle Mariners on July 6th.
"He worked very well," said Osmus.
He showed himself well in (as a carpenter), much better at the battle, and kept that quality for the game.
Found three wounds in the second half of the seventh inn, Twins got their best chance to get back to the game.
The central receiver of Biron Baxton opened an inner hole on the left-hand side of the field.
Reetfielder Aaron Hicks, made a band, took the first base, and the second busman Brian Dozer got a shot at Simon's ass before he took his place on the left side of Blain Hardy.
Hardy kissed Moera, the only game on the way, a newly appointed defeating Miguel Sano, who killed the two-eyed "single" left of the right Dr. Verhagen.
In the case of a couple of injuries, not in the car, and a comparable wound on the second base of VerHagen, it was possible to bring the third bassman Trevor Pluffa into the drum.
It was the 27th time for the leading game of the highest lion in this season, when Cluff killed his sword on the dabble.
After Detroit added the sub-industrial wound to the first half of the ninth inn, Moer hired the RBI "dablom" in space between the outfields against the closing piper "Tigers" Bruce Rondon, and the account was 5-4.
However, the right-hand player killed Sano after three shots and got his fifth seat.
Detroit used the advantage of a temporary non-professional Phil Hughes at the beginning of the game.
Tigers worked three injuries in the first two against the prisoner player, who was on the list of injuries before the game, without more than a month of shooting.
"It's definitely not the start I want to want," said Hughes, "but as the game grew, I felt more comfortable and so I was able to perform some pretty good puzzles in the third inning."
After his first visit to the first base, Hughes went to the second bassman, Ian Kinsler.
In two cars, J. D. Martinez took Victor Martinez out, who made a solo in the middle for the first wound in the game.
Victor Martinez completed his series "0 by 21" with the runners in a successful position.
The third base game, Nick Casteljanos, followed by a single one, took another wound, but Victor Martinez was shot in an attempt to get close to the third base, so the threat was eliminated.
Tigers increased the account in the second inning, got a single double from James McCann's theater and a two-way single from the central reconnaissance of Anthony Gouse, and it was 3-0.
"It was a mighty hit," said the manager, "Twins" Paul Molittor.
He wasn't particularly good, but he fell straight to the point he needed.
Heus, who was thought to be a broccoli, then replaced by the right-hand rival A. J. Ahter.
Hussus saw three wounds on six hits and a hole with four hits.
PRIMECTION: Pitcher-right "Tigers" Anabal Sanches has chosen from the games about the length of the right shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed the surgery on his back in 2007.
For Sanchez, which is on the list of traumatized people from mid-August, plans for an early start in the middle.
In the absence of Sanches, the Pitcher-left Daniel Norris will leave the list of wounded and go against the Twins.
Norris, who went out with Tigers at four times since his acquisition in exchange for the Pitcher David Pryce on 30 July, has won 1 and 1 defeat.
He did not participate in games since 20 August due to hair loss.
Tigers and Twins are closing a series of three games on Target Field in the middle.
Against Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will be played by Judge Ervin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73).
The original of Kaderov's complaint under the book "Molba to God" was brought to the Southern Sahelin Court.
In the Southern Sakhalin City Court, the original appeal was made by President Chechny Ramsana Kadarov to the decision to recognize "Extremist Material" the book "Morba to God: Its Meaning and Place in Islam", reported Interfax, referring to President of the Gorsundra Chukhrai.
The Court is now awaiting possible objections from the parties to the process.
Chuhiri refused to comment on the statements made by some of the members of Mr. RFP on the need to verify the strength of possible cooperation with foreign offices and IGIL.
"Shut up on your own," he said.
On 11 September, the Southern Sahelin City Prosecutor appealed to Judge Natalie Perchenco for the recognition of the book "Extremist Material".
The appeal came from the South Sakhalin District Attorney General on Friday evening.
There are nuances: The prosecutors believe that they have asked the court to recognize the extremists only the author's opinion rather than the Qur'an.
According to the prosecutor, the judge had taken a wrong decision," Chukhri reported.
The decision to recognize the book “Extremist Material” was adopted on 12 August 2015.
In fact, the Qur'an has been cited as an exhortation: “We worship you, and pray to you, and do not invoke anyone along with Allah.”
Kadarov called the decision-makers on the book "Satans and propagandists."
He called on the Members of the Lord to legally prohibit judicial decisions relating to the texts of the holy writings.
“I am firmly convinced that the Lord must adopt a law prohibiting judicial action concerning the texts of the Koran and other Divine Scriptures directly,” Kadarov wrote in his Instagram.
Facebook will remove comments that offend migrants and refugees
Facebook staff are intended to remove posts and comments that give negative assessment to migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network provides financial support to organizations that collect users ' complaints on the wrong content.
Combating xenophobic and racism in the Facebook leadership network has been found together with the German Ministry of Justice.
Yes, the encouragement of the head of the office, Hayko Maas, stated that the mission is currently being carried out in conjunction with the task of creating a special group of moderators.
Its participants are obliged to monitor and delete incorrect comments about migrants and refugees.
According to Hayko Maas, it is expected that the authors of the non-tolerant posts will receive notifications indicating why they were removed.
The operational blockage of the illegal content must also be supported by the organizations that specialize in collecting complaints from users of a set of complaints in the obscenities.
The Facebook Guide aims to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative references to migrants and refugees, the leadership of the social network and the Ministry of Justice of Germany was adopted after Xenophobic attitudes had been rapidly developed in the German Facebook segment.
One of the most obvious reasons for them has been the unprecedented migration crisis that some time ago covered the country of the Euro-Mediterranean.
Yes, in Germany, all items intended for the placement of refugees have already been filled.
The authorities have decided to temporarily settle migrants in the territory of the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
The displaced settlers from the Middle East and Africa were placed in barracks where they were imprisoned and armed under the Nazi regime.
There are areas for relaxation in Moscow's labs.
In the near future, a number of capitalis will be equipped with specialized areas for relaxation and psychological recovery.
The first will be the Bhutanese, Domodedian, and the Serbian camp.
The first zone for psychological recovery has already appeared at the Troecur Square in Moscow.
Such places will continue to exist in other areas of the city.
The portal m24.ru told Artem Ekimov, who was the head of the State Budget Office, Ritual.
Relation zones will represent small green areas that remind parks.
Experts believe that in such “students,” visitors can breathe, get together, and regain psychological strength.
In the near future, the relaxation zones will be built in the Domodian, Buttovian and Serbian camps, and then in other capital areas.
According to the head of the Ritual GBU, when there is a need to expand the ceiling, the builders are trying to keep the existing forest masses as far as possible.
Green settlements will serve as a living warehouse that will divide the breathing zones and areas directly below the burial site.
The GBU experts, Ritual, also stated their intention to make a proposal to refuse burial.
New ceilings can actually be free of charge.
In addition, the GBU referred to the readiness to set up electronic terminals, with the help of its visitors to identify GPS coordinates and number of backups.
In June of this year, the Ritual GBU also proposed adjusting the cost of storage services, depending on the time of the year.
Yes, the wheat harvest in the summer will be worth a thousandth of the harvest, the week of summer when the earth is at hand.
We note that over the past year, estimates of all types of ritual services have been averaged by 10 per cent.
In the Eleni forests, five mornings later found the missing giraffe.
The elderly man was alive, though he spent more than a hundred hours in the forest without any provision.
The discovery of the grifter has been successful because of the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, Corresponding: "A 79-year-old pensioner from the Tambov area spent five days in the forest."
No food and water.
He was wanted by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even dogs kinologists, but there was no results.
The discovery of a man was successful after the helicopter was set up for the search.
On that day, Vitaly Aleksandrovic was sent to the forest for meals and refreshments, but he didn't come back to dinner.
The family immediately sought help, and on the next day, some 30 people were arrested by rescuers and strangers from the neighboring village.
On the fifth floor, a helicopter joined the fireplace.
Andrey Selekov, head of the Search and Rescue Group of the Smolensian Firearms Department, said: "The helicopter was caught, the man was discovered."
He went very far, perfectly elsewhere.
It was about 12 km from the search point.
He's gone a great distance in his age.
It's a miracle he's still alive.
The Gribnik was brought to the central district hospital without knowledge, in very difficult circumstances.
He was diagnosed with pneumonia, as well as severe nausea and vomiting.
As an elderly man was able to stay alive after five days in the forest, doctors did not fully represent him.
Valentina Nepša, in charge of the treatment department of the Elline CRB: "Remarked patient investigation, treatment."
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Taking into account all his chronic diseases.
The patient's condition has improved in the morning and remains difficult, but with positive dynamics.
The pensioner Vitaly Aleksandrovic comes to Smolentin from the Tambov area every year.
His uncle says that his grandmother was going to pick up the fish before, but he never went deep in the woods.
Alexei Spitčenko, the son of the found Griffin, separated: "Lest away from the road, in principle, is not local."
He literally spent several years visiting his relatives.
Well, he went after the flu.
See, he's gone far and gone wrong.
At the beginning of the winter season, people are regularly disappearing in all areas of the Smolens.
Only in the last few days have five similar cases.
Rescuers remember: In the forest you have to walk in bright clothing, with little food, shoes, and compass.
In addition, it is desirable to leave behind traces so that they can be returned.
An-2 apartment on the promenade in the fraternity.
Straight to the middle of the village in Siberia, the An-2 disaster.
The extraordinary landing of the Enisei Aircraft aircraft took place at 68 kilometres from Bratska.
There are no casualties and no injuries, but the plane itself has suffered significant damage when landing.
An-2 has done a job trip.
On his ship, three crew members were commanders, second pilot and ship mechanic, reporting Interfax.
An emergency aircraft flew over the railway of Jélesnork-Ilimsky-Aqinsk, where the airline was based.
The aircraft's already delivered to Bratsk.
Following an emergency landing, A-2 began to check compliance with the flight safety legislation.
The investigation team of the East Siberian Transport Procurator was on the scene.
In September 2010, the Tu-154 crew landed his plane with passengers because of the technical inaccuracies of the damaged heavy aircraft in the Commission.
The engine and the ship were fired on the line, but the ship was unable to do so.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers on board.
No one was hurt at the plane's external landing.
Economic News — Nobel laureate: Globalization
The process of globalization had to contribute to reducing inequality in the world.
The situation is different, and the gap in income in the developing economies, on the other hand, is growing.
Eric Maskin.
In order to correct this, it is necessary to improve the level of education for low-qualified workers, as the principal scientist of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision-making of the NIWE, the Nobel Prize for the 2007 economy, Eric Maskin.
In the last twenty years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become increasingly open.
The Globalization Parties were forecasting great benefits for the developing economies.
"And these predictions have come true in many ways," points out Maskin.
Thus, for example, China and India have had a significant increase in GDP in the souls of the population.
However, not all are so happy.
Globalization is expected to reduce the gap between the poor and the poor in poor countries, which is marked by a large inequality of income and the exact wages of labour.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, as Eric Maskin notes in his article “Why the global markets have not reduced inequality in developing economies”, published in The World Bank Economic Review, which has translated and quoted NIWE.
In conjunction with economist, Professor Michael Kramer Erik Maskin of Harvard University developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why income disparities in poor countries are increasing as globalization grows.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
In order to demonstrate them, the Machine provides four levels of expertise - A and B for rich countries, C and D - for the poor.
After globalization, D specialists from poor countries did not qualify to cooperate with A and B specialists from the wealthy countries.
And if there is a growing pay rate for the poor in the poor countries, in cooperation with the B staff of the rich, workers in D are not able to feel or pay them all.
The result is that internationalization of production will contribute to an increase in pay gap between the two categories of experts in poor countries and, accordingly, an increase in inequality.
The creamer and E. Mask are offering a wonderful model, an alternative rickardian theory of comparative advantages.
It explains why globalization has led to inequality in income, said Fuad Alesconov, a senior professor at the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision-making, head of the Department of Mathematics of the World Health Organization.
And as every powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to the collapse of imperial work in this area.
The solution to the problem, according to Erica Maskina, is to improve the level of education of low-qualified workers.
However, workers themselves, as the scholar points out, do not have the means to pay for their training.
In this situation, Governments, international agencies, NGOs and private funds may play a significant role.
The scientist notes that the theory developed does not, in any case, call for the cessation of the globalization process, which brings and brings its fruit in terms of growth in GDP.

The United States Embassy regrets the closure of the American Centre in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia regretted the closure of the United States Centre ' s foreign literature library.
The Centre worked in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The United States Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian Government to close the US Mission Centre at its U.S. State Library, M.I. Rudomino, Moscow.
“The unilateral steps recently taken by the RF are in doubt as to the commitment of the Government of Russia to ties between the Russian and American peoples that have not been broken even during the cold war and in other difficult times of our countries’ long history,” said Ambassador John Tefta of the United States of America, quoted in the Interfax statement.
The American Centre has established a deep and lasting link between people and the culture of Russia and the United States.
It was the center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and it served as a meeting place with numerous prominent American children, including homosexuals, artists, sportsmen, scientists, politicians and writers.
“Only last year did the American Centre conduct more than 400 cultural and educational activities and hosted over 50,000 Russian visitors,” he stressed.
Teft recalled that about a year ago, it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project, FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
The Green Court was about to be held.
The typical situation: four officials stand before Judge Svatner Kumara, listening to his claim for work.
The court is totally not satisfied with the quality of your work.
We have not given you a 110-page order so that you may be comforted over it, says Kumar.
If there's one more chip, we'll show you to get rid of all the existing buildings.
Kumar is the head of the National Green Tribunal (NPT) - the judicial authority established in 2010 to halt the intense pollution of the environment that is accompanying the rapid economic growth of the past decade.
At the same time, the Tribunal has been able to consider more than 10,000 air pollution investigations, munitions, geologic development, toxic waste and steam construction.
In two of the three cases, the court decided to terminate the construction leading to pollution.
Unbelievably high rates: over the past 60 years, India has been turning from the country of girls in one of the most affected and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is particularly serious in large megapolis where infrastructure development is not conducive to intensive urbanization: the city is covered by flat sand, rivers filled with pesticides and waste of businesses and households, and a few remaining living masses are being destroyed by new living quarters.
Despite the formal support of the Green Movement by the State, the NZT has been criticised by the Government of Narendre Modi, as it is often the main cause of the rejection of major investment projects.
Thus, in May of this year, the Minister for the Environment called the court ' s decisions "extreme" and "unfulfillable".
At times, the court's decisions are not really possible within the time limit set by the court, confirming a lawyer for the environmental affairs of Raj Pandjani.
However, the incomplete dedlines are also positive: at least they prevent the responsible ones from getting dressed.
"His main goal is to overcome this system," adds a lawyer.
The Green Court has repeatedly rejected major attacks: the closure of airport, electricity and hundreds of smaller instruments.
People are also trying to remember: for example, during the discussion of a pharmaceutical company judge in the state of Telegana, who was infected by the local network of phytoroids.
We can close your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
"People lose their jobs," Kumar commented.
However, such explanations are not always understood by simple people who can change their lives through a single increase in the judiciary.
Thus, in April, the Tribunal decided to prohibit all vehicles over 10 years of age from entering the capital rather than from being subject to national sanctions.
Despite the sharp popularity and criticism, Svatner Kumar refused to reject this decision.
Instead, he ordered the Government of Deli to provide statistics on incoming and outgoing cars, and suggested that 10,000 additional buses should be purchased, prior to the fact that they were able to carry out such a order.
As the Court ' s attention began to drop pollution sources, such as floods, fuel quality, and even road accidents, the public's anger began to subside.
But the most painful subject of the principal judge was the Hong Kong cleanup programme, with the support of Prime Minister Narendro Modi last year.
When it comes to Gange, a sacred to the Indians of the river, the judge often ceases to hold his emotions and moves on to the cricket.
You know what the word "holy" means?
Someone who has chosen the water from Ganga as God's property, and has been in a state of chaos, a judge is angry.
You continue to pollute the river because you think that Gang is Gang, he will take away all our sins.
It's a river we worship, and see what you do with it every day.
The cleanup of Ganga is the most ambitious and expensive environmental project announced by the new Government.
Currently, the number of fecal bacteria in this river exceeds the norm more than 120 times.
Each year, from 1.5 to 3 out of 700 million Indians die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated money to the Ganga Rescue Fund from the sale of his costume in which he met Barak Obama and 455 other items from his personal collection.
The environmentalists charged the prime minister with populism: the cost of $700,000 was paid, while at least eight billion was required for the cleanup of the river.
The parties to the Green Court agree that India is still on its way long before it can call itself a developing country, but they do not believe that the cost of progress should be environmental.
"In the developing country, environmental talks are often perceived as unacceptable growth," says activist Malika Bhanot.
And the court is trying to find a golden centre between the environment and development."

Czypin is calling for a more open economy for peace
The economy must become more open to the world in order to increase its growth, as President Si Zzinpin said on Tuesday in addressing the group that is the task of leading reforms.
" China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and developing openness policy," he said, addressing the participants of the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group on the full deepening of reforms.
He said that openness and the deepening of reforms would give the economy a new momentum and life force and provide new space for economic development.
The Steering Group adopted a number of directives, including the introduction of market access regulations for investors, the amendment of border control rules, the promotion of public enterprises (SOE) attracting private capital and the revision of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of the economy and production that are not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be phased out through pilot programmes.
This is an important step, since it will give the market a more important role in the allocation of resources, in ensuring business legitimacy and in enhancing transparency, as stated in the statement.
The Government will also weaken the control of the powers conferred on it by ensuring that companies themselves will conduct their business.
The statement also states that China will allow border regions to develop new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for enhancing local growth.
More space will be available for private investors in order to increase the openness of the under-control state of the economy sectors.
“The Government will not change its policy on foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better conditions,” said the statement.
In addition, it will facilitate the provision of applications for permanent residence for foreigners, or Green Card, by optimising the requirements and simplifying the process itself.
The meeting also discussed the rights of lawyers and training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report issued after the meeting, Prime Minister Li Ketzen and Minister Liu Youngshan and Jan Gaoli also attended.
