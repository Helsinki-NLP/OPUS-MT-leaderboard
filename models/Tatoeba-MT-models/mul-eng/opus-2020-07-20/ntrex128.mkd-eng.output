Members of the Wells National Assembly are concerned that "they look like maps"
Some members of the congregation are surprised by their proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Parliament of the United States).
This stems from plans to change the name of the Assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the congregation throughout the political spectrum are concerned that this may be an object of ridicule.
One member of the Laburist Party's congregation said his party was worried that "he's having Twp and Pwp".
For those who don't speak big: on big twp means "study/study", and pwp means "how".
A member of Plaid said the party in general "is not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party said his party's work is "freedom" for the change of name, but noted that the similarity of the words MWP and "mapet" (Ang. Muppet) is great.
In this context, the Greek word "w" is similar to the Yorkshire-English term "u".
The Commission of the National Assembly, which is currently preparing a law to introduce amendments to the name, said: "The final decision on which the members of the congregation are to be named, of course, will bring the members themselves."
The Wells government law of 2017 gave the Wells Congregation the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of consultations with the public on the proposals that indicated great support for the appointment of the congregation as the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the name of the members of the congregation, the Commission prefers Members of the Parliament or of the WMP, but the MWP option has received the greatest support from public consultations.
Members of Parliament offer alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus may cause headlines for the President of the Congregation, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law for changes within a few weeks.
The Law on Reform will include other changes to the way the congregation works, including rules on the disqualification of members of the congregation and the design of the committee system.
Members of the congregation will give the final vote on the question of their name when they discuss the law.
Macedonians will vote at a referendum to change the name of the country.
The voters will vote on Sunday whether their country's name is changed in the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The popular vote was put in an attempt to resolve the decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens for a long time insisted that her northern neighbour's name represents a legitimate position in her territory and was constantly opposed to the country's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, an opposition to the name-change poll, said he would not take account of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the change in the name is simply the price to be paid for entry into the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bell was ringing while the churches in Harlem faced problems
"Historically, the old people I talked to say that every corner had a bar and a church," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's no one else."
He said the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"People socialize differently today," he said.
"The bars are no longer the everyday rooms of the villages where people go regularly."
And for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders think, "and sooner or later, they will return to the same place as they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by a building with a building full of people who will not help the remaining shrines in the community.
"Most people buying apartments in these buildings are white," he said, "and that is why the day will come when these churches will be closed completely because it is unlikely that most people who move to these buildings will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem to become a metropolitan of the blacks – the Metropolis Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original aggregation of white-methodists has been abolished in the 1930s.
The congregation of blacks who practice their faith in neighboring places takes over the property of the building.
St. Martin was taken from the blacks' assembly during the reign of priest John Howard Johnson, who led the fighting of the 125th Street salesmen, the main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or advance blacks.
The building was badly damaged in 1939, but since Father Johnson’s parishioners had plans to rebuild it, they bought the carillion.
Priest David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the Carolyn “the Call of the Poor. ”
The expert who played the cartoon in July called it another "cultural wealth" and "unchangeable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also noted that it was the first carillion in the world to play black musicians, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the largest carillion in Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriveter said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What happened in St. Martin in the last few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, part of the church's unmanaged leaders, and part of the Episcopal Episcopal Epistle.
The church committee – the church’s leading body, composed of non-managed leaders – writes to the parish in July with concern that the parish "will require the costs to be transferred" to the church committee, although the church committee was not involved in the work of the architects and entrepreneurs who sent the parish.
Some members of the parish have complained of lack of transparency by the parish.
Aicula hurt a 13-year-old child when he was driving a train in California
Aicula attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while a jastrosium in California, on the day of the opening of the railway season, the authorities said.
The attack took place about seven hours ago near the beach of Bikon in Ensinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB television in San Diego that he had been traveling with his friends about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy call for help and then went to the group to help get him out of the water.
Hamel said he first thought it was an excitement to catch the shark, but then "he realized he cried, 'I'm late!
I'm late!'
The whole key bone was looking at him," Hamel said he noticed after he got to the boy.
"I called everyone out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!' added Hamel.
The boy was taken to a helicopter at the child hospital Radi in San Diego, taken as a critical condition.
He doesn't know what kind of shark was responsible for the attack.
The beach rescuer, Captain Larry Gils, told the press conference that a few weeks ago, the plane was detected in the area, but they decided that the plane was not of a dangerous nature.
Gils added that the victim was hit by traumatized injuries in the top of the tower.
The authorities closed the beach on the coast of Ponto in Casablad to Swami in Ensinitas for 48 hours due to research and security.
Gilles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sansbury's plans enter the beauty market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's takes Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with jewelry in the style of shopping houses full of professional assistants.
As part of a significant entry into the United Kingdom’s beauty market of 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow as sales in the fashion and household fall, large beauty costs will be tested in 11 shops each year in the country, and will be presented to more sellers next year as they appear to be successful.
The investment in beauty appeared after the supermarkets began looking for ways to use the space of guns that was once used for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
From Sainsbury's they said that for the first time, they would double the offer of a facility for beauty up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also re-starts its Boutique milk series, so most of the products are suitable for vegans, something that is increasingly demanded by younger consumers.
In addition, perfume trader Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury shops, from which the first opened in Creedon, south London last week, and the second opened in Selie Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Buying online and buying trend reduces the amount of food on a daily basis in local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Kup, director of Sainsbury's, said salesmen would look more like stores because the supermarket synergy is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl discontinuants with more services and products that don't eat.
Sainsbury's began to become sellers of Argos in hundreds of shops, and also introduced a number of Habitat dealers after buying them both syndicates two years ago, which they say increased sales of tranquilizers and made purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reorganize its beauty and training departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint funeral with Boots shortly after 2000, but co-operation ended by disagreeing on how to share the profit of chemical dealers in supermarkets.
The new strategy appeared after Sainsbury's sold 281 of its pharmaceutical shops to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy synergy, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It was said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxury brands for him on his skin, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We transformed our looks and feelings of beauty in order to improve the environment for our consumers.
We also invested in specialized schools that would be available to offer advice.
Our brandy series is designed to meet every need, and the attractive environment and the next locations mean that we are now a worthy destination for beauty that causes the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "failed" after Holly Willowby withdrew from the contract worth 11 million pounds
The star Peter Jones of Dragons Den went "failed" after TV director Holly Willowby withdrawn from a contract worth 11 million pounds with his branded lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willowby doesn't have time for their Truly brand for domestic products and supplements.
The couple's business is related to the Goop brand of Gwenet Paltrow.
This 37-year-old leader of the morning program told Instagram he's leaving.
Holly Willowby left Peter Jones, Dragons Den's star, withdrawing from their profitable brandy business for life-style at the last moment to focus on her new big agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say Jones was "benef" when a television gold girl admitted during a tennis meeting on Tuesday in the seat of his business empire in Marlov, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – mean that she no longer has time to devote to their Truly brand for household products and supplements.
Business is linked to the Goop brand of Guinet Paltrow and was said to double the wealth of Willowby's 11 million pounds.
As 37-year-old Willowby told Instagram he left Truly, Jones quickly left Britain in one of his weekends.
One source stated: “Truly was always at the top of Holly’s priorities.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that she would send in the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw all concerned took them absolutely unprepared.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to opening.
In Marlow's seat there is a warehouse full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that leaving this director of a morning program, which is one of Britain's most paid stars, can make the company millions because of large investments in perfumes and candles products, so to clothes and household products and the potential for further retirement.
And that can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willowby, mother of three children, and Dan Boldwin's husband is close to Jones and his wife Tara Kap for ten years.
Willowby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
Both go for a break together, and Jones has a 40% share of Bolivia's TV production company.
Willowby needs to become an ambassador to the M&S brand and will replace Anton McCpartlin as the leader of I'm A Celebritty (I am a star) of the ITV.
Source close to Jones said yesterday, "We don't comment on his business moves."
A serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He was laughing at the criticisms he would receive from the media to comment that some would consider him "non-President" and because he is so positive for North Korea's leader.
Why did President Tramp give up so many things?
Tramp said with his voice translated as "a news president".
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Tramp assessed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearization have been postponed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Young Ho, told the world leaders of the UN General Assembly that the North does not see "a suitable response" from the United States to the early efforts of North Korea to disarmament.
Instead, he said, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Tramp takes a much more optimistic view of his mythical speech.
"We agree very well with North Korea," he said.
"We should have been in war with North Korea.
Millions of people will die.
Now we have this great co-operation."
He said his efforts to improve his relations with Kim brought positive results – completed rocket attacks, helped release prisoners, and the rest of the American soldiers returned home.
And he was defending his unusual approach to communication with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we'll have 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd before him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed the island and took hundreds of lives
In the aftermath of earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had been displaced, there was no awareness of an emergency, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it is a challenge," said Mr. Sumbung.
Although "Save the Children" is a team that will travel to Palu, it is still not sure that foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, the national disaster agency's spokesman, said the Indonesian authorities evaluate the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
Because of the earthquakes that continue to afflict Indonesia, the country remains hopelessly unprepared for the anger of nature.
Although they were built for tsunamis in Aceh, they were not used to looking in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of cheese to warn of tsunamis in Palau, although warnings were issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
In the best time, travel across many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters are becoming more and more of a threat to logistics.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims has been headed to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the location of the new disaster.
The main point in President Yoko Vidodo's election campaign was to improve Indonesia's old infrastructure and he spent a lot of money on roads and roads.
But the lack of funds covered Mr. Joko's administration in the eyes of the elections next year.
Mr. Yoko is also facing pressure from the sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets, using swords, spears, and arrows and other old weapons.
Look: Daniel Starge of the Liverpool Team Equally Against Chelsea
Daniel Starge saved Liverpool from losing the Prime Minister's gold league in 89 minutes on Saturday at Stafford Bridge in London.
Kserdan Shakyri put Starg's ball on about 30 yards from Chelsea's neck, while his team lost from 1 to 0.
He moved the ball from the left before he went to the distant article.
The ball was moving high above the six-year-old as he turned to the right corner of the network.
The storm finally passed through Cape Arizona and fell into the network.
"It was just trying to get into that position, get to the ball, and players like Shack always give as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible," Starj said about LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and just touched her and didn't think much about it and just joked."
Chelsea took 1 – 0 in half of the time after the label star Eden Hazard gave a cave in 25 minutes.
The flood attacker turned five back to Mateo Kovacic in that attack, before throwing the ball almost to half of the ground, and then suddenly passed into half of Liverpool.
They've given you a quick shot with Kovačic in the middle of the field.
Then he walked the projectile, leading Hazard to the six-year-old.
Hazard passed the defense and ended up in the network of a remote article with a left leg hit near Alison Becker on Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight Napoli in the League of Champions at 3 p.m. in the middle of the San Paolo Stadium in Nepal, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at WEFA League Europe at 3 p.m. in London on Thursday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rose to 832
The number of victims of earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that fell in a 7.5 earthquake that hit the ground on Friday and caused arms at a height of 20 steps, said the agency's portfolio Sutopo Purvo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was surrounded by an earthquake from the damaged buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was beaten to death
It's started a murder investigation after a woman's body was found in Birkenhad, Mercedes.
Forty-four-year-old woman was found at 7.55 p.m. with Grayson Moves' wedding wounds on the street of John, and a 32-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of murder.
The police asked the people in the area who saw or heard something to say.
Detective Brian Ohagen said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would ask the people who were near the John Street in Birkenhad who saw or heard anything suspicious about contacting us.
Also, I would like to ask people, especially taxis, who might have filmed something on cars' cameras to contact us because they might have information that is important to our investigation."
The police spokesman said the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhad and that she was found in the facility.
The afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and, as the police have said, they will inform the victims of the victim's presence.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Moves just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him he wasn't allowed to enter, not even out of the building.
He's left no words when he finds out what happened.
Now the waiters have announced that they will be gone hours before they can come back.
Someone heard a policeman tell a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
There's a woman dressed in tears.
It repeatedly repeats “so terrible. ”
At 2:00 a.m., two police vans were in the courtyard, and one was outside.
A number of police were standing in the courtyard watching the apartments.
Any information is requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or contact Anonymous Fighters against Crime at 0800 555 111 by quoting 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's status has become the most recent memorial hit in the "recording of History" casino.
Its persecution would be a dramatic trial for its "Taliban" destruction of a large number of cultural and religious artifacts issued by his fantastic Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "ruinness" and "an attempt to record history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell’s Society, said: “In the current state-of-the-state debate, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell before the Westminster Chamber would become a goal.
The iconoclast of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor issued by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the work of his predecessor, Thomas, in the past century.
The beautiful presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Torneycroft is proof of the 19th century’s thinking and part of the figure’s history that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith said about The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people think, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, that Cromwell is a parliamentary defender of extreme pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Whether that is a complete exact representation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the development of our nation back there, and Cromwell is an individually recognized figure that represents a part of that division.
His achievements as Lord-protector are also worth celebrating and mentioning."
The pig killer broke up and killed a Chinese farmer.
Dogs attacked and killed a market farmer in South-West China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by the assumption "Yuan", is a dead man with the skin artery, blood-thirsty in the market near the market in Lipanshui in the province of Gichua, South China, announced Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to place vaccines on pigs' pigs on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the province of Kinghai, China.
He apparently traveled with a cousin from nearby Junan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his brother found him dead and opened the door of a nearby pigeon.
He said that there was a big snake with blood on his chest.
The French investigation confirmed that the weight of 550 pounds broke the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
"My brother's leg was bloody and broken," said the cousin, with the thought "Wu", according to the quote in the evening news of Guayango.
The photo from the security camera showed Juan how he entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to John nor to his brother.
The market manager reported on the evening news that pigs were closed to prevent other people's attacks while the police collected evidence at the site.
Juan’s family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, and previously reported cases of pigs attacked by humans have been reported.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical damage to the husband.
Ten years ago a 650-pound pig caught a big farmer to his tractor until his wife threw the animal out.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as an "activator".
"They're just playing."
They want to bite, they're very jealous... they don't want to hurt anyone intentionally.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The rest of the Roza hurricane will bring rain in the southwestern part of the United States

More than 20 million people saw Brad Kavano's hearing
More than 20 million people saw the exciting witness on Thursday of the nominated Supreme Court candidate, Bret Kavano, and the woman who accused him of sexual assault that had reportedly taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blassi Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the inevitable political situation continued, with Spicers who stopped regular programs for conversion at the last minute of Friday: Jeff Fleck, Senator of Arizona, concluded an agreement with the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate court committee that it was 100% sure that Kavano was drinking and tried to get her clothes off the high school party.
Cavano, in his rigorous testimony, said it was 100% sure that it didn't happen.
It's likely that more than 20.4 million people, as Nielsen said, were watching him on Friday.
The company counted the average visibility of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for the other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulties with measuring people looking at the offices.
To show you better, it's a audience with a size similar to a playoff game in football or the prizes of the film academy.
The Fox News channel, whose leaders strongly attacked Kavano's appointment, led in front of all networks with 5.69 million viewers on average during the day-to-day consultation, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2,52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Fleck was a central figure in the fifth drama.
After the Republican office moderately issued a statement that it will vote for Cavano, CNN and CBS cameras as protestors call him on Friday morning while he was trying to get into the elevator for hearing the judicial committee.
He was standing with his eyes closed for a few minutes while he was passing through, and all of that was passing into CNN's life.
"They stand here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth of the country"?
He was told, "You have power, and so many women are powerless."
Flyk said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, there would be more to say during the committee's hearing.
The cable and radio-difference networks were all covering hours later, when the judicial committee was to vote to promote Kavano's nomination in the voting Senate.
But Felix said he would only do that if there was an agreement with the FBI that they would consider charges against the nominated one next week, which was asked by the minority of democracy.
Fleck was partly convinced by the conversation with his friend, democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
After talking to Kansas, and with several senators then, Fleck made a decision.
Fleck's choice was significant because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to elect Cavano without an investigation.
President Tramp opened the FBI investigation on charges against Cavano.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" on the flag
Prime Minister Teresa May accused the critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "playing politics" with the future of the British national interests in an interview for Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives at the conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the main page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called "Checkers" plan for Bregzit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect loan costs is "totally absurd".
Fire at Wade Sims: Police arrested suspect Dieon Simson for the death of a sportsman at the state university of Louisiana
The police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the state university of Louisiana.
Twenty-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and brought to prison under a second-level murder charge, said the Baton Rouge police department.
The authorities announced a video from the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the beating.
The police found eyes on the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, said CBS WAFB partner.
After Simpson was questioned, the police reported that he had been shot in Wade and killed.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The pathologist's office of East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death was a shot in the head at the door.
The Department thanks to the unit for refugees from the state police of Louisiana, the criminalized state police lab, the South University police, and the citizens of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to arrest.
The athletic director at the state university of Louisiana thanked the police for her "activity in search of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
A 6.6-step buck grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the state university of Louisiana.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 hit balls by game in the last season.
On Friday morning, the coach of the Costa Rican State University's national team, Will Wade, said the team was "unjust" and "in shock" from Sims' death.
"This is what you care about without interrupting," said the coach.
Volcano threw a pepper on Mexico City
The melting of the pepper from the volcano Popocappetel reached the southern settlement of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Sunday not to go to the volcano after the crater activity began and 183 gas and pump emissions were recorded for 24 hours.
The center was following more tattoos and drawings.
Social media images show a thin layer of paper on cars in the rural areas of Mexico City, as is Sochimalko.
Geophysicists noted an increased activity of the volcano that is 45 miles (72 km) south of the main city after a 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goo has been active since 1994.
Police met with Catalan separatists before the year of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the independence protestors broke up with the police for public order and peace and after thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first year of the polling vote for defeating Catalonia.
A group of masked supporters of separatists detained by the police for public order and peace threw eggs and colors right, creating dark clouds of street dust that would normally be filled with tourists.
Later that day, they also broke down the tapes, and the police used the bullets to get the tapes out.
For more than a few hours, independent groups have called for "No memory, no forgiveness", and on the other hand, union protestors have called "Long live Spain".
Forty-four people were treated for minor injuries suffered in protests, a local press release said.
Tension is still high in the region that wants independence, one year after Madrid characterised the referendum on 1 October as illegal, but it was also celebrated by separatist Catholics.
Most voters voted for independence, although the outcome was small because of the fight by the people who opposed the kidnapping.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police violently tried to stop voting at the voting sites in the region.
Independent groups camped on Friday night to prevent demonstrations to support the national police.
The demonstrations were held, but they had to change the route.
Sixteen and eight years old electrician Narciss Termes, who participated in separatist protests with his wife, said he no longer hopes that Catalonia has the chance of gaining independence.
"Last year we lived one of our favorite moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a vital but firm victory of the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties were forced to maintain the dynamic year with many of their most famous leaders or in a self-elected progon or in jail waiting for a trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the consistent declaration of independence.
Forty-two years old mechanic Hoan Puig, recording the protest for police support, said the conflict was supported by politicians from both sides.
"It's all going to be positive," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who are in prison before the trial last year, announced that they will be candidate for the European Parliament's elections next year.
"To be a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we saw from the Spanish government," he said.
Londoners: Men arrested after killing a car in the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeated beatings at home in Londonbury.
The incident took place in Balinagard Crecent on Thursday at around 19.30 BST.
Detective Bob Blamings said it caused the head damage and the city itself.
At one point he may have been shot by a gun from his car.
Menga's victory brought Livingstone's victory from 1 – 0 against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingstone has provided victory
Advanced Livingstone has set up the Rangers with Stephen Gerard's signature, with only two losses in 18 contests, as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's guess showed how significant it was as Gerry Hold's side jumped to a level with Hibernian in second position.
Gerard's side remained unconquered in guests in the first season and will meet with Harts leaders next week, behind which eight points remain.
Before that, the Rangers will be home to Rapid Vienna in Europe the League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone continues to be victorious in the division during six contests, and Coach Holt has not yet faced defeat since Kenny Miller’s replacement last month.
Livingston missed the chance against cruel guests
Holt's team was supposed to run a long time before they gave him bread, and their direction caused many problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried, but he pulled the attack around the table, then Alan Littgov could only direct his efforts away from playing with the hit with Craig Halket's head over the table.
The guests gladly let the Rangers play before them, knowing that they can create problems with the assigned shares.
And that's the way the judge came.
The Rangers missed a free strike, and Livingstone got an opening, Declan Galager and Robinson together set up Menga, who only even gave a bullet from the center of the six-year-olds.
By that time the Rangers had dominated possession of the ball, but they couldn't break home defense, so the Columnman Liam Kelly didn't play most of the game.
That scheme continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos is making rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pitman failed to give the ball because of the skill of the Ranger Golmen, Alan McGregor, and Litgov took the ball away from another action in Livingstone.
Livingston's six-year-old was constantly passed and was constantly protected, while two petitions for a pen – after Halket challenged Glen Middleton's replacement and one for a hand game – were rejected.
"Finonmental" by Livingstone – Analysis

Fenomanial game and score for Livingstone
They were great, continuing to overcome the expectations of this upward path.
Their style and character of playing had barely changed after they returned to the top, but much of the job went to Holt for the way the team was galvanized by his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was exceptional, managing a super-organized defense, but Menga was still holding Connor Goldson and Joe Warl ready.
The Rangers, however, failed their inspiration.
As good as they once were under Gerard’s leadership, they are now remaining with the same standards.
Their last game was weak – only once they managed to open the homes – and this is a little announcement by the Rangers who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received mixed reception in Colonia
There were smiles and blue sky on Sunday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan of Germany, which is aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They are worse because of the problems involving human rights, freedom of printing and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Colonia to open a huge new room.
The city is the home of Turkey's largest population outside Turkey.
The police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came near to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan, many of them Kurdi, are also making it clear, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Opposite protesters reflect the share of the visitor famous as a hero of some German Turks and criticised as an autocrat of others.
Traffic accident on the road in Deptford: a passenger died in battle with a car
A passenger died in a car crash in London.
The case took place near the border crossings of the streets of Bebitud and Evelyn, a traffic jam in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city about 10.15 BST.
The car driver stopped and came to help quickly, but the man died in the accident.
The case took place a few months after the death of another passenger in a traffic accident on the streets of Chaders where the driver escaped, about a mile from the strike on Saturday.
The Metropolitical Police said staff are working to identify the man and inform his family.
The road blocks are set up and the buses are moved and drivers are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartine Prison: Six police officers injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in a man's high-security prison, reported from the prison office.
The disturbances occurred at the HMP Long Martin in Warcesshire about 9.30 BST a week and still last.
Specialists from the "Tornado" unit were brought to resolve the disturbances, which include eight prisoners and were limited in one wing.
Police are treated for minor damage to the place.
The prison spokesman said: “Special trained prison personnel were advised to deal with the current HMP Long Lartine incident.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, but the police will be responsible for it and can spend extra time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartine has 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was announced that the prison governor had received a medical treatment after an attack by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the public order and peace police were called into prison to deal with serious disturbances in which staff were attacked with billiard bullets.
The Russians are threatened by Fenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with floods (may be useful for dry areas)
Tropical depression is rarely taking place to hit Arizona, but it is likely just at the beginning of the next week when the remaining force of the Russian hurricane will pass through the desert-southern region, bringing the risk of sudden floods.
The State Metrological Station has already issued warnings of possible floods for Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, so to the south and east of Nevada, South California and Yuta, including the cities of Phoenix, Flegstaf, Las Vegas and South Lake City.
Rose is expected to move on a straight path through Phoenix Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The state subway station in Phoenix reported in a tweet that “only ten Tropical cycles kept a status of tropical storm or depression in excess of 200 million Fenix since 1950!
Catharina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of Arizona's border."
The latest models of the State Centre for Urgans provide 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated quantities up to 6 inches in the Mongolon work of Arizona.
Other areas of the desert south-west region, including the central parts of the Caribbean Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated places up to 4 inches.
For those outside the risk areas of floods, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Although the flood is a very serious problem, part of this rain is likely to benefit because the southwest region is hit by drought.
According to the U.S. Societies Tracking Body, nearly 40 percent of Arizona faces extreme drought, the second highest category," said weather.com.
First, the route of the Russian hurricane has led to landslides everywhere on the South California island of Mexico.
Rosa, still with a hurricane force in the morning with winds of 85 miles per hour maximum, is 385 miles south of Mount Eugenia, Mexico and moves north with 12 miles per hour.
The storm is coming in contact with wild water in the Pacific and shrinks.
Thus, rain is expected in Mexico with a strong tropical storm in the afternoons or in the evenings on Mondays.
Rains in parts of Mexico can be intense and represent a significant risk of floods.
"There is expected rain from 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to northwestern Sonor, with possible maximum 10 inches rain," said weather.com.
Rose will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in early morning hours on Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and in southern Jutta until late evening hours on Tuesday.
"The main danger expected by Rosa or her remains is the massive floods in Lower California, South-West Sonora and the desert-west region of the United States," said the state center for hurricanes.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening floods and floods, as well as landslides in mountain regions.
Attack in Midsamer Norton: Four Arrested for attempted murder · Global Voices
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested suspected of attempted murder after 16-year-olds were found with fatal injuries in Somerset.
The teenager has been found injured in the area of Excellence Terrace in Midsammer Norton about 4.00 BST on Saturday.
He's taken to the hospital and is in a stable condition.
One 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested during the night in Radstok, the Avon and Somerset police said.
The police asked if anyone had any photos of the case's cell phone.
Tramp said Kavano "has endured the biggest evil and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The voice of Judge Kavano is a voice for the rejection of the most absurd and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Tramp of a convention in Wiling, West Virginia said.
Tramp said Cavano "has endured the biggest evil and anger" of the Democratic Party during its nomination.
Cavano witnessed before the convention on Thursday, strongly and emotionally ignoring Christine Blassi Ford’s accusations that he had been attacked half a dozen decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford witnessed the hearing and her accusations.
The president said on Saturday that "the Americans saw the Brilliantness, Quality and Courage" of Cavano that day.
"The positive vote for Judge Kavano is a vote for confirmation of one of the most successful legal conditions of our time, a lawyer with a record of public service," he said in front of a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president directly mentioned Kavano's nomination while talking about the significance of the republics' departure of early elections.
"A further five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
I'm not running, but I'm really fighting," he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere and I'm fighting for great candidates."
Trip said Democrats have a mission to "response and prevent".
The first key vote on Kavano's nomination in the Senate is expected not later than Friday, the senior GOP manager for CNN said.
Hundreds died in Indonesian earthquake and tsunamis, and the total number of victims is increasing
At least 384 people have died, many have been taken away by the huge waves that hit the beaches, when great earthquakes and tsunamis hit the Indonesian island of Slavési, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for the beach festival in the city of Palo on Friday, when soldiers with a height of 6 feet (18 steps) attacked the coast of the West, bringing many to safety and destroying all their way.
After the earthquake with 7.5 force, he hit the tsunamis.
"When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people still took their activities on the beach and didn't run immediately, so they became victims," Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, the BNPB agency's spokesman for the briefing in Jakarta, said.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, drove cars, trees, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was traveling through the open sea at 800 km/h (497 miles/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people ran to the tree to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos published by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, damaged and damaged bridges and a water-conditioned room.
Follow-up traumas continued to strike the coastal city on Sunday.
The earthquake series was held in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for Assessment and Application of Indonesia's Technology (BPPT) said the energy released from the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times more than the energy released from the atomic bomb in Hiroshima in the second world war.
The geographical position of the city, which lies at the end of the long, long, en coast, can strengthen the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "miss" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found buried under the dust of broken buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said the victims and the damage could be increased along the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in the area called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
The communication "was completely damaged without any information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday that it did not inform that tsunamis hit Palu, although the authorities said the defences came at the same time as the warning was issued.
A amateur photo shared by social media can be heard by a man on the roofs of the building as he calls inconsistency, warning people down the street of the nearby tsunami.
Within a few minutes, the wall of water falls on the coast, carrying buildings and cars with it.
Reuters couldn't confirm the photo right away.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have caused a stop in power to cut off communications about Paul, threatening authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
The military started sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but refugees still desperately need food and other basic needs.
The city airport was reopened only for help and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Vidodo was planning to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The total number of victims in the tsunami in Indonesia is over 800.
It's really bad.
While World Vision staff from Dongala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees were asleep in burial places at their office yard, they passed through empty scenes, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began to try to start disaster relief efforts, some complained that foreign aid experts were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, financial support, asylum and foreign personnel can only begin to arrive if the location of the disaster has been declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Auliya Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"What the government will say, 'All right, this is a national disaster', we can accept international assistance, but there's still no status'.
As the second night of the earthquake and tsunami in Palau fell on Friday, friends and families of missing ones still hoped that their loved ones would be a miracle that would facilitate the black story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the canalization.
On Sunday the rescuers rescued a woman who had been dragged under the hook for two days with her mother's body to her.
Ghendon Subandano, the trainer of the Indonesian state paragliding team, trained two of the missing paraglers for Asian games, which ended at the beginning of the month in Indonesia.
The others who were in the Roa Roa Hotel, added Mr. Mandhei, were his students.
"As a senior in the field of Paraguay, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gandon told me how, when she started circling news about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the paraglyders community, he was desperate to send a message to whatsApp to the players from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages ended only with a dry seal, instead of a son.
"I think that means that messages are not delivered," he said.
The thieves stole $26,750 from filling banks at the "New Market"
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from an employee in Brink's who added a bankat to the "Newport of Cay," according to Newport police station press release.
The car driver emptied the bank into the entertainment complex and prepared to supplement it with money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarty in the statement.
While he was busy, another man "dryed behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that was intended for delivery.
The Witnesses noted more suspects as they fled from the crime scene, according to the report, but the police did not give a specific number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information about their identities should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kana West: The rapper changed his name to Ya
Rapper Kana West changed his name to Him.
The change was announced on Twitter on Saturday. He wrote: "The society used to be known as Kanya West".
Forty - one - year - old West carried his past and used it for his eight album, which was published in June.
The change took place just before his visit to Saturday Night Live, where his new album "Yandhi" was expected to be published.
He will replace the singer Ariana Grande with the show who had to give up for "emotional reasons", said the artist of the show.
Although he uses it as a shortcut to his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and that means 'ti'," said West at the beginning of this year, discussing his album's title with Radio Big Boy.
"What means I am you, I am us, it is us.
From Canaan, which means the only one, to Him alone, the reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more about what we are."
He is one of the many famous rappers who changed his name.
Shawn Combs is known as Paf Daddy, Pius Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love (Love and Brother Love).
Former co-operative of West, Jay Zy, also uses his name with or without a drawing and all the big letters.
AMLO from Mexico promises he won't use the military on civilians
Mexico's U.S. president Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador promises that he will never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th year of bloody repression against the students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolko Plaza that "he will never use the army for the repression of the Mexican people".
The military fired peaceful protesters at the platform on October 2, 1968, killing even 300 people at the time when the left-wing student movements were incinerated in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador insisted that he would support young Mexicans by providing monthly assistance to those studying and opening up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double the funding of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, so the US should double its research resources in the field, the investor and practitioners for AI, Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments came after various parts of the US government made statements about artificial intelligence, even though the US has no formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China has introduced its plan last year: it is attempting to be number 1 in technology intelligence innovations by 2030.
"The suspension of the patent intelligence budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far ahead of the US, and we are looking for the next discovery in engineering," Li said.
The suspension of the funds can double the chances that the next major achievement in the AI area will do it to the US, Li said in an interview for CNBC Sunday.
Li, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published monthly by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, a Director-General of Sinovation Ventures, who invests in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the '80s, Carnegie Melon, he worked on a technical intelligence system that won the highest rank of American suit player, and later was a director at Microsoft Research and president of Google's border in China.
Are they grateful for the past competitions on US government technology as a challenge to the Agency's robotics for further research projects in the defence and ask when the next competition will be to help identify the following visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often need to work hard to get state grants, Li said.
"It's not China that takes academic leaders, it's corporations," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have been working experts from universities to work on professional intelligence in recent years.
Li said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States improve its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that "green maps" should automatically be offered to doctors of sciences by artificial intelligence," he said.
China's state council issued its Plan for the development of future generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese State Science Foundation finances people in academic institutions like the way the Natural Sciences Foundation and other government organizations spend money on US researchers, but job quality is lower in China, Li said.
Last year the US Defence Ministry set up a Joint Engineering Intelligence Centre, which should cover industry and academia partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Technical Intelligence Committee.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment for the initiative called "AI Next".
With regard to NSF, they currently invest more than $100 million per year in research on artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the legislation of the United States that required the establishment of the National Security Commission of Art Intelligence had no monthly activities.
Macedonians vote at a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
People in Macedonia voted on a referendum on Sunday whether to change its name in the Northern Macedonia Republic, a move to resolve a decade's dispute with Greece that would block its demands for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour's name represents a right to take over its territory and cast a vote on its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Orthodox population.
President George Ivanov said that he would not vote on the referendum and the boycott campaign would raise doubts as to whether the output would meet the minimum 50 per cent required for the validity of the referendum.
The referendum lawyer's question was, "Are you going to join NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change in the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is worth paying to allow entry into the body as EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that appeared after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia to live freely under the yoke of the European Union because that means safer lives for all of us," 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska said in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make decisions.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is needed to change the name.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, the output was 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in previous parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters gave their vote.
"I went out to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," 62-year-old Goose Tanevski, a voter in the capital city, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko gave their voice to the Macedonian referendum for a change in the country's name, which will open the country's way to enter NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Strumica.
Before parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Cavadarkov was preparing a small scene and tables in front of the people who would vote against the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go with our heads up high, not from the back entrance," Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor countries, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO's membership would bring much needed investments to Macedonia, which has a rate of unemployment of over 20 per cent.
"I believe that the majority will be because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
He said the result "yes" will be "a confirmation of our future".
The poll, published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is under the necessary heading.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian television Telma showed that 57 per cent of voters are planning to vote weekly.
Of these, 70 percent will vote with yes.
To be successful, the output must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failed referendum would be the first serious blow to Western government's policy after it came to power in May last year.
Look: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passed the entire defence of Brayton for Gol
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling quickly defeated Brayton's defense in the 2-0 battle for Manchester City on the Etikhad Stadium Saturday in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his stroke look so simple in the 65th minute.
Argentinian attacker got a midpoint on the ground at the beginning of the sequence.
It quickly passed between three defense players in Brayton, before they entered the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four greens.
It's about a defense player before he gets into a couple of other things from Brayton's six-year-old.
Then he gave it to the left of it, to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first arrival to the six-year-old to return Aguero's ball with his right leg to defeat the brayton's goal, Matthew Ryan, with the only hit on the right side of the network.
"Aguero has foot problems," City manager Pep Gvardiola said to journalists.
"We talked about playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky you gave me a bullet at that time."
But the initial advantage of the "heavenly Sons" gave Sterling in the fight for the Prime Minister League.
The bread came in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a long ball in Brayton's territory in that game.
He sent a wonderful direct ball along the left side to Liroy Shane.
Shane touched her a couple of times before she took Sterling to the remote article.
The attack on "heavenly Sons" brought the ball into the network before they went into the car.
City will fight Hofenheim in a contest of the League of Champions' League on Tuesday, 12.55 in the Rain-Nekar arena, Germany.
Chercher wants to play a player against Rokis.
Since Neshnels was eliminated from the fight for playoff, there was no reason to force another start.
But the competitive Sherzer is always hoping to stop in the central square on Sunday against Colorado Rokis, but only if there are still applications for a playoff for the Rokis team, which run a competition in front of Los Angeles Dogers in the Western National League.
The Rokis team had at least a "joker" for a 5–2 hit spot over Nesnels on Friday evening, but they are still fighting to establish their place in the first division.
"Although it doesn't play for anything, at least we will be able to fly by knowing that the atmosphere here in Denmark with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any moment I'll face this year.
Why don't you want me to compete with that?"
Nesnels still need to announce a week’s start, but it is unlikely that they will allow Sherzer to escape in such a situation.
Sherzer, who's gonna start 34 times, trained to throw up on Thursday and usually throw up a week's rest.

Tramp Myths in West Virginia
The president directly mentioned the situation about his election of Bret Kavano for the Supreme Court while talking about the importance of the republicans' exit of early elections.
"All we've done so far will be put on a cat in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important choices of our time.
This is one of the big, big – I'm not running, but I'm really fighting, so I'm everywhere fighting for great candidates," he said.
Tramp continues, “You see these terrible, terrible groups of democracies, you see what is happening right now.
And they are determined to regain their power by using all the resources available to them, viewing evil, incompatibility.
They don't care who they're gonna hurt, when they're going to get power and control, that's what they want power and control, but we won't give them."
Democrats, he said, have a mission to "response and prevent".
"You see it in the last four days," he said, calling the democracies "heavy, evil, unjust and unjust."
He mentioned Senator Diana Fainstin of the rules of democracy, set up by the Senate Court Committee, on behalf of which the public responded to threats of unrest.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Oh, oh, what.
No, no, wait a minute – it was a very bad speech of the body – the worst speech of the body I've ever seen.”
The labs no longer accept different opinions.
Those who express their opinion do not tolerate
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted against me, it was almost no surprise.
However, I am only the last of the members of the parliament of the laboratory party to whom he has been told we are not welcome – just because he expresses his opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because he took a decisive stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
For the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, for Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
The statement on the meeting of the Eastern Laborist Party of Nottingam stated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of my eight years as a member of the parliament of the Laborist Party, the Council meetings on Friday evening were just like that.
Unfortunately, today, it is not the tone of most meetings, but the promise of a "relief, low" policy has long been forgotten, if it really has ever begun.
It becomes clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the laboratory party, and each opinion is judged to be acceptable to the party’s leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom I thought we had previously shared a similar political thought began to expect me to completely change my mind and take a position that I would never take, no matter whether it is a matter of national security or of the EU's internal market.
When I speak publicly, and it really doesn't matter what I'm saying, it's a critical abuse of social media that calls for condemnation, rejection of central policies, telling me I shouldn't be in the lab party.
And I'm not the only one with this experience.
In fact, I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me are usually political.
I have a great deal of concern about professionalism and the determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexual or racist abuses every day, but they never withdraw.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this age in politics is that the level of abuse has become normal.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the lab party should practice tolerance culture.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions and with every request for "untrusted" or change of the rules of selection, the party becomes more demanding.
I've received much advice over the past two years, telling me to keep my head down, not being so loud, and then "it's gonna be okay".
But that's not why I came into politics.
Just 32 years ago, when I joined the lab party as a student, driven by the carelessness of the Tacher government that literally left my school to fail, I fought to improve public services for those who needed them, whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, including the last elections.
No one in East Nottingham could be confused in any way about my political attitudes and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the request on Friday, all I want to tell them is that when the country goes hard on Braghiz to harm households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the lab party.
But I have a message that's not about Notingham Momentum, but for my voters, whether they're members of the lab party or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no matter how much of the criminal threats or political opportunism I will survive, nothing will stop me from doing the way I think it's in the best interest of all of you.

Ear 38 - 17 Melrous: The Unconquered Ear goes to the top
The two late points may have changed the final result somewhere, but there is no doubt that Earl deserves the triumph in this wonderful fun competition on the day of the Scottish Empire in the streets.
They are now on the top of the table, the only winner side of the ten.
In the end, they owe everything to their superior defenses, as well as to their better use of opportunities, which brought the household team, and trainer Peter Murchi has the right to be satisfied.
"We were tested through our competitions so far and we're still unvicted, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Cristy of Melrous said: “Thank you for Earl, they used their chances better than us. ”
Grant Anderson's point in 14 minutes, converted by Fraser Climo, gave him the advantage of Earl, but the ticket card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, given to the game of Woriors, enabled Melrous to improve the numbers, and Jason Baggot stole an unconverted point.
Clymo owes him the lead of Aar with a pen, just in half an hour, so he reached a point, and he turned a salt point to get 17 - 5 for Ear in the rescue.
But Melrous well began the second half, and Patrick Andreson's point, converted by Baggot, reduced the leadership of five points.
Then there was a long detention due to the serious injury of Rurid Nott, who was brought to the nose, and from the beginning, Earl was still struggling with the point of Stafford McDoual, converted by Climo.
Er's VD captain, Blair Mcferson, then got a letter card and again, Melrous paid for the extra man with an unconverted point at Bruce Colvin at the end of time with a unpleasant pressure.
However, the household team is back, and when Struan Hachson gets a letter card for the Climus without the ball, McPherson produces a straight line of panels on the back of the Great Air Attack.
Climo converted, as he did almost again from the reboot, after Kyle Roy took David Armstrong's hit and sent winged player Gregor Henry to the fifth point for the team.
Still Game star looks ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
The "Still Game" star, Ford Kiran, seems ready to move into the entertainment industry after it has been found to be known as the director of a licensed company restaurant.
Fifty-six-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the BBC's popular series, which he is a scenarioist and plays with a long-term partner in the comedy, Greg Hemfil.
The couple announced that the next nine season would be the last, and Kirnan seems to be planning for life after Kregling.
According to the official records, he is Director of the Affonorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the source of the Scottish Sun said Kirnan was trying to get involved in the "good restaurant trade" of Glazgov.
"The sea is ours": Bolivian surrounded with mud hopes that the court will reopen a path to the Pacific
Marines patrol the hidden and laminated marine seat in La Paz.
The public buildings have set up a marine son-in-law.
The maritime bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are highlighted with the motto: “The sea is our right.
It's our duty to come back."
Under the fall of Bolivia, the mention of the coast lost in favour of Chile in a conflict of resources in the 19th century is still fresh, just as it is the tide to reflow across the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may now be the biggest in decades, while Bolivia is waiting for an international court decision on October 1 after five years of debate.
"Bolivia has the moment, a spirit of unity and peace and of course expects a positive outcome," said Roberto Calssaya, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision taken by the international court of large screens everywhere in the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will judge in favour of Bolivia's conviction that, after decades of changing talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate to assign a sovereign exit to the Bolivian sea.
Here Morales, Bolivia's charismatic president with a home-based background, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also much depends on the trial on Monday.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will probably not judge Bolivia’s benefit and that it will not even change its value.
The UN body with a seat in the Netherlands is unable to assign Chile's territory and said it will not decide on the outcome of the possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice only comes six months after the final arguments indicates that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zarate, an expert on international law from Chile.
And in the last four years, maybe they've found Bolivia's cause instead of improving it.
"The current Bolivian administration has used the problem with access to the sea for its own purposes," Zarate said.
Morales' military retraced the rest of Chile's good will, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not had the exchange of Ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguet Welce, a Bolivian representative in Hague, rejected the idea that making a court decision is unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an incredible opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end of 139 years of inconsistencies with loan benefits," he said.
Calsania also denied that Morales, one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the sea problem as a political support.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we should go beyond the past."
North Korea says she won't come to nuclear disarmament unless she can't trust the United States
Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Young Ho, says his nation will never disarmament its nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington.
Rey spoke on Saturday before the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to keep its promises during the Singapore summit between rival leaders.
His comments came at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompey was on the task of restoring blocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Young Un.
Ri says it's "fiction" to be considered that the continued sanctions and US sanctions for the declaration of the end of the Korean war will bring North Korea to a knees.
Washington's precautionary to agree with the without Pjongging Declaration first to take significant disarmament measures.
And Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is a great sceptic that Pyongyang is serious about giving up the arsenal that the country is likely to see as the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompey plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim-Tramp's second summit.
Paris fashion magazines reveal the latest line of massive hats that is on the way to the biggest sellers in your neighborhood
If you want to improve the size of your collection cap or completely block the sun, then don't keep looking.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a series of huge hats for their SS19 collection on the track that hid the style set at the fashion week in Paris.
In the end, the non-practical hats launched the Instagram flight, and these designers sent out their creatures that fall in the eyes of the track.
The park that was noted by Valentino was a huge escape hat decorated with a wide range of beads that washed the head of the model.
The other big supplements included crickets, purple hats, and even pineapples, but they're not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also discovered a selection of white masks, and it's time for the Night of the Witches.
Many of the colourful masks had wrapped lips and represented more of the Hannibal Laker than the high fashion.
One creation consisted of a drilling equipment full of eyes and a pumpkin, and the other looked like a step-by-step ice cream.
And if you continue with the great fashion statement, you're lucky.
Followers of the style predict that huge hats can come to the sellers in your neighborhood.
The big hats came very quickly after "La Bomba", the shameless hat with two broad steps that all bear from Riana to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult fashion house behind the very non-practical hat spread through the social media sends another big creation on the track, a broken beach bag with almost the same size as the model she drew.
The dark Portuguese coffee bag, with a coffeeboard and a white leather hand, was part of the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jamesus of the Modal Week in Paris.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to the FC: "I expect to see the big hats and beach bags in the sellers next summer, because the designer caused so much influence that it would be difficult to ignore the search for extra-sellers."
John Edward: Language Skills Needed for Global Citizens · Global Voices
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence, and this continues in 2018 with yet another set of outstanding results of studies, which is only reinforced with individual and group success in sports, art, music and other communities.
With more than 30,000 students everywhere in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are trying to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare their students for continuing and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As an educational center that can design and implement suitable educational programs, we see that modern languages are still popular and popular as a selected subject in schools.
Nelson Mendela said: “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it will make him feel good.
If you speak to him in his tongue, it will strike him in the soul."
This is a powerful reminder that we can't be prepared in English only when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent findings of the survey, we can note that languages are passing over all other subjects with the highest percentage of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who learned foreign languages achieved a higher rating of 5+.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of the students achieved a higher "5+" in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who learned French, and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also reached "5".
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly achieve in the future.
Languages now, as an election item, are viewed at the same level as STEM-objects (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics) in programmes of independent schools, as well as elsewhere.
The 2014 EC Employment and Skills Commission survey noted that due to the failure of employers to fill jobs, 17 per cent were due to lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills become increasingly responsible for preparing young people for their future careers.
With the ever - increasing demand for languages, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
No matter what career one may choose, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such experience.
The ability to communicate directly to people from foreign countries will automatically give him the advantage of gambling before competition.
According to YouGov’s poll of over 4,000 adults from the OK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak foreign languages well enough to speak, and French was the only language they spoke more than ten percent, i.e. 15 percent of people.
So investing in learning languages is now important to children today.
Having more languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ according to the language it teaches.
A number of schools will focus on classical modern languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be the most important in the world when it will be viewed in the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child’s interests are, there will always be numerous languages that can be selected from independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this area.
The Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed for success, regardless of what the future may bring.
At the moment, it cannot be ignored, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital for the future of the country, so this must be done in schools.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
"It must be done well" (it must be done).
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Lebron will lead Lakers to debate in San Diego on Sunday
The waiting is almost over for trainers who wanted to see Lebron James to start for Los Angeles Lakes.
Lakers' trainer Luke Walton said James will play the first game in the premise on Sunday against Daver Nagets in San Diego.
But the minute he'll play, he's not decided yet.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudel wrote a tweet that James would probably play a limited time.
After training on the beginning of the week, James was asked about his plans for the schedule of six events before the Lakers season.
"I don't need games in the pretense at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
South Tyob Channel for Trip's Mitting in West Virginia
President Donald Trump started a series of myths as part of the campaign tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five ordered minutes of Trump next week, including visits to remote places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm his election to fill the empty space in the Supreme Court is in peace, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, because the Republicans can lose control at the Congress with the vote in November.
How long is Tramp's tonight's rally in West Virginia and how do you look over the Internet?
Tramp's Mitting in Wiling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 Sundays. A weather zone on the east coast tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see Tramp's mything in West Virginia via the Internet with live transmission to YouTube.
This week it is likely that Trump will turn to the hearing of the person nominated for the Supreme Court, Bret Kavano, who has become tense because of the charges of sexual misconduct with the expected delay of voting in the Senate for one week while the FBI's investigation continues.
The primary objective of the series of mitens is to help the Republicans get a lock on the elections in November .
Since then, President Tramp's campaign has said that these five minutes next week are directed to "incentives of volunteers and supporters because the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control at the congress is so important in his agenda that the president will travel to the more associated countries at the beginning of the campaign's hard season," a spokesman from the Tramp campaign for Reuters, who refused to be nominated.
Ordered in the Wesbanko arena in Wiling, tonight's rally can attract supporters from "Ohaio and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media", according to the news from the Metro from West Virginia.
On Saturday, the second trip to Trump in West Virginia last month, the country where he won more than 40 per cent points in 2016.
Tramp is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who remains on the polls.
"It's not good for Morrisey that the president has to come to improve the popularity of the polls," said Simon Hider, a politician from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Cup Ryder 2018: The US team showed courage in the fight to keep the hopes of the beginning of individual contests in the week
After three weeks of solitary confinement, the four of us may have been just what they needed at the Cup Rayder.
The reverse of happiness is a fully formed sport concept, but players really believe in it, and most of these conflicts.
To whom would you say happiness is now?
"They had six points, and now they're four, so we're a little lucky I guess," Jordan Spit said after the end of today's competition.
Europeans have the advantage of, of course, leadership of four points and still twelve games.
The Americans, according to Spit, feel that they have a weak wind in the garden even though they have enough potency, if nothing else then the shape of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each reached three points of four.
Spit was great and led by example.
These strong challenges of praise became stronger during his game, with a key hit that led to four-four-year-old balance when he and Thomas had two failures after two rounds.
His hit with 15 was expected with a similar challenge, saying he believes that the American team is not out of play.
"You just have to be heavy and take care of your competition," Spit said.
That's all that each player has left right now.
18 dots to reach a point.
The only players with more points from Spit and Thomas in the last two days are French Molinarians and Tommy Fletwood, the independent story of the Cup Rayder.
It's strange, but the beautiful length of Europe is 4 out of 4 and they can't make mistakes.
"Molivid" was the only couple without bad hits on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bad hits on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the previous nine on Friday morning.
That series and the way they seem to run their energy up to and out of this band ensures that they are players that will win weekly and that there will be no other popular players that will provide a potential European victory when the sun comes behind Le Golf National, except Flytwood or Molinarians.
It's preferable both at the same time on different holes.
However, the talks about European glory remain unfair.
Bob Watson and Web Samson soon met Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of two couples, when he joined Alex Norren.
Two of the first nine were struck by a fatal blow by the Spanish and the Swedes in a hole from which they had never been able to get out.
In a week, however, there's no one who can help you get out of the hole.
The two couples and the four are so fascinating to look close because of the interaction between partners, the advice they give, the advice they do not listen to, and the way the strategy can change at once.
Europeans played better than a team and thus made significant leadership in the last day, but the four-day season also showed that the US team could fight even though some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europeans led with 10-6 on the last day of Cup Rayder
Europe will enter with a solid advantage on the last day of the Cup Rayder after Saturday's lead in two couples and four 10-6 before the United States.
The inspired Duo Tommy Flytwood and French Molinari led the attack with two victories while Tiger Woods tried to take control of Le Golf National for four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, which fought to keep the trophies he lost in Haseltin two years ago, dominated the American team that had a lot of failures in the morning's two couples and won the 3-1 series.
The Americans fought more resistance in the four, winning two contests, but they couldn't get the lead.
Jim Furic's team needs eight points of 12 individual games a week to keep the trophy.
Fletwood is the first European beginner who won four points consecutively, while he and Molinari, called "Molivid", after the sensory weekend, are the second pair that won four points in the first four matches in the history of the Cup Rayder.
After "smelling" Woods and Patrick Reid in two pairs, they played well and won the invented Woods and American beginner Brown Dashambu with an even more explicit result 5&4.
Woods, who ran through two swords on Saturday, was currently playing great, but now he lost 19 of the 29 matches in two pairs and four and seven times in order.
Justin Rose, who stayed as the morning two couples, came back as Henrik Stanson's partner in the four matches with the defeat 2&1 of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the first and the third in the world.
However, the Europeans were not following their friendly, windy day in the south-west of Paris.
Three-time Dominant Winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas have taken action for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They achieved a decisive victory of 2&1 over Spanish John Rahm and Ian Pulter in the two pairs and returned later to defeat Pulter and Rory McCloy with 4&3 in four, but lost the first two holes.
Only two times in the history of the Cup Rayder team has been equipped with a lack of four points in an individual game, although as the holder of the title, the Furic team has had enough equal results to maintain the trophie.
After two days, however, the weekly attack seems to remain over them.
North Korea says "there's no chance of disarmament" unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepen the United States' mistrust and that the country is not in a position to give up nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ray Young Ho told the annual World Body General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant measures of good will" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear missiles tests, decompose nuclear testing facilities and is committed to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see an appropriate answer from the United States." he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such conditions there will be no unilateral means of disarmament first."
Although Rei reiterated the well-known complaints of North Korea against Washington's approach to nuclear disarmament "in the phase", according to which North Korea would be gradually rewarded for the transitional steps, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral, nuclear disarmament, without discussion, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Rei praised a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Tramp at the first summit of the current US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed to "nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula", while Trump gave security assurance to North Korea.
North Korea seeks a formal end to the Korean war from 1950 to 53, but the United States claims that Piongyang must first withdraw from nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to impose strict international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'nuclear disarmament first of all' and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and they even oppose the 'declaration of the end of the war'," Rí said.
"The perception that sanctions can not be clogged on the knee is a crazy dream of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that existing sanctions prolong our mistrust."
Rei didn't mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Tramp, which the American leader put in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Jayin in the last five months and added: "As far as the other side of this nuclear disarmament problem was South Korea, instead of the United States, nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not end in such a crisis."
However, Rei's speech tone was significantly different from last year's, when he said before the UN General Assembly that the guidance of North Korean rockets to the US is inevitable after "Mr. Bad President" Tramp called Kim "ractor" with a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trip, which last year threatened with "total destruction" of North Korea, much more than Kim thanked for his courage to take steps to disarmament, but said that there was still much work to be done and that sanctions must remain until the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a time frame for this, saying "Do you need two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongging for the steps taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The sanctions of the Security Council must continue completely and without exception until complete, final nuclear disarmament is confirmed."
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea in 2006 to prevent the financing of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in Pjongging.
Pompey met Ri at the margins of the UN General Assembly, and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
The pump has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last time it didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July with a statement that he had made progress, but he was denied from North Korea only after a few hours because of "aggressive demands".
North Korea is committed to a meeting with Mun this month for the disarmament of a rocket building, as well as a nuclear complex that the United States takes "relevant measures".
He said Kim told him "the appropriate measures" he asked for are the security guarantees that Tramp gave to Singapore, as well as his efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students visit courses to get enough rest
A new university course in Harvard this year aims to teach all diplomats more sleep to fight the growing macho culture of learning by staying awake all night with the help of caffeine.
One researcher found that students of the world’s leading university often don’t know anything when it comes to primary care.
Charles Cajzler, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Women's Hospital Briggam, designed the course he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to begin the course after holding a talk about the effect of unpleasant sleep on the study.
"At the end of the transmission a girl came and said to me, "Why are you telling me this now, in the last year?"
She said that no one, he never told her about the importance of sleeping--what surprised me," he said about the Telegraph.
The course that was first offered this year explains to the students the basis for how good sleep habits help academic and athletic outcomes, and also improve the general well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students have a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The same time course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a student home where students press coffee, teasing, potatoes and books to find out about the effects of caffeine and light and how unpleasant sleep affects athletic results and the importance of the routine of going to bed.
On the other hand, participants learn how a long - term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks and stroke, depression, and cancer.
The map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change the students' behaviour right away.
But we believe they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know about the health effects when you choose to smoke cigarettes," added Professor Chanzler.
The culture of pride with "work all night" still exists, he said, and in addition modern technology and increased pressure on students means that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
To have enough sleep, with good quality, should be the "secret weapon" of a student in the fight against stress, depression and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight loss, because the lack of sleep causes the brain to move into a hunger regime, which makes them always hungry.
Raymond Sou, a 19-year-old California student of chemistry and physics, helped Professor Chazler design the course, after visiting one of his hours last year, in his first year in Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to act for a course throughout the student city.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all graduates to complete a similar program before they join the competition institution.
Professor Chanzler recommends that students think about setting up an alarm when they go to bed, as well as when they wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of the "son of light" that emerges from electronic screens and LED light, which puts off the circular rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga's Golto gathers Jerard's people
Reingers suffered another devastating, sad day when Dolly Menga's attack sent Stephen Gerard's decisive team to the battle with 1-0 in Livingstone.
Aybrox team wanted to record its first victory after the February 4-1 triumph in St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team won the second defeat of Gerard's team in 18 games as a manager who left his team with eight points behind the escape team Harts in the Scottish first league.
Menga was focusing seven minutes before the middle of the day, and Reingers' position lost inspiration and chances of balance.
Now, Reingers fell to the sixth place, and Livingston jumped to the third and only behind the Hibernian by the difference in his head.
There may be additional problems waiting for Rangers after linear judge Kalum Spence had to receive medical assistance because of his head injury after he was clearly hit by a remote object.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that passed Air in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, was playing with the same 11 in Livingstone that won a score with Harts last week and would be happy in the way his well-educated position pushed the opponents at every chance.
Rangers may have dominated the possession over the ball, but Livingstone made more with the ball than them.
They were supposed to reach a point, two minutes after the start of Menga's first play, when Scott Pittman passed to Alan McGregor's head, but the player in the middle row missed the chance.
Then a far-reaching attack by Kihan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner Alan Litgou could only play open in defense.
Rangers managed to control the game, but it seemed that there was more hope than faith in their game in the last three years.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt he should get a pen in the fifteenth minute when Stephen Loules and Judge Stephen Thompson did not give a sign of approval of the Colombian complaint.
Reingers managed to achieve only two shots to the hungry in the first half of the year, but the former Golmen of Aybros Liam Kelly did not strike with the head of Lasana Culibali and the weak hit of These Edaria.
Although the beginning of the 34th minute of Livingstone may have been opposed during the game, no one can deny that they deserved their game.
Reingers failed to deal with Jacobs' strike again.
Scott Alfred didn't respond when Declan Galager added Scott Robinson's ball, which with a cold head chose Menga for a simple end.
Gerard reacted during the half-life when he replaced Kulabali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a rapid effect when the wing player passed Morelos, but impressive Kelly reacted from her blockade line.
But Livingston managed to attract host players to play the type of game they enjoy, while Litgou and Haket took a lot of long-term additions.
Holt's team could've extended the lead to the end of the game, but McGregor was well placed and prevented Jacobs from playing with his head on the corner.
Reingers' replacement, Glen Middleton had another request for a pen since he met with Jacobs, but Tomson refused again.
Almanah: The Fascist of the Gagger Count
And now one side of our Almanac "On Sunday morning": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, and ADBROYUM ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Gajger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which led to the creation of a device known as a gigger number.
Since then, it has become the main cause of science, the gay figure has become the main cause of popular culture, such as in the 1950s "Colorado's bell", where they seem incredible, Cuban scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, "What is that?"
Rogers: “It’s a gay number, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put your ears, you can hear the effects of the atoms that release radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans says, it's probably jumping now!
Hans Hayger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name still exists.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the infected cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the infected cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of the treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from patients and their changes in laboratory
You can see protein honour in many types of cancer and then be returned to the organism
The test vaccine provides promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
To a woman treated with the vaccine, which was taught by the immune system to recognize the infected cells, the arm of the ovaries disappeared for 18 months.
The method includes the removal of immunological cells from the patient, their changes in the laboratory, so that they can "see" protein part in many types of cancer called HER2, and then their return to the organism.
Professor Jay Berzofski, of the American National Institute for Cancer of Betezda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate we have a promising vaccine."
HER2 "incentives the growth of several types of cancer", including cancer of the cities, ovaries, pellets and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofski.
A similar approach with the removal of immunological cells from patients and their "study" to tergetize cancer cells works in the treatment of certain types of leukemia.
Kanje West made a pro-Tramp fall, wearing a cap with his moto, then jumping into the Saturday evening alive.
That didn't go well.
Kanje West was noted in the study during the live show on Saturday evening, after a useless step in which US President Donald Tramp failed and said he would run for a function in 2020.
After the third song that evening, called The City of Spirits, which was wearing a hat with a sign to make America famous again, he began to criticise the democracies and renew his support for Trump.
"Many times when I talk to someone, they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd have been moving from America for a long time," he said.
On Saturday, a lively evening show began with a interview with Matt Damon in which Hollywood star was laughing at Bret Kavano's testimony to the Senate's legal committee, related to accusations of sexual assault on Christine Blaise Ford.
Although not released, the West's western photo was posted on social media by Commissioner Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to laugh at West with the statement.
West also appealed to the public that he had gone behind the scene because of his hat.
"They laughed at me from the stage.
They told me, "Don't show up with that hat."
They're laughing at me!
Then they told me I was in the basement, he said, according to Washington Egzeminer.
West continued: "Do you want to see the underworld?" He said he'd put his superman button, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go on?
Try with love."
His comments drew attention to the public’s neglect at least twice, and the evening show team seemed embarrassed, reports Varajeti, a man said to the publisher: “The entire study is taking place. ”
West was brought as a replacement at the last moment for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, Raper McMiller died a few days ago.
The news surprised many with the performance of the song "I love it," dressed as a Perier bottle.
News received support from the leader of the TPSAD Conservative Group, Kendis Tarner, who wrote on Twitter: “For one of the bravest spirits: You bless what is happening in the crowd. ”
But the owner of the show Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was "his own and that's absolutely beautiful."
"But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") for whom I believe to accept and spread an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So did we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, while he is now "formally known as Caine West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow the steps of Didi, known as Paf Daddy, Paf and P Didi.
Collegiate rapper, Snup Dog has the name Snup Lion and of course the famous music legend Prince has changed his name in symbol, and then in an artist of the past known as Prince.
Indicted for attempted murder at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after he shot a man at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Balihakmore, the police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the high court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the public prosecutor.
The star from the Trinov game series, Kit Harington, attacked the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as an expert fighter like John Snow in the violent, medieval, fantastic series of Tronov games.
But the actor, 31, attacked Maco-hero's stereotype, when he said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they must be strong enough to be respected.
In a statement on the cultural part of Sanday Times, Kitt said he believes "something's wrong" and asks how to deal with the problem of toxicity in #SegaKajawam's area.
Kitt, recently married to the star of the Tronov game, Rosie Lesley, also 31, admits that there are "strong feelings" on that issue.
"I personally have strong feelings, at the moment - where did we make a mistake with the man?," he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up about the problems we now see?"
Kitt believes that television may be partly responsible for the growth of toxic manpower, thanks to strong male characters.
He continued: “What have you been given, and what have you learned?
What do you learn from TV and on the street, what makes young boys feel that they must have a certain aspect of manship?
I think that's one of the big issues in our time - how do we change that?
Because it's obvious that something's wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also acknowledged that he would not participate in the continuation of the Tronov game when the series ended next summer, saying that it was "completed with battles and horses".
As of November, Kitt will re-enter the True West of Sam Shepard, who is told about a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently found out that he was thinking about what he met with his wife, Rose, was the best job she ever had since the Tronov game.
"I met my wife in this series, so in a certain way she gave me my future family and my life in the future," he said.
Rose was playing the game, a guy who had a loving attraction to Kit's face, John Snow, in the fantastic series that Amy won the prize.
The couple were married in June 2018 to Lesley's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and Sida.
More than 820,000 people are infected in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The largest number of new cases were transmitted through sex, which has been changed in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who have HIV this way is reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities say a conference in the province of Yunan.
Each year, however, the number of those living with HIV and Sida in China has grown to 100,000 people.
The transfer of HIV through sex is an issue of the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was condemned in China in 1997, but the discrimination of LGBT people is great.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will ever marry women.
Many of the transmissions of disease are due to inappropriate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the data transmitted by a member of staff associated with the Republican party's senator as "dangerous lies" and "precious theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters rejected charges on Saturday that a member of her staff published personal information to three Republican senators in the United States on the pages of Wikipedia's legislators.
The democracy of Los Angeles convinced that the claims were of "ultra-right" sympathies and web-locations.
" Lies, lies, and even worse lies," Wutters said in Twitter's statement.
The published information reportedly includes home address and telephone numbers of American Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orine Hech from Yuta.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill while holding the Senate panel hearing charges of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavano, appointed to judge the Supreme Court.
The information presented appeared shortly after Kavano was asked by three senators.
Conservative locations such as Gateway Pandit and Redsteit have announced that the IP address identifying the source of the statement is linked to Waters' office and information has been published about Walters' staff member, Hill said.
"These unfortunate accusations are completely false and represent absolute lies," Wutters continued.
"My staff member - whose identity, personal information and security are compromised as a result of those false and false accusations - is in no way responsible for the information brought out.
The unfortunate charges are completely false and absolute lies."
Waters' statement quickly attracted criticism from the Internet, including the former Secretary for the White House's printing, Ari Flejcher.
"These denials are nervous," Flejcher wrote.
"This shows that she has no temperature to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something that he has not done, he should not be offended.
He can't be challenged.
He can't ask himself about the motive of the prosecutor.
He must remain calm and calm."
Flecher seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticisms of the democratics associated with Judge Cavanno, who was accused of critics because he seemed too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navaro, a Republican candidate who was running to replace Waters in the middle of the mandate's elections, also announced Twitter.
"If it's true, that's a big deal," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement Waters said that her office informed "the competent institutions and the police of false claims.
"We will enable criminals to be found," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to some and all my staff."
The idea of Johnny English Attacks Again - Undercovered the spy frauds of Rowan Atkinson
Now it is traditional to look for elements of Brigade in every new British-related film, and that seems to be important for this renewal of the fake, action comedy Johnny Inglesh - which started in 2003 with Johnny English and reborn in 2011 with Johnny English: reborn.
Would careful self - scrutiny on the subject of how clearly we are anywhere would be the new opportunity to export the nation’s possession?
However, the face with big eyes and many grunts of uncompetitive Johnny Inglesh got the license to "stop" the stuff a second time - his name means above all that he is a comical creature with a wide cover made for film viewers in places where English is not spoken.
He's certainly a shadow of a secret agent who, despite his sincere efforts to watch a little glaze on Cluzo, has drawings from Mr. Bin and part of the boy who played a note from the song Kochii on the fire at the 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony in London.
Its foundation is the traveler and mysterious international man Atkinson who has ever been playing in the now forgotten TV advertising of Barclis, leaving chaos behind.
There's one or two points in Johnny English's latest edition.
I liked it very much when Johnny Inglesh approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armory, and the rotor’s wheels hit his back.
Atkinson's donations for a physical comedy can be seen, but the humor seems weak and somewhat superficial, especially because "serious" film brands such as 007 and the Impossible Mission and themselves contain elements of the comedy.
The humor seems to be replaced for children, instead of for adults, and for me, Johnny England's disillusionment is not as instinctive and focused as you don't have any stars like Bin at Atkinson.
The whole issue is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
Siberian hacker is encapsulated into the UK's top secret spy network, discovering the identity of all British field agents, disappointed by the agent who is in charge -- a disappointing little role for Kevin Eldon.
In the last chance for a prime minister who is a successful and combative figure and already suffering from a total meltdown of political apathy: Emma Thompson is giving himself this kind of quasi-Tereza-May, but there is nothing special in the scenario with which it would work.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy is compromised, she will have to activate one of the retired.
And that means calling itself Johnny Inglesh who's now working as a private school teacher, but "black" gives hours for secret agents: there's a few good guys here when England offers a school for spying on rock academy.
English is quickly called in Whitehol's emergency briefing and reunited with former co-worker Bow, who plays Ben Miller.
Boo is now a married man, in relation to a submarine commander, a comical role in which Vicki Pepperdin is not used well.
Well, Betman and Robin, to break up all the things in the Royal Secret Service, they're back in action and they're finally meeting the pretty Ophelia Bouletov, a character played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is under the dangerous influence of charismatic technology billionaires who claim to be able to solve British computer problems: evil Jason Volta, a graduate of Jake Lacey.
English and Bow begin their opinion of absurd actions: processed as candles they burn a French restaurant; they make a mistake after they cross the luxury yacht of Volta; and English starts the right anarchy when they try to use a cassava for virtual reality to meet the inside of the Volta house.
All the cocks are removed for the last sequence, but as nice and loud as it is, there's a lot of children's TV in the whole movie.
Nice weighted things.
And like other movies with Johnny Inglesh, I can't think of it: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role to use his talent?
Laburists deny that Britishs are planning to work four days a week, but to be paid for five
Jeremy Corbin's lab party will consider a radical plan according to which British workers will work four days a week - but will be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the heads of companies to use the savings they make with artificial intelligence to give the employees another day of freedom.
The employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would get the same pay.
According to sources the idea "appropriate" with the party's economic agenda and with the country's plans to be replaced by workers.
The four-day work week was supported by the Syndicate Congress as a way for workers to gain benefits from the changes in the economy.
A high-ranking member of the party said of Sanday Times: “The revision of the strategy should be published before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a working week of four days is a stream that is consistent with the accession of the party to the rebalanced economy for workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy for the party."
The Laborist Party will not be the first to adopt such an idea, the Green Party was charged with four-day working weeks during the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the ambition has not been accepted by the entire laboratory party.
The Laburist Party's portfolio said: "The forty-day work week is not a party's strategy and the party does not consider such an idea."
Chancellor John McDonald used last week's Laburist conference to present its vision of the socialist revolution of the economy.
Mr. McDonald said he was determined to seize the power of "directors without face" and "professors" in municipal firms.
The plans of the shadow office also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies may not get back the whole part because the Laborist government could make "deducts" because of non-ethical behaviour.
He also confirmed the plans for employees to be part of companies' boards and to create inclusive property funds with 10 per cent of private companies' capital will belong to employees, which will be able to take an annual dividend up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy makes a statement for "60 Minutes" to see if the FBI investigation for Cavano can rethink them
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Bret Kavano put the final vote for his nomination in the Supreme Court at least one week and updated the question of whether the bureau's discovery could persuade some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Peley's 60 minutes correspondent asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them think.
Kennedy was opened from his South Carolina chair.
"I think of it," said Kennedy.
"I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavano.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came out, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was firm, determined, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, though, looks like a heavy rock.
"My decision has been made for Bret Kavano and a shocking charge is needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Bret refused energy," said Graham, thinking of Christine Blaise Ford.
"Everything she calls them couldn't be confirmed.
That's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new to change."
What is the Global Citizens Festival, and did you do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be held at the Global Citizens Festival, an annual musical event that is attended by famous stars and has an impressive mission; the end of poverty.
It is now being held seven times, and the Global Citizens festival will visit tens of thousands of people who will come to the great grassroots in the central park, not only to enjoy the steps of names such as Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendez, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which started in 2012, is a continuation of the project against global poverty, an international activist group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to receive free tickets for the event (except if they do not want to pay for the VIP ticket), participants must perform a number of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, telephone call or other useful work that will help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizens been since they were 12 years old?
Is the idea of free concert really a way to convince people to seek something or just another case of "click-activism" - people who feel that they make a real difference with signing a petition on the Internet or sending a message to Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizens have claimed that more than 19 million "activities" have been registered by supporters, who have been working for many different purposes.
They say these activities have helped world leaders to identify commitment and strategies that have collected more than $37 billion and that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 promises and notifications resulting from their activities, of which 10 billion dollars have already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds collected have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are the Power of Food, the partnership of investors and implanters, with a seat in Britain dedicated to "helping children use their potential", which promises to provide $35 million for Rwanda to help the country's poor food after receiving 4,700 Twitter messages from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens alike, we can make social injustice of non-food, a record in history," Ambassador Tracy Ulman of the Food Power said, before the people of a live concert in London, in April 2018.
The group also said more than 5,000 activities were taken in connection with calls to improve food for mothers and children in Britain, the government announced funding for the project, the Food Power, which will cover 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
How do you answer one of the frequently asked questions on their website "Why do you think you can put an end to extreme poverty?"
“ It will be a long and hard way — we will never succeed, ” replied one of the world’s citizens.
But like the great civil and anti-apartted movements before us, we'll succeed, because we're strong together.
Janet Jackson, Wikkend, Sean Mendez, Cardie B, Janel Mona are some of the artists who will be on this year's event in New York, whose host will be Deborah Furnes and Hu Jackman.
America can use the "blockade" Navy to prevent Russian energy exports - Ministry of Internal Affairs
Washington may "if necessary" use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, found US Interior Minister Ryan Zinki, as Washington Egzeminer quoted.
According to Zinki, Russia's involvement in Syria - namely, where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government - is designed to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is because of the energy market, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he said.
And according to the government representative, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that maritime roads will remain open and if it is necessary to block their energy from reaching the market," he said.
Zinki has been called to the event participants organized by the Energy Consumer Alliance, a non-profit group that represents itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's approach in dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that it is effective.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is, more or less, a rise in fuel input and replacement," he said, while speaking about Russia as "an inappropriate point" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement followed after the Tromp's administration started a mission to stimulate exports of natural gas in Europe, replacing Russia, which is a very positive option for European consumers.
To that end, officials from the Tromp administration, including US President Donald Tramp himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" gas project North Tek 2, which, according to Tramp, made from Berlin a "debt" in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that North Tek 2, which is worth 11 billion dollars, should double the current capacity of 110 billion cubic metres, is only an economic project.
Kramł claims that the firm opposition of Washington to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy can't be a pressure-making tool and that customers should be able to select supplements," Russian energy minister Alexander Novak said after the meeting with American Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American position found a resistance from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading organization for industry in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US not to intervene in European energy policy and in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third party mixes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kemp, the first person of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angel Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will carefully consider" whether to apply for president in 2020, Senator Masachuszez said
Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she "will carefully consider" whether she would be candidates for president after the mid-mission elections.
During a meeting at the city council in Holíok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking of candidates.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our non-functional government, and that means a woman's head," she said, according to Hill.
"After 6 November, I will carefully consider whether to apply for president."
Waren assessed President Donald Trump's work during the city council meeting and said that he "led the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Tramp does to our democracy," she said.
Warren is open to her criticisms against Trump and the man he calls a judge in Supreme Court, Bret Kavano.
In Twitter's message on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that a large number of voters in her election unit believe that she should not vote in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probably" voters from Massachusetts said the senator should not be candidateed, according to a study by the Political Research Centre of the University of Safolk/Bostonski Globe.
Thirty-two percent support such a candidate.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's nomination, while 38 per cent support potential nomination, and 48 per cent oppose.
Other well-known names from the Democratic Party on which the nomination is being discussed in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Byden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Byden said he would officially decide by January, according to Assisied Press.
Sarah Peylin speaks of the post-primary syndrome of the Trek Peylin at Donald Tramp's Mitting
Trek Peylin, 26, has been in Iraq for a year since his arrival in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday evening
"With what my son goes through, what he goes through since he comes back, I know how other families are affected by the post-primary syndrome and the wounds our soldiers return with," she said in front of the audience of the rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Peilin called the arrest "slan in the room" and said her son and other war veterans "are returning a little different, they are going back to be baptized, they come back and ask if there is any respect for what they and their partners have done for the country, and every other member of the army has given it to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska and charged with domestic violence against women, along with a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons under alcohol, according to Dan Bennet, police spokesman in Vasila.
18 United States and City of Washington Supports the Controversy of New asylum Policy
Twenty-eight federal states and Washington support opposition to the new American policy that prevents the granting of asylum to victims fleeing from domestic or gang violence.
Representatives of 18 EU states and Washington City filed a petition to the court on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who is opposing politics, reports En-Bi-Si-News.
The entire name of the prosecutor in the case of Grace vs Parliament, which the American Union of Civil Liberties imposed in August against federal policy, has not been found.
She said her partner "and the violent members of his gang" abused her, but the US authorities rejected her asylum request on July 20th.
She was locked in Texas.
The state defender representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from where many asylum requests are coming from the United States, such as nations with ongoing gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy undermines the 2014 Board's decision on immigration complaints that allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Public lawyer of Washington Carl Rosin said on Friday that the new policy " ignores decades of legislation at the level of the United States, federal and international".
"The federal law requires all asylum applications to be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the application and such a provision violates this principle", according to the petition to the court (amicus curiae).
In addition, the advocates of the letter claim that immigration policy is harmful to the American economy because they are likely to become entrepreneurs "to offer the required labour force".
Public prosecutor Jeff Seshns ordered immigration judges not to give asylum to victims fleeing from domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"There are asylums for those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a certain social group or political opinion," Seshns said when he presented the policy on 11 June.
Azil was never designed to solve all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- with which people around the world face each day.
desperate efforts are being made to save Palo because the number of victims has doubled in the race for survival
For survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, as she sat her male baby in an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, ambulances carry bodies.
There's no clean water."
The inhabitants return to their destroyed homes and pick out their items, so that they can save what they can.
Hundreds of people were injured, and patients injured by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake were reunited.
Some of the injured, including Dui Harris, who has back and shoulder fractures, were resting in front of the Military Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside because of the frequent follow-up of minor earthquakes.
Solzy looked in his eyes when he described the strong earthquake in the hotel room of the fifth cat he had with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I was pressed into the walls of the wall, so I think,' said Harris about Assisied Press, adding that his family was in the city because of the wedding.
“I heard my wife asking for help, but then she kept quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and her child.
I hope they're safe."
The US ambassador accuses China of "mattering" with "propagand advertising"
One week after an official Chinese newspaper published a statement on four sides in an American daily newspaper counting the inter-American profit of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using American propaganda media.
U.S. President Donald Tramp last Wednesday spoke about China's De Moin Register supplement -- the most sold newspaper in Iowa -- after China accused China of joining the US elections for the 6 November convention, China rejected the charges.
Tramp's claim that Beijing is trying to mix in the US elections marked the close of the US Reuters service, a new phase in Washington's Escalator campaign to exert pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish commercial promotion ads, Beijing and Washington, they are currently in a trade war that balances import tariffs with each other.
China's fiscal tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were directed to exporters from the United States such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, confirmed by Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador in China and an ex-prime governor of Iowa, chief exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing was hurting American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in a column in De Moin Register's weekly edition, "now doubles the abuse with propaganda advertising in our free press".
"In the campaign's decadence, China's government abuses the unexplained American tradition of free speech and free media with advertising in De Moin Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the nearby newspaper stand, here in Beijing, you can only find a limited number of thoughts and you will not see the real impact of the desperate thoughts that the Chinese people may have on China's problem economic trajectory, because the media are controlled by the strong hand of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most read newspapers in China rejected his offer to publish" to the column, although he did not say who the journalist is speaking about.
Republicans abstain from women's votes before the middle of the mandate, due to the chaos with Cavano, warn analysts
Since many Republicans do not consider or defend Bret Kavano's nomination in the Supreme Court and despite a number of allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that there will be negative consequences, especially from women in the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate.
The emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong, and most Republicans have already made it clear that they want to continue voting.
Of such things there is no return," wrote Grant Richer, professor of political science at Maxwell University in Siracusa, for Hill, in a column published on Saturday.
Richier said he suspected that the pressure on the FBI's investigation of Senator Jeff Fleck (Republic of Arizona) would be enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow, nor in November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokesman of the progressive movementOn group, in front of Washington D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators called "Novembers is coming!" at a protest in the Senate hall, when the Republicans, who have control of the Commission on Legal Affairs, decided to continue with the nomination of Cavano and despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaysy Ford, Mick said.
"Education and motivation of democracy will be high," said Stu Rotenberg, a non-party political analyst on the news site.
"People already say they're tall; that's right.
But they may be higher, especially among independent female voters in the building and young voters, from 18 to 29 years old, who do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony in which her charges of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate were detailed, analysts suggest that there may be negative consequences if the Republicans continue to vote.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican party," said former President of the Republican National Committee last week, according to En-Bi-Si's news.
"It's not only about voting in the commission or the last vote or whether Kavano is going to listen, it's also about the way the Republicans have dealt with this and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of the US Priority, a group that helps in selecting democracy, for the news channel.
However, the Americans are divided on who to trust after Ford and Cavano's testimony, although a large number accept the first side.
A new Ju-Gov poll shows that 41 per cent of the investigators are definitely or most likely to believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent said that they definitely or most likely trust Kavano.
In addition, 38 percent said that they were thinking of Kawano probably or definitely lying about the witness, while only 30 percent thought of him as Ford.
After Fleck's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one more, of Debora Ramirez, said the Guardian.
Ford witnessed before the Senate's Legal Affairs Commission, under oath, last week that Kavano was attacked in a drunk state when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez accuses the Supreme Court of showing the genitals at a party while he was studying with Jael in the 1980 ’ s.
The World Network’s Exquisite Plans to Start a New Internet to Challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Ley, the World Network researcher starts with a start-up business that claims to be a rival to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend in technology, Inrapt, is a company that has been built on the platform with open-source Solid, at Berners-Ley.
Solid enables users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Ley joked that Inrupt's intention was "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start-up business.
"Now is the historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "data storage" or short-term POD.
It can contain lists of contacts, lists of tasks, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Autluk, Slek and Spotify all available to a viewer at the same time.
What is unique to the personal data store on the Internet is that only the user depends on having access to certain types of information.
The company calls it "personal strengthening through data".
The idea of Inrapt, according to the executive director of the company John Bruce, is the company to provide resources, processes and relevant skills for Solid to be available to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Li, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several development programmes with agreement on project work and codification community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications using the tools available to Inrapt's website.
Berners-Ley said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change where their business models are completely turned around by night.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a press release published on Saturday, Berners-Lie wrote that "the mission of Inrapt is to enable commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the basis of Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Ley transformed the Internet on the basis of the World Network Consortium of the Institute for Technology in Massachusetts.
Recently, Berners-Ley was an influential speaker in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even at the start of Inrapt, Berners-Ley will remain the founder and director of the World Network Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm a big optimist for the new age on the Internet," added Berners-Lie.
Bernard Van: A famous winner of the Victorian Cross of World War I
The only priest of the Anglican church who had received the Victorian cross during the first world war as a warrior was celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
Colonel Bernard Van received recognition on September 29, 1918 in an attack on Belenglez and Lehaukur.
However, he was killed four days later by a shooter and never knew he had received the highest British military representation.
A comical stone was discovered from his two parachutes in Rasden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was a "unbelievable symbol" that the stone was discovered 100 years after his grandfather got the award.
According to the London newspaper, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion through Canal de San-Qentin "In a very dense fog and under a powerful fire of lead and metals".
He later fled to the place where he was shot and with “the greatest courage ” he went ahead, before he attacked a shipyard and managed to disable three of his servants.
Colonel Van was killed by a German shooter on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said that his grandfather's work was "something I know I will never be able to accomplish, but it's something that doesn't make it humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also put a vein after the parade led by the Young Imperial Band of Brandwood.
Michael Van said "it's a great honor to be part of the parade" and added "the courage of a real hero is shown with the support that many people will give."
Fans of combined battle skills remained awake all night to see Belator 206, instead they got Pepa Prasse
Imagine, you're awake all night to watch Belator 206, and you don't have a chance to watch the main event.
San Jose's list contained 13 battles, including six with the main card shown all night in Britain on Channel 5.
On the 6th of the morning, just as Gerard Mossi and Rory McDonald prepared to face, viewers in Britain remained shocked when the channel moved to Pepa Prasse.
Some have not been impressed since they were awake to the early hours of the war.
One of Twitter’s fans described the transfer of a child’s black file as “some painful joke. ”
"The law is such that on 6 a.m. it was inappropriate, so they had to switch to a child program," said Dave Schwarz, Belator's president for marketing and communication when he was asked about the transfer.
"The Pope asked," yes.
Belator Scott Cooker's president said they will work on a schedule that will include future British viewers.
"I think that when I'm thinking about reimbursing, I think we can probably find a solution," Kucker said.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we won't be able to find a solution on Sunday by our time, and Monday by their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, we got a lot of messages on the transfer, and no one was good-bye.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a legal question.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to limit the number of five battles, instead of six -- as we usually do -- we're trying to send more because of the fans and we're overrun.
It's an accident.
Disks on the island: Tom Dale felt "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Dale says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until he went to high school that "they're not all like me"
Speaking at the first show of the Radio 4, presented by Lauren Lavern, he said he talked about the rights of homosexuals to give them "hope" to others.
He also said that what became a parent made him less concerned about the Olympic victory.
The regular president of the long-term demonstration Kirsty Yang took several months' rest because of the disease.
Acting like a similar figure in Lavern's first program, Dale said he felt "lower" than anyone else as he grew up because "there was no socially acceptable showing sympathy for boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, those feelings of inferiority and differentiality were the things that gave me strength and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was “something, ” he said, so that everyone would not be disappointed when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The Olympics with two bronze medals have become well-known supporters of the LGBT campaigns and have used their initiative to this year's Community Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to criminalize homosexuality.
He said he was speaking publicly because he felt happy that he could live openly and to give others “a hope. ”
The three-time World Championship said about the love of a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lens Black, who met in 2013 - "I was surprised".
Daley concluded a marriage with the archaeologist, who is 20 years old, last year, but said that the difference in age was never a problem.
"When you're going through this much early age" - he went to the first Olympics at 14 years of age, and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age who has experienced similar heights and depth.
Both became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Dley, and Dale said "all his views" were changed.
"As long as you asked me last year, everything was related to "I need to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there's important things about the Olympic gold medal.
My gold olympic medal is Robbie."
His son bears the name of his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 when he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daily he said that his father did not accept his death as one of the last things he had asked them about whether they had tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to sit on the first line.
"I couldn't tell him "You won't be here to be in the first order," he said.
"I held my hand when I stopped breathing and when I actually stopped breathing and died I finally realized that it was ineffective," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the Olympics in 2012 and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life -- to jump before the Olympics' home audience, there's no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of the song - pride of Heder Smol - who had turned his head in preparations for the Olympics and who was still wearing it.
Bi-Bi-Si Radio 4 desert discs are on Sunday at 11:15 British summer time.
Michaelson, who's not in shape, was at the club during the Cup Rayder on Saturday
American Phil Michaelson will put a record on Sunday when he will play the 47th Cup Rayder competition, but he will have to change the shape to avoid an unhappy transition.
Michaelson, who plays on the biennial event, recorded 12 times, was sent to the club by Captain Jim Furic during the Saturdays' two couples and four.
Instead of being at the center of attention, as often represented by the United States, the fifth winner, he spent time training and exercising his game, on the cover, hoping to fix what he was cleaning.
He was never the best leader, even at the top of his career, 48-year-old is not an ideal choice for the tough Le Golf Nazional, where distant rough hits are regularly punished with neglect.
And if the ground itself is not scary enough, Michaelson, in the ninth week of the contest, faces the precise champion of British Open Francesco Molinari, who plays in pairs with beginner Tommy Flitwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who lack four points before 12 individual contests begin to find it difficult, Michaelson's game can be condemned.
Furic expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see another.
"He fully understood the role he had today, touched me on his back and put his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furic said.
"He has a lot of self-confidence on his own.
He's part of the famous and has been given a lot for these teams in the past week and this week.
I probably didn't think about playing two games.
I was thinking more, but that's what we went through, and we thought we had to do it.
He wants to play, like everyone else."
Michaelson's record of Nick Faldo's most played games at the Cup Rayder on Sunday.
This could be the end of a career in the Cup Rayder where he never achieved the best results in his individual career.
Michaelson has 18 winnings, 20 losing matches and seven-halfs, although Furic said his presence carries something that is not material to the team.
He's funny, he's sarcastic, he wants to joke with people, and he's a great man at the team meetings," he explained.
"I think younger players were having fun playing with him, as well this week, which was fun to see.
He offers much more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Björn knows that big leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain of experience, knows that significant leadership in front of individual competitions on the last day of the Cup Rayder can easily turn into an inconsistencies.
The Danish debated a competition in Valderama in 1997, when the guy led by Steve Balesteros had a five-point lead before the Americans, but "he passed the target line only with the knives", with the lowest lead of 141⁄2-1311⁄2.
"I remind myself that we had a big lead in Valdérama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, when we lost in Valdérama, when we won a little bit," said Bjorn, the photographer, after he watched the 2018 class win with 5-3 on Friday and 10-6 in Le Golf National.
Well, history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
Go get ready for tomorrow.
Get out and play the right way.
This isn't over as long as the competition lasts.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win the trophy, and the focus remains on it.
All the time I say, I focus on 12 players in our team, but we are fully aware of the opposite side -- the best players in the world."
He added: “I don’t want to give early assessments on this issue.
The breakfast game is a different monster.
Tomorrow we're expected to play individual games, and that's a different job.
It's great to play with a partner when things go well, but when you play individually, then they test all the skills as a golf player.
It's the message that should be sent to the players, give of themselves tomorrow.
Now, you leave the partner and he has to give everything to himself."
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furic will ask players to play better individually than they did in two, except Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furic himself was at the end of the last day's change, because he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser when Europe performed the "Medina Miracle"
"I remember every word there," he said when asked about how Ben Krenshaw, the captain in 1999, united the players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to start as soon as we saw it in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When the moment comes in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the media.
We put the line right and the team order is according to how we feel, you know, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Tomas has been commissioned to oppose first and face Rory McCloy the most important competition, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fletwood and Ian Polter with other Europeans in the most important part of the series.
"I've decided to go this way with the guys because I think we're going to cover it up," Bionn said about the election in individual games.
The new German military ship has been re-located
The latest flag of the German Navy was to be sent in 2014 to replace the old warships from the time of the cold war, but that will not happen until next year because of the wrong systems and rising prices, local media reported.
The release of the "Rainland-Falz", the lead ship from the new class of Baden-Vietmberg, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Di Citat, calling for a military passport.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014 but the issues after the release prevented the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships from the Baden-Vietmberg class that the Navy ordered in 2007 will be replaced by the old frigates from the Bremen class.
It is known that they will contain a powerful fuel, a large number of anti- spiritual weapons and marine rockets, as well as some steel technology, such as a smaller radar, infrared and acoustic trail.
Among other important features is proper maintenance - it should be possible, the latest brands, to be absent for up to two years from home facilities.
However, the constant delays mean that modern warships - which should enable Germany to have power over the oceans - will be old as they enter the ministry, notes Di Cate.
The F125 strike with an accident hit the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blom and Vos station in Hamburg.
That was the first time the mariner was to return a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
It is little known about the reasons for the return, but German media quote a large number of key "software and hardware defects" that the warship was useless when sent to a battle mission.
The software deficits were particularly important because the Baden-Vietmberg class ships will have a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the old class frigates' crew from Bremen.
Also, it appeared that the ship was tragically above the planned weight that reduces its performances and limits the ability of the seafarer to add buildings in the future.
"Rainland-Falz" weighs 7,000 tons and is believed to be twice the weight of ships of a similar class that used Germany in the second world war.
Apart from the problem hardware, the price of the whole project - including the training of the team - also became a problem.
It is said that it has reached an amazing 3.1 billion euros ( 3.6 billion dollars) - an increase from the start of €2.2 billion.
The problems facing the latest frigates are particularly important because of the warning of Germany’s reduced sea force.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Commission, confirmed that the Navy "takes ships that can be planned".
The representative said that the problem got worse over time because the old ships were withdrawn from service, but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the classmates of the Baden-Vietmberg class could join the Navy.
The National Trust Hears the Secret Life of Lilies
A new research is being carried out on property in the Scottish mountains in order to find out how the lilys use the boundary in the search for food.
There is hope that the discovery will provide answers to the behaviour of the unique pilots and will help in managing future protection activities.
The study of the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual and early-liners, as well as the long-distance coffee liners and the Daubenton Lilies in Inverou Gardens in West Ross.
Special photographers will be placed at key locations around property to monitor the activities of links during the season.
En-Es staff and volunteers will also carry mobile research using hand detectors.
The expert analysis of sound from all photos will determine the frequency depending on the type of ligaments.
Then there will be a map of the habitat to create a detailed picture of their behavior on the surface.
Rob Devar, Nature Protection Adviser in En-Ti-Es, hopes that the results will find out which areas of life are most important to the liens and how they are used by each species.
Such information will help to determine the benefit of living conditions, such as the creation of libdas, and how best to maintain forests for lilys and other related species.
The population of liens in Scotland and Britain has decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by building materials and the development that affects the bed and the loss of homes.
The winds and lights also pose a risk, as well as the finely lined molluscs and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
The liers aren't really blind.
Yet, because of their hunting habits, their ears are more sensitive than their eyes when it comes to catching a plane.
They use sophisticated echo-location technique to find the insects and obstacles in the flight path.
En-Ti-Es, who cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important buildings and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, took the lilys very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, night inspection, and sometimes rescue.
The organization even provides the first and only reserve for tickets in Scotland of the property of Triv in Dampris and Galway, which is home to eight of the ten species that live in Scotland.
Property manager David Thompson says property is an ideal territory for them.
"Here in Triv we have a great area for leagues," he said.
"We have old buildings, very old two and very good living quarters.
But there's a lot of unknown things about the liers, so the work we do here and other property will help us learn more about what they need to progress."
He points out that it is important to check whether there are linens before refurbishing property because the unconscious destruction of bed can destroy up to 400 women and young people, and destroy the entire local population.
Lilies are protected and illegal to kill, rape, or disturb or destroy their beds.
Elizabeth Ferrel, a Scottish employee in the Trust for the Protection of Lilies, encourages the public to help.
She said: “We still need to learn a lot about legends and other types of people, we just don’t know how they live. ”
Ronaldo rejected the rape charges, and the lawyers will charge the German magazine
Christian Ronaldo called charges of rape "false news" and added that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will charge the German magazine Der Spigel, which declared the charges.
Portugal's attacker and Juventus is accused of rape by the Americans, named Catherine Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he then paid $375,000 to avoid the incident, reported Dr. Spigel on Friday.
Speaking of a live video on Instagram of its 142 million followers, a few hours after the charges were filed, Ronaldo, 33, rejected the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What was produced today is false news," said the winner of the gold ball in front of his camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by remembering my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and it's good," added the player laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to accuse Dr. Spigel of accusations, which they called "unauthorized transfer of doubts from private life," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Sherc said the player will seek damage because of "the moral damage to a sum corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
Apparently, the incident involving the charges took place in June 2009 in a hotel and a Palms casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a night club, Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player's room, where he reportedly raped it in an analytic, according to documents submitted to the Clark court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "99 percent" "good boy", but left under that "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that there was agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed to an agreement without judicial involvement because she was afraid of revenge and was worried "that she would be publicly humiliated".
34-year-olds say they're trying to change the deal now because there's trauma from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to join the Royal Madrid from Manchester Union when the alleged attack took place and this summer was moved to Italian giant Yuventus with an agreement worth 100m euros.
Bregzit: Britain "will Always Grieve" Who Lost Car Manufacturers · Global Voices
Britain "will always regret" if it lost the status of world leader in the production of cars after Bregzit, business minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it is "anxious" what Toyota-British announced for Bi-Bi-Si, that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production in the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We don't need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer reported that the influence of border posts in the case of Bregzit without an agreement would cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory - which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avenue - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March there will be a stop of production in our factory," said Marvin Kuk, Tokyo's managing director in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers expressed concern about how the EU would operate cross-border trade without agreement, including Honda, Bem-We and Jaguar Land Rower.
Be-em-We, for example, says he'll close his mini factory in Oxford a month after Bregzit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers call the risks of logistic synergy in the case of Bregzit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line works according to the "time-to-time" system, where businesses arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for cars according to orders.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be a break in the border which, according to the industry, can cause delays and deficits.
It's gonna be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's inventory in the Derbishair factory, the company said, and the production will stop.
Mr. Clark said that Teresa May's plan for future EU relations "is exactly designed to avoid such border checks".
"We need a deal. We need to have the best deal that will enable us not only the success we will enjoy in the present, but also to capture this opportunity," he said about the today's Bi-Bi-Si Radio programme.
"The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other producers is that we must be able to continue what is a very successful set of logistics synergys."
It could not say how long production would be banned, but it long warned that additional costs would reduce the company's competitiveness and cost jobs.
Peter Cavalaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is a representative of the union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience as soon as these jobs are taken off, they will never come back.
According to one government spokesman, "we have established a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU".
The Tramp meeting with Rosenstein can be re-ahead White House
Donald Tramp's important meeting with the deputy public lawyer Rod Rosenstein could be "debt for another week" because he continues the fight against Bret Kavano's appointment for a trial in the Supreme Court, White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Muler, who investigates the Russian mix in the elections, the relationship between Tramp's and Russia's assistants and the potential violation of the president's laws.
Whether Trump will release the deputy public lawyer and thereby threaten Miller's independence, triggering a monthly hearing in Washington.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein was thinking about wearing a camera to record talks with Trump and the possibility of withdrawing the president over the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But with reports published last Monday, he went to the White House with the intention of giving up.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday because he was then in the United Nations in New York.
Tramp said "I wouldn't want to leave Rosenstein," but the meeting was then postponed to avoid a conflict in the hearing of the Senate Justice Committee in which Kavano and one of the women accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
On Friday, Tramp issued an order to conduct a one-week FBI investigation on charges against Cavano, which would further postpone the vote in the Senate.
Tramp Sarah Sanders' press secretary appeared on Fox News Sunday.
On the question of the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for the meeting is still uncertain, it could be held this week, and it could be postponed for another week in view of all that is happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see how things are going to work, and I'm always trying to keep the print properly informed."
Some journalists dispute the claim: Sanders has not held a briefing for journalists in the White House on September 10th.
Leader Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the small number of Briffins was not due to the "great influence" of television journalists, although he added: "I will agree with the fact that they have a great influence."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president organizes more sessions on questions and answers than any president before him," she said, adding, without giving evidence: "We have considered those numbers."
There will still be briefings, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the president of the United States, it is far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this more often, and you're witnesses that we've been doing it all the time in the last few weeks, and talks with the US president will replace briefings for journalists."
Trip regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or when attending open sessions or press conferences when visiting high officials.
He rarely participates in self-sustained press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why this is so with his uncontrollable and sometimes critical appearance before congregation journalists.
E-mail Secretary to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system in relation to Braghizit's fears
The health secretary wrote a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system, expressing their gratitude to the country and their desire to stay after Bregzit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament sent this letter less than six months before the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering the costs of the settled EU citizens' status applications that they work in public services at a low level.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU for withdrawal continued during the summer, with the aim of bringing the expected decisions to this end.
However, the UK government has also intensified preparations for the possibility of non-contracting.
I know this period is very disturbing for all of you.
That is why I wanted to stress how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of his nationality.
Members of the EU-wide and wider sharing precious experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and are useful to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Cristion Abercrombie is subjected to an emergency operation after a head injury
Cristion Abercromby, the tennis player of Tennessee State Tigers, was subjected to an emergency operation after he suffered a head injury on the competition Saturday when the team lost 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reid, Tennessee State's main trainer, told reporters that the damage happened just before the half-life.
"He came to the side line of the playground and just moved on to the country," Reid said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave him Abercrombie oxygen outside the playground, and then put it in the container and carried it to further evaluation.
An official representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of "WSMV" in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the nature/level of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury actually happened.
Abecrombie is a student in the second year and plays her first season in red dress in Tennessee State after the Ilinois transfer.
He made a total of five meetings on Saturday before he left the game, resulting in total of 18 meetings this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom
According to Tori's new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people
This move will neutralize the success of Corbin's attempt to attract young voters
High administrative fee will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry expects this move to collect up to 120 million pounds per year, which will be used to help homeless people
Teresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
This move will be considered an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's attempt to attract young voters with their promises that it will provide affordable housing and will focus on people with high wage.
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, while the government's efforts to improve the situation with homeless people will be strengthened with additional resources.
The additional export which despite the current administrative fee includes the higher levels that were introduced two years ago for the second house and the purchase of property with a view to renting the same can reach up to three per cent.
The Ministry expects this move to collect up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the newly built properties in London were purchased by persons who did not live in the United Kingdom, which led to increased prices and caused difficulties for those who buy property for the first time to engage in this purchasing process of household property.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, became "spirit cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers whose most of their time spends outside the country.
This new policy was published only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked to reduce the administrative fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of offering high prices for property holding the land, but did not use it and asked Ms. May to change the quotas for accessible homes to correct "the embarrassing situation with housing" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of attractive reforms in the home, including controls of the old age and ending settlements without a justified reason.
He also wants advice to give them greater powers to build new homes.
Ms. May said: "In the last year, I said I would dedicate my prime minister to returning to the British dream, with a life better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our corrupt home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build life here.
However, those who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, are not in a position to buy homes in the same easy way as worthy British residents.
The dream of owning its own home for many people has become too far, and the humiliation of homeless people is too real."
Jack Ross: "My final ambition is to manage Scotland."
Jack Ross, the head of the Sunderland, said his "final ambition" is in the future to be the manager of Scotland's national club.
The Scotlandnman, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the Northeast club, which is currently the third place in the first league with only three points less than the top club.
This summer he moved to "The Stadium of Light" after returning "St. Mirren" to the Scottish Prime Minister's league last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got B cap and that's it," Ross said about the Scottish "Sportsound" of BBC.
"But I grew up looking at Scotland at Hampden with my father and always drew me back.
However, I could only get this opportunity if I was successful in managing the club."
Some of the presidents of Russia as manager of "Sunderland" are Dick Advocacyat, David Mojes, Sam Heirdice, Martin O'Nil, Roy Kein, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former head of Alloa Athletic said he felt no confusion knowing that he should follow such established names in such a large club, after he had previously rejected the offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at the moment is assessed by "Can I return this club to the Prime Minister's League?"
In view of the structure and objects in this club, he certainly belongs to the Prime Minister League," he said.
"It's not easy for this club to get there, but I'll probably think I've made a success here only if I get the club back there."
Ross worked as a manager for only three years, in which he entered a career after working as assistant to the head of Dumbarton and after a 15-month commitment as part of the Hearts training staff.
He then helped "Alloa" recover from falling into the third league and returned St. Mirren from losing his title in the Empire in the next season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than when he was playing in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"That was probably a true cross for me," he recalls when he took over "Alloa".
"I sincerely believed that career as a manager is the real choice for me, a better choice than career as a player.
It sounded strange because it was good for me to go, so I had enough to earn it and enjoy certain high-ranking privileges.
But building a career as a player can be really hard.
There's a lot of things you need to go through on a Sunday basis.
I still go through certain things in terms of stress and pressure from work, but I just feel good about the manager’s role.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now I'm doing it, and in this role I feel more comfortable than ever to be in my entire adult life."

According to one study, the perfect beer time is at 17:30 a.m. on Saturday
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in the profits of the British popes who are currently in a very difficult situation, but it has put a greater pressure on restaurants' syndicates.
The figures show that the popes and barons noticed an increase in sales of 2.7 per cent in July, but the profit of restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin from CGA for business advisory services on the determination of these numbers said: "The sun's time and longer than the expected participation of England of the World Summit meant that the situation in July was similar to that in June when the profits of the babies increased by 2.8 percent, while the restaurants significantly decreased.
The decline in sales of 1.8 per cent of restaurants in June has increased further during July.
The popes and barons in whom heavy drinking was sold noted a much greater increase than those in previous years in contrast with the restaurants where there was a notice of decline.
The popes in which food was sold were also badly affected by the sun’s periods, although not as dramatic as the owners of restaurants.
It seems that people simply wanted to get drunk.
In successful papayas and barges, the sales of drinks increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and food sales by only three percent.
Paul Newman, a vacation analyst and hospitality analyst from RSM, said: "These results follow the trend we saw at the end of April.
Time and influence of major social and sports events remain the most important factors when it comes to selling the market outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurants are still in a difficult situation, although the decline in sales of 4.8 per cent for a year will be particularly noticeable in addition to current pressures that create costs.
The long summer could not have come in a bad time for the owners of the premises where food is sold mainly and the time will show whether the moderate temperatures we had in August would provide much needed breath."
The total increase in the sale of papayas and restaurants, including newborns, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the stand in the release of new brands.
The "Coffer Peach Tracker" device to monitor sales in the papal, barbed and restaurant sector in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes data on the effectiveness of the same 47 operating groups with combined income of over 9 billion pounds and represents a firm reper for the industry.
One of five children has a secret profile of social media that hides it from their parents.
One study showed that one out of five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret profile of social media that hides it from their parents and teachers.
A survey involving 20,000 middle school students showed an increase in the number of "false Instagram" profiles
The news increases the fear that sexual content is published on such profiles
Twenty percent of the disciples said they had a “head ” profile that they showed to their parents
One of five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, creates a profile of social media that hides it from adults.
A survey involving 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta" profiles, a shortcut for the Instagram website where photos are shared.
The news increases the fear that sexual content is published on such profiles.
Twenty percent of the disciples said they had a clean “head ” profile that they showed to their parents, and then they had other private profiles.
A mother who accidentally found the secret profile of her 13-year-old daughter found the same teenager who asked others "to rape her."
A study conducted by "Digital Awareness UK" and "The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference" in independent schools showed that 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, and half of them admitted that one of them is secret.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's really disturbing that so many teenagers are trying to create online profiles where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" of the Scottish Athletics team
Elid Doyle was elected as the Executive Director of the Scottish Athletics Committee at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most outstanding athlete in Scotland and President Ian Biti described the move as a great opportunity for those who are part of the leadership in this sport to take advantage of its extensive international experience achieved during the past decade.
"All in the Scottish, British and World athletic community have great respect for Elid and we are sure that the athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly if it became a member of the committee," Biti said.
Doyle said: “I am prepared to be the voice of athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and help in the proper direction of the sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200- and 400-metre game titles in Atlanta in 1996, despite the total four gold medals of the Olympics, which now appeared regularly as a BBC commentator, was unable to go after a transient chemical attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month later, I received a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time will tell me if I'm going to get pregnant or whatever.
The whole process was complicated, but I was able to fully strengthen, I could go back and practice as an agility!
Thank you for the letters of encouragement!"
Advertisement of a construction pump in which mothers are compared with the real cause of division of the mind of the Internet
The construction pump company causes division of the Internet’s thinking when it announces a advertising in which mothers who come from are compared with the demand for cows.
To highlight the launch of a product that is said to be "the most important pump for the world's buildings", user-oriented technology company Elvie published a funny advertising inspired by music videos to show the freedom that the new pump has given to mothers who are coming.
Four mothers dance in a chair for cows full of snow in a song that sounds like, "Yes, I'm begging for milk, but you don't see a mirror" and, "If you didn't notice this isn't raining, these are my buildings."
The referendum continues: "Bump, pump, feed babies, pump, pump, smack the cities."
However, the advertising that was published on Facebook by the company's party caused online controversy.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, when many said they were emphasised by the milk industry.
"It is a really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
They, just as we should be pregnant and born to be able to produce milk, except for the fact that their children are stealing from them just a few days after they are born," one of the commentators said.
Elvie building pump is discrepancies included in the bringer yard ("Elvie"/ "Mother")
Another comment states: “It is understandable that this is both traumatic for the mother and for the baby.
But, yes, why don't you use them to advertise a bomb for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone added, "It's really inappropriate advertising."
Others, however, defended the advertising, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was really "a joke."
"I think this idea is genius.
I'd buy a pump like this if I still had it.
I felt like a cow because of my beg.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I think it's true.
It's a word about a genius," one of the commentators said.
Another commented: “This is a fun advertising for mothers who breast - feed milk (often their jobs or toilets) and feel like "crowds."
This doesn't announce what you're missing or judging the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were dancing while the discreet pumps were stuck in their buildings.
The concept behind the campaigns is based on the view that many women who use milk - pollination pumps say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely quiet, there are no candles, no candles, no candles and discretionaryly included in the bring-on building, giving women the freedom to move, to keep their babies, and even to get out of the house while they suck the milk.
Anna Balarin, a partner and RDR in "Mother" commented: "The "Elvie's pump is a really revolutionary product and deserves courage and provocation.
By setting the barriers between women who breast-feeding milk and milk cows, we wanted to breast-feeding with the help of a pump and the challenges that bring them to the center of attention, showing the incredible feeling of freedom that brings the new pump in a fun and closer way.
This is not the first time Elvie pump to be present in all titles.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two children appeared on the fashion track for designer Martha Jacobovski carrying the product.
Hundreds of children migrants quietly moved to a tent camp at the border with Texas
The number of children migrants in prison has increased significantly, although the crossings at the monthly level have remained relatively unchanged, partly due to the fact that strict rhetoric and policies introduced by the Tromp administration delayed children's placement at sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were uninformed immigrants and feared the threat of their own stay in the country if they sought to be sponsors of the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to bear fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a high immigration and customs officer last week testified before the Congress that the agency arrested dozens of persons who applied for sponsorship of minors without association.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested persons have no previous criminal record.
"Nearly 80 per cent of individuals who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegally resident in the country and most of them are foreigners with criminal records.
That's why we're going to keep killing those individuals," said Mr. Albens.
In order to speed up the processing of children, the authorities introduced new rules according to which some of them would be required to appear in court within a month after they were arrested, not within 60 days, as workers in the shelter said they had voted the previous standard.
Many of them will appear through a conference video call, not personally, in order to present their case for legal status before the immigration court.
Those who are considered to be incompatible with obtaining relief will be deported immediately.
The longer the children remain in prison, the more likely they will become frustrated and depressed, which may lead to violent disappearances or attempts to escape, workers in the shelters and reports that have appeared from the system in the last few months.
Lawyers say that such problems have increased in larger facilities such as Tornilo, where there is a greater likelihood of neglecting signs that the child is facing difficulties.
They added that moving children to the city of Shator, without providing enough time for them to prepare emotionally or converse with their friends, can increase the traumas that most of them are already facing.
Syria told US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In his speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has lasted for eight years.
Mualam, who also served as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally present in Syria's territory under the pretext that they are taking part in the fight against terrorism and that "they will act accordingly."
"They must immediately withdraw and that without setting conditions," he said before the congregation.
Mualem insisted that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people lost their lives in 2011, and millions were displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to lead this world battle until we clear all Syrian territory" from both terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of which train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Basar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in this country's territory destroyed by the war.
Regarding the refugee issue, Mualem said that conditions are good for them to come back and accused "some of the Western countries" of "spreading ironic fears" which encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to ease these returns," he said.
"They politicalize the question which should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union warned that Syria would not be provided with reconstruction assistance until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war was reached.
UN diplomats said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last large rebel power plant in Idlib created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkey Treaty has prevented a massive attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia on the province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the treaty had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that the military action would be directed to the gejadists, including the fighters from Nusra Frontot associated with Al Qaeda, who "will be wiped out."
UN representative Stefan de Mistura hopes to bring together the first meetings of the new committee consisting of government members and opposition with a view to preparing an existing constitution for Syria and opening the path to the elections.
Mualam confirmed the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to "review of the members of the current Constitution," and warned of the consequences of the further mixing in the same.
Why Tramp will win a second mandate
According to that logic, Mr. Tramp will again win the elections in 2020 unless, with imputation and scandal, his presidential mandate is temporarily interrupted, which most Liberians are likely to hope for.
What will no doubt be "the most dramatic final in the presidency that has ever been seen!"
From now on, there's no sign of delay in the viewers.
Since 2014, the hit time rating has increased more than twice and reached 1.05 million in CNN and nearly three times reached 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Nilsen says that "Fox News" has 2.4 million viewers on average, which is 1.7 million more than the period four years ago, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" has reached the top cable rating of about 3.5 million viewers in the evenings when important news is being released.
"This is like a fire to which people feel attracted because this is not something we understand," says Nil Baer, the main television producer of the "Designed Survivor" drama "ABC" to the cabinet secretary who becomes president after Capitol has been destroyed by the attack.
Neil Scowell, a veteran in writing comedy and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he'd vote for Mr. Tramp.
She asked why.
"He answered, "Because I think he's really funny," Mrs. Skuel told me.
There's also a certain fun value in the whole chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roe case against Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite, as well as the welfare of the global economy.
Turn off all of this is a luxury that only privileged viewers can afford.
However, you are no longer an uninformed citizen when you have already seen a panel of experts who debate the use of the "deep background" source by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear", a handgun of Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar leather jacket ("The Washington Post") and the applications of the shocking descriptions of Stormi Daniels's Anatomy.
I, for example, will never be able to see Super Mario in the same way.
"Part of what he does and what makes you feel like seeing real show is that every night he carries you something new," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of "Wellhouse Entertainment" and Creator of Pawn Stars for the Tromp's Rotary Team and daily conversions (NFLs, thanks to Kim Young-un).
You can't allow yourself to miss any episode because then you won't be able to adapt.
When I visited Mr. Fleis this week was sunny and the temperature was 80 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kaway, but he was locked inside and watched "MSNBC" while filming "CNN".
He could not stop looking, at least not when Brett Kavano was supposed to meet with the Senate Justice Committee, and the Supreme Court's future was critical.
"I remember we did all these crazy shows in the past and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization."
"I thought it was some joke, but it came out that they were right."

Affliction of external resources in the most difficult mid-term elections in the mountain house race
It is not surprising that the 17th convention area in Pennsylvania receives large amounts of funds thanks to the reorganization of the convention areas from where there are two candidates in the race for the same place.
For this recently rebuilt building area in Pittsburgh, democratic representative Conor Lamb was nominated, which took place in another area of the foreign elections last summer.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Kit Rotfus, who is currently representing the old 12th convention area, and who is largely intertwined with the new 17th convention area.
The maps have been changed since the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old areas are manipulated for the benefit of republics, which is contrary to the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th convention area represents a serious competition to finance campaigns between the main sponsors of the parties, the Congress Committee on the Campaigns of the Democratic Party (DCCC) and the National Committee of Campaigns of the Republican Party (NCRC).
Lamb became the famous name in Pennsylvania after the close victory in the 18th anniversary of the 18th convention in Pennsylvania held in March, which was characterized by a wide media coverage.
For more than a decade, this place has been occupied by a republican, and President Donald Tramp has won the area with a difference of 20 points.
Political experts offer little advantage to democracies.
The U.S. decided to punish El Salvador for support for China, and then he gave up.
The diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing under little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Tramp had a friendly meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama while the partners did not expel the Tramp organisation's management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw US diplomatic mission heads from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heder Nauert, State Department's spokesman in his statement at the beginning of this month.
However, only with regard to El Salvador had been taken into account, which received approximately 140 million US dollars in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included a reduction in financial aid and total visa restrictions, would have a detrimental impact on the country in Central America and high rates of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings progressed, representatives from North and Central America held a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity in order to maintain a similar meeting last year, which was considered to be a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from falling into the United States.
But by mid-September, high-level administrative representatives stressed that they wanted the conference to move forward and effectively put an end to any discussion on El Salvador's punishment.
Deputy President Mike Pens should be called to the conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance that his administration is signing to the assembly, diplomats say.
And the three American representatives quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing news of severe messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American representatives, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal thoughts about the state of anonymity.
Their views were supported by an external analyst who was close to the administration and who was also talking about the state of anonymity.
Learn History
The next thing that can happen is a report by Special Adviser Robert Miller on possible prosecution of justice by Mr. Tramp, for which there is currently very strong evidence in public records.
Mr. Miller is also likely to direct his investigation to the fact that Mr. Tramp's campaigns are linked to Russia in her attack on our elections.
If the composition of the Congress has changed, Mr. Tramp will have to assume responsibility for that body as it is prepared to appear again before the voters, and perhaps even before the jury of his colleagues.
There's a lot of uncertainty here, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Tramp's fall is inevitable, not even his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic need to make certain choices that will affect the duration of this fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready to launch a coup against Hitler if the West opposed and supported Chechnya in Minhen.
We failed to do that, and we missed out on the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of change and the relentless march of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are now facing a number of such changes.
What would we do if Mr. Tramp gave him the resignation of Deputy Public Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein is at the hot table after this newspaper announced that last year he proposed secretly to film the president and speculated that he was innocent of the function he was doing.
Mr. Rosenstein says the information published in "The Times" is incorrect.
"How do we react if Bret Kavano's new investigation called on by the FBI is unreasonable or unfair, or if he proves his innocence before the Supreme Court and despite the credible charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for the Congress that will condemn Mr. Tramp?
If we fall on all these tests, democracy waits for a long winter.
But I believe that's not gonna happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to burn candles for the Sabbath on the table with a swastika logo.
With this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorans from "Rangers" with a optimistic attitude in front of the rapid Vienna battle
Rangers is host to the match with Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and they are aware of the fact that after the unsolved fight against Villarreal in Spain at the beginning of this month the victory over Austria will confirm their position to qualify in Group G in the League of Europe.
Graham Dorens, the middle-class player for damage to the knee was prevented from appearing in the whole season until the unsolved game 2-2 with "Villarreal", but he believes that "Rangers" can use that result as a drop-down to larger achievements.
"It was a good point for us because "Villarreal" is a good opponent," said 31-year-old player.
"We went into the game believing we could achieve something and we returned with a win point.
Maybe we could give a little more at the end, but the wrong result was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we gave each other our best in the second half, and we were better.
On Thursday, another big European night awaits us.
I hope we win three points, but it's gonna be a hard game because they've had a good outcome in the final match, but I'm sure with the support of trainers we'll return and get a positive result.
The past year was definitely a hard year in view of everything that happened, my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a positive factor about the place.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope we can move forward now, leave the past season behind us and succeed."
Women can't sleep tonight because of this fear associated with the pension
Although the participants in the survey had a clear picture of how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the study conducted by Nationwide said they had talked to their marriage partners about the costs of a long-term relationship.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don't take steps to talk about the same," says Holly Snaider, Vice-President of the Animal Insurance Company "Nationwide".
Here's where you got to start.
Talk to your mate and children: You cannot prepare your family for the day if you do not share your wishes with them in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how to get him because such choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial adviser: Your advisor may also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Your long-term funding options may include a traditional long-term policy, a hybrid animal insurance policy, which can help you cover your expenses or provide self-insurance with your own resources if you have them.
Arrange your legal documents: Avoid legal battles at the very beginning.
Take full care of your health care so that you can persuade people to monitor your medical condition and ensure that health professionals respect your wishes unless you are able to communicate.
Think, too, of all your financial resources.
In this way, you would choose people with trust to take the financial decisions in your name and pay your bills unless you are able to do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical care and is on the way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about the drugs you drink and his allergic reactions?
Note these details in a written form to be prepared.
"It's not just about finances, but about who the doctors are?" asks Martin.
"Who are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make a plan like that."
A man shot several times with an air gun in Ilfracomb
The man was shot several times by an air gun as he returned home from leaving.
A 40 - year - old victim was found in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracomb when he was shot in cities, stomachs, and hands.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place about 02:30 BST (British summer time) as a "accident act."
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are calling on the Witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by violent earthquake and tsunamis, which struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, publicized by officials, with the number of victims expected to increase.
Because of the interruption of communications, aid personnel cannot obtain information from the Dongala area, north of Palu, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter of 7.5 degrees.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
In addition to several key facts for Palo and Dongala, on the island of Sulavesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, which is located at the end of an ant valley on the west coast of the island of Sulavesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis.
Dongala is a region that extends more than 300 kilometres (180 miles) across the coast to the northwestern part of the island of Slavési.
The area, which represents an administrative region within the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the province's economy Central Sulawesi, particularly in the coastal region of Dongala.
Ninthing is also an important activity in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Moroval, on the opposite border of Sulavesi.
The Indonesian disaster management agency says that Palau and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, tsunamis killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
The tsunami also struck and hit the Western Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific ring of fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are:
2004: The great earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Acheh in northern Sumatra caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people across the Indian Ocean, more than half of which were inhabitants of Acheh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra by the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 degrees earthquake struck the southern part of Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, causing tsunamis that destroyed the southern coast, and then almost 700 people died.
2009: 7.6 degrees earthquake struck the area near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 - degree earthquake struck one of the Isle of Mentavaj, near Sumatra, causing tsunamis that reached ten feet [10 m] and destroyed tens of villages, killing about 300 people.
2016: The earthquake with a flat focus hit the area of Pidi Jaya in Achech, causing empty and panic because it reminded people of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis in 2004.
This time the earthquake did not cause tsunamis, but more than 100 people were killed by the fallen city.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested on charges of family violence
Trek Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sara Palin was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Vasila, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of family violence, interfering in a family violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by police officers in Alaska.
According to a police report, when a woman’s acquaintance tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes, she took the phone.
Palin is in the Matt-Su prison facility with the possibility of leaving if he pays a sum of 500 US dollars, KTUU said.
On Saturday he appeared in court, where he said he was "definitely innocent" when they asked how he was explaining himself before the court, they said from the network.
Palin is facing three A-class infringements, which means he can be sentenced to one year's imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.
He is also accused of a B-class violation, sentenced to one day's imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with the attack on his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sara Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case in front of Alyaska's vet is underway.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, interfering in the report on domestic violence and possession of arms under alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he'd probably hit her face.
Sara Palin was criticized by the Veteran groups in 2016 after he said that her son's violent behavior is caused by PTSN, the result of his service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulavesi on Friday.
A 7.5 - degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been halted, and the number of victims is expected to rise in the next days.
The earthquake struck the area near Central Sulawesi, which is located north of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
Social media circulate the video on which the moment of the hit was shown.
Hundreds of people had gathered for the beach festival in Palo when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek a rare death penalty for suspects of the terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for a death sentence for Sifulo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York where eight persons have died, a rare sentence that has not been executed in the federal crime state since 1953.
Saipov, 30 October, reportedly used a rental truck on the Home Depot to attack West Side on the highway down Manhattan and to cross the pedestrians and passengers on his way.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov has killed eight victims "targetly" and "targeted" committed serious physical injuries, according to the announcement of the death penalty for the purpose of the death penalty provided in the South District of New York.
According to judicial documents, there is a possibility of a death penalty and on both grounds of the prosecution act.
Several weeks after the attack, the Federal High Court filed 22-founded charges against Saipov, including eight charges of murder for recreational purposes, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
In order to carry out the attack, there was a need for "detail planning and thinking," the prosecutors said, in which the way Saipov carried out the same attack described him as "hazardous, cruel and dangerous."
"Saifulo Habibulaevic Saipov caused, injured, damaged and lost families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, En-Lore Dekat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlie, Hernan Feruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucho," announced the state's intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since a death sentence was being tried in the South District in New York.
The defendant, Calid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but he was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for July and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were murdered after being sentenced to a contract to conduct a spy service for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both were sentenced to death with an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not show up in the days and months following the attack, according to judicial documents.
The police reported that he told the investigators that he felt good about what he did.
According to the charges, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching the ISIS video on his phone.
The police also reported that he asked to put the sign of ISIS in his hospital room.
He explained that he was innocent on all 22 grounds of the charge.
David Paton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they're clearly disappointed by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death penalty, instead of accepting a confession of guilt and to say a life sentence without the possibility of release, will only continue the trauma of these events for all involved in the same event," Paton said.
Saipov's defense earlier asked the prosecutors not to seek a death sentence.
A member of the "Tori" party says NAJEL FARAJ should be responsible for the Bregzit negotiations
Nigel Faraj today, during a protest at the "Tori" party conference, promises to "mobilize the people's army".
Former leader of the "Ukip" party said politicians must "sympathize" with Eurosceptics, while one of Teresa May's followers proposed that he be held accountable for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative supporter Peter Bonn of the Burmingham march said the United Kingdom would "be outside the EU" if Mr. Faraj was the Secretary of the Bridge.
However, the challenge faced by Ms. May with regard to the integration of her deeply-participated members was highlighted by the counter-Bregzit members of the "Tori" party who joined in a special protest against Brigzit held in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to continue implementing the Czechs plan and despite the attacks by Pro-Brigzit, the anti-Bregzit and the EU.
The allies insisted that it would continue with efforts to reach agreement with Brussels despite strong reactions and that it would force the Eurosceptics and the members of the Laburist Party to choose between her package and "haos".
Mr. Bonn told Pro-Bregzit the "Leave Means Leave" assembly in Solikhal that he wanted to "reject the Czechs' plan".
He suggested that Mr. Faraž should be involved and that he should be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible for the negotiations, we would still be outside the EU," he said.
"I'll support Bragzit, but we have to reject the Chuckers plan."
Expressing his position against the EU, he said: “We have not fought in the world wars for now to be defeated.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bonn rejected the suggestions that public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain in the EU is completely incorrect."
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the "Tori" and pro-Bregzit party, also attended the march and said to journalists: "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Czechs plan is not well-accepted by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, is not well-accepted by our party and our activists, who are in fact those who go out on the streets and who owe us our victory of elections.
Please give up the Chuckers plan and start listening to us."
In a message directed to Ms. May, she added: "The Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Faraj of the assembly said politicians must "feel the anger" if they intend to give up the decision that was made at the referendum in 2016.
"This is now a question of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to hand over Bridget, and we're here today to tell them that "we won't let you get out of it."
In a message to the spirit - inspired crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to hand over Bregzit, to feel the warmth.
"We mobilize the people's army of this country which allows us to win in the Bregzit and which will not stop until we become independent, self-just and proud of the United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, anti-Brigzit faces marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the city center.
At the meeting of the group, a small number of activists came up this weekend carrying banners with the title "Tourivists against the Bregzit".
Lord Adonis, member of the Laburist Party, laughed at the conservatives about the security issues facing the opening of the conference on the application that created the party.
"These are people who tell us they can set up IT systems and all the technology needed for Canada plus, for a border without control, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete fascist.
There's nothing called a good Braggsit," he added.
Warren plans to think carefully about the president's election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says "will think well of the president's candidate" after the elections in November.
Boston Globe stated that the representative of the Moscow Democratic Party spoke about his future during the city assembly in western Massachusetts this Saturday.
Voren, a highly critic of President Donald Tramp, will be running the re-elections in November against the Republican Party's representative Jeff Dil, who was co-chaired by the Tromp campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the center of speculation that she could replace Trump in 2020.
The event on Sunday afternoon in Holikok was her 36th meeting with the voters after Tramp came to the presidential function, which used the form of a city council.
One of the guests asked her if she was planning to run for the president.
Warren replied that it is time for "women to go to Washington to correct our corrupt government, which includes setting up a woman on top."
Arrested the suspect for the shooting and death of Corporal Sims by the LSU team
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that the suspect of the shooting and the death of coroner Wade Sims of the LSU team that took place was arrested on Friday.
The police department in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of Dayon Simpson, 20, at the press conference at 11 o'clock in the east.
They announced a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the person from the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wide Sims had a shot in his head and as a result of the same death," police chief Murphy J. Paul said about the media on Saturday, "247sports".
Wade was involved in protecting his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted he was present at the crime scene, owned weapons, and shot at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and taken to prison in the police department of the East Baton Rouge.
As a young man up to 192 inches [192 cm] who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 matches with 10 matches last season, about 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 hits by competition.
Gran At Russia: Luis Hamilton closer to the world title after the team with its orders ensures victory over Sebastian Vetel
From the moment Walter Botas qualified in front of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the commands of the Mercedes team would play a major role in the race.
From the semi-position Botas had a good start and almost left Hamilton on the chair while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vetel to attack his co- outlaw.
Vetel first went into the box and left Hamilton to fight the movement at the end of the group, something he needed to have a decisive role.
Merzedez entered the box one round later and came behind Bethel, but Hamilton went forward after the action one of one of Ferrari's drivers found it difficult to leave the inside of his free-risk to remain on the side on the double move to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstapen started from the back line of the network and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round ended at seven.
Then he led most of the race and directed the tires of his car to the finish and reached Kimi Raikonen, taking the fourth place.
He finally entered the 44th circle box, but he couldn't increase the temperature in the remaining eight rounds, so Raiconen came to fourth place.
It's a tough day because Walter's done great work all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me go.
The team has made a truly exclusive decision to have its two in the race," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad speech of the body.
President Donald Tramp mocked Senator Diana Fynstein's rally on Saturday about her claim that she did not publish a letter from Christine Blassi Ford accusing the Supreme Court candidate Bret Kavano of sexual assault.
In his speech to the rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly object to Ford's testimony to the Senate's Justice Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that people are "bad and unfair and unfair."
"There's only one thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing is that in what's happening in the Senate in the last few days, you can see anger, people who are angry and mean and uncaring and honest," he said.
"When you see publications and information protections and they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Diana Faynstein, did you publish this information?
You remember her answer... did you publish the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Wait a minute then.
Did we publish it... no, we didn't publish it," he added, imitating the senator.
To Fainstein was sent a letter of information on charges against Cavano by Ford still in July, and they were published in early September, but Fainstein denied that the protection of information came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's instructions, I didn't publish her story," Fainstein told the committee, "The Hill."
"She asked me to keep them faithful, and I did what she asked."
But it seems that the president did not believe her denial, so he commented on the same meeting on Saturday: “I’ll tell you something, it was really bad talk about the body.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it was the worst part of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the High Court candidate, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that democratics use guidelines to achieve their own goals.
"They are determined to return power in any way.
You can see their evil, underweight, they don't care who they're going to hurt, who they're supposed to get back their power and control," said the president as announced "Mediaite".
Elite League: “Dundee Stars” 5-3 “Belfast Giants”
Patrick Dwyer reached two goals for Giants in the competition against Dundee.
"Dundee Stars" adjusted for the loss of the competition within the elite league on Friday against "Belfast Giants" by winning the 5-3 dance in Denmark on Saturday.
Giants got the advantage of two goals that Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovillier achieved.
Mike Saliván and Jordan Connie reached the advantage of the host before Dwyer to return the leadership of Giants.
Françoisa Busha is equal to "Dundee" before Lucas Lundwald Nilsen to provide their victory with his two goals.
This was the third time in the season under the elite League for Adam Kifi's boys, who returned with the victory over Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two sides of the season, where Giants won the previous three contests.
The chance for Dwayer came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with the addition of Kendal McFol, which was secured by David Rutherford while Bovilier doubles the lead four minutes later.
This was a quick opening of the competition, Saliván provided the host's leadership at 13:10, before Matt Merkart assisted Kauni to achieve the score 15:16.
The couple took care of Giants to take the lead until the first break, when he reached the second floor for the evening at the end of the first period.
The host is regrouped and Bushhard returns them again with a powerful game and goal, at which the result was 27:37.
Kauni and Charles Corcoran were combined to help Nilesen for the first time secure Dundee's leadership in the competition later in the second period and he assured his team victory in half of the last period of the fifth contest .
Giants, who lost four of their last five matches, will play their next game on Friday in Milton Cans.
Flight controller died helping hundreds of people on the plane to escape earthquakes
Air traffic controller in Indonesia is famous as a hero after his death by helping hundreds of people fly safely.
More than 800 people died, and many disappeared after a great earthquake struck the island of Sulavesi on Friday, causing tsunamis.
Strong follow - up surveys continue to leave the area, and many are stuck in the Urnatis in the city of Palo.
But even though his colleagues refused to save their own lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave the position in the control tower of Mutirara Cis Al Jufri in Palu, which was constantly falling.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air aircraft with flight number 6321, which was then on the track, would fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower at the moment he thought the tower was falling.
He died later in the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, the spokesman for "Air Navigation Indonesia," said that his decision probably saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News said.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived at Paul.
"This news broke our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of victims can reach thousands of people, and the disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims is increasing because many bodies are still under the Urnati, while many can't even access it," the agency's portfolio Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said.
Branches that reached as far as 60 feet [6 m] abandoned Paul, where a mass funeral would take place on Sundays.
Military and commercial aircraft carry help and relief.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said about Sky News: "Quick help carries the body every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
The minimarcets are everywhere stolen."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said "CNN": "The Red Cross in Indonesia is quick to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get even worse."
President of Indonesia, Yoko Vidodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and sent her a message to the national army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
At the beginning of this year Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man disappeared after the plane crash in the valley
The airline that operated a plane that fell into the Pacific lien in Micronesia now says one man has disappeared, after saying earlier that 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that had tole.
Air Niugini said they couldn't find the male passenger from Saturday afternoon.
The airline reported that it works with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuck Island airport.
Officials on Friday announced that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday and everyone was in a stable condition.
The causes of accidents, as well as the exact order of events, remain unclear.
The airline and the American Navy reported that the plane hit the plane near the track.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane had missed the track.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was very low.
"That's an absolutely good job," said Janes.
Janes said he and the others were able to pass through the water that reached half of them and to head to the emergency exits of the plane that tunneled.
He said that the guards were panicking and screaming, as well as that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors working near the port’s reconstruction also helped to rescue the crew by pushing people on board before the plane to sink some 30 metres (100 steps) of water.
Air Safety Network data show that 111 people died in accidents at PNG registered in the last two decades, but none of them were included in Air Niugini.
An analyst confirmed a time frame of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded by presenting the case on Saturday for the retrial trial of the man who accused a woman in Mississippi of burning her alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlet, an analyst from the U.S. Ministry of Justice, witnessed with hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He noted for the record that he used phone records to link the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Telis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night he died.
Rowlet said he got data on the location of several mobile phones that indicate that Telis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which is contrary to his previous statements, said The Clarion Ledger.
When it was shown on the basis of the data that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was questioned on Saturday and testified that the day was not in the city.
When the prosecutors asked if Telis was telling the truth by saying he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "a liar because my truck was in Nashville."
Another setback was that Telis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
Phone records show that they knew only one week.
Rowlet said that some time after the death of Chambers, Telis deleted the messages and calls from Chambers, as well as her contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Hail.
The defence should present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to decide on the case later that day.
‘The High Breed: What's a hip-hop conjugated?

They want to return to his roots and repopulate the conscience hip hop.
Artists such as "The Fugees" and "Common" have recently experienced their lives through artists such as "Akala" and "Lowkey".
Another nigger?
A couple from New York accused a couple of being released after sending a "racist" message
A couple from New York accused a couple of having been abandoned on the basis of discrimination after they had received a message from the mother who complained that she was "one more black."
The marriage couple deny that they are growing up, saying that the charge is actually a "dangerous."
Linsy Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, was disappointed when in 2016 after the first working day of new negotiator Giselle Morris found out she was black.
"I don't want another black girl," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message directed to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Morris, and that twice.
Once she realized what she actually did to Plasco-Flaxman, feeling "unsuitable" she abandoned Mrs. Morris, saying that their friendly sister, who is African-American, had done her job badly and that she was expecting her daughter to be from the Philippines, says "New York Post".
Mrs. Morris was paid for the first working day and then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris accuses the couple and seeks compensation for the damage to the 350 US dollars export release every day for six months, a commitment that would involve her to live with the family, which was first committed, but without concluding a contract.
"I want to show them that they don't have to do such things," she said on "Post" on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple returned to the allegations that they were growing up, saying that Ms. Morris' release was a reasonable step because they feared they could no longer believe her after they had hurt her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't think of.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said husband Joel Plasco for "Post."
“But would you trust your children to whom you were unworthy, even for a mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's be real."
By saying that the charge is "a disappointment", Plasco said his wife gave birth to the baby just two months ago and that she was in "a very difficult situation."
“Are you going to attack someone who is in such a situation?
That's not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still under way, the public is quick to condemn the couple of social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Podington's publishers fear readers will not be able to connect with the sword that speaks, found in the new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said regarding the letter: “It’s really hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
It's very interesting that we now know all about the great success of Padington.
After she said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for BBC before being inspired to write the book of a small game in the form of a sword, would still be optimistic if his work was not well-accepted, she added that the 60th year of the publication of the book was "and bitter and sweet" after his death last year.
For "Padington", whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she adds that her father felt quiet pride about his potential success.
"He was a really quiet man and he didn't even want to thank himself," she said.
"But since he felt "Paddington" so real, it was almost like having a child that achieved something in life: and you're proud of him even though success does not depend on you.
I think Padington's success has taken him this way.
Although it was a word of creation and the fruit of his fantasy, he always wrote his own "Paddington."
My daughter was on death row, and I had to meet her on the phone.
Her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors desperately tried to save her life.
"Now I was summoned to tell me regularly that the situation is very bad and that it is expected that it will not survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz.
"Then Nad called to tell me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did to her.
And I said, “Tasha, I really love you so much.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The effect of the medications that her doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slowly was reduced and she was getting out of her system.
She died early, and this meant that all her systems were giving up.
I just had to sit and wait, aware of the fact that all this is happening.
I could not scream, cry, or cry again because I was surrounded by family members and people.
I really had to stay awake."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperus lamenting the loss of his daughter was riding on the plane along with other passengers, unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I raised my head, and the tears didn't stop.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I felt a great deal about Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her."
Grieving women set a bridge card to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones in death make efforts to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamfris place maps on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and telephone numbers on which people can call for support.
Miss Davis' son, Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and he killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, says her son had a great potential to become a cook, as well as an infected smile.
"Everyone remembered him for his smile.
People always said his smile could light up every room."
However, he quit his job before he died because it was “in a really dark place.”
His brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found Tyler after he took his life in 2014.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm always afraid it will have a consistent effect."
Ms. Davis develops the cards "for others to let them know that there are people out there who can talk to and who can talk to, even if it's becoming a friend.
Don't sit in silence, you have to start talking."
Mrs. Hamfris, who is a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost her partner Mark, who was married for 15 years shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt unhappy or depressed, nor did he say anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed changes in his behavior.
He reached the end of Christmas day when the children opened their gifts, and he didn't even look at them and made no contact with them."
She said that his death was a tremendous tragedy for all of them, but they had to find a way to pass on it: “This is the kind of thing that disturbs the family.
We're broken.
But we have to keep fighting."

Bret Kavano's future is uncertain after the FBI started the investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get something that is contrary to what he was asking for, i.e. an investigation with limited time, with limited scope, we might be able to achieve a little unity," said Mr. Fleck on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee "disappears" under the current stand-alone state.
Why did Kavano and his supporters from the Republican Party not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their mobility is due only to the timing.
The mid-term elections should be held for only a few weeks, on 6 November, and if the Republicans are expected to face failure, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to elect their highest court member in the country.
George V. Bush calls to the senators, where he works in the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who, however, worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What's going to happen after the FBI announces his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats at the moment.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavano could receive at least 50 votes in the Senate's vote, enabling Vice President Mike Pens to change the unfathomable outcome and enter the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea "has decreased" under Kim's leadership
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Young-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean envoy said.
Park Bjeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Union Ministry, said there were 1.127 crossings last year in comparison with 2011 when there were 2.706.
Mr. Park said the strengthening border controls between North Korea and China and the high rates of people's sweaters were key factors.
Pyongyang didn't comment publicly.
Most North Korean refugees are currently receiving state aid in South Korea.
Saul says that more than 30,000 people from North Korea have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and which can easily be crossed in comparison with the well-protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China considers these people illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriated them.
The relations between the North and the South, whose technicality is still in war, have improved significantly in the past few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss issues that focused on the stand of negotiations on denuclearization.
This followed a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Tramp and Kim Young-un in Singapore where they generally agreed to work towards achieving the goal - the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But North Korea's Foreign Minister Rey Young-ho accused the sanctions imposed by the United States on the increase from then to now.
"As long as there is no confidence in the United States; there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such conditions we cannot put ourselves out first," said Mr. Rei in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bret Cavano "historic" and says he is not qualified to serve in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader of the House of Representatives called the Supreme Court candidate Bret Kavano "historic" and said that if his temper is taken into account he is inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't but think that if a woman acted that way, they would say she was "historical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kawano's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaughly denied claims that he had sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blassy Ford when they were teenagers.
Cavano was very emotional at his internship, sometimes even weeping and missing while talking about his family and school years.
He also clearly condemned the democracies in the committee, calling them against him "a gross and coordinated destruction of his view" organised by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Cavano’s testimony was proof that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he had been shown to be afraid of the democracies.
"I think it's disqualifying itself with those statements and the way the Clinton family and democracies have been attacked," she said.
Pelosi did not answer the question whether she would try to remove Cavano from function if the allegations against him were confirmed and if the Democrats received the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this: if he does not tell the truth before the Congress or the FBI, then he is not only qualified to serve in the Supreme Court, but he is not worthy to serve in the court where he is at the moment," Pelosi said.
Cavano is currently a judge at the District Appeal Court in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a democracy she was concerned about the possible sentences that would bring Cavano against the Act on Access to Health or Roy against Wade, because he is considered a subject of conservative justice.
In the hearings to confirm his candidate, Kavano did not answer the questions about whether he would lower some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for a decent, shy man to enter the court and wait for us to say, "It's really beautiful, isn't it?" Pelosi said.
And women should use it.
It's really a severe criticism, months and years of anger gathering, which she can't release without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She continues, “It helped me a lot of help to a woman who was doing an executive job somewhere, and who told me that she cried when she was angry, but she managed to develop her own technique, so when she became angry and started to cry, she tells her face, “You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continues to cry.
I think that's great."
The salts are permitted as a ventilator for anger partly because they are actually wrongly interpreted.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs at the office where the men dominated was when I once began to cry with unexplainable anger and an old woman, a cold manager of which I always had some fear, took me to the door and pulled me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and they'll enjoy the fact that they're able to reach you."

In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a ship's online business called "Monkey Business" and withdrew from the presidential race, Mrs. Shreder, deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she would not think of the idea of candidates for president.
"It wasn't a well thought-in-depth decision," he told me 30 years later through a laugh.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Sneaked and Seven Juggins."
Given the fact that the campaign had long started, she did not have enough financial resources, so she promised she wouldn't get in the race unless she collected 2 million US dollars.
That was a lost battle.
She learned that some of her supporters gave her men’s kitchen $1,000, to which she would give only $250.
"Do they think I need a break?" she asked.
During the speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign she was so dominated by emotions, i.e. thanks to the people who supported her, the frustration of the system for which it was so difficult to collect funds and to terget voters rather than delegates and hate sex, she began to cry.
"If you had seen me you would probably have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Ms. Shreder recalls how the media responded to the case.
"You thought Klinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember asking what they'd write on my graveboard.
"She's crying?"
How the US-China trade war can be a good job for Beijing
The opening of the fire with the beginning of the US-China trade war was exciting and, although the battle is far from over, the conflict between countries can be useful for Beijing on a long-term basis, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States gave the first warning at the beginning of this year by paying off key exports in China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The situation has significantly deteriorated during this week by introducing new customs tariffs for goods worth 200 billion US dollars (150 billion dollars), effectively taxing half of the goods coming to the United States of America from China.
Peking was returning to nature every time, about five to ten percent of American goods worth $60 billion.
China promises to return to the United States with the same measure, and it is little more likely that the second largest economy in the world will decline in the same way in the near future.
To make Washington withdraw means to accept his demands, but public worship before the United States would be too ashamed for Ksi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays well, US military pressures can result in positive support for China on a long-term basis because it will reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that with a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing, conditions can be created to begin a sudden decline in economic aspect in any country is much more dangerous than was previously determined by observers," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia in the New American Security Centre, which represents a tank tank.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of refugees, the Foreign Minister said
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and makes efforts to help restore the country that has been abandoned by the long war that lasted for more than seven years.
In a speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem said the conditions in the country improved.
"Today the situation on the ground is stable and safer, which is due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renew the areas left by terrorists in order to restore the state to normal.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country to which they had to leave because of terrorism and the economic measures imposed unanimously have been taken that have affected their daily lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Additional six million people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime welcomed assistance in the restoration of the country.
However, he stressed that he would not receive any help or help from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe has achieved a significant victory for the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the US team in Ryder Cup 2018 with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in "Le Golf National", outside Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six times over the European field and has not won the title of Ryder's purchase in Europe since 1993.
Europe has repeated the receipt since Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached 14.5 points that were needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mikelson, who faced difficulties during most of the tournament, at his first bullet hit the ball in the water in par-3 at the 16th floor, lost from French Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari was noted throughout, with one of the four players who achieved the score 5-0-0 after the tournament began to be organized in the current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spit lost the score of 5:4 from the lowest-ranked player of the European team, Torbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's highest-ranking player, lost 2 and 1 of Ian Poulter from England, who was probably the last time he played the Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Serhio Garcia, a participant of eight Ryder purchases, became a European who won most of the tournament's titles with 25.5 points won during his career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop.
This year was really hard.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm so glad we brought the title back.
The team game is the most important and I am happy that I could help," said the emotional Garcia after Europe's victory.
He's now leaving his cousin John Ram's place, which one of the ones won on Sunday, Tiger Woods, the American Gulf legend, with a result 2:1.
"I feel incredible pride that I won Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four contests in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
It's about amazing statistics of one of the best players at all times, who won 14 great titles, when ranked after Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team for the weekend was trying to direct the game to low-tree fields, with the exception of Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
American team captain Jim Furic after his team's disappointment game said, "I'm proud of these guys, they really fought.
One morning we assigned him the difficulties of the European team.
We fought.
Get down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the American Association of Professional Golfers and our Rayder Cup Committee and we're going on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to admit them.
They were playing with us.
