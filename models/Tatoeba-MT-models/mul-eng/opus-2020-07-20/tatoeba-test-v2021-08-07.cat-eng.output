I heard what you said.
I heard her story.
I wrote a letter.
I wrote a book of kitchen.
I was glad to see that he finally made a sign.
I read several books last week.
I noticed that she sat on the front line.
I opened the box.
I thought he was angry and he would go.
It was me who called at the door.
I called before.
I saw the man trapped in a car.
Well, I'm sorry.
He fought against racial discrimination.
We went without him because he wasn't ready.
He left for the United States.
He died three years ago.
We called at the door for five minutes, but it was gone.
They had to break the arm to Tom.
They went through the topic right now.
It happened on my side to see that I didn't know him.
He lost all his money.
He painted the blue door.
He tried to score the taron.
I went to Kyoto.
She was heedless for her part to leave the door unclosed when she went out.
It was an anonymous complaint that allowed the police to reach terrorists.
It was a wonderful night.
It was a terrible week.
It was a nightmare.
He sat in front to hear.
He came home three hours later.
He comes here every five days.
I see the moon on the horizon.
You come here all day?
Come when you want.
You come here every day?
We're wearing them in the winter.
Watch your cars cross the street.
Come with us.
Come when you want.
Come when you want.
It's a joke.

He lives here.
They live on the other side of the river.
You live in Tokyo?
I'd like to meet your older sister.
I'd like an aspirin.
I'd like a clearer one.
We want complete prayers.
I wanted to buy the book, but I realized I didn't have more than 200 eggs.
You want to marry me?
Do you want to do this now?
You want to play tennis with us?
Would you like to take another fee from you?
Do you want a beer?
He wants a watch like yours.
He wants a watch like yours.
You're taller than she is.
You need it.
You don't have to eat it.
I want to go to America some day.
I want to learn hope.
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
I want to stay here.
I want a book.
I want to see the ocean.
I want to live in a quiet city with the clean air.
