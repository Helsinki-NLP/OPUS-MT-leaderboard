Say what you want.
We're leaving Boston.
Tom could not escape feeling that something was going on right away.
I don't have to agree with everything I say.

I ran to my mother.
I'm very early.

We saw her entering the park.
Tell me about your wife.
I'd like to be a little taller.
The speed of the light is much higher than the speed of the sound.

Hello, is anyone there?
Tom's wife left him in 2013.
His heart is troubled.
This man is my friend.
Do you remember what she said?
Did Marika write you a letter in Finnish?
He mentioned your name.
It doesn't look like my sister.
Never compare your wife to another woman.
The dirty blues have already come out of the skin.

You can't get out of here.
The doctor came right away.
It's too late.
The car's already hiding one small cabin.
Isn't that right?
I forgot to call him today.
Here's my bike.
I don't want to hurt you.
There's nothing wrong with it.
I'm just asking for something, so I'm not a alkane.
I don't have your address.
Are you Alkana?
Reading is my passion.

Is there a basis for such a conclusion?
How does your car look?
It's hot today.

We've got our passports here.
Is that car too small?
What's the size of your shoes?
He's beautiful as a god!
The medium is green.
Thomas doesn't know whether to turn to the sword or to the right.
The Japanese are a brave nation.
They're incredible.

The doctor looked at the child and said she was healthy.
Nothing's wrong.
Don't run around the pool.
Be creative.
Scholars explain this difference.
Am I too busy?
I'm asking you to get out of the light.
She's no hero.
Why did you do that?
Do you think we'll find her home?
Which team is ours?
She played guitar, and he played.
You're different, you love me.
Keep out of the fire.
Maybe it's snow in the morning.
My room walls are green.
The calculator is a great expression.
Did he really do that?
I saw her entering the room.
There's a lot of books in his room.
When did you find it?
The one who has everything can lose everything.
Are you Alkana?
You never understand my jokes.
I found a couple of fingers behind the bed.
He's back in the morning.
I need an e-mail ring.
I can't just leave you here.
Life is short for the wine of the little ones.
If the car is damaged, you're responsible.
This is my heart.
They're somewhere higher than us.
I thought she had no reason to share what she did.
Aren't you tired?
Good evening, how's it going?
She's very nice.
I told him myself.
People should work.
"Shut up," he whispered.
Because he often loves them, they cannot be trusted.
What do you mean?
Leave me alone!
I'm doing this without any problems.
Mark took his things and left.
We finally learned the truth.
You're looking good.
At present, Thomas is learning English in Japan.
Thomas complains about the noise.
No one's here.
Who do you want to borrow?
Did anyone say where our secret is?
For the first time, I came to Japan.
Look at what Mary is doing.
He knows how to play poker.
Thank you very much.
It's over.
I don't like school.
They've been looking for the wormholes.
I grew up for my son.
She's stuck in the kitchen.
I don't have the best understanding.
Don't cry like that.
Why are you feeling that way?
There's a lot of words I don't understand.
Could I have a cup of tea?
I have to tell her the truth in the morning.
My dream is to teach Totor language in Kazanya.
I'm a student.
I'd like to dig the map.
You're gonna have to drive.
Take your brother with you.
But she was always able to get what she wanted.
You didn't tell me anything?
Leave me, ladies and gentlemen.
She knows exactly what she wants.
Hello.
Did Thomas forgive you for what you did last week?
Good morning, it's time to wake up.
The baby's been sleeping all night.
She doesn't like the city of life.
This is too big for me.
That's okay.
Do whatever you want.
The man you saw last night is my uncle.
I don't like snow.
I gave Tom a chance.
We're playing golf, not throwing things.
What kind of test?
He told me about his life story.
I decided to be happy because this is good for my health.
I'll stay here until he gets back.
A teacher.
What do we see here?
What do you see?
That's not what you think!
In that store, you can buy yourself a dog.
He likes sweet cake.
You have to do the same thing.
It's simple and intuitive.
How many hours do you work a week?
Yeah, two.
They don't.
Please contact me when you get to Boston.
She asked me what came first.
We'll all die sooner or later.
How long will it take?
It's a hat.
Where is the German Embassy?
Be friendly.
This rose is amazing.
But he knew it couldn't continue.
Maybe not.
I want it too!
She's watching, but she's not seeing anything.
He can't eat a salad today.
She's white.
I'd like to travel around the world.
Do you like Italian?
I've been in prison for five years.
I didn't.
Any thing that is simple enough to understand it is too simple to create an understanding that could be understood.
We didn't have to hurry.
Please?
It doesn't matter which team win game.
He's running away.
This dress is too big for me.
Get out and stay at your car.
Bring her a half salad.
We're friends.
She didn't answer.
I heard Mary wants a divorce.
Is this a sleek or a whore?
My father came home in the morning.
This mountain is covered with snow every year.
Never lose hope.
Can you give me a drink?
This book belongs to the libraries.
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
From milk we produce cheese and butter.
When I was in high school, I spent six hours every day in the morning.
You guys are the best bastards.
How can you say something like that?
Be careful!
Obviously you've done this before.
Do you get a letter?
Two years ago, I couldn't play the piano.
What is the difference?
You're accused.
She rejected my request.
Who did you say you were first?
I like Korean food.
He invited me south.
You're still sad.
There's nothing here.
You never know what's going to happen in the future.
We're producing copper forms.
Everyone likes to bets.
What did you do to make this happen?
Look at the example given above.
Their flight seemed very funny.
I wanted to be a philosopher.
You're not fast enough.
We're leaving the door open.
Can you bring the bride?
Why are you calling?
They discussed the problem.
If I didn't get his help, I wouldn't be alive.
He was almost asleep.
I have one brother.
Where did you come from?
Do you like that color?
Isn't it different that Tom's not here right now?
Millions have lost their lives in war.
Compare your word with that on the plane.
She took him for granted.
They need our help.
Did you get Tom's note?
I don't like what he's talking about.
I don't know what's going on with me anymore.
I've learned a lot from him.
He killed that man.
Don't believe too much.
That red hat is old.
He plays golf every Sunday.
Be creative.
I couldn't understand what he said.
Shut the door.
I'm always nervous.
He was upset.
Go back to your place.
Be friendly.
Isn't it a great morning?
It's just a story.
I have more and more yellow hair.
He turned off the light.
I'm not jealous.
The sky is blue.
The old woman wanted and couldn't quit.
After the movie, they're tired.
You can use my word.
I want to talk to your grandfather.
That's what you're gonna do to Tom.
He's rarely home on Sundays.
When would you like to see him?
Tom took the help.
His son's eight.
If I had the speed, I'd fly to you.
When the hell are you going?
He promised me he'd be more careful in the future.
When did you hear the noise?
I forgot to buy one thought.
I've heard a lot about you.
Don't go now, we're ready for lunch.
Italy is a very beautiful country.
That's old-fashioned.
Eat your gift!
Although he is also living in the United States, Thomas does not speak English.
The school is five miles from my home.
I've given up my gun.
Who ate all our food?
I know their gift will be scanted.
Please be patient.
Women change the world.
Singapúre is considered to be a crime on the ground.
I wanted Mary to love me instead of Tom.
You can sit on your chair.
We need more sugar.
The pink scent filled the room.
Blogging sometimes.
Thomas already had three cups of coffee.
I don't understand German.
Yes, please.
I'll help you.
You're accused.
Who are you looking for?
What does that mean?
The apples on the other side of the wall are the sweetest.
Is that it?
I studied Japanese.
That's ridiculous.
She had a woman's head, a leukemia body, a bird's wings, and a living egg.
Tell me how you solved that problem.
Would you like to come with me?
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't explain what happened there.
I was afraid of heights.
I don't know where to go.
If you don't mind, we'll go.
What's going on with me?
I'm a match.
Compare the facts.
I'm not Alkan right now.
I'm going to France to leave.
You can sit wherever you want.
You're engineers.
The door was slowed down.
That's the story.
Did you get involved in any sports?
It's time for you to start a new business.
Let's get out of here.
This girl I told you is living here.
Please, just leave.
I can't believe she's older than my mother.
Look back and see the black cat.
She's got a lot to do with her family.
Do you know him?
I don't know whether to turn to the sword or to the right.
I'll take off the kitchen later.
He came from a small village.
I was kidding my friends.
All your cats are girls.
And now I remember the times when we were dating you.
When we're hungry, we're going to call them low.
Scandals got his career in progress.
Cats are complex individuals.
He was so poor that no one could buy gifts.
I suggest you ask Tom.
This mixture is not small.
There's nothing wrong with that.
If you ask him, he'll be coming soon.
I know that you know that I know.
Go home before 6:00.
Doona's fresh.
I'll be back in half an hour.
I don't want to be mad anymore.
Are you a lawyer?
Where'd you go to school?
The cave light.
I'm sorry.
Put the paper in half.
What does he write in letters?
The woman's eating the gift.
I ate the apple.
A single person finds pleasure in watching the birds.
Who's the man sitting at the end of another table?
Are you pregnant?
I'm really busy right now.
His steps have been well established.
I've been punished for all the eternity of these endless space.
Where do you need a new message?
He cut the straight line on the wall.
You need a car?
Take your hat off when you get into class.
They don't have anything else to complain about.
She's on her way.
Please contact me when you get to Boston.
Thomas was seven hours late.
This is for us.
Close the radio.
Bernie wants to know the truth.
Thomas took a look at all the little one.
You have to take care of yourself.
You need courage, Tom.
How's your time?
Your trip starts here.
Can you believe what he said?
Thomas asked where you were.
I'd like to help, but I'm very busy.
Thomas couldn't think of Mary.
I think we need to talk to Tom.
Don't go back to the bus.
All the apples are there.
You're gonna have to pay.
When should we go to the station?
The more I think about it, the less I like it.
I'll take you to the new store.
Everyone knows her.
She's an incredible nut.
Where's Turkey?
Tom's starting.
I can't.
Get out of class.
There's three dogs sleeping on my mom's bed.
Thomas has already finished the job he had to do.
If you can't have children, you can always get bored.
That's what I thought.
Although she was running as fast as she could, she was still not afraid of the bus.
They need friends.
Young people, please.
Can you find it as a gift?
Do you like living like this?
It's hot today, isn't it?
Are you sure you don't have a home?
Are you playing chess?
Her boyfriend is Turk.
Answer me.
My mother can't come.
There are lots of people in Bavaria.
Do you know if he has a girlfriend?
I don't have a family.
The parents believed too much of their son.
What would you like to order, gentlemen?
That's what happened to him.
He came into my room without permission.
You can't just leave.
Come on, man!
You can sit on your chair.
Where do you live if you don't have a home?
Our union can be warm.
He told me I could use his car.
Almost all students like English.
That test was so hard that we didn't have time to finish it.
That's all.
You have to work fast.
If it is believed that society has not given up on any value, it can be said that it believes in a mass destruction.
English is spoken around the world.
All their efforts were in vain.
Where did it go?
This girl's playing pretty bad.
Life is unfair.
Each person paid a thousand dollars.
Jilla is the only girl in our club.
Schools don't have to go to school today.
The sun shines on the sky.
His parents were satisfied with his success.
Now it's our house.
I'll call them in the morning when I get home.
He helped fix my watch.
No one's worth helping me.
John didn't know what to do next.
He suffered from severe headaches.
I want a dog.
I have to find my pen.
Sometimes Nigeria was British colony.
Don't throw stones into the river.
I'm a good student of Germans.
She wears her camera's white color.
I can't go until he's gone.
I encouraged her to kiss.
Have you finished your homework?
John is a professor of French literature at Oxford University.
Do you understand what he said?
What color is her hair?
The sooner you get back, the happier your father will be.
Are you ready to start your trip?
Your clock is ten minutes late.
They gave you a deal.
You told me she was yours.
How much money do you have to hide after your money?
We believe in God.
I'm a hero.
This is the man I've been waiting for.
He didn't pay the debt and started it.
Mr. Brauna speaks very well in Japanese.
No, he's not my new boyfriend.
I like to watch baseball and football.
Everyone, except her, broke up.
The king stood by the king.
This bridge was built two years ago.
She's my first love.
You have to keep your promise.
Tomas looks different today.
What is the rent price of the room?
We have to get out of here.
Thomas never wants to do that again.
I asked her to hold on for a minute.
How have you started learning the languages of the people who speak your language?
They don't pose a threat.
Their advice encouraged me to move abroad.
You're the only one who can help me.
What place does that have?
That's why we're playing inside.
Your origin is completely white.
But I don't want to.
I'm afraid I can't meet you tonight.
Thomas has a sister who is a lawyer.
I'm like my mother.
This morning, you just look funny.
Doctor, can you hear me?
You understand, don't you?
I hope to see him on Monday.
Tom's ready.
The eagle is hot, so be careful not to let go of it.
Do you find your letters?
For God's sake!
He doesn't remember whether that room was empty or not.
The store sells expensive accessories to women.
I don't like music.
It's not them.
I don't care about the back of my neck.
Just where you are.
The house is hers.
The doctor advised him to stop so much work.
Are you sure?
You were busy.
I can't live that way anymore.
He'll do anything to earn money.
I just want to talk.
What kind of music does Thomas like?
The tree grows near her home.
Don't talk in the library.
How's it going, Panel?
I'd just go to the dollar.
I don't want to live.
I think Thomas is trying to kill Mary.
It's just the right answer.
If I had been rich, I'd have given you some money.
When and where did you meet her?
Where'd you get it?
Tom didn't show up.
Don't be so serious, it's just a game.
He told a funny story.
I don't have time now.
Thomas is the captain of our team.
This rise is very long.
Listen to what the teacher says.
Why don't no one eat my balls?
I asked Tom to dig a guitar.
What do you remember?
She's probably convinced it.
What a wonderful night!
I can't find Tim.
She called him Charles.
I'm not sure if it's a boy or a girl.
Life is beautiful.
She's taking them to school.
Dadebe was temporarily unreachable.
Nobody liked what you said.
I didn't know what to say.
Do you think I should go alone?
Just answer the question.
I never want to be a student.
Look at the train going through the tunnel.
I'm not the only one who loves Tom.
I'm really tired now.
No, I don't think I'm hurt.
How are we doing?
I've got 10 karaokes.
Their flight seemed funny.
Don't touch her, she's too young to understand.
I bought this suit just for this pro.
It's similar.
You're welcome, okay?
This is the only explanation.
I can't believe I'm really here.
You don't know the way?
I love that.
This will require help.
I printed hundreds of pages.
I see and hear.
Don't forget the ticket.
Put your hand in front of your answer.
Please change the flag.
Isn't it true that you have a gun?
I spent the whole day in the war.
The war ended their investigation.
When the spring comes, the day is longer than the day after day.
I'm listening to radio.
Sweet dreams!
Leave my car in the backyard.
It's Tony's book.
I had to go ahead.
Thomas eats only what he wants to eat.
Who took this asshole?
He threw his ticket into China.
What would you do if you were in his place?
I don't like horses.
Beje, what's your address?
She was lying on the floor like a horse.
African dramas are larger than Asian dramas.
What I've always said.
He heard him working on Wednesday night.
Please bring me a glass of water.
He took her hand.
Eat the gift!
If God did not exist, he could have created us.
This time you should do the same thing yourself.
Shema was very kind to me.
You don't understand.
She has green eyes and bright red hair.
Does Thomas have experience?
She left her fault in the train.
I'm a farmer.
You have to go there.
What was the reason?
I don't see anything from here.
Because I didn't get an answer, I wrote it again.
She's standing on the wall.
Don't trust me too much.
They've missed a great deal.
Fight for your rights.
He always talks to me when he meets me on my way.
Look at the book on the table.
I've had one beer and I've had a lot of fun.
Thomas did not think that he needed a personal guardian.
Someone opened the door.
Do you have questions about this lesson?
We saw how she got into the park.
It's not like we're busy.
You didn't seem like you wanted those books.
I've got a red bike.
He's down and big.
I want to go to Tokyo.
The trip was boring.
He's much smarter than me.
Tom still doesn't seem interested.
Today, the weather is terrible.
I didn't want this to happen.
I'm trying to get out of here.
Like I said, I'm not gonna do anything.
After that, there's a little red dog.
Get rid of them.
Ana likes chocolate.
I know that Mike likes a chicken.
I've got to cut all the fibers into the ovaries' ovaries.
He died two years ago.
Get me to your room.
The taxis went straight into the army.
Yes, I understand.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
He was charged with murder.
If you don't go to school, you won't pay for anything.
If anything happens, we'll talk to you right away.
Would you like to have a cup of coffee?
Is there any danger?
You're dangerous to swim in this river.
My friends are wonderful.
It won't buy anything.
We have enough water.
Who will inherit the land?
She's working hard.
Don't be changed.
Please open this box.
Is it healthy to eat fish?
My baby wants to talk.
I asked her what music she likes.
There are no eyewitnesses.
Is she satisfied?
But he knew he had no choice.
Do you remember this game?
It started without documents.
I'm usually here.
She kept talking.
Mike doesn't know how to play baseball well.
Cupnugars are often used to travel in the deserts.
Mary is a book.
Then we'll get out of here.
I saw his car in front of the window.
Are you ready?
I'm happy I'm not a woman.
Stop cleaning time and get back to work.
The more you get, the better.
Ten years is a long time.
Is this your car?
I can't believe you're still a alkane.
To be happy is perfectly normal.
We have to move very carefully.
Did you get Tom's note?
Last night, I was hurt by my hand.
If I had been rich, I'd have given you some money.
I don't have a computer.
My father doesn't eat a lot of fruit.
Can you give me a break?
She kissed me with a kiss and made me feel good for the night.
My friend's here.
Where's your life now?
The older you are, the harder it is to learn the language.
Thomas doesn't smoke coffee, but he's smoking cigarettes.
Not everyone likes dogs.
I'll stay here a few days.
I feel bad.
Why did you say such a bad thing?
You can't defeat me.
I didn't think I could do that.
Is that true?
She's checking.
We'll take a look at the beach.
He's my father.
He doesn't want to wait for you.
He moved his family to the zoo.
Thomas refused to go to the hospital.
Same half of nine.
This car was manufactured in Japan.
Is that your first time in Japan?
Tony was happy.
My father asked me to open the door.
Make his photobot!
Your brother wasn't at school today.
Thomas will never let you down.
I was in Canada then.
I made this food myself.
Put the gun down.
Someone wrote his name on the wall.
The only thing that can cover the wrong in the wrong direction is the opposite.
They don't have sugar anymore.
I love your daughter.
Thomas wants him to stay tonight and he won't eat again.
Someone opened the door.
I'm not your mom.
Why isn't Tom in the car?
My name is Ricardo.
When did you get the telegram?
You don't have to swim in that hut.
When will the snow break?
He thought I was very tired.
I think she doesn't have to eat anymore.
Either you're with us or before us.
Please help me!
Thomas knows he likes Mary.
I like this music.
She's out of the dog.
He went to the store, but he stopped at her house.
Snow is moving fast.
We're here.
Of course I should read this book.
At present, Thomas is not in prison.
Thomas and Mary went to the museum.
The ship is moving along the horizon.
Good morning, my dear dog.
God blesses those who give up.
I can't work when you stand there.
Mary had problems with the lungs.
We were one big happy family.
What color car did she buy?
The boy spent the whole night.
Will you kill me?
She witnessed before him.
My father's growing rice.
We speak Japanese.
The result was disappointing.
I went through the window.
The meat's not ready yet.
Give me the gloves.
She needs more sleep.
Did you hear anything?
Is she your mother?
Sutem. Can we turn the light on?
He's no longer a doctor.
It was the first time I visited the museum.
We're wasting our time.
I think Thomas wants to stay.
What a nice family.
Do you, though, like, Florida?
You didn't have to eat those green fish.
Wake up! It's the last day.
We looked through the window, but we didn't see anything.
When was the last time you saw Tom?
The capital of Sweden is Stockholm.
They were talking about love.
Thomas never wants to do that again.
I don't understand.
Left alone, the child would feel very lonely.
I don't know anyone here.
Our teams lack mobility.
Cat's crossed the road.
Tena's a mirror.
Why don't you help the police?
I want to meet your father.
Please be patient.
He was busy.
I'm pregnant.
I saw him.
I'm hurting Logbano.
"Good morning," said Tom, laughing.
I'm hurting my arm.
He needs a hat.
You shouldn't go.
You shouldn't trust him.
There are seven days a week.
You have to make your own way of life.
Without air and water, no one could live.
He's been snooping, and he's just not worried about it.
They work eight hours a day.
I ate and I ate.
I do this every Sunday morning.
She quickly opened the letter.
Are you busy right now?
I'll forget everything I said.
Where do you have all these traits?
I'm in the middle of the window.
Take Tom to the hospital.
I have a white cat.
He quickly recorded our names.
Our son died in the war.
He is not satisfied with the result.
It's obvious you're wrong.
I can't tell you what's going to happen first.
I don't want to talk to you because you broke my heart.
Don't believe him.
We can all go
Who's sitting at the other end of the table?
This idea is very interesting.
They're going to buy it.
Everything that's genetic is simple.
Their lessons are too numerous to learn.
Thomas raised his hand.
We're going to be sick.
The wings are spread to the south.
This flower is very colorful.
I'm a nanny.
I'm sick.
It's okay, but I'm tired for a while.
It's a wonderful idea.
He's very proud of his game.
That'll never happen to us.
I wouldn't be at all.
The woman wants to know the truth.
Is this word often used?
Lithuania is a member of the European Union.
I want to be a linguist.
Where's the cat?
I'm sorry about what I did.
She's becoming a nurse.
I learned to ride a bike when I was six.
He took off his shoulder.
Let me do that.
I like jazz.
I'm sure he's innocent.
Open the window and enter the fresh air.
Have you ever proposed a word?
It's hard to sing.
Did you see my mother?
I know his name.
Thomas doesn't want to live that way.
Did you accept what she's doing?
He came here before the final lessons.
You know their address?
What are you doing?
He looked down on his prairie boots.
His catacombs were lying on my bed, and he didn't want to break.
There are several good hotels in the city.
From where did this letter come?
He doesn't want to teach today.
We're all different.
You don't know how hard I love you.
I wrote her a long letter.
He couldn't do what he wanted.
I feel weak today.
Life is interesting.
She's here?
I don't like music.
Be careful, okay?
I'm buying a camera for $30.
That's great.
That's no method, it's a provocation.
Answer in English.
He wants to see us again.
There's a lot of trouble here.
Where do you live?
My friend doesn't use sugar.
I'm out of my pockets.
He's supposed to be looking for people.
Bob was in bed at the time.
My brother is two years older than I am, but he is three inches lower than me.
I can only tell you what I know.
I'm thinking about you.
What's your home address?
He'll be free tomorrow.
Don't you see my wife?
Your daughter heard us talking.
Thomas will die soon.
I'm ready to go to bed later.
I've agreed to it before.
Look at that house with a red roof.
My boots on the fourth floor.
She was already pregnant.
We're the top players.
These clothes belong to you.
Don't worry about it.
Do you know you're stronger than me?
I love her so much that I can't leave her.
Can you go with us?
I don't care.
Thomas could not find a reason why he had to go home early.
Put your hand up.
He didn't sell the house.
No one has ever seen God.
She saw something waiting for her at school.
I don't think we should be busy.
Where's Maria?
The new contract allows us to demand what we want.
Thomas is still a cat.
