Members of the Wales Assembly do not want to “go on maps”
Among some members of the National Assembly, there is a lack of interest in the proposal to adopt the name of the MWP Abbreviator (from the Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of Parliament of Wales).
The problem decision is related to plans to amend the name of the Assembly of Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from various political parties are concerned about the possible escape from this observatory.
One of the librarians, expressing his party's opinion, expressed concern that the new Abbreviation “refuses Twp and Pwp”.
For our readers, not from Wales: walley twp means "tupica", and pwp is "kakaka".
According to a member of the Assembly of the Party of Wales, his organization in general remained “unsatisfied” and offered other options.
The representatives of the Conservative Party “did not object” to the new abbreviation, but noted that MWP was close to writing the word Muppet (mappet).
In this context, the letters w in the Wally language appear like the letters u in the Yorkshire dialect of English.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently developing a draft law on the change of names, made the following statement: “The final decision on how to name the members of the Assembly will be, of course, remains after them”.
The Wales National Assembly Act of 2017 authorized it to change its name.
In June, the Committee had published the results of a public opinion survey on the options proposed by the Parliament of Wales, which, instead of the Assembly, had found broad support among the local population.
With regard to the appointment of members of the Assembly, the Committee expressed preference for the option “Members of Parliament of Wales” (Wellsh Parliament Members, or WMP), while the option of MWP received the highest public support.
At the same time, members of the Assembly have proposed other options, but the President, Elina Jones, will find it difficult to find a satisfactory solution to all decisions, and remember that the draft amendment law must be submitted in a few weeks.
Reform laws will include other amendments to the working process of the Assembly, including new rules on the disqualification of members of the Assembly and the establishment of the Committee ' s system.
Members of the Assembly shall vote for the final version of their appointment during the legislative debate.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on the change in their country ' s name
On the resurrection day, Macedonians declared their country ' s name in the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The international vote has been called upon to allow for a multi-year dispute with a neighbouring Greece in which its province of Macedonia is located.
The Government of Greece has long insisted that the term “Republic of Macedonia” includes territorial claims in the Greek province and has repeatedly been opposed to the entry of its northern neighbour into the European Union and NATO.
President George Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on change of name, stated that his findings would not be recognized.
However, the referendum parties, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, note that the change in the name of the country is the total cost of entry into the EU and NATO.
The crisis in Harlem's income: always shut down St. Martin's Col.
“The old area I met said that earlier on each corner was on the bar and on the church, ” Adams relates.
"And now there is no one else."
The disappearance of bars can be understood as follows:
“The format of the public has changed.”
“Bar stopped being his kind of guest of the whole area where they came regularly.”
But as for the church, it is concerned that the funds received from the sale of the assets will not last long, as their leaders have put their trust in them.
At the place of the church, he added, there will be a multi-room house where residents will hardly be able to support residents in the area of income.
“Most of the buyers of these rooms will be white,” Adams says. “And this is about the day when such churches are finally closed, because new neighbors will never be their guests.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black area: the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and the Church of St. Martin was ten years later.
The first arrivals of the Methodist Church left their mark in the 30th century.
Their building was purchased by a black entrance in the neighborhood.
When St. Martin's church passed into the hands of the black community, she was led by a similar John Howard Johnson, who organized a shopkeeper on 125th Street, the chief trading center of Harlem, where they refused to accept work or increase in the service of the blacks.
In 1939 a fire caused serious damage to the building, and during the reconstruction work, Johnson's father ordered the installation of the carilion.
Similar to David Johnson, the son of Johnson, who changed him into the head of St. Martin church, he proudly called the Carolyn "coloss for the poor."
But the expert, who was testing Carolyn in July, called it “cultural heritage” and “unique historical instrument”.
An expert at the University of Michigan, Tiffany Ng, also noted that it was the first carillion of St. Martin's church to be the world's first instrument of his kind in which the black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, invited him 18 years ago to play a larger chariot in the Riverside Church.
According to Merriots, St. Martin's church has not yet been replaced.
During the last few months of St. Martin’s church, a complex situation arose with architects and contractors, some of whom were invited by worldly church leaders, others by the Episcopal Episcopal Church.
The collection, the lead of the income authority of the world leaders, was returned to Epachia in July, concerned that the Epachia “is trying to transfer the value of work” to the congregation, although the latter had no relation to the choice of architects and contractors sent by Epachia.
Some came to express concern about the lack of transparency by the European Union.
In California, a 13-year-old janitor of the winning lobby
According to official sources, on Saturday, the first day of the lobbying season, in California, 13-year-old nanny attacked the shark and suffered physical damage.
The attack took place about 7 a.m. near the Bikon Beach beach in Ensynthase.
As Chad Hammel told at the KSWB-TV station (San Diego), he met his friends on Saturday morning and, about half an hour, heard a boy crying for help.
According to Hammela, he began to realize that the boy was very excited about the lobbying, but soon he realized that he cried out, “I’m sorry!
He said, "I have heard."
In response to the attack, Hammel noted that “he had completely destroyed his skin around the key. ”
"I called for everyone to get out of the water and say, "Here's the shark!" Hammel says.
The boy was brought to the Reed Children's Hospital (San Diego); his condition was considered critical.
The kind of shark that hits a teenager is unknown.
Captain Larry Gailz, during the briefing, reported that a shark had been detected a few weeks ago in this place, but it did not lead to dangerous species.
Gailz also added that the victim of the attack was injured in the upper part of the tunnel.
The authorities closed the area from the ponto beach in Casablade to the Svami beach in Ensinitas for 48 hours to conduct investigations and to ensure the safety of the population.
Gailz noted that there are 135 kinds of sharks in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Seinsbury plans to submit to the United Kingdom perfume-cosmetic market
Seinsbury is planning to set up cosmetics and perfumes divisions in Butts, Superdrag and Debenheims stores with cosmetic consultants, according to the model of the luxury universities.
The United Kingdom's retail market is estimated at 2.8 billion pounds of sterlings and continues to grow, while fashion and household goods fall. In order to capture a significant share of this desirable market as an experiment in 11 stores across the country, space and perfume sectors will be presented, and in the case of success in many other shops next year.
The owners of the supermarkets will seek to fill the boxes that were previously released under television, microwave ovens, household goods, and investment in the perfume-cosmetic market.
According to the representatives of Seinsberi, it is planned to increase the two assortment of cosmetic goods to 3,000 names; the first would be proposed such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing association from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be presented to a greater extent, in specialized locations, by the type of organization of goods in Butts stores.
In addition, a business line of Boutik-Cosmetic products will be reorganised to meet the demands of young buyers.
In two Seinsbury stores will be presented with cheeses from Fragrance Shop, the first of which has already been opened in Crodon, South London last week, and the second is expected to be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
The Internet trade and the tendency to buy small quantities of products every day in small bags soon from home led to the fact that supermarkets were forced to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Kup, President Seinsbury, says that the cars are gradually converted into the universe, and his supermarket network is fighting for buyers in the competitive fight against dairy shops, such as Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and non-food goods.
Hundreds of Seinsbury supermarkets are located in Argos, and some of them are now able to find the Habitats store from the time the network got two brands two years ago, resulting in increased sales of food goods and extracts from these acquisitions.
The previous attempts to give the supermarket a new life to their cosmetics and appetizers have not been successful.
In the early 2000s a joint venture between Seinsbury and Butts was organized, but further differences arose between the participants in the distribution of income from the sale of patents in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed following the sale of the Seinsberi pharmaceutical business (all 281 stores) by Selesio, the owner of the Lloyds Farms Network, for 125 million pounds of sterlings three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the implementation of the plan by adding a broad line of luxury care facilities for La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, CEO of Seinsbury, says: "We have completely transformed the appearance and atmosphere of our perfume and cosmetics departments to create a more favourable environment for our buyers.
We have also invited special-educated consultants who will always be ready to assist the Council.
Our brand association for any taste, pleasant design and convenient storage of stores will attract many visitors to search for cosmetics and perfumes, and this will be a completely new concept of shopping".
Peter Jones responded to Holly Willowby's 11 million pounds of sterling
The star of the "Logova Dragon" show, Peter Jones "refused" by Holly Willowby TV out of a deal of 11 million pounds of sterlings, which she intended to conclude with Peter's Lifstyl brand, but instead preferred new contracts with "Marx and Spencer" and ITV
Willowby doesn't have time for their common brand of home clothes and accessories Truly.
This couple's business was compared to the brand Goop actress Gwinett Peltro.
The 37-year lead programme “Etim tomorrow” announced its decision in Instagram.
The decision of Holly Willowby to leave their profit-free lipstick brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV led to the light of Peter Jones, star of the Drama.
According to our sources, Johns was “disgusted” when a television lover at the busy meeting held on Tuesday at his business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that it would not have enough time to hold new contracts up to 1.5 million dollars on their common brand of true home clothes and accessories.
Their brand was compared to the child actress Gwinet Peltrou Goop, and it was expected that her sales would double increase Willowby's value of 11 million pounds of sterlings.
The 37-year-old leader announced his way to the Instagram, and John himself left Britain on a private plane in the direction of one of his wheels.
As one source reports, “the mark Truly was the main priority of Holly.
It was a long-term investment that would ensure her safe existence for the next few decades.
Its decision led to the rank of all parties to the transaction.
They were all shocked by what happened on Tuesday, as the weeks were counted before the start of the mark.
The entire warehouse, filled with goods ready for sale, remained at the headquarters in Marlou.’
Experts believe that one of the most popular stars of the United Kingdom's "Etim morning" will be a company in millions of sterling pounds due to significant inputs in goods: from shower and candles to clothing, as well as the potential delay in the start of the line.
It is also about breaking up old friendships.
Three of Willowby's children and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been dating Johns and his wife, Tarrow Capep, for 10 years now.
Willowby created Truly's brand with Taro Kapp in 2016, and Tari's husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, headed the company in March.
Both couples often take leave together, and in addition, Johnsse owns 40 per cent of the shares of Dana Baldwina.
Willowby will become M&S agent and replace Anthony Macpartlin as the lead translator of the ITV “I – Notch”.
The source from nearby Jones said yesterday: “We cannot comment on his business activities.”
"And then we fell in love with each other"
He questioned the criticism of the media because of the “indebted president” comment and the positive assessment of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Tramp refuse such claims?
He said, "Tramp," with the voice of the leading news.
"I didn't give up on anything."
He noted that Kim Chen Yin was interested in the reconvened meeting, after Transcript called their first summit held in Singapore in June, a significant step towards reducing the stocks of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have been in vain.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, the high-ranked North Korean diplomat Lee Yoon Ho made a statement to the world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea still expects “responsible responses” from the United States following the initial measures of the CDR on disarmament.
Instead, the United States noted that the diplomat continued to use sanctions as a source of pressure.
During the meeting of its sponsors, President Tramp made a much more optimistic assessment.
“The North Korean case is remarkable,” he said.
“We were on the border with North Korea.
Millions of people could have died.
And now we have excellent relationships."
According to Trampa, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Chen Yin brought fruit: the end of the missile tests, the prisoners were released, and the remaining members of the CDR were also returned to their families.
Referring to his relationship with Kim Chen Yen, Trump stressed that his unusual approach to diplomacy was nothing strange.
“Bring yourself like the president so simple, but then instead of 10,000 people on the street who are in this completely murdered room, there would be 200 people here,” Trap said, pointing at the crowd before him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia: catastrophic destructions are estimated by hundreds of victims
On the first day after the earthquake that struck Lombok, the foreign NGOs said they did not need assistance.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lomboka were left over, the Government did not consider it necessary to declare a national disaster, which was mandatory for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they clearly understood that there was no need for international support, so it was not easy,” explains Selina Sambung.
The Save Children Organization is preparing a mission to go to Pala, but we still do not know if a foreign group can work on site.
According to Mr. Sutopo, the official representative of the National Administration for the Elimination of Natural Disasters, Indonesia is conducting an assessment of the situation in Pala in order to determine the relevance of the involvement of international organizations.
In view of the continuing sensitivities in Indonesia, the country is still in terrible condition prepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunamis were being built in Achehe, they are rarely found on other coastal lines.
Despite the threat of tsunamis, there was no siren in Pala to warn the people that, most likely, it had led to so many casualties.
Transport between many Indonesian islands is difficult enough even in good weather.
Natural disasters are increasingly difficult for logistics.
The first hospital in Lombok to assist the victims of earthquakes is located in Pala, but the road to a new disaster will take at least three days.
President Joko Vidodo has strengthened the strong infrastructure of Indonesia, the main point of his pre-election campaign, and has spent considerable resources on improving roads and railways.
However, the administration of President Joko, which is flying for a new period of time next year, has been in trouble with funding.
The President also criticises the expansion of the interconfession between the conservative Muslim majority of Indonesia and the rest of the population.
More than a thousand people were killed, and tens of thousands were killed as a result of ties between Christians and Muslims, armed mobs, guns, and other suicides.

A memorial of Cromwell before Parliament's building gave rise to a serious discussion on the "Repeating History"
Cromwell would be rewarded with the destruction of many cultural and religious artifacts in England by his followers, Puritan fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Memory Society called Mr. Krika’s proposal “missing” and “trying to re-write history”.
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Memorial Society, said: “In the ongoing debate on the meaning of historic monuments, the issue of the status of Oliver Cromwell before the Westminster Court is inevitable.
Cromwell has nothing to do with the economic movement during the English civil war.
Oliver Cromwell is probably suffering from the sins of his predecessor, Thomas, who lived centuries ago.
The great statue of Cromwell of Sir William Hamo Tornikrovt reflects the views of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historical achievements of a man whom many of them considered to be worthy of respect.
In the interview The Sunday Telegraph John Goldsmith said: “Many people, especially at the end of the 19th century, considered Cromwell the guardian of the parliament from outside pressure, in his case the monarchy.
If such an opinion can be considered historically accurate, it remains the subject of expert debate.
But it can be said with conviction that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century had affected the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was a significant historical figure representing one side of this section.
Its achievements as the Lord's Protector also deserve high appreciation and respect.”
The Chinese farmer's death was brought to an end by a pig killer.
In one of the markets in South-West China, farmers have become victims of swine, reports local media.
The victim's body (in the media is mentioned only by his name, “Yuan”) from a detached artery was discovered with a piece of bread on the market in the province of Luupanšu Province, in southern China.
The pig is ready to be herded into pigs on pigs' farm, 30 May 2005, in the Chinese province of China.
Yuan and his twin brother came from the nearby province of June in the middle and brought 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, the twin brother discovered Juan’s soulless body, and the door was opened to the neighboring priest.
There was a huge game with blood on the rail.
During the trial trial, it was found that the pig had a weight of 250 pounds [250 kg].
“ My brother’s feet were covered and torn, ” said the newspaper Guiyang Evening News Wu, the victim’s relative.
The video from the surveillance camera showed that John came to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about the time of the fall.
The pig killer didn't belong to the brothers.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pigs were isolated in a separate prison during the investigation in order to avoid repeated attacks.
It is reported that the Yuan family is negotiating with the market administration on compensation for the death of the farmer.
The cases of swine attacks on people are rare.
In 2016, pigs attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, U.S.A., a severely traumatized man.
Ten years ago, a 300 kilograms [300 kilograms] of animal came to the tractor and left only fearing a successful woman.
In 2012, a case was recorded when a farmer from Oregon, U.S., was accompanied by his own pigs. According to CBC News, one Canadian farmer, pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act on their secret aggression as a “lowing mechanism”.
"The pigs are playing,
They're cute, they're very nice, but they don't want to try you.
You should just bring your feelings to your attention and to your attention," he explained.
Uragan Rosa brings lead to a large part of the South-West United States
It is estimated that hurricane Rosa is losing power by moving through a colder zone to the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days, it will bring levies and floods into the territory of northern Mexico and the South-West of the United States.
As of Saturday, 5 o'clock in New York City, the cycle reached the 1st category of winds up to 135 km/h, which is 360 km south-west of the city of Punta Euhania, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to move north in the resurrection.
At the same time, the Pacific begins to form a low-pressure zone, which will move east to the west coast of the United States, near the coast of Lower California, the storm brings tropical moisture to the north of Mexico, to the south-west of the United States.
More than 25 cents are expected on Monday in Mexico.
Under the influence of tropical moisture falling in the emerging low pressure zone, heavy rains are expected in the coming days in the South West.
The range from 2.5 to 10 cm leads to dangerous evaporation, gravitational flows and possible use in the desert.
In some areas, especially in the southern states of Nevada and Arizona, the rate of drop in crops may be 5 to 8 cm per hour due to high tropical humidity.
In some areas of the South-West United States, most of the territory of Arizona is expected to be between 5 and 10 cents per cent.
There is no risk of sudden fast-sustaining floods due to the uneven distribution of tropical rain.
If there is a risk of a tropical lion's footing in the desert, there are serious consequences.
Lions can turn cannons into dry rivers, and the grass can cause the air to dry up and rise the dust.
With the rise of low-pressure zones on the southern coast of California, the Lebanon is rocked.
It may be up to 1.5 cm in size, which may cause small gravitational flows and create narrow surfaces on the roads.
These are the first cuts from the beginning of the spring season in the region.
On Sunday evenings and Monday mornings in Arizona, tropical rains will take place in other territories until Monday evening and Tuesday morning.
On Tuesday, Lebanon will go to the district of Four angles and extend to the evening.
In October, the United States will be monitoring the rare temperatures due to low air temperature in Arctic, at sufficiently high temperatures in tropical areas.
Such a combination sometimes leads to a strong change in temperature in a small territory.
Such severe temperatures will be particularly noticeable in the central part of the United States in the resurrection.
There is a difference between the temperature in Kansas City (Missuri) and Omahe (Nebresca), as well as between St. Louis and De-Mayans (Iyova).
Over the next few days, the summer season will be rocked and extended to other territories.
In most central and eastern parts of the United States, temperatures are expected early in October, and the temperature will reach 27 degrees south of the North-East country.
In New York on Tuesday, air temperature can rise to 27 degrees, which is 10 degrees higher than average.
Our long-term forecast of the weather is very likely to be very high on the east coast of the United States until mid-October.
Senate hearings on the case of Judge Bretta Cavano have seen more than 20 million observers
The testimony of Bretta Cavano and Christina Blazi Ford, who accused Cavano of attempted rape in the 1980s, attracted more than 20 million viewers of six televisions on Thursday.
The political opposition in the area of the Kawano candidate ' s approval received an unexpected continuation. On Friday in the media, an urgent communication was made by the Republican Jeff Fleek on the condition that the prosecutor's charges were investigated within one week by the FBI.
As stated by the Forum at the hearings before the Senate Legal Committee, she was convinced by “100 per cent” that Kavano was attacked in an ordeal and tried to break her up at school.
Cavano gave emotional evidence saying that 100 per cent was convinced that it was not.
According to the Nielsen Research Agency, the five-year debates were viewed by more than 20.4 million observers.
The Agency took into account the average statistical data from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
Data on the number of other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, are still available.
In addition, Nielsen's rating does not always take into account viewers who watch TV at work.
For comparisons, it's about the middle auditor following the American football match in the playoff or the Oskar award ceremony.
The largest audience was Fox News Channel, whose leading firemen supported the appointment of Cavano: Senate hearings throughout the day saw an average of 5.69 million viewers reported by the Nielsen Agency.
Second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS audit was 3.1 million, NBC - 2.94 million, MSNBC was viewed by 2.89 million viewers, while CNN had 2.52 million reviews, reports Nielsen.
After listening to the case, there is no weakness.
On Friday, this drama was played by Jeff Fleck.
After reporting his intention to support the candidate of CNN and CBS, the senator from Arizona, who was considered a moderated Republican, was able to print on the camera on Friday morning, as he met with a group of activists who had been critical of the senator.
The whole world saw, as he had blinded his eyes, getting fired from the women who had been wounded in a direct ephere on CNN.
"I am standing before you," said one of them.
"Do you think he speaks the truth?"
“You have the strength, while so many women are useless,” they tried to explain their position.
Flyk replied to the activists that his office had already made a statement and he was talking about it at the Committee meeting, and the elevator doors were closed, hiding the senator from the passenger cameras.
When a few hours later, the Legal Committee was prepared to approve Cavano's application for a post of judges and to send it to the Senate for a general vote, all the channels were transpired into a direct ephere.
However, Fleck provided one condition — the FBB's investigation of these allegations against the candidate for the next week, as the democratic minority had achieved.
Flyk claims that he changed his opinion through the involvement of another Senator of the Democrats Chris Kuns.
He made a final decision by talking to Kuns and several other senators.
The decision of the Flake had taken effect, as it was evident that the Republicans were not able to vote in favour of Cavano without an investigation.
By order of President Trampa FBR, the investigation was made at the address of Cavano.
British Prime Minister Teresa May blames her criticisms in the "political games" around the situation with Brexito
In an interview on Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa May accused politicians who criticized her plans to leave the European Union, putting their interests at stake above the interests of society.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain is attending a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published in one field with May, former head of MID Boris Johnson criticised her so-called Shachaki plan in the context of Bressite, saying that it considered the customs mail between Britain and the EU to be “absolutely ill”.

The East Coast Coronor of Baton-Russia published a preliminary conclusion on Friday: death was caused by a corrugated fire wound of the hair and head.
The Division appreciates the criminal investigation of the police department of the state of Louisiana, the state police labs, the South University police and the local residents who have assisted in carrying out operational and research activities that have resulted in detention.
Joe Alleva, Director of Sports at the University of Louisiana, thanked the authority of the law for their "good work for the sake of the offender".
Simsu was 20 years old.
The two-metre forum was the teacher of Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played at the University of Louisiana.
In the last season, Sims collected 5.6 glasses and made 2.6 selections in the middle of the match.
The trainer of the Will White team made a statement on Friday morning, saying that the tragic death of Wade Sims was called “sock” and “the current top” in all games.
"That's what I've always been afraid of," added the coach.
Volcano surrounded by a Mexican palm tree
Volcano Popocappetel buried the ashes of the southern coast of Mexico City.
On Saturday, the National Centre for the Prevention of Natural Disasters, Mexico, advised the population not to approach the volcano: the activity was registered in its courtyard and 183 parasol emissions were reported.
According to the Center, near the volcano, sin was often spread and drug abuse was felt.
In some areas of Mexico, such as Sochimilko, social networking users have posted photographs of truck lobes covered by thin dolls.
After the quake of 7.1 Mw, which hit the central part of Mexico in September 2017, geophysics had the presence of volcanic activity at 72 km south-east of the capital.
Volcano Popocatetel (or, for its sake, Don Goio) is an active volcano since 1994.
Police with Catalan separatists in front of the first anniversary of the referendum on independence
On Saturday in Barcelona, the first anniversary of the referendum on the departure of Spain from two camps was held by a multi-twenty-thirty meeting; six participants were detained.
Police officers have detached the protestors, while the last ones dressed in black masks have been subjected to the threat of ejaculation and the firefly, raising the cloud of darkness in the heart of Barcelona.
After the police left the tunnels to stop the storm, the riots returned with renewed force.
For a number of hours, the supporters of independence have scheduled: “We do not forget, nor do we forgive.” And their opponents have said to them, “Peace be to Spain.”
According to local press reports, fourteen participants died in a hospital with mild injuries.
On 1 October last year, a referendum was held on the origin of Spain, which was recognized by the illegal Spanish Government, but was important to the separatists.
Catalonia, with a large movement, voted for departure from Spain, but it was a low point because the opposition to the exits were greatly opposed to the referendum.
According to the Catalan official sources, nearly 1,000 people were injured during the past year when police tried to block a referendum in the electoral areas of the country.
On Friday, the separatists were engaged in an alleged demonstration in support of the Spanish police in order to interfere with its conduct.
The demonstration was all the same, but it went the other way.
The 68-year-old electrician Narciss Termes, visiting separatists in his wife's company, recalls that the hope of acquiring the Catalan sovereignty has become ever deeper.
“One of the most important events in our lives has happened last year.
My parents cried out with joy, had the opportunity to vote in the referendum, and we are in a position today," he said.
In the recent December elections in the local authorities of the Spanish office of the Catholic Party, a significant victory was achieved, even with a small blow, but this year their movement was lost because many prominent leaders were either in refugee camps or under guard, awaiting the court's role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Puch, 42-year-old mechanic, writing on the phone mitting in support of the police, said that the conflict was underpinned by both sides of the political spectrum.
“The speed is up,” he added.
On Saturday, Mr. Oriol Junckeras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalan separatists, at the end of the last year in the pre-trial detention chamber, declared his intention to vote in the European Parliament next year.
“Participation in the European Parliament as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Spanish Government,” he said.
London: The car broke into the house, all three of the participants were arrested
One of the houses in London was several times hit by a car; men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested.
The visit took place on Thursday about 19:30 p.m., on local time in the Ballinagard Crecent area.
As a result of the fire, the doors were damaged and the building itself was reported by the police inspector Bob Bloomings.
There's a report that the car could have been pulled out of the hole.
The victory of Livingstone over the Rangers thanks to Mangy's bullet
The first valley of Dolly Mangy brought the promised victory of the Livingstone team
Thanks to the murder of the sword Livingstone, he won an unexpected victory over the Rangers. For the principal trainer of the Scottish club, Steven Gerard, this is the only second defeat for 18 games.
The exact hit of Dolly Mangy was compared to command by Gary Holt with the Hibernian Club in the initial table where they do the second place.
The group of leaders, Harts, of which the Rangers remain eight, will be held on Sunday in the Premier League.
The fourth Rangers will be held in their field of the League of Europe with the Austrian Rapid Club (Vienna).
The Livingstone Club has continued its inexhaustible series in the division, has been playing six moms, and has not received any injuries since Holt changed Kenny Miller to the head of the team trainer.
Missed moments for Livingstone in the reception of the guests
Colporteurs were supposed to have been carrying the account from the beginning, and the “reingers ” were obviously not working against their efforts.
Scott Robinson managed to break through the line of protection, but the hole didn't get out of his weak attempt.
The host party allowed the Rangers to play in front of their guard line, counting at dangerous moments when the game was resumed.
That's what they did and missed this important goal.
The Rangers had launched a free strike, and Livingstone had the opportunity: Declan Gallager and Robinson had handed over Menge, who had been killed from the central position.
At that point, the Rangers were superior to the sword, but the protection of the receiving team was unwarranted, so the returnor Liam Kelly was not concerned.
The second team continued on the same scheme, although Kelly had yet to escape the attack by Alfredo Morelos.
King King of Rangers, Alain McGregor removed his sword from Scott Pittman, and Litgou made a broad reference to the standard.
The sword has always fallen into the script “Livingstone”, but all the attacks have been reflected, and the two requirements of the panels, one for the promotion of the game of Glenna Middleton Halkett and the other for the game, were not satisfied.
"Finomial" game "Livingstone" — Analysis
From BBC Scotland — Alasder Lamont, report to the "Toni Makarios Arena" stadium
Fenominal game and great result for the Livingstone team.
All the games were absolutely great, and all the expectations continued to arise on the Olympics on a regular basis.
Their style of game and composition has not changed in practice since their origin to the top levels of rating, and the great merit of Holt's coach has been that he has, from the very beginning, mobilized this team.
There were no heroes on his team.
Captain Halket was leading a highly organized protection, and Menga did not allow Connor Goldson and Joe Urall to weaken.
At that time, the Rangers could never enter the rhythm.
Although they had good games with trainer Gerard, this time they did not justify our expectations.
In the last few minutes, their match did not catch up with the sword, but they only managed to protect the receiving team once. The Rangers, who were dropped in the middle of the table, had something to think about.
The cold welcome of Erdogan during the visit to Kelne
On Saturday, 29 September, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in the morning, there was a wonderful time, and both of them were in excellent shape.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany to establish relations between the two NATO States parties — the visit without any conflict.
The heads of countries were unable to understand such issues as human rights, freedom to print and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Afterward, Erdogan was sent to Callen to participate in a ceremony to open a huge new dream.
There is the largest Turkish diaspora outside Turkey in Kelne.
In terms of security, the police did not allow the 25,000 troops to enter the camp, but many of the party members of Erdogan were on their way to see their president.
At the same time, opposers of the Erdogan regime, including lies, were gathered to condemn him in full voice both his policies and the decision of the German Government to invite him to visit Germany.
The presence of radically contradictory points of view at the meeting reflects the magnitude of this figure: many Germans with Turkish roots carry Erdogan, while others consider him a tyrant.
Road accidents in Deptford: A car crash led to the death of a driver
In London, a car was contacted by a bus driver who ended up at the scene.
The accident took place shortly after Bebitid Street and Evelyn Street, a resurfaced in the southeastern part of the town of Depfort, about 10:15 at the local time.
The driver of the car and those who came to the hospital tried to help the driver, but the man did not come to his senses.
This is not the only accident with the death toll in this area: it was about a mile from the scene, on the streets of Chailders Street, and another passenger was hit by a car that had crashed.
The London police report that work is currently under way to identify the missing person and inform his immediate relatives.
As long as the road is open and the bus route is changed, car drivers are asked not to travel in this area.
Insects in Long-Lartin Prison: Six police officers wounded
According to Long-Laartin administration, six police officers were injured during the incident in a man prison with a severe regime.
In the Man's Prison of Long Laartin (Wustershire) there have been a number of incidents involving about 09:30 in local time.
To address the irregularities involving eight prisoners from one wing, a “Tornado” group was called.
The police received minor injuries to soft tissue; medical assistance was provided on site.
According to the official representative of the prison, “specially trained staff were recruited to permit the incident at the Long Laartin Correctional Authority.
Six of them were injured.
We are categorically opposed to the use of physical force in our institution, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be transferred to the police and their measures of detention may be changed for a longer time.”
There are currently more than 500 prisoners in Long Laartin, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June the media reported that a prison manager had fallen into a hospital and had been attacked by one of the prisoners.
And in October last year, prison leadership was forced to attract special appointments in order to calm down broken prisoners who threw billions of shells into the supervisors.
Uragan Rosa can warm Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which will benefit dry areas)
Arizona rarely falls into the area of the intense tropical cycle, but this time it has been “stirred”: at the beginning of the following week, the uragan Rose, making the last fish, must go over the desert part of the South West and take risks of the lion’s pelvis.
The National Meteorological Service has already warned of the threat of river floods on Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona and in the southern and eastern parts of Nevada, in southern California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Uragan Rosa will go straight over Phoenix on Tuesday and fall on Monday evening.
The National Meteorological Service Office in Fenix reported on Twitter that “ten tropical cycles have maintained the status of tropical fever or depression, located at 320 km from Fenix, since 1950.
Uragan Katrina (born 1967) passed 65 km from the Arizona border."
According to the latest estimates of the National Meteorological Service, there are from 5 to 10 cm of seats, up to 15 cm on the Mogolon-Rome River.
In other desert regions of the South-West, such as the Central Scalistic Mountains and the Great Basin, there may be up to 2.5 to 5 centimetres, where the settlements may reach 10 centimetres.
For areas where the left-wing streams will be eaten by the side, the rain caused by the Rosan hurricane can be a blessing, as the region has long suffered from drought.
Although left-wings may pose a danger, the heavy rains can ease the dry season in the South-West United States.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 per cent of Arizona's territory is considered to be at least a strong drought (the second by weight)”, reports the website weather.com.
In the beginning, Urgan Rose is involved in the Mexican state of Lower California.
As a wake-up morning, hurricanes, whose maximum speed is 137 km/h, are 360 km south of the city of Punta Euhania (Mexico) and move north at a speed of 19 km/h.
Uragan has been in the area with colder water on the Pacific Coast and thus loses its strength.
In the second half of the day, hurricanes reach Mexico in the "tropic storm".
It is expected that in certain regions of Mexico there will be a wave of floods with a threat of flooding.
“In the territory of Lower California to the north-west of Sonori, it may take up to 7 to 10 cm and up to 25 cm,” reports the website weather.com.
URAGAN ROSA will be sent north through Mexico, and early Tuesday morning he will come to the border with Arizona in the tropical cycle, from Arizona to the southern part of Utah to the evening.
“The main potential risk associated with the Rosa hurricane and its remnants associated with the strong lions in Lower California, the northwestern part of the Sunsor and the desert regions of the United States,” the National Meteorological Service reports.
It is expected that droughts will cause dangerous snowfalls, grueling streams in the desert and possible use in the mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsummer Norton: Four suspects were detained in an attempt to kill
In Somerset, 16-year-olds suffered severe knife injuries, and three adolescents and 20-year-olds were suspected of attempted murder.
A victim of severe injuries was found in the Exelsier Terras city of Midsomer Norton, about 4 hours a.m. on Saturday.
After hospitalization, his condition is deemed to be “stabilized”.
On the same night, four suspects 17, 18 and 20 years old were arrested in the Radstok area, reported to the Evon and Somerset District Police.
The police will search for potential witnesses of crimes with any videotape on the mobile phone.
Donald Tramp: "All hatred, all evil" of Democrats has been committed in Cavano
“The vote for Judge Kavano is a vote against the cruel and rebuttal tactics used by democracy,” Tramp said at a meeting of his colleagues in Wiling, West Virginia.
In Trampa's view, in the process of approving the appointment of Cavano to the candidate, “all hatred, all evil” was violated by the Democratic Party.
In the United States Congress on Thursday, Cavano gave a statement that, in his emotional treatment, he categorically rejected Christine Blazi Ford’s accusation that he had been sexually abused more than 30 years ago when they were both teenagers.
Dr. Ford also provided evidence in the hearing of her accusation.
On Saturday, the president of the United States said that on that day, “the American people saw a glowing mind, class and masculinity” in Cavano.
“The vote for the approval of Judge Kawano is the vote for the approval of one of the most procuring lawyers of our time, with an unencumbered list of public service”, the president of the group of his colleagues in West Virginia announced.
In his speech, the President had repeatedly raised the question of the appointment of Cavano, referring to the importance of the electoral role of the Republicans in the Congress and the House of Representatives.
“For the most important elections in our life, there are five weeks remaining.
I do not participate in them, but I participate in the race in a different sense.”
"I'm wearing like a gorilla and I'm fighting for our great candidates."
The tramp believes that democracy has set itself the task of “all forces to give us opposition”.
According to the regulation, the first key vote in the Senate on the approval of the candidate of Cavano must be held no later than Friday, the Assistant to the High Representative of the Republican Party was informed.
The earthquake in Indonesia has taken hundreds of lives, and the total number of victims continues to grow
On Saturday, the Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people had been killed, many were caught by giant waves covering the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulavesi, where the incredible power of tsunamis and earthquakes had come to an end.
The first victims became hundreds of guests of the beach festival in the city of Pala, and on Friday at the beach, they reached a height of almost six metres, which swept everything on their way and led many of the guests to a humiliating death.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When a storm warning was announced yesterday, people continued to rest, instead of running quickly to the shelter, and therefore lost their lives,” Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, official representative of the Indonesian National Administration for the Elimination of Natural Disasters at the Jakarta press conference, reported.
“The dogs did not come together, and in the stream of water there were cars, roads, houses, and everything was destroyed on its way,” Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunamis crossed the ocean at a speed of 497 km/h and all the effort was destroyed on the coast.
Some of those present went to the trees, which saved their lives.
Some 16,700 local residents were evacuated to 24 refugee camps in Palu.
At the airport, the disaster management has seen destroyed houses, warehouses, damaged bridges, and destroyed houses.
On Saturday, the coastal city still has underground interpretations.
A series of earthquakes took place in the territory of 2.4 million people.
The Agency ' s statement on the assessment and use of the technology of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) indicates that the earthquake caused the emissions of energy occurred about 200 times more than when an atomic bomb destroyed Hiroshima.
The tsunamis may have been much stronger than expected because of the geographical situation of the city at the end of the long dry river.
Nogorho called the damage “large”, adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hospitals have been destroyed.
Under the ruins of damaged buildings were found dead bodies, 540 people were injured, and 29 others were missing.
Nogorho added that victims and destructions could be even more significant along the coast 300 km from Pala, in the village of Dungal, near the earthquake.
The communication from Dungala was “completely destroyed, there was no information received”.
“More than 300 thousand people live in the Dungala area”, reports the International Committee of the Red Cross in its communiqué, whose staff and volunteers are already in the disaster zone.
“Trade has occurred, but it has not yet been done,” the report says.
On Saturday, the Office was critical because it did not report the arrival of the tsunamis in Pala. The authorities, however, believe that the waves reached the shore when the initial warning was still in force.
Social networks have shown a favorite video where a man on the upper floor of the building shouts about overcrowding tsunamis, desperately trying to attract people to the street.
Within a few minutes, the wall of water is broken down, and all houses and cars are destroyed.
The Reuters Agency has not yet been able to confirm the authorship of this role.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have led to a huge supply of electricity, which has left the connection in Paula, which has made it very difficult for rescue operations to be carried out.
In Jakarta and other cities, military vehicles were sent with humanitarian assistance, but the evacuated population still did not get the food and supplies needed first, governmental sources reported.
The city airport has been opened only for humanitarian assistance; it will be closed for other flights until October.
President Joko Vidodo will visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Wednesday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeds 800.
The situation is very bad.
Volunteers of the World Vision charitable organization came from Dungala to Pala, where officials found shelter in the fireplaces that were destroyed in their office building. According to Doseb Sinai, on their way, they had a terrible picture of total destruction.
“They saw a great many destroyed homes,” he says.
The situation is very bad.
Blessed organizations have begun to implement humanitarian assistance mechanisms, but many regret that international NGOs have failed to succeed in the fall of Paul.
Indonesia ' s legislation allows funding, humanitarian assistance and staff of foreign organizations to be drawn up only after the announcement of a place where the disaster hit the national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It is believed that this is a local disaster,” reports Auliya Ariani, Secretary-General of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the Government announces a natural disaster to the national, we can accept foreign aid, but until the status remains unchanged.”
On the second day after the natural disaster, Paul, his friends and relatives, who were missing, still look forward to their wonderful salvation, which will bring the people of faith into the best possible condition.
On Saturday there was a small boy who fell into a canal hole.
On the resurrection day, the rescuers came out of the windows of the building to a woman who had spent two days there, along with her mother’s lifeless body.
Hendon Subandano, the National Assembly of Indonesia on parapolarism, prepared two of the missing pilots to a recent Asian game in Indonesia.
Among the other people who fell into a trap in the Roa Roa Hotel were his disciples, including Mandhei.
“I am not the last person in this sport, and it is emotionally difficult to survive,” he said.
He recalls how, after learning of the violation of Roa Roa's house by other parapolitors, he had been desperately trying to contact his colleagues at the beach festival for the next few hours.
However, his messages were made with a single seal, not with two holes.
“This means that no reports have been delivered”, he considers.
Degree of $26,750 while serving the bank in Newport-on-Lviv
On Friday morning, the criminals murdered $26,750 in the Incassator Brink's, one of the bankmates in Newport-on-Lviv, speaking in the press release of the Newport Police.
According to Detective Dennis McCarty, the manager of the bronzed microwave bus picked up the presence of a bank located in the entertainment complex and was about to run it with new bank notes.
At that time, “as Brink's staff from behind, the rapist ran away” and stole a bag with bank notes for the bank.
According to the witnesses of the incident, several suspects fled from the crime scene, but the police did not indicate the number of potential participants.
Citizens who have any information on these persons are requested to contact the airport police office, number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changed his name to Him
Repper Kane West has come up with a new name: Yes.
He announced this on Saturday in Twitter: “A personality previously known as Kanye West”.
The 41-year-old West has been wearing it as a pseudonym for a long time and has even put it in the name of his eighth album, which went up in June.
News of this occurred prior to Kane's appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he plans to present his new Yandhi album.
Kane West, in favour of Ariana, who withdrew from his participation because of “emotional experiences”, reported the author of the transfer.
Wast earlier stated that the dog was not only a minor version of his name but also a religious thought.
“He is the most frequently met word in the Bible, it means “you”, so West explained the name of his album in one of the recent interviews with the radiologist Big Boy.
"It's me, it's you, it's us.
The beginning was Kane, which means “one, ” and now I am the only One, it is the reflection of all the good, bad, uncarried things in us, all the time.
And the album is an attempt to make you think who we are."
Cain was not the first known rapper to change his name.
Shawn Combs, formerly known as Paf Daddy, Pius Diddi, or just Diddy, this year asked him to call himself Lav (“love”) or Brass Lov (“Brother Love” or “Brother Love”).
The West Repper J-Zi also changed his name several times: with a defies and without, inscribed letters or letters.
The President of Mexico solemnly promises not to use military forces against the civilian population
President Andres Manuel Lopes Obrador of Mexico has never tried to win the war against the civilian population before the 50th anniversary of the student demonstration, which ended with a bloodthirsty massacre.
Speaking on Saturday at the Tlatelolko Square, President Lopes Obrador promised "never come to help the Mexican people with the military."
On 2 October 1968, during the peaceful demonstration, the first bomb blasts broke out and 300 people were killed, which was the basis for the strengthening of the left student movement in Latin America.
Lopes Obrador also promised to support the Mexican youth in the form of a monthly scholarship for training and opening up a large number of free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and the lack of prospects for education bring young people into the criminal world.
Funding of II development needs to be doubled
China and its efforts in the field of artistic intelligence should not be underestimated, and the United States should double its investment in scientific development, according to Li Caifu, an investor and an entrepreneur in the development of II with the experience of work in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
A number of US ministries have made previous statements on II work, although in general the United States does not have a clear II development strategy.
At the same time, China presented its own plan last year: its goal was to be the first in IE innovations by 2030.
“The increase in the budget for IIA research twice would be a good start, given that all other countries are far away from the United States, and we expect the next break in the II area,” says Li.
The increase in funding can double the chances that the next major achievement of II will be made in the United States, Li CNBC said in an interview this week.
Li, whose book "Superstitions of Art: China, the Kremnia Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Director-General of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most outstanding IO companies in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s, he worked at the University of Carnegie Mellon on a system of art intellectuals, which took over the highest in the American Otello, and then was the leader of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
He mentioned previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Robotics Challenge Defence Advanced Research Projects, and wondered when the next competition would be to help people find a non-traditional idea.
According to Li, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants.
“China is looking for academic leaders, but corporations,” Li said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have been looking for the lights from universities for work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
It is believed that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to develop artificial intelligence.
“I think that Green Card candidates should be offered automatically in the field of artistic intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published the next generation's artificial intelligence development plan.
The Chinese National Fund for Natural Science grants scientific funding in the same way as the National Science Fund and other government organizations lend money to American researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China below is confirmed by Li.
Earlier this year, the United States Ministry of Defence established the United States Centre for Cultural Intelligence, where partners from industry and scientific circles should participate, and the White House announced the establishment of the Special Committee on Cultural Intelligence.
This month DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in an AI Next programme.
With regard to NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in II research.
In the meantime, the legislation of the United States which sought to establish the National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not taken any action in this regard for a few months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on whether the country's name should be changed
On Wednesday, the people of Macedonia voted in favour of a referendum on whether their country's name should be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would allow for a multi-year dispute with Greece, which blocked its application for entry into the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and has imposed a ban on its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June both Governments concluded an agreement based on a new name proposal, but the opposition-nationalists claimed that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the people of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov stated that he would not vote on the referendum, and the fighter campaign had raised doubts as to whether the voter ' s ability to meet the 50 per cent minimum required for the referendum.
The question raised at the referendum was raised as follows: “Do you maintain NATO and the EU membership under the terms of the Treaty with Greece?”
Parties to the change of names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that Macedonia, one of the countries that appeared after the collapse of Yugoslavia, should pay this price for entry into organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I am here today to vote for a future country, for Macedonia’s youth, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this means a more secure life for all of us,” explains 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska, dwelling in Skopje.
A sufficient number of Members of Parliament stated that they would observe the results of the vote in order to make it decisive, although it did not have a legally binding force.
The change in the title will require a majority of two thirds of Parliament members.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no reports of violations had been made at 13:00.
However, the figure was 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” says 62-year-old Jose Tanevski, president of Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica and his son, Dusko, voted in favour of a referendum in Macedonia on the change in the name of the country, which will open the way for its entry into NATO and the European Union in Strumice, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
Before the building of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, in 54, prepared a small stage, setting up a table before the parliaments set up by those citizens who are going to fight against the referendum.
“We are members of NATO and the EU, but we want to join the top head, not with the heads of civil service,” Kavadarkov says.
"Yes, we are the citizens of the poor country, but we also have a sense of self-esteem.
If they do not want to adopt us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would invest in Macedonia, which is so necessary in that country, where unemployment is more than 20 per cent.
“I believe that the overwhelming majority will be due to the fact that more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO”, Zaev said after the vote.
He believes that a positive response will be “a reward for our well-being”.
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies indicated that from 30 to 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, but that was the below requirement.
A second survey conducted by the Macedonian Telecom-TV channel revealed that 57 per cent of respondents were scheduled to vote on Wednesday.
70 per cent of this figure claims to be positive.
For the referendum to take place, the vote must be 50 per cent more than one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first major political blow to the Western Government since it came to power in May last year.
Consider: Serhio Aguero from Manchester City is trying to protect Briton to kill the goal
Serhio Aguero and Rahim Sterling fought with the protection of Briton, bringing Manchester City to victory with account 2:0 on Saturday at the Ethical Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero killed the cave at 65 minutes, it was said that he had no work to do.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine attacker got a dog in the center of the field.
He walked between the three Britons before entering the open space.
Aguero was surrounded by four opponents in the green football field.
He beat one guard and beat up a few more at the end of the Bryton strike zone.
He then handed the sword to Sterling on the left.
The English attacker, in the strike zone, returned the sword of Aguero, whose right was hit by the sword of Briton, Matthew Ryan in the right corner of the gate.
"Aguero is experiencing some foot problems," said the coach Manchester City, Pep Gvardioola.
“We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were told that he killed the cave at that time."
But Sterling gave the "heavenly Deep" initial advantage in combating Premier League.
That ball was killed in 29 minutes.
In this game, Aguero got a sword, being deep in Briton territory.
He gave a great deal of transfer on the left wing of Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few cases before sending Sterling to the next station.
The attacking “heavens-Golds” killed a sword in the door right before choosing beyond the borders of the field.
Manchester City met Hoffenheim in the League of Championships on Tuesday 12:55 at Rein-Neckar-Arene, Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer is going to pick up the glasses at Colorado Rokis.
There was no special reason to force events after Washington Nésionals was elected from the playoff battle.
But the independent Sherzer hopes to take up the fight against Colorado Rokis on Wednesday, but only if the Rokis, which are based on one Los Angeles Dogers game in the Western Division, starts playing off.
Winning 5-2 over Nesionals on Friday evening, Rokizi has already won 7 or 8 seats, but they still hope to secure their title in the first division.
“And although we play just like this, at least we can maintain positions, knowing the great importance of the atmosphere in Denmark in the presence of viewers and another team, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss that?"
Nesionals has not yet declared the drinker on the resurrection, but, in the latter case, he is willing to present the Sherzer to this role.
Sherzer, who's going to play 34th, threw his sword into the dining room on Thursday, and on the evening, he's going to be a drinker.
The statistics of Washington’s Pitcher Justice – 18-7 with rating ERA 2,53 and 300 cars in 220 2/3 innings in the current season.
The tramp runs in West Virginia
Commenting on the importance of the electoral role of the Republicans in the interim elections, the President referred to the situation around Bretta Cavano, the candidate of the President of the Supreme Court.
“All we did was put on the map in November.
Five weeks remained before one of the most important elections in our lives.
That's very, very important, and I'm not running, although I'm really running, I'm fighting for the good candidates everywhere."
Tramp continued: “You see this terrible radical group of democracies, you see that is happening right now.
And they are determined to return their power, using whatever means are needed, and we are observing the breadth and the depth.
They are all equal to those they try to gain power and control, but we are not going to give them away."
Democrats, he claims, have intended to “stand up and stop.”
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "the wicked, the deaf, the dumb, and the liars."
He referred to the Senate Legal Committee, referring to Senator Diane Fynstein, who called out loud calls from the hall.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you allowed this document to be removed?
Mm... mm... what document?
I've never seen the body's language before.
The Liberian party is no longer an organization with different views.
It does not show tolerance for one who expresses his opinion
When Momentum activists in my local party offered me a suggestion about the fall of mistrust, it was not unexpected.
Finally, I am the last of several Members of Parliament from the Liberian Party who have not yet said that we are not welcome for expressing our opinion.
The same is true of my colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, because she was strongly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, in my case, I've been exposed by a votomous mistrust about a disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe — on the ground of the trial — is the issue that Germany did not agree with the previous leaders.
The Nottingham Eastern Liberian Congregation was informed on Friday that “we want the congregations to be inclusive and productive”.
Most of the time since my eight-year stay on the seat of a local parliament member from the Liberian party, the GC Friday Assembly has been like that.
Unfortunately, today’s tone does not match those many meetings, but the promise of “better human and soft” policy has long been forgotten if it was ever so.
The fact that there is no difference in views in the Liberian party is becoming increasingly evident, and each opinion is assessed as to whether it is acceptable for the party's leadership.
This began soon after Jeremy became a leader; colleagues whom I had previously felt as if my own political perspective had been waiting for me to change my views and take a position that I would never agree with — whether on national security or on the single EU market.
Every time after my public statement, which is not important, I am speaking, social networks should deal with complaints that call for the abolition of elections that condemn the centre's policy or that claim that I should not be a member of the Liberian Party.
And that's not just what happens to me.
In fact, I know that I've been attracted to more than some of my colleagues, because my comments in my address still tend to be political.
I am proud of the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who daily face assaults on the sexual or racist soil, but never give up.
Most of all, in this policy, it is disappointing that such a number of abuses have been considered normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin stated that the Liberian party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the “large church” and with every wave of mistrust or change of party election rules is already happening.
For the past two years, I have received many recommendations that invite me to sit down and to talk, and then everything will be fine with me.
But I didn't come to politics for that.
Since I joined the Liberians 32 years ago, as a student of the school that had been subjected to a predispositional relationship with the Government of Tetcher, for which my school class had literally fallen apart, I have tried to stand up to the highest standards of public service for those who are most in need of it — whether the local Member State or the Government Minister.
I've never been hiding my political views, I haven't done it in the past.
No one in the Middle East could correctly interpret my political positions and areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
Those who supported this vote on Friday would like to say that our country is moving to Brexit, which will certainly lead to economic, industrial and public unrest, and I do not understand the desire of some to spend their time and strength on my loyalty to the leader of the Liberian party.
But in fact, the only audience I would like to call is not Nottingham Momentum, but my voters, whether they are lesbians or not: I am proud of what I serve you, and I promise that no threat to canceling the results of the elections or political merit does not prevent me from acting as I consider necessary in your interests.

E. 38 - 17 Melrous: The Unvicted “Er” goes first
Two late attempts may have had some final results, but Er has undoubtedly earned a triumph in this amazingly interesting meeting of Prime Minister Tennet.
Now they're leading a table, the only winning team of ten.
Finally, thanks to their superior protection, as well as the ability to choose the time needed, which gave the host team and trainer Peter Merci the full right to be sufficient.
“All this time, we have been tested to the limit, and we are still not winning, so I have no reason to lose,” commented Peter Merci.
Robin Cristy, Melrous, said, "It's about to give us the proper "Er," they've been better for us."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, carried out by Fréser Climo, led to the "E" forward, but a warm card issued for the game "Voriors" by the Scottish player Rory Hughes allowed Melrouz to move forward, and Jason Baggott was arrested for an infamous attempt.
The climate has increased the "Er" with a fine before, directly in the middle of the game, the eye has worked, and then in the break it has carried out a single attempt, making account 17-5 for "Er".
But Melrose started a second half good, and Patrick Anderson's attempt by Baggot has reduced to five times.
It was then a long break due to the serious trauma of Ruarid Knott, who had received the extension, and after the re-examination, Er continued thanks to the efforts of Stafford McDouale, who was realized by Climmo.
The current Captain "Er" Blair Mcferson then received a warm card, and once again, Melrouz persuaded the opponents to pay a regular game for an unrealistic attempt by Bruce Colvin, at the end of the summer period.
Nevertheless, the economy came back, and when Straan Hatchinson received a yellow card to capture Climate without a sword from the line of the script, McFerson made a dotdown behind the next little "Er".
Climo realized the advantage, not remaining practically from its own return, after Kayl Rou had been hit by David Armstrong and sent a highly attacking Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt on the field.
Star Still Game is going to start a new career in a restaurant business.
The Star of Still Game Ford Kiran is going to start work in the hotel industry: it was known that he was appointed director of the licensed restaurant.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the BBC popular show to which he writes, and is filmed together with former comedian partner Greg Hemfil.
Duet announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last show, and it seems that Kirnan was planning his life after Craigong.
According to official information, he is Director of the Affonymorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this information, although the source of the Scottish Sun indicated that Kirnan was planning to participate in the “increasing restaurant business” in Glasgow.
“Our Sea”: without access to the Bolivian sea, it is hoped that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
The seamen patrol the warhead in La Pase.
The public buildings are covered with mud slides.
The military-morning bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are described by the Los Angelesese: "Our sea is on the right.
It is our duty to bring him back."
Throughout Bolivia, without access to the sea, there is still a memory of the coastal line lost in Chile as a result of the bloody conflict of the 19th century because of resources; life and effort to re-enter the Pacific.
These hopes may have become the strongest hope in recent decades, as Bolivia expects the decisions of the international court, which will be held on 1 October as a result of five years of debate.
"In Bolivia there is energy, spirit of unity and mental equality and, of course, there is a positive outcome," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilia.
Many patients will monitor the decision-making process in the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Tribunal can support Bolivia ' s statement that, after decades of urgent negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate to provide Bolivia with a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of the Bolivian indigenous peoples, who is struggling with the question of re-election next year, also looks forward to the decision to be made on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will not take a decision in favour of Bolivia, and if so, it will change little.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no jurisdiction over the Chilean territory and has already stated that it will not have any effect on possible negotiations.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice was made only six months after the last arguments had been heard indicates that the case was “not difficult”, says Pas Zarate, an expert in international law.
In the last four years, Bolivia has not progressed, and the reverse has always been reversed.
“The current administration of Bolivia used the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes,” Zarate says.
According to her, the Morales military ritual destroyed the last Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but then it will be very difficult to hold discussions.
These two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodrigues Velce, representative of Bolivia in the Hague, did not agree that the decision of the court was made too quickly.
The Monday will provide Bolivia with “the exclusive opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and the chance to “end of 139 years of mutual benefit”, he said.
Calzadilia also disagrees that Morales, one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, uses the military and maritime problem as a political nightmare.
“The disease is never denied its right to access the Pacific,” he claims.
“The decision of the court is another opportunity to convince us that we have to move through our past.”
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not take place until it can trust the United States.
Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri-Yon Ho states that his country will never go to the destruction of its nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
At the United Nations General Assembly meeting on Saturday, Riy took the floor.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises of summits in Singapore between the leaders of its countries.
His comments are as far as U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo is gradually returning to the restoration of the Tupic Nuclear Diplomat for more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Chen Yin.
Ri claims that the dream that long sanctions and the United States objection to the declaration of the end of the Korean war will ever be put to the North on the knees is a lie.
Washington is afraid to adopt this declaration unless Phenyan has already taken substantial steps towards disarmament.
And Kim, and US President Donald Trump want to hold the second summit.
However, scepticism is that Phenyan is seriously involved in the rejection of the arsenal, which the country is likely to consider as the only way to guarantee its safety is widely distributed.
Pompeo plans to visit Pynian next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Tramp.
Paris fashion shows a new line of massive bulkheads that promise to appear in mass sales and will carry them directly with you
If you want to add lead to your collection or to protect yourself from sunglasses, you don't have to look for anything else.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a mass of unusual main decorations, which were part of their SS19 collection and hidden visitors to Paris on Sundays.
In this summer, very unprofessional steps led to the popularity of Instagram signatories, and designers decided to launch their snowflakes on the floor.
The outstanding example of Valentino: the main refugee camp, decorated with large fields, like the first one, was beautiful in the heads of models.
Other massive accessories have been included in refined gold-cubic stones, silver and even pineapple pineapples, but not all of these headaches are intended to burn the head in cold weather.
Tom Brown also became a peaceful collection of wonderful masks, which came very close to the persecution of Halloween.
In many of these caves, the teeth were protected, and they were more remembered by the portrait of Hannibal Laker than by the creation of the kitchen.
One of the specimens reminded us of a water tank with holes and protective glasses, while the other was growing ice.
If you are a worshiper of the highest order, it will be yours.
Modal criticism predicts that these giants have all the chance to break into mass sales — directly to you.
The large size slips are due to the five La Bomba, a two-footed solo jump with two legs that were already hoped for, from Riana to Emily Ratakovski.
The cultural lobby, which released this extremely unprofessional step, which led to such widespread popularity in social networks, was born and sent out to play on the floor another huge accessories — a flat bag, almost the same size as the one in the buyer’s model, which was empty.
The orange bag from the sacred Rafi with a white leather handle and an octopus from the Rafi became a bright specimen of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection on Sunday of fashion in Paris.
Selebritist Luke Armitage reports on the issue of FC: “I think big shoes and beach bags will appear in the mass sale next summer, as the designer has already produced such a forum for his products, it would be very difficult to ignore the demand for large accessories.”
John Edward: Language knowledge is of great importance to citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland continue to be a tradition of flashing education, which has been confirmed in 2018: the results of the exams have shown individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other public-funded disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scotland Independent Schools Council (SCIS), train more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, and seek to provide a higher level of service for students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further higher education and for the status of citizens of the world.
As part of the educational sector responsible for the development and implementation of an individual school programme, we see that modern languages continue to remain popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in the language he understands, you call him to mind.
And if you speak to him in his mother tongue, then surely you are turning to his heart.’
This is convincing evidence that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relations with citizens of other countries and be able to trust them.
As a result of the last exams this year, we see language taking leadership positions in the milk tables and having the highest score in the results of the exams in independent schools.
In total, 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages received a higher “A”.
The data received by 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of students received “A” in Mandarin (Chinese name), while 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students also received “A”.
This proves that, in independent schools of Scotland, foreign languages are undoubtedly important for children and young people in the future.
Language subjects are currently being used with the same demand as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics in schools and other educational institutions.
A survey by the United Kingdom Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of the reasons for the difficulties of employers in filling vacancies were because of the lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly a guarantee of a successful career for young people.
Given that more prospective jobs require language knowledge, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
Regardless of what a student will choose, if he learns a second language, he will receive a real advantage in the future by developing another additional practice that will be acceptable to him throughout his life.
The possibility of direct contact with people from other countries automatically gives a person who knows several foreign languages the competitive advantages.
According to a survey by YouGov, involving more than 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak well in a foreign language in order to support the discussion and 15 per cent were spoken in French alone with two per cent.
That is why investment in language education is so current.
The knowledge of a number of languages, especially those of developing countries with economies, gives children more opportunities to find a good job.
In Scotland schools, there is a great deal of confusion about languages that are taught — in each school in its own language.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are most important to Britain in the light of the future development of the country by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, you will always choose from a number of languages with the teaching group, which members are experts in those languages.
The independent schools of Scotland strive to create an environment for training and training children and to equip them with the skills needed to achieve success, regardless of their future.
It cannot be denied that, in the global business environment, language remains vital for the future development of the country, and that must be reflected accordingly in education.
In fact, modern languages need to be considered as “individuals of the international community”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice to ensure diversity and advantages for young people in Scotland.
You need to do it.
John Edwards, Director of the Council of Independent Schools of Scotland
Lebron takes the lead in Lakers on the resurrection in San Diego
The dark expectations of fans will see Lebron James first in Los Angeles Lakes, almost to the end.
The Lakers trainer Luke Walton announced that James was playing in a pre-resurrection match against Daver Naggets in San Diego.
But he still needs to figure out how much time he needs to play.
"More than one and less than eight hours," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
The report “Lackers” by Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James is, in most cases, playing a limited amount of time.
After training this week, James asked about his plans for six pre-sense games in Lakers.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-convention games to prepare for the season,” the player answers.
Trampa pre-run in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Tramp starts the pre-election meeting tonight at Wiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned meetings of Trampa next week, including a friendly visit to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on the candidate proposed by the Supreme Judge was postponed, the Trump sought support for the forthcoming interim elections, as the Republicans were at risk of losing control of the Congress if the vote was held in November.
How many meetings will be held this evening in the West Virginia, and how can you see it online?
The meeting with Trampo in Wiling, West Virginia will be held at 19:00 a.m. on the east side today, on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can view the tramp meeting with the Western Virginia voters online on YouTube.
The tramp is likely to be heard this week in order to send his candidate Bretta Cavano to the Supreme Judge. The proposal of this candidate led to a mass of negative responses, as Kavano was accused of sexual harassment, and the vote to be taken in Senate will be postponed until Sunday until the FBR is investigated.
However, the main objective of this action is to help the Republicans of the Republic of the Republic of the Congo make a pre-election step.
Thus, the campaign of President Trampa aimed at helping those five meetings to be held the following week to “increase the activities of volunteers and stakeholders, as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters wrote.
“The control over the Congress is so important to its agenda that the President must visit as many states as possible, as we are entering the tense pre-accession season,” said the press secretary of the Trampa pre-election campaign, who refused to be called Reuters.
The action planned today at Wesbanco Arena in Wiling could attract participants from "... Ohio and Pennsylvania, and draw attention to the Pittsburgh media", reports West Virginia Metro News.
The visit to the West Virginia Strip this Saturday is the second visit to that country in the last month, which has benefited more than 40 per cent in 2016.
The tramp is trying to assist a candidate in the Senate of the West Virgin of Patrick Morris, who is left behind as a result of the interrogations.
“The fact that Morrisi is beginning to challenge the competitors for questioning must come by the president — a bad sign for Morris himself,” says Simon Heder, a politician from the University of West Virginia (cited by Reuters).
Riyadh 2018: The United States of America is ready to fight and looks forward to a meeting in the morning
After three separate sessions, the Saturday game, two to two, may have been what Kubok Rydera needed.
The transitional initiative is an excellent idea of sports, but it is believed to be games, and it is very clear on such occasions.
So who's taking the initiative?
"They had a advantage in six glasses, and now four, so I think it is a small initiative for us," Jordan Spit said.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of four eyes and twelve more horses.
The Americans, in the opinion of Sparta, feel “the wind in the clouds” and have reason to keep the spirit high, not least thanks to the form of Sparta and Justin Thomas, who played all day together, and each can be praised with three eyes of four.
Spit was constantly running from you to the grass than he gave a personal example.
The winning calls became all too loud as his round continued, beating the decisive sword in the hole, closing the match when they and Thomas entered two to two.
His defeat at the game on the 15th of June was met with a similar slogan, one of which was about his faith in a chance for the American team.
“We need to meet with all our strengths and focus only on our game,” he commented.
It's all that's left of the toys now.
Walk 18 moons and become winners.
The only games that have worked for the last two days are Spit and Thomas, the French Moliners and Tommy Flytwood, who have never been in the history of Kubka Ryder.
A strange but charming couple from Europe killed four of them, and they don't seem to know the mistake.
“Molivid” was the only couple who did not pick up the gods on the Sabbath day, but also escaped the gods on the Sabbath morning, on the Friday, and again on the Friday morning.
Such a series and, as their energy seems, circulation between them and inadvertent patients, strengthens the faith that they will not win in the resurrection, and when the sun falls behind the horizon of the Le Golf National, there will be no more prominent game that confirms the potential victory of Europe than the Flitwood or Molinary.
It would be good if both were on different moons at the same time.
However, speak of the glory of Europe as long as it is too late.
Bob Watson and Webb Simpson quickly argued with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the game in four matches when he was married to Alex Norren.
The two gods and the two gods on the first nine moons struck the Spanish and the Swedish, from which they were unable to choose.
So in the resurrection no one will help you choose from your stomach.
So it is all too easy to watch the game in four balls and four games because of the interaction between couples, the councils they exchange, and they are intent on reducing, and how the strategy can be changed in one direction.
At the same time, Europe played better than the team, and had a significant impact on the past day, but this fourth session also showed that the United States had all the strength to fight, in which some, especially in America, doubted.
On the final day, Cuba, the Europe Rider will be headed by account 10-6
Europe will be blessed on the final day of Cuba Rider after the completion of Saturday matrices in four cats and four of the United States' top 10-6.
The inspired poets Tommy Flitwood and French Molinari led the struggle with two victories over the fighting Tiger Woods to bring the account to Le Golf National by four o'clock.
The European team of Thomas Bourne, wishing to return the lost one two years ago in Hazellin, has been dominant over the alleged failure of the American team in tomorrow's games in four matches, winning with the count of 3-1.
The United States had more opposition in the quarter, won two matches, but they could not reduce the gap in the account.
Commander Jim Ferica needs eight glasses of 12 resurrected mothers to keep the trophies.
Flitwood is the first European novel to win four shots, while he and Molinari, who received the name Mollywood after the seasonings, became the only second pair who won four shots in the first four matches in the history of Cuba Rayder.
When Woods and Patrick Reid broke into four swords, they then had a great deal of cooperation to win over the fallen spirit of Woods and U.S. novelty Brison with even more decisive 5/4.
The Woods, last two Saturday matches, showed periodical challenges, but now he lost 19 out of 29 matches in four matches, and four out of seven.
Justin Rose, who spent the morning in four matches, returned to Henry Stanson's party on Thursday, defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Cape with account 2/1, taking the first and third places in the world.
For Europe, the game has not become easy and pleasant for a relaxing day to the south-west of Paris.
The three-fold champions of Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas were two shots for Americans on Saturday.
They worked hard with the 2/1 account over Spanish John Ram and Ian Polter in the game in four bullets and returned later to play Polter and Rory McKilroy in the 4/3 account in the quarter, lost the first two moons.
Only two times in the history of Kubka Rader, the team had to be left in four eyes, leaving alone, bearing in mind that the Ferika team, as farmers, had to play a game to hold the trophies.
However, after two days of second-place detention, the contract in the resurrection looks like it is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says that “categories” will not be deployed unilaterally without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea made a statement to the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would strengthen confidence in the United States and that his country would not give up its nuclear weapons in a unilateral manner under any circumstances.
Rei Yon Ho said to the General Assembly every year that North Korea had taken “a major good will” last year, such as the end of nuclear and missile tests, the detonation of nuclear ignition and the obligation not to raise nuclear weapons stocks and not to develop nuclear technologies.
"But we don't see a symmetric reaction from the United States," he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we cannot take the first action on disarmament.”
While Ri repeated the voice of North Korean complaints against Washington ' s “a step-by-step” approach to decollarization, which would be rewarded by North Korea for step-by-step steps, his statement showed important in the sense that it did not reject unilateral decollarization without control, as Phenyan had done in the past.
Rey referred to a joint statement made by Kim Chen Yen and Donald Tramp on the first in history between the current US President and the North Korean leader, who was held in Singapore on 12 June; then Kim promised to start the movement on the part of the Korean peninsula, and Tromp promised North Korea security.
North Korea is trying to formalize the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States states that Phinenan must have begun to abandon his nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposes the call for the weakening of the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
“The US$ insists that “initiation must be made” and that the level of pressure is increased through sanctions in order to enforce its objective imperatively and even counter “declaration of the end of the war”, says Ri.
“The idea that sanctions can put us on the knees is the utopian dream of people who don’t know us.
But this problem is that continuing sanctions strengthen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans of the second high-level meeting between Kim and Tramp, on which the United States leader mentioned at the beginning of the week at the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Xe Inn, who took place in the last five months, and added: “If South Korea was on the side of this issue, and not the United States, the Korean peninsula would not be in such a pit.”
However, Ri's words were very different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the target of North Korea's missile on the United States was inevitable after the “Mr. President of Evil” Tramp called Kima “the suicide bomber”.
This year at UN Tromp, which threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, commended Kim for her courage in taking disarmament measures, but said that there was still much to be done, and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea does not.
In the middle of the trip, he said that he did not indicate any time limits for this process: “Will it take two years, three years or five months?
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should encourage Phanyan for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary-General Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The introduction of sanctions by the Security Council must continue actively and legally until we see the full, final and confirmed decollarization.”
The Security Council has consistently strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with the aim of shutting down the financing of the Phinenan nuclear and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN General Assembly summits and reported that he would visit Pyjan again next month to prepare for the second high-level meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has failed.
In July he left Phenyan, saying that progress had been made, but for a few hours after that visit, North Korea condemned him for “bandit requirements”.
North Korea promised a meeting with the participation of Muna this month to decompose a rocket complex and a nuclear complex if the United States would take “relevant measures”.
According to Kim, he said that the “relevant measures” he had mentioned were security assurances that Tramp promised Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are learning to breathe at special courses
A new course introduced this year at Harvard University helped all students to learn more to sleep and to fight the shovinist culture of endless caffeine consumption in order to celebrate “night of the past”.
One of the academics explained that the most successful students in the world often have no idea of how to care for themselves.
Charles Chesler, a sleep health professor at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that he considered to be the first in his class in the United States.
After his opening, he was angered by the idea of introducing such a course, prior to the report on the impact of sleep failure on learning processes.
“At the end of my report, a girl came to me and said, ‘I’m sorry that I knew about this only now that I’m almost finished.’
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, first proposed to students this year, describes how the habit of healthy sleep contributes to academic and sports success, as well as how it improves the overall human consciousness.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the Executive Director of the Health Service of the University, says that the university has decided to introduce this course after it has been made clear that students are experiencing a serious lack of sleep during the school week.
Over an hour of work, students are carrying out a number of interactive tasks.
In one of the sections of employment, we suggest a room in the community where students, with coffee cups, teasings, coaches and books, receive information about how each of these actions and substances — coffee, light, and sleep - affect sports results and how important it is to get enough sleep every day.
In the second section, participants are aware of how long sleep loss can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
An interactive map of the campus encourages participants to think about their daily lives.
“We understand that these activities do not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know how any other person has the right to know about, for example, how smoking affects his health,” added Professor Chesler.
According to him, the false feeling of pride that a person can “go all night ” is still quite widespread, and modern technologies, as well as increasing pressure on students, mean that sleep deprivation is a problem.
He said that the amount of sleep of good quality is a “secret weapon” for the student to fight stress, nervousness, and anxiety, and even for the fight against the loss of weight, as lack of sleep translates the brain into the process of hunger, enabling him to constantly experience hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemistry and physics, helped Professor Chesler to develop a course, visited one of the last year's courses during his first year of education in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to spread this information throughout the camp.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all experts to conduct a similar training program before going to a competitive educational institution.
Professor Chesler recommends that students set up a building that warns against falling asleep and falling, as well as remind themselves of the harmful effects of the “light of light” released by electronic screens and lighting lamps, which undermines the human bureaucracy and leads to problems with pollution.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Menga brings victory over Gerard's command
The Rangers survived a series of fine marches, as Holly Menga led the unencumbered team of Steven Gerard to an attack with account 1:0 in Livingstone.
Commander Aybrox hoped to win his first win after winning account 4:1 in February in St. Johnston, but Commander Gary Holta only won the second defeat of Gerard of 18 games as manager, leaving his team on eight fronts, leaving the easy win of the Harts team to the Scottish Premier League leaders.
Menga was killed in seven minutes before the break, and the Reingers, who lost the spirit, seemed to have failed to balance the account.
While Rangers was now in sixth place, Livingstone was in third place, and only Hibernian was in relation to dead heads.
The Rangers may also have additional problems after a linear judge, Kalum Spence, came to treat the head wound after an item was removed from the guest sector.
Gerard made eight replacements to the team that passed through "Er" in a semi-final for the Scottish League of Cuba.
In turn, Holt went with the same Livi 11 strategy, which has increased the gap with Harts last week, and he would be happy to see his well-informed composition strengthen the opponents on each step.
The Rangers may have been led by a sword, but Livingston survived more when the sword came to him.
They had to be killed almost two minutes after the first transfer of Menga Scott Pittman to the Alain McGregor, but the protector used the chance shown.
Kigan Jackobs had a gravitational attack on the captain of the crew of Craig Halket, but his defense partner, Alan Litgo, was able only to send a sword to the side of the further stage.
The Rangers took control, but the third seems to have been more hopeful than the faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was convinced that it was supposed to have been a fine hit for forty-five minutes when he and Stephen Laules met, but Judge Stephen Thompson did not agree with the Colombian statement.
The Rangers did two strikes in the first team, but former owner of Aybrox, Liam Kelly, was hardly concerned about the attack of Lassan Kulibali on his head, and the weak strike of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the first hall of Livi, which was killed at 34 minutes, may not have been in harmony with the game, no one can deny that they earned it exclusively by their own efforts.
But once again, the Rangers failed to deal with the game of Jacobs with the standard.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Galler gave Scott Robinson a sword, who tried hard to pass the sword on to Menga to finish.
Gerard began to act on the interrupting when Kulibali changed to Ryan Kent, and this replacement almost immediately resulted when the final semi-protector left the Morelos dog, but the impressionant Kelly pushed off with his line of overcrowding.
But Livingstone continued to attract guests into their imaginary game with the participation of Litgo and Halket, a constant process of long transfers.
The Holt team tried to increase the gap in the final stages, but McGregor was able to block Jacobs before Litgo was transferred from the field.
The Rangers rescue game, Glenn Midlton, was in constant need of a strike after he met Jacobs, but Tomson refused again.
GERMANY: Recruiter of the Hague Accountant
And now the page of our German "Saturday Morning": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, the future physics of Johanne Wilhelm Gans was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity — an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger accountant.
As one of the basiss of science, the journalist Geiger also became one of the basis of popular culture, and this was reflected in the 1950s film "Colocola Coronado", with the coffee-like Roma Rogers and Dalem Evans — such that it would be said that scientists are not the same — in the main roles:
The human being says, "What is the matter with this treasure?"
Rogers: "It's Geiger's accountant, used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you hope these sensors, you can actually hear the effects of atoms generated by radiation in minerals."
Evans will say, "You have heard.
“Gans” Geiger died in 1945, not for a few days before he was 63 years old.
But his invention, called his author's honour, is still widely used.
A new cancer can learn the immune system to see analytic cells
A new anticancer vaccine can learn the immune system to “see” the anomaly growing cells and kill them.
Part of the treatment of vaccines is to learn the immune system to identify analytic cells
The method is to remove immune cells from the patient and change them in laboratory conditions
As a result of this change, cells get the ability to see white type, which is characteristic of many types of cancer, then cells must be re-adjusted
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One patient who has been infected with this vaccine and whose immune system has learned to recognize analytic cells has been infected with ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method is to remove the immune cells from the patient and change them in laboratory conditions, after which modified cells can see the HER2 protein, which is characteristic of many cancers, and then re-enter the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofski, National Institute for Cancer Research, Wifezda, Maryland, says: “The results we have received suggest that we have experienced a very promising vaccine.”
Professor Berzofski explains: HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancers”, including breast cancer, pelvic, mild and colorectal cancer.
A similar method was successfully used in the treatment of leicemia, and it was included in the collection of immune cells in patients and their “training” as should be affected by cancer cells.
Kane West spoke in defense of the trampa in the MAGA helmet after its appearance in SNL.
It's all gone bad.
Kane West was found in the study during a Saturday concert in which he spoke for the protection of US President Donald Trampa, arguing that he would resume the post in 2020.
After performing his third song, called the City of Prizrak, which he performed, he went to the "Make America a Great Again", the performer spoke against the democracies and supported Trampa.
“I used to talk to white people, and they asked me, ‘How can you support the Trampa, who is a racist?’”
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago.”
The SNL channel conducted a parallel show with Matt Damon in the main role in which the Hollywood star quoted Bret Cavano's testimony to the Senate Committee on Statements of Christine Blaise Ford on Sexual Harassment.
On television, they did not show how the crowd was upset by Westa’s speech, but the video was being downloaded into social networks by Criss Rock.
Now it's not clear whether Rock tried this step to take West.
In addition, West appealed to the public that his hat had been pulled off by the cuffs.
“They were leaning towards me on the floor.
They're saying, don't get in that bag.
They were really hanging on to me!
Washington Examiner quotes him as saying: “And they still said that my position is not cruel.”
He will say, "Would you like to know that there is no god but the Lord of the heavens and the earth, so that no one may say to you what you should do?
Then you will need love."
At least two times, his comments drew the attention of the audience, SNL members were said to be missing, and one man said: “All the study was closed in silence.”
Weesta has recently been invited to replace Ariane Grande, who was an ex-boyfriend, Reper Mac Miller, who died a few days ago.
Many have chosen to perform the West song "I Love it" in Perrier's costume.
West received support from the head of the TPUSA Kendis Terner Conservative Group, who wrote on Twitter: “One of the most courageous people: SPASSIBO FOR THE MISSION OF MY PEOPLE”.
The leading actor Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was just “the person he is, and that is absolutely remarkable”.
“However, I do not want to support anyone (buying his music, clothing or otherwise supporting his creation) who, in my view, divides and spreads an ideology that is valuable to my community.
He is a free man.
Like us," she said.
Before the show started, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, stating that he is now “formally known as Kanye West”.
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he's on his way to Diddy, also known as Paf Daddy, Paffi, and Pi Diddy.
In his colleague, Rep. Snup Doga had the name Snup Leon, and as another example, it is possible to bring up the performer, a recent legend, Prince, who changed his name to symbol, and then to the artist's name, formerly known as Prince.
An attempt to find charges of murder on the grounds of torture in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after one of his visitors died from knife injuries on Friday at a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The incident took place in Ballihakamore, as reported in the police.
The respondent is expected to appear before the Belfast World Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the State Prosecutor.
Kit Harington's star “Games of the throne” is attacked by toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as the winning sword of John Snow in the violent mid-term fantasy series of the HBO.
However, a 31-year-old actor angrily criticised the stereotype of a male cat, saying that such characters often encourage young people to think that to be respected, they must be cruel.
In his interview The Sunday Times Culture Kit said that he felt that “something was wrong” and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the era #MeToo.
Kitt, who recently married his colleague on the “Game of Thrones” film, admitted that he was “not quite equal” to this issue.
“I personally take the matter very seriously: where did we fail with courage?” asked the actor.
“Why do we teach adult children that we have a problem today?”
Kitt believes that television may be partly blamed for the intrusion of toxic muscle because of excessive muscle strength.
The actor continues: “What is the prey, and what is the prey?
What do they teach on television and on the streets, making young men feel that they should show only one particular aspect of courage?
I think this is really one of the biggest problems in our time, and the question of how can we change this?
Because today with young people, it's really not.
In the interview, he also recognized that he would not participate in any of the “Game of Thrones” exercises after the series ended next summer, saying that he had “completed with battalions and evils”.
As of November, Kitt plays a major role in the re-synthesis of the real West, Sam Shepard, who talks about the film promoter and his brother, the rapist.
The actor recently announced that he believed that meeting with his wife, Rose, was the best final for him.
“I met my wife in this series, so he gave me my family and my future, ” says an actor.
Rose played the Igreist, an object of the passion of the character of Kita John Snow in the fictional series entitled Emmy’s prize.
Para observed the marriage in June 2018 at Lesley's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 per cent increase in new cases
China announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of its citizens affected by HIV and AIDS.
According to health representatives, more than 820,000 people suffer from these diseases in the country.
Only about 40,000 new cases were recorded in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases of disease have been transmitted sexually, which is evidence of changing past trends.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of the flow of infected blood.
However, the number of HIV infections has been practically zeroed, and Chinese health representatives at a conference in the province of June.
Each year, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexualism was criminalized in China in 1997, but the discrimination against LGBT was still widespread.
Studies confirm that 70 to 90 per cent of men having sex with men end up marrying women due to the conservative values of the country.
In many cases the transmission of diseases is due to the lack of protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised universal access to drugs against HIV as part of its efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Watters is investigating information about the guilt of the senators of the Republican Party, complaining about “dangerous lies” and “precious theories”
A member of the U.S. Parliament, Maxine Waters, rejected the charges on Saturday that one of her staff had posted personal information from three United States senators on the pages of the lawmakers of Wikipedia.
The democracy of Los Angeles claims that claims have been made by “ultra-legal” experts and websites.
“ Lies, lies, and even more lies,” Wutters says in his Twitter.
The information is reported to include the address and telephone number of the United States Senators, Lindsey Graham, South California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hetch, Utah.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person at the Capitol Valley during the hearings of the Senate Commission on sexual harassment against a candidate at the Supreme Court of Bretta Cavano.
The escape took place some time after the three senators conducted a survey of Cavano.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of communications had been linked to the Waters office and informed of the Wutters staff, reports Hill.
“This unreasonably false claim is absolutely false, ” Wutters asserts.
“A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these moustaches, was not in any way responsible for the withdrawal of this information.
That is an unreasonably false claim.”
The Uter's statement immediately called for criticism on the Internet, including by former press secretary of the White House, Ari Flecher.
"It's a hateful denial," says Flejcher.
“This means that the author has a temperature that is not suitable for work in Congress.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why don't you?
And you don't have to justify it either.
And you shouldn't be hiding in the motives of the prosecutors.
You have to stay calm and cool.”
Flejcher, it has been said, compared with Water's reaction to the criticism of Democrats against the Kawano judge, whose criticisms accused him of being too bad during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a candidate from the Republicans who fought at Waters in the interim elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“If this is the truth, it is very important,” he writes.
In his statement, Walters wrote that her office had warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities of these Muslim actions.
“We are concerned that the criminals are found,” she writes, “and that they are responsible for all their actions that can be destructive and dangerous for all of my staff.”
Johnny Inglesch has been hit again — a weak family member of spina bifida Rowen Atkinson
Today, it has become a tradition to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new film in which the United Kingdom is characterised otherwise; this is also true of the new parallel Spanish franchise, Agent Johnny Inglesh, which was produced in 2003 and continued in 2011 with the film “Agent Johnny England: Recharge”.
Will the self-sustaining picture with the “explainly we’re all smoke” a new attempt on national exports?
In any case, Professor Johnny Inglesch's fingerprints with a spinal cord gained his right to chaos a second time — that is, his name is very clear — that he is a wide-screen comic book designed for the non-English cinematographic audience.
Hero, of course, was a secret agent who, despite his excellent claims on glazing, received a little Clouseau, Mr. Bina's painting and the treasure of this guy, who made one note in a young Chariots of Fire in London at the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony.
This person was originally created on the basis of the identity of the traveler and the forgotten “International” Atkinson, who once played in the memory of Barclaycard’s television advertising, in which the hero left behind the chaos.
In this latest release the JE is one or two pleasant moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny Inglesch approached the helicopter, walked in the middle of the day, and the thieves were lying on his back.
Yes, it shows Atkinson's gift to the physical performance of comedian scenes, but the honour itself seems to be quite weak and strange, especially since “serious” films such as Agent 007” and the Mission’s failure are now confidently offering a comedy as an element.
Such a feeling of jealousy is based on children rather than on adults, and for me, the wonderful crimes of Johnny England are not as dramatic and appropriate as those of Atkinson in the movies about Mr. Bines.
The permanent mission is now that Britain is in a serious crisis.
Cyber hacker entered the top-secret British spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of the degour agent Kevin Eldonu here, unfortunately, had an epidemiological role.
This is the last trap for the Prime Minister, who has been forced and forced by a figure that has already suffered from huge political instability: Emma Thompson is doing all he can for Quazi Terez May, but the script does nothing to do with it.
Her intelligence consultants informed her that, as each active spy had been compromised, she had to remove someone from the scene.
And here on stage is Johnny Ingles himself, who is currently working as a school teacher at a certain point, but also gives informal lessons in the secret operation: there are several good steps here, as England offers Spanish Academy skills in the style of "the year".
England is returning to Whitehall for extra training and is reunited with its former infamous friend, whom Ben Miller is playing this time.
Baf is now a married man under the command of the underwater boat, the role of the "good hockeys" in which Vicki Pepperdin is a little lost.
So, Betman and Robin are back in the game because of the terrible mistakes that have been made in Her Majesty's secret service, and they are faced with a beautiful year-old woman, Ophelia Boulett, in the performance of Olga Curylenko.
At that time, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the control of a charismatic technology billionaire, who claims to be able to solve British computer problems, such as the violent Jason Volt, which is playing by Jake Lacey.
England and Baf begin to wear haircuts: masked under officers, they are under the French restaurant; they create chaos, a barbaric transport to the Volta plant; England is born with a complex anarchy, trying to use the virtual reality guarantee to get acquainted with the Volt's home.
All these scenes are, of course, a sweet and boring thought, but in all of this there is something very childish.
It's full of stuff.
And, as with other films, Johnny England, I couldn't imagine, but the British cinema industry can't give Rouen Atkinson a role that is really balanced with his talent?
The Liberians reject that they are developing a plan to reduce the work week of Britain by four days after Friday's pay.
The Liberian party, Jeremy Corbin, is going to consider a radical plan that the British will work four days a week, but the payments will be paid in five days.
The party, it is reported, would like the management of companies to hand over the protection workers obtained from the revolution in the field of artificial intelligence to provide them with additional exits.
This would allow staff members to enjoy three-day exits for the same wage.
The source reported that the idea was “recorded” in the party's economic agenda and would help the people of the country become a part of the workforce.
The Congress of Trade Unions approved a four-day working week transition so that workers could benefit from the advantages of the changing economy.
The high-ranking source of the Liberian party said The Sunday Times: It is expected that the policy review will be announced by the end of the year.
“This will not occur at the same time, but four-day working week is our goal, which is consistent with the approach of the Party to change the balance of the economy for the benefit of the work force, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party.”
The Liberian Party is not the first to support this idea, since the Green Party has promised four-day working weeks still during its 2017 pre-election campaign.
However, this effort is not currently approved by the majority of the Liberian party.
The representative of the Liberian Party said: “The four-day working week is not a political party and is not a party”.
The Montenegrin Chancellor John McDonnell used a Liberian conference last week to concreteize his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was full of determination to seize power in the "non-directors" and "expectors" of municipal companies.
The plan of the tank Chancellor also means that current water-containers may not have all their share back, as the Liberian Government can “sacrifice” on the basis of the alleged crimes.
He also confirmed the plans to include staff in the Board of Directors of Companies and the establishment of the Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10 per cent of the private sector's capital to the labour sector, which would receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds of sterling.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking about 60 minutes, can the FBI's investigation about Cavano change their opinion?
The FBR's investigation of charges to Judge Bretta Cavano held a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Judge as a minimum per week and asked whether the findings of the agencies could build up any senators to support Cavano.
In the interview presented on Wednesday, the 60-minute “60-minute” correspondent Scott Pelley asked the senators, John Kennedy and Lindsey Grem, if the FBI could find anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Well, of course," answered Kennedy.
“When I went to the meeting, I said I had spoken to Judge Cavano.
I called him after this happened, and I said, "Did you do this?"
His answer was decisive, definite and unique.’
But Grama's opinion remained undisputed when she voted.
“I am firmly determined on the subject of Brett Cavano, and my opinion can only be changed by arguments, by actions comparable to the dynamics,” he said.
"Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but one thing I know is that Brett strongly rejected all of this," he added, referring to Christine Blaise Ford.
“Not one of the witnesses she called could also confirm those facts.
That story is 36 years old.
I have not noticed anything new in it."
What is this Global Citizen Festival, and did it do anything to reduce poverty?
On this Saturday in New York, the Global Citizen Festival (Festival of Peace) will be held — an annual musical event involving the impressive star composition of the impressive mission — the end of poverty all over the world.
Seven years have passed since the Festival of World Citizens as many as tens of thousands of people have met in the capital of the Central Park, but not only to enjoy the statements of executives such as Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendez, but also to talk about this objective: the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
The festival of citizens of the world, which was opened in 2012, was the continuation of a global project to combat poverty, which was carried out by the international human rights defenders group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), you must have participated in voluntary activities or sent an e-mail to the world leader, make a phone call, or perform any other or other important action aimed at helping to raise awareness of your purpose to end poverty.
But how successful has the Festival of Peace been in achieving its goal for 12 years?
Is it the idea of rewarding people with a free tour of the concert now to convince citizens to call for action, or is it just another case of what is called "clicitism", when people believe that they make real changes by signing online petition or sending communications to Twitter?
The organizers of Global Citizen state that, since 2011, more than 19 million "actions" have been registered at the festival by its partners, who pursue many different objectives.
It is recalled that, thanks to these actions, world leaders promised to allocate more than $37 billion, which should affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group drew up 390 commitments and declarations made as a result of its actions, with at least $10 billion already paid or collected.
According to the assessment of the group, the funds provided provided direct assistance to nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the most important obligations is the name of The Power of Nutrition: the British partnership of investors and implementing specialists committed to “to help children fully open their capacity”, promised Rwanda to provide $35 million to help put an end to the unrest in the area, which was done after more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens were received.
“With the support of the Government of Great Britain, donors, national governments and Global Citizens, like you, we can make social injustice with regard to the lack of food for the past history,” said Ambassador Power of Nutrition Tracy Ullman at a live concert in London, held in April 2018.
The Group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions were taken calling on Britain to improve food for mothers and children, the Government announced funding for the Food Force project, covering 5 million women and children through activities aimed at improving food.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the festival's website, "Why do you think we can end with extreme poverty?"
The organizers of the Global Citizen respond: “This will be a long and difficult way for us to meet and fall.
But as in the great civil rights struggle and anti-aparttade, we succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Wikkend, Sean Mendez, Cardie B, Jeanelle Moné, are some of the artists who will be taking part in this year's event in New York, and his leaders will be Debor Lee Fernes and Hyu Jackman.
The United States may use a military fleet for blockades to prevent the export of Russian energy: Minister of Internal Affairs
US Minister for Internal Affairs Ryan Zinke stated that Washington could, if necessary, flee to the aid of its military fleet to prevent the fall of Russian energy operators on the market, including in the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia's presence in Syria, especially where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate Government, is a proposal to explore new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy as they do in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe,” he says.
And, according to the official, there are certain ways and means to address this problem.
“The United States, together with our fleet, has the opportunity to ensure the openness of the maritime routes and, where necessary, to block their energy from entering the market,” said the Minister.
Zinke referred to the activities organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-commercial group, which positions itself as the U.S. “Volume of Energy” in the United States.
He further compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they were actually the same.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is more or less efficient in fuel use and replacement,” said the minister, calling Russia a “ponie with a single triangle”, whose economy depends on fuel generation.
Statements were made because the Trampa administration had made the task of increasing its exports of frozen natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia with a much more flexible option for European consumers.
To that end, the authorities of the tramp administration, including US President Donald Trampa, are trying to convince Germany to get out of the “inaccurate” project of the North Stream-2 pipeline, which, according to Trampa, made Berlin a “plennic” Moscow.
In Moscow, it was repeatedly stressed that the North River-2 project cost 11 billion dollars, which should double the current transit capacity of up to 110 billion cubic metres, was a purely economic project.
Kremmel argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is motivated by economic reasons and is an example of poor competition.
“I stress that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for pressure and that consumers should be able to select suppliers,” said Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Minister of Energy Rick Perry, held in September in Moscow.
The United States position called for a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
German industry in the German Federation (BDI) called on the United States to refrain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When the third State intervenes in our energy supply, this creates a serious problem,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting of German Chancellor Angel Merkel and President of Russia Vladimira Putin.
Senator of the state of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren will carefully explore the possibility of a presidential ballot in 2020
The Secretary of State, Elizabeth Warren, said on Saturday that the possibility of a presidential ballot would be examined closely after the mid-term elections.
At a city meeting in Hollyok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about participating in the pre-election race.
“It is time for women to go to Washington and "rest" our corrupt government, and for that, a woman is required,” says Warren The Hill.
“After 6 November, I will take a closer look at the possibility of balloting the Presidents.”
Warren thus assessed the activities of President Donald Trampa at the meeting: “This area is in the wrong direction”.
"I'm worried about Donald Trump's doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren is an open critic of both the Trampa itself and his candidate at the post of Supreme Judge Bretta Cavano.
In his Twitter on Friday, Warren wrote: “We must, of course, conduct an FBR investigation before the vote begins.”
However, a survey published in Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think it should be ballistics in 2020.
According to a survey by the Political Research Centre of the University of Safffolk/Boston Globe, 85 per cent of the "probably" electors of Massachusetts said that the senator should not be balsified.
Thirty-two per cent of respondents, on the contrary, support her plans.
The survey showed that the population was more supportive of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38 per cent supported his possible participation in the elections and 48 per cent objected.
Other well-known names of democracies discussed in connection with the 2020 perspective include former Vice-President Joe Byden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Byden claims that he will take an official decision by January, reports the Associated Press.
Sara Pailin told of the post-traumatic stress disorder of Traka Palina at a meeting with the Donalda Trampa voters
Trek Pailin, 26 years old, was serving in the army in September and spent the year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday evening.
“My son, who has returned home, is now experiencing the same experience as members of other families who experience the effects of PTSD and those who have injuries, and our soldiers are returning with injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Tramp in Talse, Oklahoma.
He called his arrest a white one in the eye and said of his son and other veterans: “They are already returned to others who are confused about the matter, and are given the same respect to their friends, soldiers, bats and any other war they have committed in their country.”
Trak Pailin was arrested on Monday in Basil, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against women involved in the situation of violence and the storage of weapons in the state of alcohol abuse, according to Dan Bennet, the representative of the police department of Vasil.
18 States in Colombia support the challenges of the new asylum policy
Eighty states and the region of Colombia support the legal dispute of a new policy of the United States that prohibits the granting of asylum to refugees or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, 18 representatives of states and districts gave a panel of experts to Washington on the support of the asylum seeker in dispute policy on Friday.
The full name of the search for Grace against Sessions, provided by the American Union of Civil Liberties in August against federal policy, is not published.
The woman claims that her civil husband “and his sons in the criminal group” have been subjected to ill-treatment, but on 20 July United States officials rejected her request for asylum.
She was detained in Texas.
Lawyers of the States that support Grace say that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala make a large number of requests for asylum in the United States, such as countries facing widespread problems with criminal groups and domestic violence.
The new policy of the United States with regard to asylum was rejected by the Immigration Appeals Council in 2014, which allowed immigrants without documents of domestic violence to make a declaration of asylum.
In his statement on Friday, the Attorney-General of Colombia, Carl Rosin, stated that the new policy “ ignores the decades of the application of public, federal and international law”.
“Federal law requires that all requests for asylum be considered on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the search, and that prohibition violates this principle,” the court consultant said.
Lawyers also claim that policies prohibiting immigrants from entering the United States are damaging the economy, stressing that this category of citizens is more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provides the necessary labour force”.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Seshns issued an order for immigration judges to no longer provide asylum for victims of domestic or Bandit violence.
“Eviction will be granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political belief,” said Seans in his statement of 11 June.
This tool has never been designed to solve absolutely all the problems, even the most serious people face every day in the world.
Desperate efforts to save people in Paul: the number of people who have died has doubled in search of survivors
The situation has become increasingly difficult for survivors.
“It’s very difficult right now,” said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, comforting her sick child at the center of the city of Paula.
“Every minute soon help will bring the wounded.
Clean water in large deficits."
The inhabitants return to their destroyed homes, dig in the dark and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and patients affected by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, including Dvi Harris, who had been beaten by the bell and the bell, had to rest outside the army hospital, where patients had been treated in open air because they had to leave the room because of continued strong waves.
He weeps, remembering how a violent earthquake destroyed the number in the room on the fifth floor that he had taken with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for salvation.
I think I was impressed by the walls, ” says Harris Associated Press, explaining that his family had come to the wedding.
“I heard my wife calling, asking for help, and then came in silence.
I don't know what happened to her and our baby.
I hope they will be saved, and I hope they will be all right."
The Ambassador of the United States charges China with “adjugation” carried out through “propagandistic advertising”
A week after one of the official Chinese newspapers published a daily publication of a statement on four pages on the benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US Ambassador of China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
In the past, U.S. President Donald Tramp referred to a payment supplement to Des Moines Register China Daily, the largest commercial newspaper in the state of Iowa, with accusations from China in an attempt to participate in the elections at the United States Congress on 6 November, which China rejected.
The Trampa claim that Beijing is trying to participate in the US election is a confirmation of the fact that US officials informed Reuters: a new phase is being held in the strengthening Washington Press campaign in China.
While it is normal for foreign Governments to place commercial promotion advertising, Beijing and Washington are currently in a position to scale trade wars, resulting in a comparison of import tariffs for their countries.
China's response tariffs in the beginning of the war had the task of defeating exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of the Trip, had been declared by Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, Ambassador of the United States to China and former former governor of Iowa, the major exporter of agricultural products in China, claims that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an article published in the resurrected Des Moines Register, “now doubles this tragedy by placing a propaganda advertising in our own free press”.
“By spreading its propaganda, the Government of China is benefiting our hearts from the American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, paying and placing advertising in Des Moines Register,” says Branstad.
“However, in the newspapers here, on the streets of Beijing, you will hardly hear strange voices and you will not see the real variety of views that the Chinese might be aware of, as local media are under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he writes.
He also added that one of the most famous Chinese newspapers had “opened” from the proposal to publish its article, although it did not bring the exact name of the publication.
Analyticals warn that, by contrast, the Republican Republicans are preventing women voters from threatening the interim period
Many high-ranking Republicans prefer to remain on the side and protect the candidate of Supreme Judge Bret Cavano, despite several statements of sexual violence, and analysts warn that there is a negative reaction, particularly from women who may be affected by the forthcoming interim elections.
The emotions surrounding the situation had spread to an end, and most Republicans had officially declared that they wanted to continue voting.
I can’t go back to such things, says Grant Reyer, professor of politics at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, in his article published on Saturday.
It is doubtful that the efforts of Senator Jeff Fleek (R-Arizona) to conduct an FBR investigation in the last minute will be sufficient to satisfy the disappointed voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget about this tomorrow or November," said Karin Jan-Pier, senior adviser and national representative of the progressive movementOn Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestors scheduled "Noble forwards!" against Senat, when the Republicans under the supervision of the Judicial Committee decided to apply to Cavano, despite Dr. Christine Blaysy Ford, told Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond the framework," said politicalist Stu Rottenberg on the news site.
“People say that the situation has already been strong enough, and that is the truth.
But things can get worse, especially in the case of female voters in the courts and young voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although not pleased with the president, often do not vote.”
Before the Forum had publicly testified against the candidate for the Supreme Judge, accusing him of sexual harassment, analysts had assumed that if the Republicans confirmed the move, this could be a response.
“This is already an irregular matter for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steel, former Chairman of the National Committee of the Republican Republican in the beginning of last week, as reported by NBC News.
“Not only is it about the vote on the committee or the final vote or whether Kawano is on the ground of suspects, but also about how the Republicans deal with how they relate to it,” says Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to choose Democrats, a news channel.
Nevertheless, the Americans seem to have split up a few of them on the issue of who they are to believe — Ford or Cavano — and they seem to be getting closer to the last.
A new survey of YouGov shows that 41 per cent of respondents believe in the Forum exactly or almost at least, while 35 per cent said that they believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 per cent believe that Kavano was almost entirely or partly silent at the time of his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same about the Forum.
Flyka FBR is currently investigating the charges made by the Forum and at least another prosecutor, Deboro Ramires, reports The Guardian.
Last week, the Forum under oath had testified to the Senate's Legal Committee that Cavano, in a state of oppression, attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate at the Supreme Judge's post showed her his birthday at the school at the University of Jells in the 1980s.
World Cup Designer Plans to Launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Ley, the founder of the World Heritage site, runs a launch that calls for competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is a company based on the open platform of Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people to access.
In an exclusive interview, Fast Company Berners-Lei said that the Inrupt objective was to obtain “peace”.
“We must do this now,” he says about his start.
"It's a historic moment."
The annex uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own “identity online data storage” or POD.
It may contain lists of contacts, cases, as well as calendars, music library and other personal and professional data tools.
The application works on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify — everything can be used in one browser and at the same time.
The uniqueity of personal data online storage is that it is fully managed by a user who can access any necessary information.
The company calls this principle “a personal increase in rights and opportunities through data”.
According to the Director-General of John Bruce, Inrupt is the idea that the company has provided resources, processes and relevant skills to make Solid accessible to all.
At present, Berners-Lei, Bruce, is a safety platform purchased by IBM, a number of state developers with whom a project contract has been concluded, and a community of programmers and volunteers.
Since this week, technology developers around the world have been able to create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Ley said that he and his team would not negotiate with Facebook and Google on whether his company should make the cardinal changes, resulting in the total change in all their business models.
“We do not ask their permission.”
In his post on the Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lei wrote that “Mission Inrupt — to provide commercial energy and ecosystem for the protection of the integrity and quality of the new solid network”.
In 1994, Berners-Ley converted the Internet and established a World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, the voice of Berners-Lie has been quite powerful in the debate on neutrality in the network.
Even at the start of Inrupt, Berners-Ley will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Institute of Open Data.
“I am incredibly optimistic about the next Internet era,” says Berners-Lie.
Bernard Vann: Church servant who was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I
In the history of the English Church, only one priest-war had won the Victoria Cross during World War I, and this event was noted in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel Prefect Bernard Vann was rewarded with this award on 29 September 1918 for his participation in the attack on Bellengles and Leukor.
Unfortunately, he was killed four days later by a shooter, so he never realized that he had received a British military prize.
A memorial in honour of this event was made public by his two grandsons at the council in Rushden, Nortgemptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said that it was “so symbolic” that the memorial was opened 100 years after his grandfather received a prize.
According to the London newspaper of 29 September 1918, Colonel Van has conducted his battalion through the San Cantene Canton Canal “in a very harsh and intense fire of field weapons and ammunition”.
He later jumped into the fire line and led the group forward with the “largest shield” and then one hand blew a field rifle, killing three soldiers in the unit.
Colonel Van was killed by a German shooter on October 4, 1918 — almost a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old grandson of Henry Michael Van said that “he could hardly do the same heroic, but that would be humiliating.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also set up a vein at the end of the council led by the Imperial Youth Orchestra, Brandwood.
Michael Vann said that “it is a great honor to take part in the Council” and added that “the well-being of the real hero is confirmed by the support that will be given to many people”.
The MMA volunteers didn't sleep all night to see Bellator 206, but instead they showed them the peppu pig.
Imagine that you didn't sleep all night to see the full Bellator 206, but you didn't see the main event.
The San José table contained 13 wars, including six major programmes, which spent all night in direct epheria on 5 British television channels.
At six o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mossi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the meeting, British patients were shocked to see the "Swink Peppa" screen.
Some patients did not realize this because they did not sleep until tomorrow just to see the war.
One of the worshippers in Twitter called this change in the children's multifilm “some painful joke”.
“The government ruled that the content was inappropriate for 6 hours in the morning, so they had to switch to children’s programmes,” said Dave Schwarz, senior vice-president of Bellator on marketing and communications when asked why this had happened.
"Yes, "Sinka Peppa."
The president of Bellator Scott Kocker said they were planning to draw up a schedule so that they could also see viewers from Britain in the future.
“As for the re-examination, I think we can solve this issue,” says Koker.
“But the resurrection is six hours in the morning, and we cannot resolve this matter until the resurrection of our time, and it will be Monday for them.
But we'll do the best we can.
Believe me, when the message has changed, the dog of text messages has disappeared, and all of them have been far from friendly.
We were trying to solve this problem right away, thinking it was a technical problem.
It seemed that this was a matter of public importance.
I promise that this will not happen exactly the next time.
We're going to reduce the number of wars to five instead of six, as we usually do, and we're trying to increase this number for fans, but we've got a change.
Yes, it has.’
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily experienced a feeling of worthlessness because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic Dwarf Tom Daily says he's grown up feeling worse because of his sexuality, but that's what motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old athlete said that he did not understand that “not all like him” until he went to high school.
Speaking in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, named Lauren Lavern, he said that he was referring to the rights of gays to give others hope.
He also said that the Olympic victory became less concerned with him after his childhood.
The regular multi-year-old director of Kirsty Young's illness took a few months' leave.
Daily, speaking as the main guest in Laverna's programme, said that he felt “more worthless than any of the witnesses” because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, both for boys and girls.”
He says, “These feelings have been completely real to me, but they have strengthened me, and I have been able to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something meant” not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic medalist became a well-known LGBT activist and, in his speech at the Society's Games in Australia this year, called on countries to criminalize homosexuality.
He said that he expressed his opinion because he believed that he could live an open life without consequences and wanted to give others a “hope”.
The three-time World Championship said that the feelings of a man, American director Dustin Lansa Black, with whom he met in 2013, “were his shocks.”
Last year, Dale married Oscar, who is 20 years old, but claims that the difference in age has never been a problem.
“If everything happens in your life at such a young age, ” he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died from cancer three years later, “it is hard to find a relative who would have the same hearty opposite life experience.
The couple became parents in June, they had a son, named Robert Ray Black-Dilly, and Dale said that "all his world life" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it would be all about "I need to win a gold medal," said the athlete.
"But you know, there's more and more gold olympic medals.
My Olympic gold medal is my Lord."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daily told him that his father did not want to rest from his death, and one of his last requests was the first tickets to the London 2012 meeting.
"I couldn't say to him, 'Dad, you're not going to be a couple anymore, and you can't sit there for the first time,' she says.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped studying, and only when he actually stopped studying, I finally realized that he was not a winner,” said the athlete.
The following year, Dale took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
“I just knew that this was what I had hoped for all my life — to throw in front of a crowd of Olympic players, it wasn’t a better feeling, ” he says.
It also inspired him to choose the first favorite song, Proud by Heather Small, which helped him prepare for the Olympics and to this day.
Desert Island Discs, BBC Radio 4, Wednesday, 11:15 in English summer.
Michaelson, who's not in shape, has been doing this Saturday, Kubka Rader on the floor.
American Phil Michaelson will set up a record on the resurrection, playing his 47th Kubka Ryder, but he will have to take the form in order to avoid the unpleasant past.
Michaelson, who played in the binary on the 12th time of record, was sent to Captain Jim Furic on a scale on Saturday for four swords and four.
Instead of being at the center of events, as was often in the United States, the five-fold major winner divided his day between watching the game and working on his own game in the field, hoping to correct what concerns him.
Never had the most direct hit, even at the top of his 48-year-old career, a sportsman was not an ideal candidate for the Le Golf National strike, where long-term rap is usually punished for minor injuries.
And if the course itself is not scary enough, Michaelson will meet with the exact British Open French Molinary champion, who joined the newsman Tommy Fletwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who lost four eyes in 12 single matches make a bright start, Michaelson's match may be decisive.
Felix expressed confidence in his partner, even though he could still say.
“He fully understood the role he had on him today, hid me behind his back, covered me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” he commented.
"He is sure enough to believe in himself.
He's going to the Hall of Glory, and he did so much for these orders and last week.
I probably didn't think he was playing two matches.
I was hoping for more, but that's how it was, and that's how we decided to go.
He wants to be there with everyone."
On the resurrection day, Michaelson won the Nick Foldo record for the number of mothers in Kubke Ryder.
This can be seen as the end of the career in Kubke Rader, which never met the heights of his individual record.
Michaelson had 18 victories, 20 injuries and seven injuries, although Felix said that his presence had brought little benefit to the team.
“He is fun, sarcastic, sad, he likes to impress people, and he's a great guy who's interested in it,” he explained.
“I think that this week the young toys have enjoyed it, and that was interesting to see.
His game is much more than just a game.”
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bourne, knows that a great advantage can soon be lost
Thomas Bourne, the captain of the European team, knows from his experience that significant leadership at the unique level in Cuba Rayder can easily turn into a disadvantage.
In March 1997, the Datchan detached in Valderram, where a team headed by the North Ballesteros, had the advantage of five eyes above the Americans, but only a few minutes ahead of the slightest difference, won with the account of 141 /2-131/2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage in Valderram; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram where we won, but only until now,” said Bourne, printed on the photo, following a review of the 2018 class, who won the Le Golf National field with account 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday, as a result of the 10-6.
So history will prove to me and the whole team that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow you'll be full.
Go and do the right thing.
Until the eyes on the table have been shown, nothing has yet been finished.
We have a goal, and that's a chance to win the trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I did not hesitate to focus on the 12 games of our team, but we know so well what we are against – the biggest games in the world.”
He added: “I would never take it for myself.
We'll have another test tomorrow.
In the morning, individual statements are being made, and this is already another case.
It's always nice to be with a partner when things are going well, but when you're alone, you're trying your best at the professional golf course.
That is what it takes to encourage the players to get full tomorrow.
Now the partner remains behind, and he must also apply all his efforts.”
Unlike Bourne, his opponent, Jim Felix, believes that his individual game will be better than his partners, except Jordan Sparta and Justin Thomas, who took three of the four eyes.
He spent all of this in the last few days, became part of the winner's team in Brooklyn before he finally lost his mind when Europe was performing a miracle in Medin.
“I remember every detail of this,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Krenshaw, the captain in 1999, played his games before the last day.
“We have 12 important mothers tomorrow, but you would like to finish all of this earlier in Brooklyn like in Medin.
When the initiative is moving on one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the average.
We have established our plan for the game, and have made the children as we thought proper, and tomorrow we are trying to create a miracle."
Tomasu had the task of trying to lead the opposition by meeting Rory McKilro in a ball match with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ramom, Tommy Fletwood and Ayjan Polter, as well as other European games from the top of the tournament table.
“I have chosen such a group of guys, and so on, because I believe that they will thus overcome all possible shortcomings,” Bourne said, commenting on his choice of individual players.
The introduction of a new German military vessel has been renewed
The new flag of the German fleet had to be introduced into operation in 2014 to replace the old warships of the cold war era, but this would not occur at least in the next year due to the unjust systems and the cost-effective increase, local media reported.
The introduction of the Reinland-Pfaltz operation, the main ship, completes a new class of Baden-Würtemberg, which is now under way until the first half of 2019, reports the newspaper Die Zeit with a reference to the military representative.
The fleet had to be joined in 2014, but the problems that had arisen after the delivery had made it difficult to judge the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wurtemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be replaced by the old Bramen class frigates.
They will, of course, have a powerful rifle, a multitude of Zenite and Anti-Croatian rockets, as well as some steel technologies, such as reduced radiological, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important characteristics include longer periods of service, which should be possible for the deployment of new brakes for up to two years from home ports.
However, the permanent withdrawal of entry into operation means that the most modern military vessels, as they say, allow Germany to expand its foreign power, are already advancing to the time when they enter arms, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 strike broke into the headlines last year when the German warship officially refused to enter the operation of the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss summit in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned to the ship’s crew after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media referred to a number of critical “programme and equipment defects” that made the warship useless.
The lack of software was particularly critical, as the Baden-Wurtemberg court would operate with a crew of about 120 seafarers — only half of the working force on the old brakes of the Bremen class.
In addition, it was found that the ship was too heavy to reduce its productivity and limited the capacity of the IMF to implement innovations in the future.
It is believed that the 7000-tonnes Rhineland Pfaltz were twice as heavy as ships of the same class as Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the incorrect equipment, the value of the whole project, including the training of the team, is also a problem.
It is said that it reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion) compared to the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of detention on which new frigates become particularly important in the light of recent threats to the reduction of German military and maritime power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartles, head of the German Parliament Committee on Defence, acknowledged that the military and marine forces had indeed “encouraged the stock of ships capable of deployment”.
The officer said that the problem had been resolved over time because the old ships had been driven out of operation, but their ships had not been provided for.
He visited that none of Baden-Wurtemberg's frugals could be taken on the fleet.
National Trust listens to the secret life of flying mice
A new study carried out in one of Scotland's mountains aims to show how flies use landchaft in search of food.
It should be hoped that the data received will allow for a renewed view of the conduct of unique clarinets and will assist in further conservation activities.
In a study organized by the National Fund of Scotland, traditional neoplasms, soprano-sopranos, as well as Korean long-lasting flies of mice and dobantons will be studied by the Inverwe Gardens, West Ross.
Special registries will be established in some areas around the place to monitor the operations of flying mice throughout the season.
NHS and volunteer staff will also conduct mobile field surveys using manual detectors.
The expert audio analysis of all records will determine the frequency of calls and the types of activities that various groups of these animals are responsible for.
Then a housing map will be drawn up and a report will be prepared to create a detailed picture of their behaviour in the landscape.
Rob Duar, NTSC conservation consultant, hopes that these results will show which habitats are most important for flying mice and how they are used in each species.
This information will help to determine the main directions for the management of the habitat, such as the formation of lumbars, as well as the maintenance of forest masses, optimal for flying mice and other related species.
The population of flying mice in Scotland and throughout Britain has decreased significantly in the past century.
They are at risk of disappearance due to construction and development, which affect their housing and the loss of the habitat.
Air turbines and lighting facilities may pose a danger, as well as a washing machine for the dust, chemical processing of building materials and cleaning of household boilers.
In fact, the mouse is not blind.
However, their nightly appetites are such that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching.
They use a complex echo-location technique to determine exactly the obstacles to flight.
NTSC, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is very serious about the population of flying mice.
Ten trained experts are working in the organization, regularly conducting surveys, exit checks, and sometimes rescue work.
The organization even established the first and only reserve of flying mice in Scotland instead of Thrive in Dampris and Gallowe, where eight of the 10 species of Scottish flying mice live.
David Thompson, manager of insolvency, says that property is an ideal territory for them.
“There, in Threadeve, is a great place for flying mice,” he says.
“There are old buildings, many old trees and all the elements of a good living environment.
But many of the flying mice remain unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to understand better what they need for the well-being."
He recalled the importance of checking the presence of flying mice before technical services are carried out within private authorities, as the unintended destruction of one nest could lead to the death of up to 400 singles and young persons, and possibly even to the destruction of the entire local population.
The flies are protected by law, their destruction, damage or destruction of their habitat is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish Office for the Conservation of Birds, calls for assistance to the public.
She said, "We have yet to know more about our bones. We do not know how many of them are in a single state."
Ronalda rejected the charges of rape and his lawyers were going to be brought to court in German journals
Cristian Ronalda rejected the charges against him in rape, calling them “female news”, and claiming that people simply “want to self” using his name.
His lawyers are going to be brought before the court at the German newsmagazine Spigel, who has published accusations against footballist.
Forvard Portugal and Juventus were accused of rape by the Americans on behalf of Catherine Mayorga, who had a place in the Las Vegas hospital number in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to talk about the incident, reported on Spigel Friday.
In a video in Instagram, in which 142 million subscribers were registered after a few hours after reporting charges, 33-year-old Ronaldo referred to this information as “female news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is all this fictional news, says the five-time winner of Ballon d'Or on the camera.
“They just want to get lost using my name.
That's okay.
They want to be marked by my name, but it's just part of their work.
I am a happy man, and everything is great for me. ”
Ronaldo's lawyers are prepared to appeal to the Spigel court for charges they have called “unliquidative information on confidentiality issues”, according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Sherc stated that the game was intended to require compensation for “a moral damage in proportion to the seriousness of the legal violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
On meeting in the night club, Ronalda and Mayorga returned to the playroom, where he supposedly raped her in an annal form, according to the documents given to the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell in front of her on his knees and told her that he was “99 per cent good boy, but he was one per cent injured”.
The documents state that Ronalda has confirmed that the couple were engaged in sex, but that was in mutual agreement.
Majorga also claims that she turned to the police and that the hospital had photos of her trauma, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial solution because she felt “fear that they would torture her” and was afraid of“ public humiliation”.
The 34-year-old woman said that she was now trying to change the place of residence as she continued to experience the trauma caused by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was going to join the Royal Madrid from Manchester, United States, during the anticipated attack, but this summer he moved to the Italian giant Jewess for 100 million euros.
Brexit: United Kingdom “approachs of automobile manufacturers who have always been lost”
Minister for Business and Enterprise Greg Clark stated that Britain “will always regret it” if Brexit loses his world leader in the production of cars.
He also commented on the fact that Toyota UK reported to the BBC that, if Britain comes out of the EU without trade, it will temporarily cease its production in Bernaston, not far from Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer stated that the effects of the border delays in the absence of Brexit could result in loss of jobs.
In Bern, Toyota Auris and Avenis were produced and released almost 150,000 cars last year, 90 per cent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I think that if Britain comes out of the EU by the end of March, the production will be stopped at our place of work,” says Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in Britain expressed concern about EU exit without international trade agreement, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims to close the Mini factory in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main fears are that, according to automobile manufacturers, in the absence of Brexit supply chains will be put at high risk.
The Toyota production line shall be launched “at the exact time” and details for vehicles prepared on demand shall be submitted to suppliers in Britain and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom comes out of the EU on 29 March without trade, there may be concerns which, according to the representatives of the industry, may lead to delays and lack of interest.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to store stocks on its premises in Derbyshire for more than one day, and therefore the production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that the Tereza May plan, drawn up in the Czechs, on future relations with the EU “was precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks”.
“We need a deal: we want to conclude a better agreement, which will allow me to repeat, not only to achieve success now, but also to use this opportunity in the future,” he told BBC Radio 4 in the Effair of Today’s Programme.
“Not only Toyota, but also other producers claim that we must be absolutely able to continue the successful supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to clarify the duration of the production, but in a longer-term perspective, it had warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the profession and would ultimately lead to a reduction of jobs.
Peter Cavallaris, who has worked in Bernaston for 24 years, who is the head of the trade union, says that the concern of the members of the organization is growing: “In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we can no longer return them.”
The representative of the Government said: “We have developed a precise and reliable plan of our future relations with the EU”.
The Trampa meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed once again, according to information from the White House
The responsible meeting of Donald Trampa with the Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rod Rosenstein may be “traveled next week”, as the battle for Brett Cavano's candidate continues as the Supreme Judge, the White House said on Wednesday.
Rosenstein is investigating the work of Special Adviser Robert Muller, who will investigate Russia's involvement in the elections, the relationship between Trampa and Russia's assistants and potential obstacles to justice by the President.
If the Deputy Prosecutor General was to be removed from office, thus threatening Muller's independence, there was a mass of incidents in Washington for many months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of a forum to record talks with the tramp and the opportunity of the President with the help of amendment 25.
Rosenstein is investigating this information.
However, on Monday, he went to the White House to get some shoes to take off.
Instead, a meeting with the Trompo was announced on Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Tramp said that he “would not” want to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid contact with the Senate judicial committee, where Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blaise Ford, gave evidence.
On Friday, Tramp was scheduled to conduct a weekly investigation on the FBR complaints in Cavanaugh, which further held a full vote in the Senate.
Press Secretary Trampa, Sarah Sanders, spoke on Fox News on Wednesday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of this meeting has not yet been appointed, perhaps this week, and perhaps it will be postponed for another week, taking into account all other developments in the Supreme Court.”
But let's see, and I always prefer to keep the press in the course."
Some journalists argue that Sanders did not have briefings at the White House on 10 September.
Leader Chris Walles was interested in why.
Sanders says that the lack of briefings is not due to the "disturbation of the community" of television reporters, although she added, "I will not deny that they are playing in public".
It proposed an increase in the number of direct contacts between the tramp and the press.
“The president holds more meetings in response to journalists than any other president before him”, she added, without adding the exact figures: “We have these figures.”
Sanders believed that briefings would continue, but “if the press had the opportunity to direct the question of the President of the United States, it would be much better than talking to me.”
We are trying to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we have held in the last few weeks, and if you can talk directly to the President of the United States, it is a worthy substitute for press briefings."
The tram is regularly responsible for issues arising from the White House, participating in open meetings or press conferences with seniors.
The press conference is a rare one, especially for the press.
The president's odd behaviour in front of the journalists gathered this week in New York may be the answer.
The Minister of Health is addressing EU workers in Scotland with a letter on threats from Brexit
The Minister of Health has called on EU staff working in the Scottish GSP to express appreciation for the country ' s ownership and to wish them to remain in their post after Brexit.
Jean-Friman, MSP, addressed the letter to staff less than six months before the EU's departure from Great Britain.
The Government of Scotland has already undertaken to cover the cost of making statements on the status of EU citizens working in its public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “Over the summer negotiations between Britain and the EU on exit continued, and this step must be taken.
However, the Government of Great Britain is also working to prepare a possible scenario with a lack of transactions.
I know this must be a very anxious time for all of you.
That is why I now want to stress again how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Colleges from all over the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is, of course, your home, and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercromby has been transferred to an emergency operation on head injuries
Michael Organ from Tennessee reported that the Tennesi State Tigers semi-protector Christian Abercromby transferred an extraneous operation to the head injury on Saturday after the defeat of 31-27 in the vanderbilt Commodores battle.
The main trainer in Tennessee, Rod Reid, told journalists that the trauma was received shortly before the interruption.
"He went up to the side line and just moved there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel have given Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before placing it on the back of the arm and carrying it to medical examination.
The official representative of the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombies had been operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are no details about the type/level of trauma, and in Tennessee efforts are being made to explain when the trauma has occurred.
For Abercromby, only on second course, this was the first season in Tennessee City after the transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday, before the event, he successfully caught five matches, which totaled 18 matches per season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher amount of ergonomics when buying real estate in Britain.
In accordance with the new Tori plans, foreign buyers will receive a higher amount of ergonomics when buying real estate in Great Britain, and additional funds will be used to assist homeless people.
This step leads to the net results of Corbin's attempts to attract young voters
The higher collection will be taken from those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The figure expects it to collect up to 120 million pounds per year for homeless people
Foreign buyers will receive a higher harvest in the purchase of real estate in Great Britain, and additional funds will be used to assist homeless people, as Teresa May announced today.
This step results in Corbin's attempt to attract young voters, who promises to make housing more accessible and improve citizens' income.
The increase in the collection will be taken from natural persons and non-tax firms in Britain, and additional funds thus provided should stimulate the Government's efforts to assist homeless people.
The addition to the existing Herb collection, including the increase made two years ago for the acquisition of secondary housing and rent housing, may amount to three per cent.
The figure is expected to allow this step to generate up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the new London real estate is purchased by non-British residents, leading to a rise in prices and making it difficult for buyers to acquire their first home to improve their living conditions.
Many elite areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “city examples” because of the large number of foreign buyers who have bought homes here, most of their time abroad.
The new policy was developed a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the Serbian congregation to help increase the number of young people to acquire their first home.
He accused large construction companies of the price of real estate, purchased land, but not using them, and called on Ms. May to give up the quota for available housing to correct the “sacrifice situation with housing” in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms that would include rent control and the cessation of unreasonably travel.
He also wanted to give local self-government authorities more authority to build new houses.
Ms. Maye stated: “Last year I said that I dedicated my priority to the fulfillment of the British dream — that life would be better with every new generation.
And that, including the solution to our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
Nevertheless, it is unfair that the acquisition of property is available to people who are not British citizens, as well as foreign companies, as well as to British workers.
For too many people, the dream of getting their own home has become too far, and for some, the threat is too real.
Jack Ross: My final goal is to manage Scotland
Boss Sunderland Club Jack Ross says his "final goal" is to become a certain stage of the management of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scottish is satisfied with the restoration of the North-East Club, which is currently the third place in the first league of three eyes.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after returning St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got cup B, and everything," said Ross Sportsound BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up seeing my father in Scotland as a child, and that always attracted me back.
However, this will only occur if I can be a successful club manager.”
The presidents of Rossa, the manager of Sunderland were also Dicka Advocate, David Moies, Sam Heirdez, Martin O'Nil, Roy Kin, Gus Poet and Paolo Di Canio.
Former manager Alloa Athletic says that he did not try to escape such authoritarian names in such large clubs as he had previously rejected the suggestions of Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
“For me success at this moment will depend on whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
According to its structure and capabilities, this club will undoubtedly belong to the Premier League,” says the coach.
“It is not an easy task to bring him there, but I will think that I have done my job only if I can get the club back.”
Ross has been working for three years as a manager and has been in charge of Dumbarton, then for 15 months at Hearts Train Station.
He then helped Allo to get up from the third level, and in the following season, St. Mirren took down his positions in the champion's winner.
Ross claims that today he feels more comfortable than ever in his career at Clyde, Hartplepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It must have been this revolution,” he recalls his work in Alla.
"I sincerely believed that management was more appropriate to me than the game.
That sounds strange because I did everything well, worked well, and achieved certain success.
But the game is harder.
There's a lot of stuff that needs to be done every week.
I'm still under stress at work, but I feel good at the manager's position.
I always wanted to guide, and now, by doing so, I feel the most comfortable fish in the water for the rest of my adult life.”

The summer season has strengthened the sale of British pops, but has reduced sales in restaurants.
According to statistics, the sale of potatoes and bars in July increased by 2.7 per cent and in restaurants by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, from CGA Business Consulting Company, who received this statistics, says: “Sustaining solar activity, as well as longer than expected, the participation of England in the World Championships means that July continued the trend of the previous month, June, when sales in the popes increased by 2.8 per cent, and in restaurants, the opposite was significantly reduced.”
The June fall in the restaurant trade continued to be at 1.8 per cent in July.
The pops and bars selling spirits have shown much higher results compared with restaurants.
Peppers selling only food also suffered from sunburn, although not as strong as restaurants.
It's a feeling that people want to jump out the street just to miss the trigger.
The sale of drinks in beans and bars increased by 6.6 per cent per month and by 3 per cent.’
Paul Newman, an RSM analysis in the field of long-term and hospitality business, says: “These results continue to be the trend we observe since the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sports activities remain key factors when it comes to the sale of goods on the market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to experience difficulties, since sales fall to 4.8 per cent per cent per annum will be particularly painful due to continued price pressure.
The long summer seemed never to be the case for operators working with ice, and not yet the fact that August, which brings more moderate temperatures, gives us so much to expect.”
The overall growth in tobacco and restaurants, including reopened, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowing of branding.

Every fifth child has secret accounts on social networks that he hides from parents.
According to the survey, every fifth child, some 11 years of age, has secret accounts in social networks that he conceals from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the growth of the page “Faeque Institution”
This news has intensified the fear of the content of sex
Twenty per cent of the students said they had a “primary” account that parents knew about
However, every fifth child, some of whom are 11 years of age, creates accounts in cells that are hidden from adults.
The survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of fashion accounts, i.e. Instagram, a photo exchange site.
This news has intensified the fear of sexual content publications.
Twenty per cent of the students claimed that they had a basic, clean account, which had access to their parents, but still had secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally obtained access to the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter, moved there to a youth who called on others to “strengthen him”.
A study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC) showed that 40 per cent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles in total, with half of them recognized as generally secret.
Chapter HMC Mike Bukenen says: “Many teenagers are trying to create online spaces that are not available to their parents and teachers, and that is a disturbing fact.”
Elid Doyle will become the “voice of sportsmen” of the Scottish easy-to-fly athletes
At the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body, Elid Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of the Scottish Light Attraction as a observer member of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland's most titled athletic athlete, and President Jan Bitty claims that this step is an excellent opportunity for those who lead sports to take advantage of the extensive experience of sports at the international level over the last decade.
“Elid is enjoying great respect in the Scottish, British and World Light-Athletic Community, and we are confident that its participation will bring great benefits to the Scottish athletic community,” says Beatty.
Doyle says: “I look forward to becoming the voice of athletes, and I hope that I can really make good contributions and contribute to the development of sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Games in Atlanta, has a total of four gold olympic medals, and is now working as a series of BBC commentators, after the transfer of the insulin, lost the ability to walk.
He says in his Twitter: “I had a stroke last month.
I lost my ability to move.
The doctors said it's only time to show if I'm gonna fix it, and if so, how much.
It was a daunting job, but I was completely cured, learned to walk again, and today I am practicing hunting!
Thank you very much for your support!"
Advertisement of milk intolerance, in which breast-feeding mothers were compared to cows, divided the views of Internet users
The milk-producing company called for disputes on the Internet and published a advertising that compares breast-feeding to breast-feeding.
By placing on the market, as they say, “the first free milk can be placed on the breast”, Elvie published an advertising music video demonstrating the freedom that the new milk cheese provides to breast-feeding mothers.
The four real moms dance in the full-time corner of the corner under a musical track, with the words, "Yes, I'm dancing with my own milk, but you won't see me embarrassed" and "If you didn't notice, it's not wise, it's my chest."
And the mountain -- We have brought it down, and We have given it to its young ones to drink, and We have given it to them to drink.
This advertising role, published on the Facebook page, has raised online disputes.
77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments: the video has received a wide range of responses from viewers, many say that it is a light to the milk industry.
“It is a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and born to produce milk, except that their children take them for a few days after birth," says one user.
Elvie molluscs are dressed directly under the special botulter (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment is, "Of course, it is equally traumatic for both mothers and children.
But why not use them to advertise milk to mothers leaving their children? "
Another user adds: “Reclaim from reality”.
Others, on the other hand, protected the role, and one woman even wrote that the song “is just great. ”
"I think it's a great idea.
If I were deaf, I'd be obliged to buy that.
The heart beat really made me feel like a cow.
Advertisement, of course, is a little confused, but maybe it feels that way.
The generic product” was written by one user.
Another comment is: “The procrastination of mothers who breast-feed (often they do it directly at their workplaces or in toilets) and who, in fact, feel a little "cocks."
It is not a commercial to celebrate or destroy our dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women showed that they were all dancing with these undetected milk sauces that were under bottgalts.
The concept of this advertising campaign is often based on the fact that many pregnant women say that they feel like cows.
In fact, Elvie’s milk intolerance is absolutely unsatisfied, there are no drills or pipes, is freely placed in a laundry room, and it is undetectable, allowing women to move, hold little children and even go out on the street during pregnancy.
Anna Balarin, a partner and early child development specialist of Mother’s company, comments: “Molkootsos Elvie is such a revolutionary product that he deserves a strong and provocative advertising.
By conducting a parallel between women and breast-feeding, we wanted to focus on breast-feeding and all its problems, thereby demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that gives new milk.
It's not the first time Elvie's milk intolerance falls in the headlines.
During the London Sunday morning, the mother of two children appeared on the floor of Martha Jacob's designer, using this product for appointment.
Hundreds of migrant children have safely moved to a palace camp at the border with Texas
The number of detained migrant children has increased sharply, although the number of monthly crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the authorities of the Trapa have made it difficult for children to be placed among the authors.
Most sponsors are usually the same immigrants who do not have documents and are afraid of endangering their residence in the country.
The risk of an increase in June when federal authorities announced that potential contractors and other adult members of their families would be required to provide fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, senior immigration and customs officer, testified at the Congress that the agency had arrested ten persons who had been requested to take care of the remaining unencumbered minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested were not previously convicted.
“About 80 per cent of persons who are either sponsors or members of their families are illegally resident in the country, and a large part of them are foreigners who have committed a crime.
That is why we continue to persecute these people,” said Olbens.
In the words of the staff members, in an effort to speed up the process of child training, the officials introduced new rules that some of them should appear before the court within a month of detention, not within 60 days of the previous.
In order to claim their legal status as a judge on immigration cases, many of them are present on video media rather than on their own.
Those who feel that they have no right to help will be deported quickly.
According to reception workers and information that has appeared in the system in recent months, more children remain in detention than are likely to have been exposed to anxiety or depression, which may lead to the outbreak of violence or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say that these problems are being intensified in larger institutions, such as Toronto, where the signs that the child is experiencing difficulties are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that taking children to court camps without giving them time emotionally to prepare for or invite friends can reduce the burden that many of them are already fighting.
Syria commands the “occupational forces” of the United States, France and Turkey to immediately expel the army
Speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mulam also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war had already taken place in the country for eight years.
Muala, also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were on the Syrian ground illegally, under the suggestion to combat terrorism, and “will be considered accordingly”.
“They must go immediately and without any conditions”, he said to the assembled.
Mualam insists that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions have been expelled from their homes, “the war with terrorism is almost over.”
He said that Damascus would continue to “supply this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories” from terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has deployed around 2000 military personnel in Syria, who are primarily trained and consulted by both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Basar Assad.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 military personnel in the war-abiding country.
In the case of refugees, Mualem said that good conditions had been established for their return and charged “some Western countries” with the spread of irradiation threats, which forced refugees to stay outside the country.
“We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to promote the return of civilians,” he said.
“They policy on what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be helped to recover until the political agreement between Assad and the opposition has been reached.
UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last large scale of the Idlib rebels has created an opportunity for political negotiations to continue.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented a wide-ranging attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia on a province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that this agreement had “a fixed time” and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the Jihadists, including the fighters from the Al-Qaida Front of Nussra, who “will be destroyed”.
UN Ambassador Stefan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new committee will be convened in the near future, consisting of representatives of the Government and opposition to develop a post-constitution constitution for Syria and propose a path to the election.
Mualam expressed the terms of the Syrian Government ' s participation in this committee, stating that the work of the Commission should be limited to “review of the articles of the current Constitution”, and warning of interference.
Why Tramp wins the second time
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will win the election in 2020 if the imputation and scandal do not pre-empt his presidency, and that is what many liberal observers are likely to hope for.
And this will certainly be “the most dramatic end of the presidency for all history”.
There are no signs of blindness at the moment.
From 2014 the premium rates increased by more than two to 1.05 million CNNs and almost three times to 1.6 million MSNBCs.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers compared to 1.7 million years ago, and the MSNBC show "The Rachel Maddow Show" has taken over cable ratings, gathering 3.5 million viewers at night during the main news show.
“It is a fire to which people suffer because it is outside our understanding,” says Nil Ber, director of the ABC drama “The marked survivor”, about a member of the cabinet of ministers who becomes president after the Capitol was destroyed by the attack.
Nell Scowell, a former comedian writer and author, “Only funny: a few unpleasant facts about the discovery of Hollywood boys” suggests another theory.
She recalls how she once went on a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trampa.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "That's because he's funny."
In all of this, there is something precious — a joy.
Of course, unlike the rest of the television-transmitted content, Washington's coherent lines of events can determine the future of the Roo v. Wade and answer questions about the possibility of reunification of immigrant families and the world economy.
The exception is a growth that only privileged observers can afford.
And yet, when you're six hours late, you can see how the expert group is discussing the use of Bob Vodvord's deep background for his book "Stretch", or about Paul Manafort's short of $15,000 from the Straussian skin (redened clothes", according to Washington Post), or a brief description by St. Daniels, we say that Mr. Trampa's anatoms are already outside the framework of normal information.
For example, I've never seen Super Mario before.
“His work is partly to make us feel that the reality of the show is that it's going to hurt you every night,” says Brent Montgomery, Executive Director Wheelhouse Entertainment and Pawn Stars about the changing actor's appearance of the Trampa show and the daily revolutions of the compound (Dr.N.F.L., Kim Chen Yin's celebration).
You can't let yourself miss any episode, or you're hopelessly gone.
When I contacted Mr. Fleis this week, there were 27 degrees of heat in the north coast of Kaway, the sun lit up, but he hid inside his house and watched MSNBC during CNN's entry.
He could not get out of the screen, at least not exactly when it was shown how Brett Cavano would appear before the Senate Legal Committee and decide on the future Supreme Court.
“I remember when we did all these confusing shows, people said, ‘This was the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” said Mr. Fleis.
"Then I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Autsaider money is influenced by the harshest intermediate choices that lead the White House
It is no wonder that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is experiencing the flow of availability through the change in the areas of the Congress, in which two officials participate in the race for the same place.
This restored Pittsburgh area, which has not been changed so recently, supports the democracy, the member of the House of Representatives of the Conor Lamb, which has taken place in another district in the extraordinary elections of the past spring.
Lamb is against another active official, the Republic of China Rotfus, who is currently represented by the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is substantially exceeded by the new 17th century.
The maps were revised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that, as a result of pre-election machines, the old areas had been registered in violation of the Constitution by the Republicans.
The Honca, in the new 17th district, called for a warm discussion on the financing of the campaigns between the financial forces of the main party, the Committee of the Congress of the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (NCRC).
The name Lamba became known in Pennsylvania after a small difference in the number of special elections in March in the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This place has been occupied by the Republicans for more than ten years, and President Donald Tramp has won a round of 20 awards.
Political experts offer little advantage to democracies.
The United States ordered El Salvador to support China, but then withdrew
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing as a negative response to Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Tramp held a warm meeting with President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varello, who was also in Panama until partners had sent the management team of the organization of the Trampa.
The representatives of the Department decided to appeal to the American diplomatic mission leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for “renewed decisions on Taiwan’s non-recognition”, said the press Secretary of the Department of State Hezer Nauert at the beginning of this month.
However, the possibility of punishment was considered only for El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in 2017, including drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed tax sanctions, including the reduction of financial assistance and the target visa restrictions, would be a disease for Central America with its high level of unemployment and murder.
The representatives of North and Central America held a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to be held for the results of a similar meeting that took place last year, which was recognized as a step forward in the efforts to prevent migration in the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior representatives of the Administration had understood that they wanted the conference to continue, and had actually stopped considering El Salvador ' s punishment.
According to the diplomats, the conference was scheduled for mid-October and will be attended by Vice-President Mike Pens to indicate that the administration was truly critical of this meeting.
Three American diplomatic representatives kindly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without having received any further harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debates discussed by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss domestic issues under anonymity.
Their reports also confirm the side analysis of the administration, but also referred to anonymity.
Learn History
The next step could be the communication of Special Adviser Robert Mulller on the possible obstacle to the justice of Mr. Trampa, which is currently very important evidence in public records.
Mr. Muller, according to the report, was also investigating the fact that the Trampa campaign had been negotiated with Russia and its attacks during the previous elections.
If the Congress has changed its position, Mr. Tramp is present before the person responsible for this body, just as he is ready to speak to the voters again, and perhaps eventually to the jury of his colleagues.
But there is a lot of 'if'; I do not mean that the fall of Mr. Trampa is inevitable, as is the fall of his equivalents in Europe.
We are all making a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which is about the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to build a coup and defeat Hitler, and this would have happened if the West had opposed him and supported the Czech army in Munich.
However, we have not done so, and this has allowed us to avoid the coming years of bloodshed.
The course of history is being developed at such points, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerating or halting.
The Americans are experiencing some of these extreme moments right now.
What would we do if Mr. Tramp was killed by the Deputy Attorney General Roda Rosenstein, the man who was controlling Mr. Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to the newspaper, he has proposed a secret record of the President's activities last year and has discussed his inadmissibility to the post.
Mr. Rosenstein contends that The Times data are false.
“How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation about Brett Cavano is not complete or true, or if it is all approved by the Supreme Judge in spite of the trustworthy allegations of sexual harassment and lying?
And above all, will we, in the medium term, vote for the Congress, which will attract Mr. Trampa to responsibility?
If we don't pass these tests properly, this winter is too heavy for democracy.
But I believe that we can go through them with the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew sent to the Osvens by the same Nazi regime that the officials once occupied a house in which I lived many years ago.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, I was forced to burn Sunday candles on the table with a symbol of swastika.
How can I not be optimistic about our future with my family?'

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic in the face of a football club in Venice's Rapids.
The Rangers adopted the Venetian Rapids on Thursday, knowing that the victory over Austrians, after impressing nothing in Spain over the Villarreal at the beginning of this month, will allow them to take strong positions in the G League of Europe.
The trauma of the knee prevented the defender of Gremo Dorrans from first speaking in the season before nothing with account 2:2 against "Vilderreal", but he believes that "Raingers" can use this result as a platform to achieve greater results.
"It was a good time for us because Wilderreal is a good team," said 31-year-old footballist.
"We went to the game, thinking we could get something, and we went with nothing.
Perhaps at the end of the day, we were able to deal with it, but nothing was probably the right result.
They probably played better in the first team, and our success came to the second team where we were better.
This Thursday is another big European night.
I hope we can get three glasses, but this will be a tough game because they showed good results in their last game, but I am sure that we can move forward and get positive results.
The past year has certainly been difficult, taking into account all my injuries and replacements in the club, but now there is a good factor in this place.
The composition is beautifully improved, and children are really satisfied with this; training has gone on to the "hour".
I hope we can move forward, leave behind the previous season and succeed."
Women lose sleep because of fear of their pensions
Despite having a clear picture of how they wanted to be concerned, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the national study said that they had discussed with their wives the value of long-term care.
However, only 10% said they were talking to their children on this subject.
“People want them to be concerned about someone in the family, but they don’t try to discuss it with them,” says Holly Snaider, Vice-President of the Nationwide.
And that's what we have to do.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for the day when they will probably have to worry about you if you do not have your best interests first.
Discuss with your consultant and family, where and how you will get medical help, as this choice may be an important factor in spending.
Consult with your financial adviser: he will help you to develop a plan to cover these costs.
Your choice of long-term care funding may be covered by a traditional long-term care insurance policy or mixed life insurance policy that will help cover these costs or self-insurance through your own property, provided that you have money.
Bring your legal documents in order: save yourself from legal battalions.
Trust the medical service and appoint a trusted person who will monitor your medical service and monitor that specialists will comply with your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
We also recommend that we consider the possibility of financial reliability.
A trusted person should be selected to help you make financial decisions and monitor the payment of your accounts if you feel inadequate.
Remember, too, that your elderly parent needs immediate medical attention, and he is on his way to the hospital.
In this case, can you provide information on what medicines he is taking and on what allergic he has?
Write all these details in a book so that you can prepare for each case.
Martin adds: “It is important not only to have funds, but also to choose a doctor.”
“What medicines do you take?
Who's gonna take care of your dog?
Build up and write down this plan."

The injuries are not life-threatening, the police are currently looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people were killed as a result of heavy earthquakes and tsunamis in the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, and the number of people killed was expected to grow.
As a result of the exit of communications, rescuers cannot obtain any information from Donggal, the area north of Pala, which is near the earthquake epicenter of 7.5 balls.
In Pala, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of a natural disaster.
Here are some key facts about Paul and Donggal, located on the island of Sulavesi:
Palu, the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of the bridge on the west coast of the island of Sulavesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 (in 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when earthquakes and tsunamis took place.
Donggal is a coastal area within 300 km (180 km) west of the island of Sulavesi.
In 2017 there were 299,200 persons in the Administrative Region of the Minor Province.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basis of the economy of the Province of Central Sulawesi, in particular the coastal region of Donggal.
Nickel production is also important for the province's economy, but mainly focused in Moroval, on the opposite side of the Slavonic.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, over the past 100 years, several times the damages have been caused in Pala and Donggal.
In 1938, tsunamis killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggal.
The tsunamis also occurred in the western part of Donggal in 1996, resulting in nine deaths.
Indonesia is on the Pacific volcano fire and suffers from earthquakes regularly.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Ache, north of Sumatra on 26 December, caused tsunamis in 14 countries, resulting in a death rate of 226,000 people across the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Ache.
2005: The follow-up to the heavy earthquakes was on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Neas, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The earthquake of 6.8 South Java, the most inhabited island of Indonesia, caused tsunamis that hit the southern coast, resulting in the death of some 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred in the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-ball earthquake occurred on one of the Isle of Mantawa in Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 feet [10 m], destroying tens of trees and killing about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake broke out in the area of Pydi-Jia in Achehe, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastating earthquake in 2004 and tsunamis.
The tsunamis did not occur this time, but more than 100 people died as a result of the destruction of buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes have taken place on the tourist island of Lombok, resulting in more than 500 deaths, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists remained in ruins temporarily.
Senior son of Sire Pailin arrested on charges of domestic violence
Trak Pillin, the oldest son of former Governor Alaski and Vice-Candidate in President Sarre Pillin, was arrested on charges of assault.
The 29-year-old Pailin of Basil, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence in a situation where domestic violence occurred and for resistance to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by the police of the state of Alaska.
According to the police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he chose the phone.
According to KTUU, Pailin is in the Mat-Su investigation facility and will be released at $500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when asked if he was guilty, he declared his “expressed innocence”.
The Pailin is threatening the introduction of three minor offences in Class A, which means that it may be deprived of liberty for up to one year and spent at $250,000.
It was also charged with the crime of Class B, which was sentenced to one day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first case when criminal charges against Paelina were brought against him.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Pallin.
His mother, Sarah Pallin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently under consideration by the veteran court of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, with reporting on domestic violence, and with the storage of weapons in the status of alcohol abuse in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her face.
Sarah Pailin was critical of the group of veterans in 2016 after explaining her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his work in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people were killed as a result of earthquakes on the Indonesian island of Sulavesi on Friday.
7.5 volleyballs caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are not working, and the number of victims will grow in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred shortly after the Central Sulawesi, which is located in the northeastern part of the capital of Jakarta, Indonesia.
Social networks feature videotapes with developments.
Hundreds of people were at the beach festival in the city of Paula when the tsunami broke out on the beach.
The federal prosecutor wants to bring the suspect in New York with a rare death sentence
The federal prosecutor in New York was sentenced to death for Saifulo Saipov, suspected of performing the project in New York, resulting in the death of eight people, a rare federal sentence that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
In October of Saipov, 30 years old, they had taken over the truck home Depot to attack the West Side Road in Lower Manhattan by passengers and passengers.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors would have to prove that Saipov had “preciously” killed eight people and “preciously” ships of serious physical harm, according to the notification of his intention to receive the death penalty in the South of New York.
According to the court document, the two charges may be subject to a death sentence.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jurors charged Saipov with 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of cars.
According to the prosecutors, the attack was “very planned and intended”, Saipov carried it out as described as “absolute, cruel and criminal”.
“Syifullo Habibullajevic Saipov caused trauma, damage and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Lora Dekadade, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlie, Erna Ferruchi, Erna Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnukko,” states the report.
Five dead were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years ago, in the South New York area, the prosecutor needed a death penalty.
In September 2009, the accused Halid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but eventually he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
The death penalty for federal cases in New York was last applied in 1953 in relation to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been sentenced to a contract for spying on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Rosenbergi was sentenced to the use of an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the Saipov case documents, Uzbek's uncle has demonstrated that there was no divorce after his attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was glad he did.
According to the accused, Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired to watch the IGIL video on the phone during the attack.
He also requested that the IGIL flag be brought into his hospital room, reported to the police.
He denied his guilt for all 22 points of the conviction.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders on the side of Saipov, said that they were “exploited” by the decision of the prosecutor.
“We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty, not the life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only aggravate the pain of these events for all their participants,” Patton said.
Saipov's protection had previously appealed to the prosecutors with a request not to receive a death penalty.
Member of Parliament of Tori says that NYJEL FARAJ should not be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tori Nigel Faraj conference, the people's army has been “moving the people's army”.
Former leader Ukip said that the policies should “sympathize” Eurosceptics, as one of the members of the Teresa May parliament suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
A member of the Conservative Party, Peter Bown, told a meeting in Birmingham that Britain would already "go" if Mr. Faraj was Secretary Brexit.
However, the problem faced by Ms. May, trying to reconcile its deeply divided lines, is further compounded by the fact that the members of the Tori Party against the EU's exit join in a separate protest against Brexit, which is taking place in the city.
The Prime Minister of all forces is trying to maintain his compromise plan, drawn up in the Czechs in the aftermath of an attack by the Brexit, his opponents and the EU.
The Union insists that she continue to try to deal with Brussels despite the negative reaction and thus let the Eurosceptics and Liberians choose between her package and her "haos".
Mr. Bown said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solikhalla that he wanted to play Chuckers.
He suggested that Mr. Faraja should be held accountable for the negotiations with Brussels.
He said, “If he were responsible, we would have gone away.”
Mr. Wellingboro added: "I will continue to speak for Brexit, but we need to play Chuckers."
Speaking against the EU, he said: "We have not fought in the world wars to be independent.
We want to establish our laws in our country."
Mr. Bown rejected the assumption that the public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British had changed their opinion and wanted to remain completely out of line with reality.”
A member of the party of Tori Andrea Jenkins also made a comment to journalists: “I say, Prime Minister, just listen to people.”
“Checkers is not popular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan, he is also unpopulated among the members of our party and our activists, who are actually pushing the streets and who first choose us.
Please stand by the Czechs and begin to listen to what they say to you."
In her brief address to Ms. May, she added: “The Prime Ministers will remain in their work if they remain faithful to their promises.”
Mr. Faraj said that if policies were to be taken to make a decision at the 2016 referendum, they needed to stop “feeling sick”.
“This is now the issue of trust between us, people, and our political class,” he says.
"They're trying to pass Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "We're not going to let you down."
Turning to the alert crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is at the border of Brexit, to feel down.
“We mobilize the national army of this country, which is our victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become independent, independent and proud of the United Kingdom.”
At that time, Brexit's opponents went through a demonstration on Birmingham and then held a two-hour rally in the city center.
Several activists have mixed up with the “Tori v. Brexit” posters in these exits.
At the opening of the meeting, the member of the Leiborist Party, Lord Adonis, criticized the conservators because of the security problems in the mobile application of their party.
“And these people claim that they can set up Canada's IT and technology plus, for work at borders, for free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
“This is one of the two sides.
The good Brexit does not exist in principle,” he claims.
Warren plans to “extremely study” participation in the presidential run
A member of the United States Parliament, Senator Elizabeth Warren, says that after the November elections, she will “take a good look at the possibility of balloting in the Presidents”.
The Boston Globe reports that a democracy from Massachusetts spoke on Saturday about its future at a mouse meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a member of the presidential criticism of Donald Trampa, was voted in November to re-election against the member of the Republican Party, Jeff Dila, who was co-chaired by the Trampa campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
Discussions are being held that it has the opportunity to post the Trampa in 2020.
On Saturday in Hollyok, she held a regular meeting with the voters; since the beginning of the post, it had already been her 36th meeting with the voters in the form of a rally.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to vote in the president's position.
Warren replied that the time had come for “women to go to Washington to "rest" our corrupt government and that it would require a woman to be up there”.
As a result of Sims' murder, the LSU game was under arrest
The Baton Rouge Police, Louisiana State, announced on Saturday that the suspect in the murder (smoker) of LSU White Sims, who was held on Friday, had been arrested.
At 11:00 p.m. of the press conference, the Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years old.
On Friday, the police department published videotapes with a request to help identify the person who was able to remove the video.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot around South University campus on Friday morning.
“Wide Sims got a shot at the head that ended,” stated the chief of police officer Murphy J. Paul on Saturday.
Wade came in for his friend, and he was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he had been involved in the incident, had a weapon in his possession, and had been shot at Wade Sims.
During his arrest, Simpson did not oppose and was detained under police control in East Baton Rouge.
The young man grew up at 1 m 82 cm in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 players in the last season and picked up 17.4 minutes, 5.6 glasses and 2.9 games.
Gran At Russia: Luis Hamilton is approaching the title of the world champion after the command tactic has given him victory over Sebastian Fettel
Since Walter Botts passed his qualification on Saturday, Luis Hamilton, it has become clear that the Mersedes command tactics play a major role in the race.
With half a dozen Botts was already well-started and practically dependent on Hamilton when it protected his position on the first two rounds, and invited Fettel to attack his teammates.
The party first went to the Pitt. He left Hamilton to stand in the corner of the whole group – the choice that was making the decision.
Mersedes went on foot one round down and then up behind the Fettel, but Hamilton, after some of the rides in the wheelchair, was moved to the point that the Ferrari driver suddenly left the inner space free, risking a double movement to protect the third route.
On the 21st day of his birth, Max Ferstapen began with a series of networks and was at the end of the first round.
Then he walked most of the race, standing on the family tracks, in order to finish it quickly, moving Kimi Reekkonen into fourth place.
As a result, he went to the foot-to-foot at the 44th round, but could not increase the pace of the remaining eight rounds, as the Riekkonen took the fourth place.
The day was difficult because Walter had done fantastic work on the exits and had shown this honor by sharing it with me.
The team has done such an extraordinary work to have a couple of wheels in stock," Gamaliel said.
Premises language of violence
President Donald Tramp criticised Senator Diane Fynstein at a meeting with the voters on Saturday for her claim that she had not published a letter from Christina Blaise Ford, accused of Bretta Cavano, a high-ranking judge, in sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the President did not recall the direct evidence of the Forum's submission to the Senate Legal Committee, saying that what happened in the Senate showed that participants in these events were “low, thin and lying people”.
“The only possible reaction to all of this, and what is happening in the last few days in the Senate, is great, it's anger, evil, madness and lies,” he said.
You will see all of them running away. Then they will say, "No, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Fynstein, did you send the information?
Remember her answer... did you send the information to the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't swear.
Yeah, stop.
No, we, what, what? No, we didn't, we didn't, he added to the senator's internship.
A letter was sent in July with a detailed statement of charges made by the Forum against Cavanaugh, and in early September it was illegally disclosed, but Finstein denied that the flight had taken place in her office.
“I didn’t hide doctor Ford’s approvals, but I didn’t share her information,” said Fünstein to the Committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep this information secret, and I did as she asked.”
However, the manner in which she refused the accusations in the run did not seem to favor the president, who commented on it during the Saturday morning: “What I tell you is that the tongue of the body has given it health.
Maybe she didn't say a word, but the body language was a joke I've ever seen."
While continuing to protect her candidate as a high-ranking judge, whom three women accused of sexual harassment, the President suggested that the democracies used these charges for their own purposes.
“They are definitely trying to return their authority in all available ways.
We observe the scope, the dignity, the dignity, all of them equal to whom they try to move through which they must go to gain power and control," the President quoted Mediaite as saying.
British elite hockey League: Danny Stars 5-3 Belfast Janets
Patrick Duyer shot two balls for "Jiants" in a game against "Dandy"
In the game of Elite hockey League, Dandy Stars was paid for the fifth assault on Belfast Janets, winning the answer match on Saturday with 5-3 for Dandy.
Janets received an early advantage in two rounds thanks to the hits of Patrick Duyer and Francis Boviler.
Mike Sallivan and Jordan Connie raised the household team before Duayer took Jaiants to the lead.
France Bushar compared the Dandy account, which has been confirmed by Lucas Lundwald Nilsen's victory before two rounds.
For the people of Adam Kifa, who had won Dani with account 2:1 at Belfast on Friday evening, this was the third blast in the season of the Elite League.
It was the fourth meeting of the parties in the season when Janets won three previous matches.
The first floor of Dueira came to the fourth minute at 3:35 after Kendall McFolla's main pass with the support of David Rezerford, after which Boviler doubled the advantage of four minutes later.

The Duyer confirmed that Janets took the initiative at the first break when he killed the second floor at the end of the first period.
Hosea was regrouped, and Bushhar again took the account, killing the cave on a number of transfers at 27:37.
Connie and Charles Corcoran were united to help Nilsen to give Danny the opportunity to take the lead at the end of the second period, after which he, together with his team, won, held opponents in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
“Jiants” is currently missing four of the last five matches, being sent to Milton Kains for the next match, which will be held on Friday.
Aeroplanes have died in order to avoid earthquakes by hundreds of people on board the aircraft
The Indonesian aviation inspector was sentenced to death by a hero after he was informed of his death in order to fly with hundreds of passengers safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have died without news as a result of a massive earthquake on the island of Sulavesi on Friday, which caused tsunamis.
Strong underground towers continue to destroy this area, and many of the inhabitants of the city of Paula were under the walls of buildings.
Despite his colleagues being rescued for their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the terrible dispersion of Mutira Cis Al-Jufri Airport, the city of Palo.
He remained on his way to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, then located in the airfield, could safely fly.
Then, when it was shown to him that the tower was torn apart, he turned his back on her.
He ended up in the hospital later.
The representative of Indonesia's aircraft, Johannes Sirait, said that this decision could save hundreds of lives, reports the Australian agency ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to bring him to a large hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, the dissident was dead before the helicopter arrived in Pala.
“We are very sorry for this loss,” he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid that the number of people killed as a result of earthquakes could reach thousands of people, as access to the cities of Donggal, Siggi and Butong were limited, according to information from the disaster relief agencies.
“The number of victims is likely to grow, as a large number of people are still under siege, and many have not been able to choose from there,” says the representative of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The villages, which reached a height of 15 feet [6 m], were abandoned by the city of Paul, where the mass burial of the dead was to take place in the resurrection.
Military and commercial aircraft provide humanitarian assistance in the affected city.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Soon help will bring the victims every minute.
Clean water doesn't catch.
The merchets are scattered all over.’
Jan Helfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross's colleagues will be quick to help survivors, but we do not know that they will stay there.
The tragedy has already taken a lot of serious measures, but it can be much worse."
The Indonesian President, Joe Vidodo, came to Paul on Wednesday, and spoke before the armed forces of the country, in particular, saying: “I ask you all to work day and night to meet all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" tells CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia suffered earthquakes in Lombok, resulting in more than 550 deaths.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that one person has disappeared without news after a plane crash in the harbor
The airline, performing a journey that had suffered a breach in the Pacific Lake of Micronesia, now reports that one person had lost without news, while it was said that all 47 passengers and crew had voluntarily left the trailer.
Air Niugini reports that, as on Saturday, she has no information about a male passenger.
The airline stated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police in an attempt to find the person.
The airline was unable to respond immediately to requests for more detailed information on passengers, such as their age or nationality.
Local sailors helped save other passengers and aircraft after he landed on the water, trying to land on the island of Chuka.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been sent to the hospital.
The airline also reported that six passengers had been hospitalized on Saturday, and they were all in a stable state.
The causes of aviation accidents and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airlines and the U.S.U.S.A. claim that the aircraft has landed in the bay near the airfield.
Some witnesses claim that the aircraft could not land on the airfield.
American passenger Bill Jens says that the plane has gone into the airfield area too low.
"And that's very good," adds Janes.
Janes told him and other passengers were able to get to the emergency exits on the dock, as the water level was on the ground.
He also said that the guards panicked and screamed at the ship, and that he had a slight headache.
The U.S.S. reported that the mariners who rebuilt the surrounding area also contributed to the rescue of the ship, which they carried people to the beach before the plane was loaded some 30 feet (100 feet).
The flight safety data show that in the last two decades of aviation accidents with companies registered in PNG, 111 people have been killed, but none of them had anything to do with Air Niugini.
Analytics on disclosure have shown that women are alive
On Saturday, the charges were raised against the men charged with embezzlement in 2014 by the inhabitants of Mississippi.
The analysis of the Department of Justice of the United States Paul Roullett provided multi-time evidence as an expert in the analysis of the disclosures.
He told the members of the department how he used the phone records to draw up a common picture of the action of 29-year-oldquinton Telis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Roulette said he had received information about the location of these people from several mobile phones; according to that, on that evening, Tellis spent time with Chambers, which was contrary to his previous evidence, reports The Clarion Ledger.
He said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to the data received, his cell phone was near Chambers; when that situation became apparent, the police asked the S.S.A.
In his testimony, Sanford stated that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Sanford if he was telling the truth, claiming that that night he was in Sanford's truck, Sanford said that "that's a lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis said he met Chambers two weeks before her death.
However, according to telephone calls records, they were held only for one week.
Roulette also showed that some time after the death of Chambers Telis removed her text messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
He says, "It's her own life."
Protection should begin with its final arguments on the resurrection.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over later that day.
The High Breed: what is the "known hip hop"?
Trio hip-hoppers are trying to fight the negative attitude of this genre by filling their music with positive content.
The High Breed Group of Bristol claims that the content of the hip hop has changed from significant political and social problems.
The Group wishes to return to its roots and to make the “known” hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently become witnesses of rebirth in Britain, thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
The New York Times brought a family couple to court because of the racist smog
The New York court sentenced a couple to discrimination after receiving a complaint from a woman who complained that she had been “one more black”, which a woman mistakenly sent instead of her husband.
The spouses reject that they are racist, claiming that the request was made with “a purpose of making a loan”.
Linsi Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two children, expressed concern, knowing that the new loan offered by the child care service, Jezreel Morris, was blackmailed when she came to her family on her first day of work in 2016.
"Not so much as a black one," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Fleksman in his husband's view.
Instead of sending a message to her husband, however, she had twice misdirected Mrs. Morris.
Acknowledging her plight, the “confused” Plasco-Flexman fired Morris, stating in his service that the scourge that had happened to the Africans had been doing its work badly, and in general that they were waiting for the Philippines, not the American, reports New York Post.
Morris paid for a day's work and then sent us home to Uber.
Morris is now in court for a family couple and requires compensation for the release of $350 a day for six months, under the terms of a specific oral agreement that, however, has not been concluded by any contract.
"I want them to understand: such things are unacceptable," she said on Friday, adding, "and I know it's discrimination."
The husband disagrees with the charges of racism, and they claim that the release of Morris could be considered a reasonable step because, as she was tried, they could no longer trust her anymore.
“My wife sent her in a message that she really didn’t mean.
She's not growing up.
We are not racially racist," said the husband, Joe Plasco, in the Post.
"But why do you trust your children with whom you have been pregnant, even if they have become pregnant?
Would you trust your newborn child?
That's enough for you."
Calling for “enforcement”, Plasco said that his wife had given birth to a child two months ago and had been in “a very difficult situation”.
“Are you going to persecute a man who is in this state?
Not very kind to you," added a bank employee specializing in investment.
The trial continues, but the public opinion has already delivered its judgment on social networks, accusing couples of unacceptable conduct and logic problems.
The Paddington publishers were afraid that readers would not be able to walk with the speaker, says a new letter
The daughter of Bonda, Karen Yankee, who was born shortly after the publication was adopted, said: “It’s hard to put herself in the place of the first person who reads the book before it was published.
It is a pleasure to know that Paddington has great success."
She also said that her father, before he decided to write a book on pregnancy, had worked by an operator at BBC, and would refuse to publish it with optimism, and added that the 60-year-old jubilee had been “and happy and bitter” because their author had not been there in the past year.
As for Paddington himself, she referred to him as “a very important member of our family”, and that her father was quiet because his staff finally grew in knowledge.
“He was a quiet, humble man,” said his daughter.
"For Paddington was so real to him, and for his father it was almost as if his own child had succeeded: he was proud of them, although he did not really consider this success of his own service.
I think he was referring to the success of Paddington just like that.
Paddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he was always giving the proper bear.”
I was forced to call my dying daughter on the phone.
After the plane crash, her daughter was sent to the Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried to save her life.
“He called regularly and said that it was really bad that something was going on,” said Mrs. Ednan Laperuz.
"Then he called again and said that she would die in the next two minutes, and that we should beg.
I did the same.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications that doctors gave her, enabling her to work, gradually ceased to function by leaving her body.
She died earlier than expected.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that everything was going to end.
I couldn't cry or cry or cry because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to hold my hands firmly."
Finally, Ms. Ednan Laperuz, disappointed at the loss of his daughter, sat down on the plane with other passengers, humble with a huge loss she just had to survive.
“No one in the neighborhood knew what had happened,” she says.
"My head has fallen, I haven't stopped crying.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I experienced this profound feeling of compassion for Nadu.
He needed so much in my love and support.
I know how much he loved her."
Women who have survived the loss of their loved ones prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost close victims of suicide are trying to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey are located on the Welsh Bridge with comforting words and telephone numbers that people can call for support.
Miss Davis Taylor's son was 13 when he was depressed and he was 18 years old.
“I don’t want other parents to test what I’m doing every day,” she says.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lidney, relates that her son was a great fighter and had a poor appetite.
"They all loved his sweetness.
They all said, "When he is cooled, the light will be in his room."
However, before his death, he left his job because he was now living in fear.”
This happened in 2014, and the man who ended up with Tyler found his relative, who was then 11 years old.
Ms. Davis says, "I'm not going to stop fearing that a grave reaction will occur."
Ms. Davis thought of these openings, "because people knew there was someone who could talk to and tell you everything, even if it was your friend.
You can't sit down and talk to people."
Mrs. Hamfries, who has spent many years with Mrs. Davis, lost her husband, Mark, who was 15 years old — not soon after his mother died.
“He did not say that he felt confused, confused, or something like that,” she says.
“For a few days before the birth, we noticed changes in his attitude.
And it was bad in his birth, and he did not even look at children when they discovered their gifts.
She says that his death was a terrible tragedy for them, but they had to go through it, and this incident had upset our family.
It disintegrated her in parts.
But we must continue to live and fight."

Future Bretta Cavano View of the Wall: FBR Starts Research
“I thought that if we could get something like what he asked for — a limited time and amount of research, we could bring at least a little unity,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would "disrupt" on the basis of a growing party's core response.
Why did Mr. Kavano and his Republicans not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Time is the cause of their confusion.
Intermediate elections will take place every five weeks, 6 November, and if, as expected, everything will go badly for the Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the person they want and elect him as the highest judge in the country.
George W. Bush will call on the senators, with the support of Mr. Kavano, who has been working in the White House for Mr. Bush, and who has met Bush with his future wife Ashley, who was then working as Secretary-General.
What happens after the FBI finds its report?
A vote will take place at the Senate, which is currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavano would be able to obtain 50 votes to the Senate meeting, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pens to resolve the problem of equality of votes and confirm his candidate for the position of the Supreme Judge.
The number of refugees from North Korea has decreased in Kim
Since Kim Chen Yin has come to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has been reduced, the South Korean legislator has said.
Again, Ben Seug, referring to the Ministry of the South, stated that the figure was reduced to 1127 over the previous year, compared with the 2706 refugee cases in 2011.
Mr. Pak said that the key factors had increased border control between North Korea and China, as well as the higher rates taken by smugglers exporting people.
The phinian of public comments does not give.
The overwhelming majority of North Korean refugees are eventually offered the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul claims that, since the end of the Korean war in 1953, over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most people run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the confidently protected demilitarized zone between the two Korea.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often places them under forced repatriation.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still in the state of war, have improved significantly over the past months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of two countries met in Beijing to resume the negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This occurred after the June historic meeting of Presidents Donald Trampa and Kim Chen Yin in Singapore, where they reached common agreements on the disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Riy Yun Ho, accused the United States of withholding its sanctions.
“If we do not have a little confidence in the United States, we will also lack confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we cannot begin disarmament in a unilateral manner,” said Mr. Rey in his statement to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Cavano "issterical", and claims he does not qualify for work in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives of Nancy Pelosi called Bretta Cavano, a candidate at the Supreme Judge's post, “sister” and said that he was not qualified for work in the Supreme Court due to his temper.
Pelosi made this comment in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t imagine that if a woman had ever allowed herself to behave like this, she would immediately be called a "stitch," says Pelosi about her reaction to Kavano's statement to the Legal Committee of Sena, given to her on Thursday.
Cavano emotionally rejected Dr. Christine Blaise Ford's accusation of sexual harassment, which the couple were in when they were both teenagers.
Cavano spoke emotionally enough, even when he was depressed on occasion, and he was excited to talk about his family and school years.
He also strongly condemned the Committee's democracies, calling it “the gross and clearly planned murder of an active person”, organized by liberals, who were accused of having lost Hillary Clinton's presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi also said that, in her opinion, Cavano had only confirmed that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he had a prelude to democracy.
“I think he is disqualifying himself with his beliefs, as well as with the way he refers to Clinton and Democrats,” she says.
Pelosi was upset when she was asked if she was trying to get to Cavano's responsibility if his fault was confirmed and if the Democrats were to receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so: if he does not speak the truth of Congress or the FBI, he will not only stand for the Supreme Court but also for the court where he is now," said Pelosi.
Cavano is currently the judge of the District Appeal Court D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a democracy, she was concerned by the possible decisions of the Cavanaugh Medical Services Act or "Roo v. Wade", since she was considered a representative of conservative justice.
At the hearings of his candidate, Cavano had raised the question of whether he would reject some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for us to let a man of truth and wisdom stand before the Supreme Judge, and when he calls out, 'How great!"' says Pelosi.
And women should be able to do that.
It's fair anger, months and years of light, she can't go through it without a smile.
"When we're wrong, we're crying," said Mrs. Stein 45 down.
"I don't think that's so unusual, what do you think?"
She said, "A woman who has worked in a position of guidance has helped me very much, and she has told me that she cried too when she was in trouble, but has developed a technique which she has explained to her companion: 'You may think I am crying because I am upset.
In fact, I'm upset."
And then she just kept talking.
I've been impressed by this approach."
The tears are permitted as a source of anger, partly because they are treated unjustly in the root.
One of my most painful memories of my first job in the office where men dominated me was that I once cried out of anger, but I realized the power of the woman's stomach, the airless manager that I was always afraid of, and that led me to a wooden cell.
"Never let them see how you weep," she said to me.
They do not know that you are crying for evil.
They think you have broken up, and they rejoice, and they think that they have brought you the end.’
Patricia Schreder, then a Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential elections.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught up in an inconsistencies and left the race, Mrs. Shreder, deeply disappointed, decided that there were no reasons why she could not vote for the president.
“This decision was not to be considered,” she admitted with a smile 30 years later.
“Seven other candidates were already in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called that "Belson and seven evils."
The campaign had already reached its end, it had given up much of its resources, and therefore it claimed that it would not participate in the race unless it had collected $2 million.
It was said that it was a completely missed option.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave her $1,000 to men, offered her only 250.
“And what do they have in store for?”; she wondered.
When she said that she would not conduct an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions — thanks to the people who supported her, disappointed by the system that made it so difficult to collect money and access to voters, as well as anger over discrimination on the grounds of sex.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” recalled Ms. Shreder about how the press responded to her.
"It could have been thought that Kleneex was my corporate sponsor.
I still thought, "What do they write on my memory?"
"It doesn't end up screaming?"
How a trade war with America can be useful for Beijing
Experts believe that the first outbreaks of the US-China trade war have been disgusting, and although the fight is still far from over, the gap between countries can benefit Beijing in a long-term perspective.
Donald Tramp, President of the United States, made the first warning at the beginning of this year by imposing the basic Chinese export goods, including solar batteries, steel and aluminium.
The most significant auction took place this week when new tariffs affected goods of $200 billion (150 billion), actually taxing half of all goods coming from the United States of China.
Beijing has each reported an equal number of deaths, recently establishing US$60 billion in sales of five to ten per cent.
China promised that responses to the United States would always be balanced, and the second on the scale of the world economy would hardly begin to test the smaller difficulties in the near future.
Leaving Washington to quit means to sign the demands, but to make the United States public would be too careful for Si Zingpin, President of China.
However, experts believe that, if Beijing can properly play its cards, the US-led trade war may provide long-term support to China, reducing the interdependence of two economies.
“The rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that can lead to economic collapse in any of these countries, in fact, far more dangerous than previously recognized by observers,” says Ebigel Grace, a researcher at the Center for New American Security, specializing in Asia.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that Syria was “ready” to return refugees
Syria states that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking assistance in the restoration of a country that has been left out of war for more than seven years.
Speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mulam reported that conditions in the country had improved.
“Today the situation on the ground has become more stable and safe thanks to the success of counter-terrorism”, he said.
The Government continues to restore the destroyed terrorists of the region so that people can live there peacefully.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives are being created.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
More than six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mulam said that the Syrian regime would be grateful for assistance in the restoration of the country of destruction.
But he stressed that the country would not accept assistance under any circumstances or assistance from countries that were sponsoring terrorism.
Europe Strengthens the Victory of Kubke Ryder in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Kubok Ryder, winning the US team from 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The United States had already lost six times in Europe, and the European Kubok Ryder has not won since 1993.
Europe has returned to its territory through the command of the Danish captain Thomas Bourne, who has taken 14.5 pounds to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Michaelson, who fought most of the tournament, made his first round in water on the 16th of June par-3, hit his rival Frances Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari won in all its rounds, became 1-x-4th games that once went 5-0-0, as the current tournament format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spit suffered a 5.4-th game with the lowest rating in the European team, the Turbir Olsen from Denmark.
One of the best players in the world, Dustin Johnson, introduced 2:1 New Polter from England, who may have been involved in the Kubke Rader last time.
The Spanish Serhio Garcia, a veteran of eight Kubkov Ryder, has become the winner of a tournament for Europe's history with 25.5 spectators for careers.
“I usually don’t cry, but I can’t stay today.
That was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy to have a box again.
Everything is in the team, and I am glad that I was able to help," said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He handed over to his co-founder John Ramu, who won a victory over the American legend golfer Tiger Woods with account 2:1 in a single game.
“I’m experiencing incredible pride for this victory – I’m growing up watching the game of Tiger Woods,” says 23-year-old Rome.
Wood lost all four matches in France, and now his career record is 13-21-3.
These figures are quite strange for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 main titles, only Jack Niklaus.
The United States was fighting all the way out, trying to overcome it, except for Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed the top class golf throughout the tournament.
The United States captain Jim Furic said after a recent statement by his team: “I'm proud of these guys, they're fighting.
This morning we were able to make it easier for Europe.
I didn't get it.
Let's take a walk in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his games were over-played.
We are regrouping, I will work with the PGA America and our Committee on Kubka Ryder, and we will move forward with success.
I love all 12 kids, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We need to be able to play.
We have lost."
Red tide: News The concentration of micro-organisms has decreased in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasote
The recent report of the Florida Commission on Fisheries and Natural Diplomatic has reflected a general reduction in the concentration of bluefin tuna in some parts of the Tampa region.
According to FWC, the areas of Pinellas, Manatita, Sarasota, Charlotte and Koller are reported to be fruitful, which refers to reducing the concentration of micro-organisms.
The Red Cross extends about 130 miles from the northern Pinnel to the southern part of Li.
Hopes can be observed about 10 miles from the Hillsboro border, but their number has decreased significantly over the past few weeks.
The Red Cross is also observed in the area of Pasco.
In the past week, average concentration in and around Pinellas was reported, from low to high concentration in the Hillsboro coastal area, high concentration in the Manat and Sarasota districts and in the coastal areas, medium concentration in the Charlotte area, high concentration in the Li coast, and low concentration in the Collier area.
In the areas of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Li and Koler, there is still a likelihood of breathing.
In the northwestern Florida, this probability was not reported last week.
