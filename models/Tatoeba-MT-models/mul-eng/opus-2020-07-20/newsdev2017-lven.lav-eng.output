New questions about the California Water Supply Project
Critics and state legislators say they want to know more about the project that Governor Jerry Brauna has paid for in support of the 16 billion US dollars project under the leadership of the California Water Supply Administration said that the Brauna Administration offered government funding to complete two large water tunnels.
Critics claim that the Government’s funding described in the Losanjelos metropolis water supply management may go contrary to the long-standing claims that the various local water supply management, not California itself, would pay for the vision of Brauna to create two equal 35-year-old tunnels in order to modernise water to the south of the Sacramento River, mainly Central and South California.
Initial expenditure for the construction of tunnels at $248 million, which is still to be authorised by the supervisory authority, has already begun the federal audit investigation.
On Wednesday, the state legislators also ordered the state audit of the construction of the tunnel.
On the fourth day, Ms Vogela said that, despite the Losanjelos Metropole Water Supply Management Account, no money will be used to complete the current planning phase of two tunnels from the state's general budget.
However, the opposition of the tunnels and a group of taxpayers were critical on Thursday, and the representative of the Assembly, Sūzan Ega, one of the state lawmakers behind the audit order last week, asked the state for clarifications on Thursday.
"It's a game with buyers," said David Volfs, the law director of the tax-payer association Howard Jervis.
In my opinion, this is the subject of yesterday's audit (demand): there is much more to it than the answer.
The tunnel project has been approved by Brown and some politically effective water supply management and water consumers in Central and South California.
Supporters claim that the tunnels will be a good environment and will provide Californian safest water supply.
The opponents claim that they are concerned that the state will use tunnels to divert too much water from the Sakramento River and the San Francisco River, harming North California and further endangering local species.
Metropoles and other water supply administrations intended to receive water from tunnels must still be committed to paying for the uncertainty of whether the investment in heavy resources will really bring enough water to repay it.
The same water supply management also announced this year that it would not pay for the completion of the current preparatory work unless the project was first authorised by the supervisory authority.
On the fourth day, a monthly report published by the Management of Water Supply in Los Angeles on a tunnel project states that "the state has indicated that additional funding will be granted for the completion of the planning phase by state or federal budgets."
After all that local water supply management has spent on the project, including $63 million from its water supply management, "and it is expected that the state will use the state's money to complete the planning," said Bobs Muirs, a Losanjelos water supply manager.
He then asked Vogel, a state speaker.
Vogela said that the state plans to grant money for the completion of the tunnel planning from the payment of the existing half-century old water network, the Stata Water Project.
However, the opposition to the construction of tunnels indicates that the regulatory framework to be issued in 2009, which, in their view, makes it easier for the state to spend money on the construction of tunnels, while the water supply authorities that benefit from it will not assume payment obligations for them.
"The project contractors have pledged to pay for this project and have used financial incentives to cover these commitments," said Patrizio Šiferle, environmental consultant and former planner of tunnels.
This raises questions about where this money was immediately found.
Business group reference to the Chinese cybersecurity Act
The coalition of international business groups has come to China with a request to change the proposed cybersecurity rules by warning that they will damage trade and the country of the island.
The letter to China Prime Minister Li Kecjana has signed 46 groups from the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America, expressing global concerns that the rules could restrict or impede access to the Chinese security products market.
The signatories include the US Chamber of Commerce, the European Services Forum and groups from Japan, Korea and Mexico.
The proposed rules provide that suppliers must demonstrate to the Chinese authorities how security products operate and how information about Chinese citizens will be stored in the country.
The last letter dated Wednesday states that this data collection could make it easier and reduce access to Chinese customers.
Chemical radiation in Tianjin: since tragedy last year
Zhangs Mengfan claims that the company has won to know what happened in Tianjin.
The Chinese leaders plan a series of memory measures to mention a large level of chemical radiation that killed 173 people on the first day of the year, but not all agree.
John Sadvorts reports from Tianjin.
Almost anywhere else in the world would be the anniversary of such a disaster as the people remember and remember.
However, not in China.
Although in the city of Tajikistan a memorial service is held for the memory of some of the dead fires, other such memorials are excluded.
The media controlled by the Communist Party have been provided with what they can and cannot say, and some survivors, as well as the injured family members, have been warned not to speak to foreign press.
However, 23-year-old Zhangs Mengfan is reluctant to listen.
"This year's society should know something about what happened," he said to me.
I don't want to hear it.
On August 12, Zhangs was a radio operator in the military firefighting Brigadiers' Brigadier General, located only a mile from the explosion epicenter.
"Tomorrow summer was received at 22.53 p.m., and we started sending my team members," he relates.
They could enter the location within 10 minutes.
There are large fires in the storage of chemical substances that are also kept by teams from other parts of the city.
None of them drew attention to the fact that a large number of light and toxic substances were unlawfully stored, mainly over the permitted quantities and also without proper supervision.
The cancer began when nitrocellulose - chemical substances used in the bone age - a batch of chemicals were released and then the weather was turned on.
Then it spread across a large area - 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate salt.
In the explosions, logs and fire dumps were fired, where Zhangs Mengfan was waiting for the radio clock news from the scene.
This information was not received either.
"When I woke up in the shadows, I cried out," he told me.
I knew what that would mean to my friends.
Of the 26 firemen of his unit, who were sent to the explosion, eight never returned.
Many others have serious problems and other injuries.
The largest of the two major explosions were compared to the earthquake, and the blast wave was felt many miles away.
The total loss is estimated at more than $1 billion, including more than 300 damaged buildings.
In total, 173 people lost their lives, of whom 104 were burned.
The remains of eight people have not been found.
The investigation authorities of the official government made a significant contribution to the agreement on corruption, political relations and official secrecy, as a result of which it was permitted to apply the rules and to ignore security systems.
First of all, in no way should such a prisoner be allowed to stay close to the homes in which he lived.
More than 100 staff members and company management representatives have started some kind of disciplinary or criminal investigation.
So while the Government can point to progress made - thousands of households and compensations for the population, these sensitive issues remain current.
The tragedy has been discovered in a happy system where rapid economic growth is a priority and the lack of independent supervision is a fact.
This evening’s courage and duty are no doubt, but without fire as a lamp, the walls are not quite impressive.
It is a fiery furnace that has been sent forth in an unprecedented war against man - made catastrophes that could have been prevented.
Zhangs Mengfan no longer works in the fire department, but he will visit the monumental service in Tianjin.
He will bear a message of hope for the surviving members of his congregation.
Most of all, I want to tell them: I've cared for your parents and they're doing well.
Leave your parents to me.
Now I'm a member of your family.
I will fulfill your duties as a son.
The golden spring could affect the shooting season of shoes
The Scottish Red Cross shooting season will begin later, as the number of birds has decreased over the summer period this year.
Several features have been abandoned, as many of the new rubies have not survived in cold weather.
Noting the beginning of the season, the Scotia Game Managers Association (SGA) reports that the shooting of rubella provides more work than the Edinburgh Festival.
However, the OneKind Animal Protection Fund calls for the end of the "brothal bird shelter".
The director of the organisation, Harij Hüttons, said: "The work that is being invested in to ensure a large number of games intended for shooting is huge and inevitable to include any of the most controversial activities."
There is no surprise that the society has avoided this so-called sport and calls on the government to prohibit the unsound, unnecessary work that is being pursued by only a very small part of the population of Scotland.
The owners of the land also claim that they are committed to maintaining the number of birds and that mining is important for the development of the rural economy.
SGA President Alex Hogs said that the industry provides 8,800 full-time jobs in the most disadvantaged regions of the year and that it has been a "rich job" in times of insecurity.
He said, "In comparison with many European countries, Scotland has not been so deeply affected by the culture of "medium" and at least not knowing how the shooting season affects the country's economy."
Hogs said that the number of jobs provided during the strike exceeded the number of jobs created at Edinburgh International Festival, Fringe Festival, Tetovation Festival and Vecgada evenings together.
He added: "The employment situation in Scotland is currently very disturbing, especially in the oil and gas sector, so the players and their families want to see the expansion of the sector.
We want to work with the Government of Scotland to ensure that hard-working people can rely on these jobs in the future.
RSPB Scotland considers that at least eight gold rings have been killed near the rubella habitat.
Many players recognize that the shooting of rubons is not generally popular, but SGA claims that the sector "and has taken significant steps towards better practice."
The day of the opening of the Ruben shooting season is traditionally known as the "Holy Twelve-Minister."
However, there is still a lot of debate on this kind of sport, and the management of robbery sites is linked to the persecution of some of the natural protection authorities.
On Thursday, RSPB Scotland said that less than five years ago in the mountains of Mondalita, in the southeastern part of Winterness, there have been eight rounds of gold.
The Natural Welfare Fund considers that they have been illegally killed near the site of robbery and their satellite processes have been destroyed.
Scottish Minister of Environment Rosanna Kaningema said these reports are "very disturbing and exciting."
Ms. Kaningemas commissioned officials to analyse evidence of approximately 90 survivors and missing injuries with drivers in order to determine whether there is a trend of criminal activity.
A clean group or RSPB would be concerned about attempts to combine the feelings of opposition before the beginning of the mine season, and said there was no clear evidence that birds had even been killed in the siege of the Montalita Mountains.
Rio Olympic Games 2016: Briony Piedja United Kingdom takes off on the tramline
The representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain cuts the powder in the tramline
Briony Piedja became the first British woman to become a medalist in the Olympics trampling game in Rio.
Peijzi (25) to gold missed 0.425 points because the Canadian representative Rosanna Maclenana had already removed another Olympic title by order with a result of 56,465.
The World Championship, China's representative Lī Dana was at bronze, while the second British finalist, Ketrina Driscole, finished at the end of the sixth.
I can't believe I've broken an Olympic medal.
I'm so happy," said the emotional Paige.
I didn't feel it was a medal, but I was able to show the best performance, so I was so happy that all the training and hard work had been paid.
I'm so glad I could finally start with Kate, already one representative's participation in the final would be historical, but we were both there.
The highest achievement in international competitions prior to the Olympic Games was the fifth place at the 2015 World Championship in Denmark.
Tramlining in the Olympic Games was introduced in 2000, and this is the first time British women have been released to final.
Median reaction.
Nathan Beilijs, the only representative of the British team, was in the exhibition on the six-day tramline competition.
Hanna Velana, who participates in the Olympics a second time, soon began to celebrate the achievement of the Paige.
Peijza has won a ballaur biology with excellence at the University of Sheffield.
Rio 2016: Fijian fans clean gold medallion in regbi-7
12-year-old boy to see the game, squeezing half of the senses in the fields of sugarcane to the nearest television
Fiji, after its history, begins the first Olympic gold medallion of fame yet to be discovered
Banks closed, shops shut down, and mourners took their way through Suvas, smoking, singing and liquefiing
Fiji gained gold medals, at Deodoro Stadium Regbie-7 at the end of 43-7 in the UK.
Thousands of people around the island have stopped their jobs to watch historical games.
Fascinating Fiji is the first Olympic medal ever fought
Many of the others were dressed in Fiji’s colors and were dressed in crevices, wearing a national flag, and uplifting the team.
When the game ends on the sludge, the sneezers go on the streets, slendering, and sneezing.
"Some people even stopped their cars on the streets of Suvas and joined the Fijian flag to celebrate their small struggles," reports Fiji Times.
The celebration will certainly continue at the end of the week and on the next week.
Ireland Prime Minister: Finn Harps 0-5 Derry City
Aaron Macenefs is the first of two prison sentences in good terms in Finnpar.
Derry City has moved to another Premier, winning a convincing victory with a 5-0 battle with Finn Harps.
Aaron Macenefs raised a "confessive fight" under the leadership of the two first half-time criminal regimes that were committed to violations against Lukas Shubert.
Nathan Boils introduced the names at the beginning of the second half of the time, and Schüberts defeated the opponent in the fourth quarter before the Kita Varda won the win, ending the opponent's battle in Finnpar.
Derry is about one point in front of Cork City, and both teams will be in the decisive game on Friday evening at Brandievel.
It was Derry's first victory over his northern rival competitors this season, and they disturbed me on the Harps side.
Macenefs seized the opening stage of the game at 17 minutes after Kirana Kola went out against Schübert, although the crime appeared outside the prison.
There was no doubt about the second sentence of punishment, the former Barium Moloam's half-year-old "Karamel's strike" by letting Sübert go down on the ground and Makenef's result in the third minute after the interruption.
Boys added the exact point after Dinah Jervis's game with the end of the eight minutes after the game started.
Derry City hosted Gerard Doherti for a night of rest, but he made a great effort to keep his words through David Skalley's guest in the best game to discover.
Sübert was shot by the bomb in the waves of Kolma before he showed up at 83 minutes ago, and soon followed by Varda's wise brother-in-law over the protection of the Harps Centre Richard Braš.
It was Derry's greatest victory in the series and great preparation for the final game with Cork.
Inverness College University of Upper and Island University (UHI)
A total of 20 students could be exaggerated in the UHI High Media Course of the Inverness College.
Most of them were 17 - and 18 - year - old students who were expected to use the notes received in their studies to attend the university.
Inverness College UHI claims that quality assurance processes are being applied, adding that the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) is investigating this case.
The SQA Secretary of the press said that the highest media assessment available throughout the country in 2016 is "notified as planned".
Twenty students were enrolled at the offered and evaluated course by the Inverness College UHI.
Many of the students were young people living in rural areas who received training online, but they often had to be sent to the Inverness College from their homes, such as Lochéibaras.
One student’s father said that after her daughter’s publications in the social media that she had not received any assessment of her job, at least 10 had also come to the hearing with a statement that she had not received any assessment of her course’s work.
He said to BBC News Scotland directly that about five more people who received this course in the Inverness College last year, and who were able to contact them, said the same thing happened to them.
The situation means that her daughter cannot provide a place at the University of Glazgova, but she will be able to accept other university offers, thanks to the qualifications received at school.
However, her father said that there were others who visited college organized media courses that had not been conducted and who were now "forgotten" and uncertain whether their course work would be reviewed and evaluated with a sign so that they could attend universities.
Inverness College UHI is part of the University of Upper and Island.
Diana Rovlinsone, UHI Director and Executive Director of the University of Inverness, said: "We are very important to the results of the exams and students' achievements."
It also confirms the great review of His Majesty's Education Inspection (HMIE) received this year, as well as in comparison with the improved levels of achievement in both further and higher education.
As we have done every year a review of all published results, compared with each student predicted.
In this particular course, standard quality assurance measures were taken, and the evaluation body recently reported on "the major improvements in the provision and management of this assessment" and confirmed that "the evaluations were in accordance with national standards."
SQA is currently investigating this case at our request.
The SQA press secretary said: "We are pleased that the highest media evaluation in 2016 has taken place as planned and that candidates had the opportunity to show their understanding of the subject."
Many candidates have shown good performance and have seen a small increase in A-C achievement compared with the same qualification in the past year.
It was developed in accordance with previous and model documents and in accordance with our course and evaluation specifications.
The brothers were put in prison for Samurai's sword "asspirits" in Kilmarno
Jason Braidenam is used or used by the Samurai, the Nazis, and the monks
Two brothers were imprisoned in prison for killing a man with a samurai tooth after a drug-related torture in Ireland, which was assessed as "in the spirit".
Upuris Jason Bradens (38) was arrested several times at his home in Kilmarno on 5 July 2015.
James Clark (36) will be sentenced to at least 22 years in prison after being sentenced to imprisonment.
His brother John (38) was sentenced to ten years in prison after being sentenced to less severe imprisonment without a previous sentence.
At the trial of the two men, Judge Bill Danlops told the brothers that they had done "a cruel, cruel and vengeful attack."
He rejected any admission that Mr. Braidena was crying and waiting for them, armed with a samurai tooth.
Justice Danlops adds: "You plan to enter illegally with at least one nation and a minority."
Jason Bradens may have been a drug dealer, but he was a son, father, and friend.
You killed him.
After two men were arrested, the police inspector who conducted the investigation said: "John and James Clark's violent and dangerous actions have caused Jason Braiden's death."
Living in a world where 38 years of age are so tragic that there is a heartbreaking situation that the family needs to survive.
The court first heard that the brothers from Kilmarnoka had decided to fire Mr. Braidena’s gold medal that they had given him in exchange for drugs.
Two alcoholics and drug addicts came to her house, rubbed their faces with shelves and armed with Nazi and Eastern war chariots.
It is considered that the tooth used in the spleen belongs to the deceased.
The family said that they had seen Clarke on the roof of Braiden when he sat on the sofa at the door and heard his voice.
Prosecutor Richards Godards said at the court hearing: "The attack on this man was sustained, haotish."
After that, the place of burial was described as "a ghost".
In addition to the injuries of the two nasals, Braidens experienced a severe trauma with a long subject.
Three days later he died at Kilmarnokas Croshaus Hospital.
The two brothers did not know each other in secret.
In giving the evidence, James Clarks, who has already been tried 38 times, including a secretion attempt, said, "I didn't want it. It was an accident."
John Clarks, who has already been tried 23 times, said that he was only involved in helping a brother who, according to him, attacked Braidens."
A man is told by a prisoner about the rape and murder of his child's child
David Sinkler’s knowledge of his son’s fate in his home in Istkillbraid in 2012.
A man who had been kidnapped and killed by his child’s breast in an accident because he did not want to eat was sentenced to seven years ’ imprisonment and three months’ imprisonment.
David Sinkler spent four months at the age of Josué, when his home in Istkillbraid, Southwest, was "lost control" on 6 December 2012.
The cause of the disease was explained only after a judicial examination.
Sinkler (34) was initially accused of fraud but was recognized as guilty of fraud without a previous thought.
Judge Lords Breiseidl Sinkleram said, "You will attack your child's child by beating him, causing him to die."
When you beat him, you needed to know it, but you didn't find it.
Only after basic medical examinations you will be aware of what has been done.
Your wife believed you.
Now her feelings are transferred and you can no longer support yourself.
Lords Breiseidl described the consequences of Joshua's death as a disaster to all and added: "Nothing will come back to Joshua."
Before the trial, it was found that on the day that the child died, Sinkler and his wife, Karstiya, had given Josh and Josua to fly and buy in Estkilbraid.
At 17.30 p.m., Karstija Sinklere met with her mother and sister.
Just 11 minutes later, Sinkler called her, who heard "schoked".
He said to her, "Joshua won't come as soon as he gets home."
Then he ended the conversation and called 999.
The Jew was immediately taken to Hermiary’s hospital where he died.
At first, the cause of Joshua’s death was unclear, but he was looking at the court’s team of medical experts, which soon found the effects of death on the eyes and brains of the victims, and such trauma could not be felt.
One of the experts, Dr. Peter Richards, John Redclifa Hospital, advised the child neurosurgery in Oxford, said: "This has happened because the child has been kidnapped and thus has suffered injuries, as well as has been replaced with more power than daily."
The defence representative Jans Djügids told the court that Sinkler's "excusely sorry" was done.
Rio Olympic Games 2016: Hloja Tatone Threaten Juliyas Yefimov's Positions
For the British representative, Tatoni is released from the arms of the bronze 200 m in the ignition
The British representative of Hloja Tatone criticises the participation of the contestant Juliya Yefimo in Rio after the Russian representative has been arrested for 200 m in the fight.
Yefimova, who was allowed to participate in the games after the complaint about the ban on participation due to doping, was beaten by Tatoni in the fourth place.
"I would have wanted them to be completely pure games," said a 20-year-old witch hunter.
I don't already know what's going on there.
I'm not satisfied with it, but that's it.
Jefimova, who had moved to another location, learned about her participation in the games only three days earlier.
I don't want to see people walk away from sports, but I don't think that's really right.
She did not have to participate in the competition, and a 20 - year - old British representative had to fight a medal.
Rie Kaneto won the seventh gold medal in Japan in 2016 in Rio, defeating Jefimov, who was on the silver medal.
Chinese representative Jinlinga This was at the bronze, only for six seconds, holding the remaining Tatoni in the fourth unit.
Her British team member, 20-year-old Molly Renšova, finished at the sixth.
"Living in the fourth place is a little bit of temptation, the one that is before you," adds Tatone.
It's a great experience, and I'm a little excited about the fourth place.
I'm so close to the medal, and that would have been a dream.
However, the final meeting is already a great experience that I will take with me in the years to come.
It was a small blow, but in the long run it would make me strong, and it makes me look forward to getting closer to it.
Only 0.01 seconds left the British record at the end of women's 200 m piloting.
"Every man has to give another chance," said Jeffimova.
Yefimova, who said that she had already been moved to answer questions about her doping past, protected her right to start Rio.
In 2013, she received a 16-month ban following the discovery of anabolic steroids in her body.
The Sport Resolution Court (CAS) stated that athletes could not participate in Rio games because they had already been subject to sanctions.
The CAS examined my complaint, and I won.
If someone does not like it and there is someone else's opinion, they can turn to CAS," she explained.
I don't support doping, and I've never used it.
In the second case, it was definitely not my fault.
Each person must be given another opportunity.
When you go and write your sentence, no one's in prison.
Bens Prauds cut out 50 free-style swimming place
First, a British record was set up to destroy the place of men 50 m free of style at the end of the landing.
The Union champion Praud (21) took 21.54 seconds to make the fifth most qualified final (02:44 BST Saturday).
Your delegation is innocent and deaf
Indian Sports Minister Vijajs Goels Rio Olympics has been a very busy person, often held in clubs, encouraging Indian athletes and taking loans after their beginnings.
However, he and his large company have apparently caused the pressure of Olympic players because of their uncontrollable behavior, once again trying to escape to the racing zones without adequate accreditation and the routy reacting to the Indian news agency Press Trust of India.
Vijajs Goels, photographed in July, corrects his behavior.
On Wednesday the Olympic Games organizers threatened to cancel Goela's accreditation, if her behaviour did not improve, by sending a warning letter after he and his company tried to enter the restricted access zone in the event of the outbreak of the incineration and in the air where the kidnapping and supply took place.
"We have received several reports of your sport minister's attempt to enter accredited competition zones with non-accredited people," wrote Sarah Petererson, coordinator of the Rio 2016 Committee of Organisations.
When the staff tried to explain that it was not allowed, the people who were with the minister became aggressive and aggressive and sometimes angry with our staff.
"If our protocol team becomes aware of any such behaviour, your sport minister's accreditation will be cancelled and his privileges in the Olympic Games will be abolished," was mentioned in the letter.
The head of the Indian delegation called this case "from the mouse-shulled ziloni", and Goel himself said that he did nothing wrong by describing it all as "responsibility".
In the meantime, he wrote: "All I know is that we have respected all the rules.
We feed on the Olympics and support our Indian athletes.
On the other hand, this Olympic Games are all dreamy in India, and there are no medals in the past.
Those who lost hope in social media indicated that Michael Felps has beaten as many medals as India’s history.
A number of prominent candidates have already been excluded, including the poet Abhinev Bindra, who broke gold medals in Beijing in 2008.
This time he stayed fourth.
The house is full of money and opportunity," author and author of a Sardonian Twitter post.
However, some bright prospects remain, as there will still be in the sports box, golf, tennis, lightball and, yes, in the bathroom.
The only Indian winemaker, Dipa Karmakara, will strive for the final holiday, expressing his fear of double "Naves leciens", the Produnova holiday, which has been tried by only a few other winemakers.
In a country where 1.25 billion people live, the low number of medals in India has always been a cause of confusion.
Analysts say that there are countless reasons for this.
National beauty is a cricket that is not an Olympic sport.
India has not made a major contribution to the infrastructure and the training of Olympics - the first tool for the winning was prepared from the spare parts of the old shoe.
Parents have always emphasized academia of knowledge about sport.
And the authorities responsible for sport are taken over by corruption.
The International Olympic Committee has set up the Indian Olympic Association for the violation of its statutes in 2012 because it has been elected by leaders who have been proposed to be criminalized.
Three Indian winter Olympic players were even prevented from representing their country, wearing a flag or wearing any national symbol.
They're acting like independent sportsmen.
When people get their own, turbulence is forced to land in South Dakota on the JetBlue Airport route of Boston-Sacramento.
JetBlue airport was forced on Thursday night to perform an emergency landing after 22 passengers and two crew members were injured during the storm report to CBS Sacramento.
The trip 429 from Boston to Sacramento was cancelled in Rapidsitia, South Dakota, shortly before 19:30 a.m. after local time.
The airline reports that the victims have been transferred to a hospital for examinations.
JetBlue claims that it has sent personnel to assist the injured, has stopped the reserve car to deliver to the other passengers Sacramento.
The drug control agency (DEA) has a long way to go with regard to medicinal marijuana
Unfortunately, the answer is: we don't believe it.
This is a loss of opportunity for further delays in the provision of treatment to countless people.
To date, there is only one scientific source of medical marijuana at the University of Mississippi at the federal level.
In a few more positive cases today, DEA also announced that it will now allow other places to apply for permission to do the same.
There is hope that the extent and diversity of marijuana available for scientific purposes could increase.
Although this will draw attention to the importance of good study, it will be symbolic in large measure, as no matter how much marijuana is available, if access to it is still difficult, it is not significant.
Think of a product that is very demanding but is kept behind closed doors.
In response to a request for a goods which makes a difficult decision to produce more but never close the door.
This product is marijuana and its location is listed in list 1 of these closed doors.
In this unpleasant situation there is medical marijuana.
Since marijuana is included in list 1 (relevantly, according to its definition "not currently approved medical use and there is a high potential for its use), there are significant obstacles to the closure of doors.
Potential researchers usually turn to DEA because it grants permission to start scientific studies.
Even if authorisations are issued for the investigation of substances listed in list 1, authorities must comply with very strict safety rules and establish high-level safety systems that may be expensive.
There is also an even more subjective consideration of the authorisation from its academic authority to carry out studies on substances listed in list 1 for the first time.
Even if individual faculty representatives want to carry out this study, university management may not want problems or potential near results due to negative press reports.
This happened at Arizona University when Dr. Sjø Sisli was released from prison after trying to face medical marijuana tests.
Finally, Sislija came looking for private funding for his project, and only in April, seven years after the initial project was proposed, his project became the first approved medical marijuana tests for the prevention of post-traumatic stress for the vets.
Then, after years of struggle with bureaucratic obstacles, the National Institute of the Reliability of Drugs has held the last key.
It is now the largest federal beneficiary of marijuana research, and is the only supplier of marijuana itself.
Even if there is a higher level of medical medicine for free circulation studies, the institution will still have to approve all the studies it has funded.
However, the problem is in its name 'bad use'.
The representative of the San Francisco University, Dr. Donald Eibrams, who interviewed his documentary film "Marihuan", said that the main task of the Institute is to study the substances in the context of their potential dependence, rather than as a medicine.
Eibram will pay attention to the important fact.
Even if the study will overcome all the above-mentioned obstacles, the door can still be closed if the purpose is to study the benefits of medical marijuana rather than its damage.
Note: The search for fast (and, to be recognized, unscientific) in the U.S. National Medical Library found 1,434 jobs for medical marijuana in the last five years.
In this same search, only 57 jobs benefited from medical marijuana.
Most of the studies were about the damage done by marijuana, such as "Drug travel due to the anticholinergic effects of marijuana", "Marihuan pancreatitis caused" and "Marihuan use and lung cancer risk."
Such a disparity results in an entirely broken body.
The path to medical marijuana use is mixed with surprises and glazing, where only the eye is visible.
As long as DEA's body stands for list 1, despite the medical effect, the U.S. Department of Health and Social Affairs maintains a wide range of cannabis patents for medical purposes.
DEA continues to identify marijuana with heroin and LSD as a high-liquid drug potential, even though the very main administrative law of the DEA is challenged by Judge Francis Jang.
The strict medical meaning of marijuana is safer than many widely consumed foods.
For example, developing 10 fresh cartridges may cause toxic reactions.
In comparison, it is physically impossible to swallow so many marijuana to put death in place.
Marihuan in its natural form is one of the safest known therapeuticly active substances for humans.
A reasonable analysis of Marihuan can be used with caution in the medical field.
It must be said again that it was proposed by the DEA judge himself.
Yet, almost 30 years later, few have changed.
Whether we realize it or not, all of us in our daily lives accept a certain dose of gratitude.
Maybe we don't always have the energy to say it loud or we're either so tired or confused that no one seems to notice it.
With regard to greatness in the context of the federal medical marijuana policy, it must be sustainable to present the facts carefully.
Patients' lives, for example, Charlotte Fiji, whose joints are reduced by medical marijuana, and many other lives are dependent on it.
It is worth talking at the highest level about the fact that the soil can provide so much benefit and still find it behind closed doors.
Bloody Beethroots: Donalds Tramps "Blond in Berlusconi"
Bloody Beethroots is known in the context of electronic dance music
The musicians say Tramps dominates media like Berlusconi
You know, we have been experienced in Italy at Berlusconi, and Tramps looks at me after blonda Berlusconi, "The Bloody Beethroots, the founder of the electronic music bank association, said CNN.
The presidential candidate for the office of the Republicans and the political media magnet of Italy, both known to their overexploited persons, was able to attract the attention of the press and to change the history of the media.
"Bloody Beethroots" composed of Rifo is known for its electronic music and has collaborated with various artists, starting with legendary Seru Pol Makartni and ending with an electropopist singer of the Greek Svabo Bechu in 2013 in the song "Cronicles of a Fallen Love."
Rifo is born in Basano del Grapa, Italy, near Venice, in 1977, about the time of the birth of the pancreas, and the numbers " 1977" are recorded in music on the chest.
"The English language is not my native language, so I don't understand everything about your world," Rifo said, hiding behind the black fees he is familiar with.
I'm trying to explore, and I'm trying to improve my understanding of your culture.
Rifo invited the Americans to look at the "Video" documentary film in which Berlusconi monopol was studied on the Italian media.
The documentary is about how "Berlusconi made the Italian track," said Rifo, adding that Trampam had a similar impact on America.
"You see how a man can completely turn the system and get everything... by himself," he said.
I think Tramps isn't good for this country.
Two Turks were imprisoned in prison for drug trafficking of more than 500 million steroids
Two Turkish men were sentenced to more than 500 million sterilizations of cocaine contraband on board the North Sea, each for at least 20 years in prison.
Momins Sahins and Emins Ozmens were recognized as a criminal after three tons of A-class drug was found in the High Court of Glazgo after about 100 centimetres from the Aberdian coast to "MV Hamal".
The detention in 2015 is one of the largest cocaine seizures ever held in Europe.
Maminam Sahin and Emina Ozmen will be discussed in prison for her role in drug trafficking
A heavy cargo of drugs found on board is one of the largest in British history
The drugs were found hidden in a specially designed hiding place on a ship registered in Tanzania, which sailed from Smbang to Tenerif and then to the North Sea.
It stopped British fleet frigate "HMS Somerset" and border force kit "HMC Valiant".
Sahins (47) was sentenced to 22 years, but Ozmens (51) was sentenced to 20 years in the Supreme Court of Glasgow.
Judge Lords Kinkleiven told men that the amount of drugs was "not only important, but ambitious", and drug contraband had a "failing effect" on people and the surrounding society.
He said, "You were involved in the most important operation, including the carriage of cocaine by ships, the operation that crossed international and really intercontinental borders."
He said that Captain Sahins wasn't "drugs in the end," but he had played an important role in the crime, while the role of Captain Ozmena was "something smaller".
The inspectors attacked Hamal, following the information received from the French customs authority DNRED, and when it arrived in Aberden, they broke through the steel plate by entering a dark section where 128 dogs with cocaine were found with a weight of 3.2 tonnes, with a value of approximately 512 million stars on the black market.
"MV Hamal" checked the caral fleet last year.
There were three tons of cocaine on board.
The inspection of ships found that in its ballast tanks there are toxic tonne of Class A drugs
The ship was on its way from the coast of Bosnia to South America before being stopped in the North Sea.
Access to this place was opened under the roof in one of the crew’s rooms, and the survey was banned.
Sahins and Ozmens were recognised as guilty for the carriage of cocaine and for hiding on board from 20 February to 23 April last year and for the supply of cocaine from 21 April to 23 April.
Two previously unauthorized men who had worked in the shipping sector since the end of the school continued to claim that they were innocent, but they accepted the judgment.
There is a lack of evidence for the charges against four other men.
Sahina, lawyer Jonathan Krovs, said that the two children's father was a "honested mouse".
He said, "Someone who was involved in drug trafficking."
Someone who was able to drive the ships.
In view of the drug hierarchy, Sahins certainly is not a drug at the end of the tree, but at some point below.
A delicious quantity of cocaine on board means that it was to be disposed of by road
The police went through the whole ship a long time before the drugs were divided into these boxes.
When Sahina asked questions about his captain's work on Hamal in February 2015, the court listened.
Mr Krova said that he was "socked" about the need to put the events of a very important girl (9) and a child (13) and "only wants to go back to Turkey".
Both men have not seen their family since the arrest in April 2015 because families are still fighting to get visa approval.
Ozmena lawyer Di Morus said that he wants to see his family "extraordinary" but he knows that in the future, it will "not be possible".
Speaking after today's judgments, Scottish prosecutor David Harvijs said: "The international drug trade has no borders, and we, whose task is to do so, work more closely together to achieve that we are one step ahead.
"Scotian achievements in the conduct of criminals are indeed at global level, and in this case we have committed significant economic losses to organised crime representatives."
Drugs were planted all over the ship, including under the walls.
The inspectors of this Contracting Pack find a hidden vessel in the cargo space
Mr Harvija added: "Hamal" was identified on the basis of information received from the French authorities, and after rapid cooperation with Tanzania where the ship was registered, the general prosecutor who also allowed to sail on the ship.
"Our investigation was then given from Guyana, which provided access to important data on consignments, to Spain, which provided us with very valuable information on ship detention sites in the Canary Islands.
We have also cooperated with colleagues in Denmark, Norway and the United States to collect specific evidence together.
Despite basic information that Hamal is wearing a large amount of drugs, representatives of the British authorities in international waters could not go up there without the permission of the Government of Tanzania - something they had never given before.
Süh Peitena, Prosecutor of the Royal Criminal League (CPS) of International Justice and Organized Crime Control, said: "The CPS Criminal Justice Council has issued an authorisation to extend to the Tanzanian authorities within 24 hours of the time of receipt of information.
According to international maritime law, British officials do not have the right to cross international waters on board a ship which is under the flag of another State unless that country has a special legal permit to do so.
Without our criminal justice, there would be a great risk that the ship could escape and that we would never be able to call these people responsible.
Photographer Braiens Romeizhn boasts a heavy "Austrom Express" train
Photo by Brians Romeijzn from Rotterdam in this move has taken pictures of the train in Belgium
In the photos are visible inside the wheel-like interior, coated seats, with open windows and a narrow car cab
It is already known as the East Express wagon, but it was owned by the Belgian National Railway Company
A city scientist has taken these remarkable photographs that have seen the remains of a passenger train that has once been one of the best modes of movement.
Its time of winter has already passed, and the train and locomotives have been allowed to catch the train deck in Belgium, where they have become the object of a popular photography and live search engine.
Photo by Brians Romeijzn, 40, has taken these scary pictures, which are seen inside the train's corner, painted seats, with open windows, and the driver's cabin
The Vilcina wagon and locomotives have been allowed to catch the train deck in Belgium, where they have become the object of a popular photography and accommodation search engine.
These trains were a sign of weakness when they worked under the legendary name from 1883 to 2009.
Lokomotives were used by the Belgian National Railway Company about 50 years ago.
After 126 years of skiing, the last train operating with the express name of the East came from Strasbourg to Vienna in December 2009, ending a famous history phase.
The East expression was famous on the Paris road - Smbang.
When it was launched in 1883 (operator - La Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits) it was known as the "Express d'Orient" in French.
It became the Eastern expression in 1891, and by the 1930s it had been regular routes throughout Europe.
It should not be mixed with a private Venice Simplon-Orient-Express.
There is a very small "Company Internationale des Wagons-Lits" luxury van.
In this photograph, measuring instruments and open-hands are still installed in a dry machine cabin in which equipment is in shape.
The novelist said that the machine's cabin is "in its own words claustrophobic, and the truck trolley must have been unstoppable."
In the past, trucks and wagons have become the object of a popular photography and accommodation search engine.
After visiting lost train in Belgium, Romaindjes MailOnlineTravel said: "I could really feel how it used in his Jewish times."
Ladies and gentlemen, on the way to the high summit, the ladies will join in beautiful clothing.

A father in Lancashire is expelled from school for T-crela with lavender names
Two children's father was expelled from school for entering his sports day in T-crecl.
Kreigs Makbets (36) from Bärnli City in Lancashire said he'd "not" be the lead of the cricket with the title "Lajzam and Dr.am!"
However, despite the fact that when he noticed his mistake and took the second T-cracker, he found that he was forbidden to enter school territory the next day.
The only father, who has been working for four years as head of the Park Primary School in Kolna, Children, was unable to leave because of the ban on children, and staff even called social services and police.
Creig Macbets (36) of the Children said that he was not expelled from school territory after he had gone to the children's sports club in T-crek.
Mr. Bärnlija accused school director Saru Miguel of overreacting.
He says that he is unjustly punished because before you go to see his two children's adventures, you're wrong after a quick t-crack.
My father, who no longer works as a school director, said, "It was a mistake and a misunderstanding on my part."
I don't think about the day of the sport and I'll be quick to take it off.
Shortly after the end of the event, we had a father's competition, and the director pointed out my T-circle and said that it was not appropriate.
I'm sorry, and I'm gonna go get it on the other side, and that's why it's over.
However, 36 years of age, the man said that he had received a letter from the president of the school that he was invited to address the director the next day, but he did not see the need to do so because he had already regretted it.
"Then the school director called me and said that I was forbidden to enter school territory," Mr. Bärnlija added.
I learned that after the sport day, some parents on the Facebook page were afraid of it and that many people were interested in it.
Any sincere person would say that it is overexpressed.
Mr Macbeta, who is editor of the online journal Love Mini, said that, of course, he could not even come back to the children on the last Saturday.
However, this was because of the call from school and social services.
On the T-crekla was Kreiga Čarlza image Lister from BBC cult comedy "Sarkanais bread" with one of his iconic words "Lajjam and Dr.am."
He commented: "I thanked them that I wasn't there because I was forbidden to go to school.
Then he called me from the social services and asked why I was not going back to the girl.
The school also called the police because I didn't come back to the girl for 40 minutes."
Mr Macbeta said he had been told that he could no longer go to school and that the ban would be in force until further notice.
He also said that he had been warned that he could apply the 500-star penalty if he was accused of violating this provision.
Sarah Miguel, Director of the Park School, said that the case is now over.
Sarah Miguel, director of the Park School, said: "I am going to confirm that Mr. McBeta has left the office and is no longer our school manager."
This case is now over, and I hope to go back to school in September."
The city councillor John Könijs said that schools have clear policies and guidelines.
"We all need to bear in mind that taking such jobs as a councillor or a leader applies to you higher standards, and unfortunately he does not respond to these standards this time," he said.
Professor Jonathan Nixon added that he did not think that the school required him to apply a ban and that there was a silence from the bridge.
Mr. Nixon added: "This T-cracking was boring, and he apologized for it too."
The Lancashire Police confirmed that they were calling from school but did not return.
In the last few years, the former VEF facilities in the area of Freedom have been renovated - there are several IT companies, the sector has already begun to call this area the local Silicia road.
The other VEF territory, including Bérzaune, will also be developed.
The development and construction of the second round of project at the LU Academic Centre in Turnnakal will pay EUR 21 million.
Following the conclusion of the purchase by the University of Latvia on the Academic Centre in Tornākal, Riga, the second series of technical projects, construction and self-sustainment, a notice will appear on the website of the Procurement Supervisory Office.
The procurement shall be carried out in the form of a negotiation procedure without prior publication of the notice of the contract.
The contract will be concluded with the LNK Industry Group, which has undertaken these operations at EUR 21,186,560.
As the University explains, when the European Union funds are planning and implementing projects for the 2014-2021 programming period, the next series of the academic complex - Science Centre Buildings - design, self-sustainment and construction, according to the Ski project and the specific year of construction.
The building of the science centre shall be similar to the building designed and constructed by the natural science centre and its operation, which is similar to the most important technical and technological parameters, as well as the number of existing scientific and academic personnel and students.
The competition regulation was accompanied by the SIA Six-style skiing project, which provided information to all potential suppliers in the course of the tender, including a listing of the objects planned by the University of Latvia Academy Centre, indicating the name of each particular object, the expected area of the object, the year of the planned transfer of the object, and other information.
At the end of 2015, the SIA Six style carried out the corrections to the territory of the complex of buildings of the former University of Latvia Academic Centre, which resulted in a clarification of the location and interconnection of the buildings of the Academic Centre, as well as the transport organisation in and around the territory of the meta.
It shall be published for circulation of the medicinal product in the sections of the road.
The holder of the VAS Latvian road transport system shall inform the LAU.
The subject of the purchase is divided into 9 rooms: Alūksnes, Daugavpils, Jakabpils, Jelgav, Rēzezne, Valmiera, Tals and Riga.
The tenderers may submit an offer for one or more batches.
In order to improve the transparency of road drivers and their adjacent areas, the flow of the medicine in road sections is necessary to facilitate the removal of water from the road, as well as to limit the seating of the product and the formation of dust.
The most recent work of the medicine is for farmers on the Talsu road total of 28 roads to 637 kilometres, 20 to 432 kilometres to the Valmer road, and 17 roads to 384 kilometres to the North.
It has already been reported that in June the company completed its work on the main and most important national asphalt roads, but on the smaller regional roads and on the local road road, the VAS Latvian road maintenance operator plans to entrust farmers with the work of swimming parts of the VAS road.
"We have the opportunity to make more efficient use of open funding for car maintenance work, while giving farmers the opportunity to put on a full range of technology and to earn a good job," said VAS Latvian Car Manager Vladimir Kononovs, president of the Board of Directors of the Board.
The deadline for submission of tenders shall be 22 August.
Court of Justice: Demagogy on the compulsory health insurance model with additional financial burdens does not remain a criticism.
Any demagogy on compulsory health insurance, which would be imposed on the population of direct and high-payment burdens, remains no criticism, is considered by juris Janson.
Janson has today been asked by Health Minister Andu Chakšu to discuss the situation in the health sector.
After the meeting, Janson told journalists that the funding model offered by the Ministry of Health is a sustainable and developed health care system that would make it more accessible to patients.
He also noted that additional funding for health care should be discussed in this case as it is currently insufficient.
Janson also stressed that any demagogy on compulsory health insurance that would impose direct and high-payment burden on the population remains no criticism, especially when the Netherlands model is called.
Janson said that the Netherlands's health was released 11% of the total domestic product, while Latvia was only 3%.
Therefore, the Government and Parliament must be responsible enough to understand that the point of this reconciliation must be removed, given legal certainty and added that the model offered by the Ministry of Health (VM) will not work otherwise.
She thanked the lawyer for the support and pointed out that the main concern was that the patient should be approached by a doctor, which means that the health care system needs additional funding.
The Minister also pointed out that the planned additional €35 million will be possible next year only to make the most urgent cases with regard to oncological patients and the remuneration of birth specialists.
Therefore, VM has developed a plan and submitted an additional EUR 41 million request for health care to reduce lines to specialists and investigations.
"The question of priorities, whether or not the means will be found," said Czecha.
This amount does not include an increase in pay for medicines.
Commenting that the doctors are not surprised that the VM review of the government is leading all three health care funding options, including the one that provides additional payment for patients, Czechs said that all three models are allowed to be created by the government.
Janson also adds that, with all three models, it is possible to show clearly that Latvia is not ready to impose additional burden on the population.
It has already been reported that VM will defend the option of the health care financing model, which does not provide for the increase in the overall tax burden, but calls for a part of the social tax to be transferred to health, as set out in the summary of the concept report on the change in the financing model for the Latvian health care system.
At the same time, both the Ministry indicated that the best option to fund health care will be selected as a result of the discussion by the end of September.
Locals are already ready.
This year, after giving up, we will recognise Grobin's new wife, the former Syrian farmer Rolands Damby.
We're already on the Liepaja market.
By creating several early varieties, but the preferred bubbles have been well pasted, the regional newspaper Cursa Time.
"This year, it's a lot better than last year," says the grower Artis Kousis in the Rucava village of Rucava.
In the case of weather, this is also much better than before when it was cold and windy.
The exhibition of the Liepaya Theatre in Riga begins.
On 12 and 13 August, the Riga Theatre will visit the Liepaja Theatre, offering viewers both the "Playing Night" awards, and the bright intriguing – the Lisbon Theatre Director, Herbert Laukstein, will inform the "Delfi" portal of the theatre.
On the evening of August 12th, viewers will be shown the "Ziloņsman" of the human drama studied by director Laura Groza-Kiber.
This is the story of a real historical person - John America - who lived in the Victorian era in London and in his body was called Zilonic because of a deformed disease.
In the study, the title is an actor Egons Dombrovskis, who received the title "The Night of the Games" for the American role.
As the critic of Normund's Akots described his performance, Meriks is "cour the heart is released" a role in which the sex picture is not repeated."
On 13 August, viewers will be offered a "Portraits" study.
The exhibition has received six "Game Night" nominations, including "Gada's big show".
The director designed the study as a self-containing portrait gallery, as important as giving each play model, so that each of them has a centre and a background.
The exhibition consists of several mini exhibitions, which end up in a single pool.
It is an observation of a person’s nature, where the main conflict between real emotions and austrian calculation, often revealing how people change in different situations - each of the waves is a wave, which, because of its wealth and goodness, is a storm in the surroundings, sometimes the ax that confuses someone else.
On the other hand, both of these data will be played in the Mazzana dormitory at Liepaja's theatre director Herbert Laukstein's mono expression "Man who has a variety of elevators" in Galin's Polish mode.
It's not funny, but it's a full story of how a man's only friend becomes a lift.
Despite the capsitating style that dominates the visual appearance, the dominant tone of the study, however, is clear and even optimistic.
"A man who has a variety of livers" is not about the determination of loneliness and old age, but about that life is worth loving.
Even if it seems that there's nothing about it," wrote critic Ligh Ulberte about the appearance.
Tickets for all studies can be purchased in the "Biles Paradises" box and on the Internet.
Detective Olga: My work is not serious, but real life.
I've already been waiting for Olga Zelíka - the owner and investigator of the Riga Detective Agency.
Her ears are shaking and leaving a very positive impression of a person.
The white biscuits and the white jacket - a very elegant woman who covers all my ideas about what to be a woman-detective.
She's waiting for me with a champagne, which I'm going to answer slowly.
I'm sorry I talked to him because I think it's interesting that women are working with such an unusual thing.
It's always the work of men.
Olga is the highest legal education - the Master's degree.
He's been working in the criminal police.
Realizing that he wanted something for himself and his company.
That's how it's known.
"I really didn't want to go back to the police," says Olga.
It's routine.
There, in the criminal police, we were investigating cases, collecting information.
We're dealing with suspects.
"This year, a 10-year publication to the Riga Detectives Agency."
She's calling for a party party: "There won't be a party."
They're all violent people.
Asked about her business, Olga says: "Business is very specific."
For the first five years, I was a team.
After that, I realized that working on the team is sometimes dangerous.
This is a business when someone who is otherwise unprofessional may be in a very bad situation.
If the journalists have a fifth power, then we're second.
Spher, of course, is not simple.
Many try to seduce us because we are working against the corruption of the community.
Let people think about it!
Many come and ask if the hearing equipment can be set up to attract dogs.
Many have seen films.
Detectives' business is serious.
"It's a collection of information," says Olga.
If there is a crime under the law, I have to warn you.
The walls are green and heavy - to have at least the core to which the negotiations are to be held.
I've been a client who's a man who's always on the site.
She was looking for protection, of course.
We also have security.
Her husband was a maniac.
At first, everything is beautiful and good, but then it starts.
"It's the most dangerous thing," says Olga.
Psihe is buried, and it happens that you can stand like a thief.
That was the end of the evil.
Don't give God a life of suicide.
That's very dangerous.
People become victims at some point.
"Many women try to walk away from their families and then come back," she says.
I rejected the last order.
"That happened for the first time in my life," explains Olga.
There was such a terrible situation.
The woman had been sold, she had a son.
"His husband's son's seat and made him invalid," Olga recalls.
I believe that a woman has a mother’s instinct, and firstly, she needs to protect her child.
When it all happened, she came to me asking to be in her husband’s arms.
There are people who are accused of being cruel.
The most dangerous thing is that my mother looked at it.
I can't understand that.
Her child is now disabled.
We couldn't find the lake once, and the dog was very helpful.
In the drug section, no dogs can be excluded at all.
"I understand that there are enough people and there are those who are not healthy dogs," she said.
Of course, the facts of fraud are current.
There is also divorce in the family, and information needs to be collected.
It's clear what's the wrong side.
The last thing I’ve ever heard about has been the subject of dating other friends.
That's interesting, because once men smile, now - women.
Even the best friends are fighting!
Women's "take" friends for 100 and over a thousand euros.
Women need to be careful to go abroad because they can sell them in a currency.
"Latvies women are intelligent and very trustworthy," Olga says.
There have been cases when you go abroad to be appreciated again.
That's not legal.
Olga relates that she had a husband who was like Jesus Christ.
It's a lot of growth, it's a lot of hair.
When I was 22 years old, tragedy struck.
He had a serious headache.
He came back as a completely different person.
"I'm from him," Olga recalls.
It could be compared to a bullet, it was dangerous.
The question is, what is the most common thing that has come up with, Olga says: "Everything is special, but the most extreme is the thing where trust is used."
When the stolen "take" is stolen.
Debts and doesn't give money.
If you have a lawyer's education and experience in the police, you can work as a detective.
"One thing is just like a detective, the other one is to be," says Olga.
Situations when we are facing a crisis of mistrust are likely to be tragic, as women are often not ready to resolve the situation.
She's not ready to accept the outcome.
This is an unexpected situation, since a person is not ready to lose his family.
Not every woman was prepared to accept the reality.
Often, young girls who feel the urge to spend money are using wealthy men.
One man who pursued his wife said that she could not be more loving because all the women had deceived her.
"He was shopping three times," Olga recalls.
At that time, there is already a man's problem if all women lie to him.
Olga tells us about the case when a man left his wife and all the children, and she asked him if he ever had a hand on him.
In general, I always put him in place, he answered.
In such cases, I will reply to work.
I think it's interesting how things are resolved - or they're taken for photographs and showed to the community if there's evidence of fraud.
How does this happen?
"There is a protection of data for natural persons in parallel to detective work," says Olga.
This is a provocative question.
One law allows us to do everything, another - nothing.
For personal interests, we may accept such photos and videos, but not for public view.
If a material which does not comply with the law is presented to the court, there may be serious problems.
In order to become a detective, lack of education and experience, it is also necessary to be mentally healthy and to meet the criteria.
We don't take the prints, the police are working on them.
I'm telling customers - get rid of the serials, here's real life!
In fact, when I worked in the (police) system, dogs were also used, they were very helpful.
"In the drug department there can't be any dogs at all," says Olga.
Some customers approach me with regard to the search for secrets, but I do not like to take such matters.
They're very serious.
There are now more and more clients than men, because women may hate men.
I used to be different.
Now the women are spreading, but the men are sitting at home with the children.
"Of course, most people suffer well," says Olga.
I like Deil in Karneg.
He says - stop stopping and start living real.
We all know that if you're on one child, you have to force the other but you can't!
You have to say that you don't like it.
It must not be done.
Do not be afraid to lose out on what makes life so difficult!
You can't be a minor, and we're gonna do what we're allowed to do with ourselves.
Yes, my first case was directly related to the husband’s infidelity when the woman was not ready to accept the fact that the man was lying to her.
She called all the time and asked what to do.
"I am now asking all customers whether they are willing to accept the situation when they know that a man is really cheating on them," Olga says.
It's not an excuse, it's a life.
If you come with a loan detective, you have to take responsibility.
It's not a theater, this, but real life.
I also need a specialist.
It is a heart condition and associated with Japanese medicine - hand treatment.
It's very interesting.
Why did I start working with that?
This is related to a large amount of adrenaline, and you need something to do with it.
The needs are not only designed, but renewable energy, light.
"People come out of my office positively and satisfied," says Olga.
She has needed signs at the wall office, and Olga relates that it is written, not with the aid of the mouse, but with the prints.
I didn't just do it until I got it, the book about the need was literally put in my hands.
I felt it like a sign.
However, it is very personal.
More than you need to know here.
Olga's crying, too.
It's her haircut.
We're all created by fear.
I've been playing guitar since I was 11 years old.
I've written songs and clips.
I'm positive and funny, but I need to rest to get back.
Others save alcohol, I need it.
Alcohol's burning.

Detective work has a narrow limit when work comes into your life.
"It's a job that shouldn't go to life," she says.
The question of how to combine work with private life is, Olga says, "My dear man is in Italy."
We have a very strong feeling.
It's time for the most love in my life.
I've had enough of them to think about, and I'd feel better already.
Detectives don't usually trust me, but he's accepted my work.
I really do part-time work.
I didn't get into this business either.
I've got a need for it.
When I was a child, I saw more than others.
Thanks to the needs, open intuition.
There's a lot of detectives, but really working -- little.
In each case, it's work with the brains, and it's hard to shut down.
You need some rest too.
"So you can't come back," Olga admits.
The biggest case I've been working on is the story of the Constant.
I've been working on it for years.
The man was deliberately jealous of his wife.
I made it so that my mother - in - law had gone to England - beyond the threat.
You don't have another option.
We shouldn't regret it.
I'm sorry to hear that.
You can't do that.
We need to talk about what we have every day.
Thank God.
Three good things must be said every day to someone else.
A good work must be done, or it must be done by day itself.
We shouldn't get involved with men.
It's a big mistake.

In no way should you be subject to yourself and your children.
You don't have to sit down and wait for something.
Humans are created to do good and to support one another.
If God created us, we are already needed and not part of this world.
You should never sit on the spot!
How to prepare for the family photosession.
The summer is still full of excitement, as well as the regular school year, which families may be tired of in the photos.
In order to make everyone look happy and beautiful, it is worth thinking about how to prepare the photograph before.
The advice of "Ihabpyma" is given by a mother of many children, Aleksandra Nesterenko and a professional photographer, Marina Levickaja.
It has to be photographed in nature, because it's much more natural and harmonious.
In the study, children find it much harder to get in and relax.
It is recommended to choose a uniform style for the whole family, which is one color in nature.
Aleksandra, for example, tells us that she will choose clothes for all six family members so that the clothes will not be more than three colors in the tone and possibly less writings on the clothes.
Don't forget about a good mood.
Sit down, talk, play, but don’t get tired or worry if your child is not as obedient as you would like.
And, look, the next advice is already taken from the professional photographer's search for cargo!
You have to understand exactly what you want to do during the photo session and tell about their photographs.
For one they will be beautiful, attractive children and ideally formed family image, for others - "life is what it is", i.e., in the choices to see the real, real emotions, or how to love to say the photograph itself, - "fleet mugs", "swift eyes", "swift clouds".
Of course, it may happen that someone wants "two in one", but it happens rarely.
In any case, when you go to the photosession, you need to understand that it's only a few hours from your life, and because less will be the impression because it's better.
You are yourself - not even strong mothers who are working, ready to eat, grow up, and still, and not always taken by a father who speaks unkindly on the phone.
And not the man who lives behind some unknown bridge.
Be a family, remember how wonderful it is to share one another’s thoughts, feelings, and feelings with others.
And then the task of photography will only be to convey real miracles to the emotions that govern between you.
If you chose a photograph, you would trust him.
It is left to ask 250 times to show what has happened after she has made her best choice of clothes, instead of the best shoes.
Keep and keep all the necessary clothes in advance so that the photosession day should no longer work with them.
Plan the route and think about how much time you will need to get to the photosession site (especially when photography takes place in the study and the time is limited).
If you have little children, then choose a photosession time that corresponds to the day-to-day mode so that it does not occur during the usually low-duty day.
And, of course, do not forget to take with your children food, vegetables, water, and most loving roulettes (skins and sweets only in extreme situations).
Father prepares that he may need to remove the tears, but it is usually not written in such a subscript, and only photographs know what the problem is, recognize Marina.
Do not drink too much water before photosession and before you get a good shot.
And it would still be recommended after photosession to bring together all of them.
Go to the attractive park, find out some sweetness, get in touch with the wheelchairs - for which the family is more networked.
It will also have a great picture and pleasant memories of the day spent together.
Krasnopjorov and Fadejeva: The creation of a minimum wage - a surprise or a brake economy?
The issue of the minimum wage creation in public debates is almost either the status of the holy beef: whether it should be supported by an increase or the mention of something that is not stated, general phrases.
Given the significant increase in the risk of economic stagnation (only the buttons avoided from technical recession), we believe it is important to stress that the creation of a minimum wage is not a miracle which will reduce the inequality of income at home, approaching the level of Latvia's Western Europe and will complement the national budget.
On the other hand, if the minimum wage is too much, it is more damaging than good, as its creation reduces the competitiveness and employment of companies, particularly in sectors and low-income regions.
In the first miracle it seems that, despite several minimum wage increases in the post-crisis period, the minimum wage in Latvia is not so high that the creation of some ten euro coins a year would significantly weaken the competitiveness of companies - only EUR 370 while in some European Union (EU) countries there are about half a thousand minimum wage.
However, compared with the average wage country (%) - the minimum wage in Latvia (44%) exceeds the EU average.
Since in Latvia, the share of the minimum wage recipients is significantly higher than in neighbouring countries (Latvia - 17%, Lithuania - 11%, Estonia - 6% [1]), the level of the same minimum wage is attributable to most companies.
According to the findings of the Latvian Bankings firm, each fifth Latvian company replied that it was important or very important to increase the prices of the products by increasing the minimum wage at the beginning of 2014.
This means that, for the first time, the minimum wage ceilings were partially funded by consumers (i.e. the Latvian population); secondly, the increase in prices meant a loss of competitiveness for several companies both in the domestic and foreign markets (i.e., an increase in imports and limited exports).
In view of the higher competitiveness and productivity of tobacco production, almost every fifteen-year-old Latvian company had an important role to play (which means greater unemployment and immigration).
In addition, almost every eleven companies replied that it was important for him to limit the admission of new workers to work in the construction of minimum wages.
It is worth noting that the minimum wage in Latvia has not changed in 2011-2013.
Therefore, even if, on the basis of the 2014 minimum wage establishment, each 5 undertaking has noted the importance of improving productivity, it does not yet mean that similar results could be expected in 2017 (the fourth minimum wage increase could be achieved by order).
Another important result is - due to the high level of the minimum wage, it was important for several companies to increase the wage of employees who benefit more than the minimum wage.
The impact of the minimum wage was thus significant even for companies where no minimum wage was received by any of the employees.
In recent years the minimum wage level in all three Baltic countries has exceeded the nominal labour productivity (real labour productivity + inflation).
Thus, the further unreasonably low wage increase in labour productivity (even though the overall low level of euro) will have a negative impact on the competitiveness and employment of companies.
In assessing the rationality of the establishment of a minimum wage, an analysis of the average economic indicators is not sufficient.
It should also be assessed whether the establishment of a minimum wage is in the "floating" sectors and regions where the minimum wage is most commonly used.
The findings of the Latvian Bank's survey show that the highest concentration of employees with minimum wages is in small enterprises (from 10 to 19 employees; 25%).
At the end of 2013, the proportion of workers in the industry and services sectors with minimum wages was higher (16% and 19% respectively) than in trade (15%), construction (11%) and financial and insurance sectors (2%).
On the other hand, Latvia, where the minimum wage is 64% of the average wage (and more than two thirds of the average private sector), may be affected by its subsequent rise in unemployment demand (i.e., to maintain its high unemployment) and to promote the economic stability of the lakes.
Some indications show that the minimum wage thresholds implemented in 2014-2015 (over 27%) have been braked in Latvia's development.
For example, Latgale is the only Latvian region in which unemployment was higher in 2015 than in 2013.
It should be noted that there is no region in Estonia and Lithuania that has so far left the average wage from the rest of the country.
For example, in Estonia, the average wage of all regions exceeds the minimum wage set in the country at least twice.
The lowest wages in Lithuania are in the Taurages region, but also there were 54% of the average wages in 2015 (because of two rapid minimum wage increases in 2016, this figure could reach 58%).
In the public debate, a temporary call for a minimum wage up to 68% of the average wage country (e.g. here) is lacking in economic reasons, and this is not implemented in the short term or in the long term.
Firstly, there is no one in the EU that is so high or even so close to the average wage.
Secondly, this would mean setting a minimum wage above average wages in several sectors of the economy (which would mean the release of bankrots and masses of these sectors), such as clothing, leather products, fish processing, food services and veterinary services; and this is more than the current average wage in the private sector of Latgale.
The creation of a minimum wage from January 2017 to EUR 400-410, as currently offered by the Ministry of Welfare, would make a minimum wage in Latvia (% of the average wage) one of the highest in the EU.
If nominal productivity increases by 4% but the minimum wage is at least twice as rapid, there is a clear negative impact on the competitiveness and employment of companies.
Such negative effects will be most widespread in sectors and regions where the current minimum wage has already been used frequently, such as in Latvia.
The fact that significant minimum wage levels cannot be allowed at the moment means that other mechanisms should be used for low wage beneficiaries' support.
The immediate effect can be achieved by travelling with public income tax to a minimum unfavourable (budget limits).
Insufficient level of education, inadequate quality of education and poor quality of education, as well as poor health conditions (which often arise because of lack of access to medical services and long-term interest rates) are among the real causes of income inequality.
During the investigation, 521 responses were received by the Latvian company to the minimum wage rate in January 2014.
The survey took place within the framework of the Wage Dynamics Network (WDN) project of the European System of Central Banks.
These figures represent companies with a number of employees not less than 10.
It also explains the specific nature of low-income workers with minimum wages in construction.
11 fires registered in Latvia on the same Sunday show the operational information of the State Fire and Rescue Service (DUGD).
In the light of the news, the larger fires had occurred in the ancient Middle East of Ogres, where a total of 80 square miles [80 sq km] of wood was burned in the undamaged area of the house and in the Jákabpil, where there was a clear fire in the area of 30 square meters.

The Russian Vice-President, Riga, is in secret with the ZZS ministers.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitria Medvedeve, vice-president of Arkadijs Dvorkovich in the fish processing industry "Kaija" last week, believed with three ZZS politicians - finance ministers Danu Reiznieci-Ozol, Minister of Transport Uldi Auguli and Minister of Transport Jani Dúklava, wrote on Friday the portal "sees.lv".

The Minister of Finance has found that negotiations have been an opportunity to remove sanctions for fishermen, as well as whether Russia will continue to "pump" gas in the Inçúkalna gas tank.
Dvorkovich has made it clear that this is not a matter of government but of the energy company.
Contrary to diplomatic practice, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not been involved in the negotiations.
Düklav was justified by not seeing the need, because "the Minister of Foreign Affairs is therefore on vacation," wrote the portal.

Legendary editor Hafingtone says "The Huffington Post".
Arianna Hafingtone, the assistant editor and editor-in-chief of the US media holding "The Huffington Post" after 11 years of work, announced withdrawal from the company.
The Huffington Post, established in 2005 and awarded by the Pulicer Prize, which offers daily political and economic journals, as well as a reflection of Internet sensations, is considered to be a medium-term goal in the context of the rapid development of digital technology solutions.
At the beginning of 2005, the media offered innovative and interactive content solutions for their time in the absence of a burden, but the feisbux gained popularity only among students in the national colleges.
Not long after the re-election of the representative of the Republical Party, George Busa, in the office of President Hafingtone, the media media represented liberal values, and with such a global view, the material will be prepared.
Now Hafingtone has found on Twitter that after departure he is ready to start a new business - his plan to create a "Thrive Global" initiative that would address the health and burden of employees.
At the moment, we don't know what might be in his place under "The Huffington Post".
During his work, the portal rejected anonymous comments, emphasizing Hafington that freedom of speech is given to people who are concerned about what is said and who do not hide behind anonymity.
Also, in her management in February 2015, she was informed about the US presidential candidate Donaldu Trampu to publish a statement in the statement section.

In 2016 Verizon also purchased parts of the Internet business "Yahoo" in 2016.
According to these transactions, "The Huffington Post", a very effective and independent medium, became a small part of a large corporation.
Currently, the content of the famous brand is available in nine international editions, the total number of unique visits per month is 81 million.
Four people were killed in the earthquake in Thailand.
During the last 24 hours in the city of Huahin and the southern provinces of Thailand, nine explosions have occurred, killing at least four people and killing several tens, by the authorities on Friday.
In southern Thailand, there were two explosions on Friday about eight o’clock after the local time.
One of the shooters exploded in front of the marine police building, killing local officials and killing a man, reported in Surathana, governor of the province Vongsiri Promčana.
"I think it's related to explosions in Huahin," said the governor.
A second explosion occurred in front of the provincial police station.
In the southern part of Thailand, on Friday morning, two explosions occurred in Phúketa, a tourist resort.
On Friday morning in Huahin, two explosives exploded at the sound tower, killing one and killing three people.
It has already been reported that on Thursday evening, just before midnight, two explosions occurred in the city of Huahai, killing one woman and killing 19 more people, including foreigners.
In Huahin the fourth day, the murdered woman was a peasant.
Of the 19 injured, three were in serious condition, and seven of the injured were foreign - four women and three men.
In Mumbai there were two holes hidden, 50 feet [50 m] from each other.
The brakes were detonated with mobile phones at half an hour.
Four days before that, one man was in an accident that occurred in the province of Tranas in southern Thailand.
Police rescue children from traffic; parents are threatened by the courts.
On the night of Riga, local police rescued children from the car crash, while their children's parents threatened the police with court cases for the construction of the car bottle, the agency informed the Riga State Police (RPP).
On the afternoon afternoon, a busy man told me that the shopping center Spice had noticed a car in the parking lot where there was a baby in half an hour without an adult presence.
On arrival at the location of the event, a car specified by the driver was found that was located in the sun.
There was a child sitting in the front seat of the passenger seat, where the child was found.
The child was taken by the sun directly.
The Jewish voice was loud and clear, and her voice was heard thundering and thundering.
In view of the fact that the owner of the vehicle did not find the place, the decision shall immediately be taken to create the rear of the vehicle in order not to endanger the health and life of the child.
A child with all seats is removed from a wheelchair and called a doctor.
As the child breathes, the skin was warm and hot, so until the medical procedure was over, the pressure on the skin was reduced.
At the same time, physicians and the parents of the child were involved in the event.
The father of a child, while building a room on his own vehicle, remained aggressive and did not allow the child to be present.
Discussions with parents have been conducted and it has been explained that children up to seven years of age are prohibited from leaving alone without supervision.
In addition, the child was left to health and life in dangerous circumstances.
After the discussions, the doctor examined and found that hospitalization was not necessary.
However, the child’s parents categorically refused to provide any explanation of the incident and threatened the court with the construction of the car glass.
During the interview with the parents, there was no evidence that they were in need of alcohol or that they could otherwise harm the child, so a four - month - old child was given both care.
The material was sent to the Children's Legal Crime Prevention Section, whose employees will assess the responsibility of the parents.
The RPP recalls that even when not very hot outside, the car left in the sun is affected very fast.
If a child or a pet is left in such a car, it may endanger his life.
LPF members may request the installation of Poni.
The members of the Latvian Federation of Pledging (LPF) may, in the near future, request the President of the Federation to remove Kasparu Poni, whose current leader, the LETA, the former Vice-President of the Federation, Janis Dzis.
In view of the criticism of Poni and his activities in the Federation in recent days, several LPF members have signed a letter requesting that the LPF Joint Assembly be referred to as the highest federation institution and that it is entitled to decide any question raised in the LPF Joint Assembly.
The members of the Federation are not satisfied with the style of the Pones leadership, as well as his going to the Riodzejaneiro Olympic Games, where he was not able to give the Latvian record of the well-being trainer Alūnas Ribakovas in the Olympics, German Jakubovski, is considered to be an atheistic and disrespectful act by the president.
The Danish authorities pointed out that the LPF members, as well as the Federal Secretary General Aivars Platonovs, have achieved a great deal of work for the development of the Federation and sport, but the Ponis dose is not very welcome to the federation.
The day in which I worked for a long time in the federation explained that the federation had been trying to concentrate power on one person.
Accordingly, the members of the Federation could also be required to amend the regulatory statutes governing the activities of the LPF which would exclude such an option in the future.
The sun explained that the discrepancies with the Polish Federation had existed for a long time, but the events of the last days have served as the members of the "last pillar" Federation to decide what to do.
The former Vice-President of the Federation indicated that there was a very low number of trainers and the work of the Council of Judges during the activities of Pones.
In order to ensure faster procedures and decisions in the federation, the LPF members at a joint meeting had decided to authorize the government consisting of Pone and two vice-presidents to lead the federation.
However, according to Jean, Pone joined the federation.
The members of the Federation relied on Pon, believing that decisions could be taken earlier in the federation.
"He reassured the brothers of their trust, for he practically took the power in his hands to make an unethical step," said Jean.
"This approach cannot be from the person to whom other sports representatives should be served as an example," Dzis admits.
Pone has tried to satisfy his ambitions in the office of President Pone, which also does not favour him as President of the LPF.
The long-term LPF Secretary-General Vladimir Maslovskis informed the LETA that a letter could be submitted to the Federation next week, thus meeting the LPF Joint Meeting within a month.
In his view, there is "all the issues that have been hurt" in the joint meeting and should be decided on the next action.
Mr. Friday was not yet informed that the LPF members are planning to convene a joint meeting in which they might decide to leave the office.
At the moment, I don’t know anything about attending such a meeting, so I don’t have a comment.
As for the fact that the men are not satisfied with my work, so far there has been only one case with the already mentioned trainer Jakubovski when there has been some dissatisfaction.
Before the London Olympic Games, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he filed a complaint at the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and called on Latvia not to send any athletes.
"After this case, Jakubovski lost the choice of the senior trainer's office because his action was not in line with the interests of LPF," Pone said.
He also pointed out that the LPF members in the joint meetings where they had reported on the case were not received until now.
"In contrast, we have recognised that the quality of the Federation's work has improved," said the LPF president.
Mr. also made it clear that the Olympics of Riodezáneiro should not be spread, but should work.
Most people in Latvia do not understand and do not understand what the role of the federation presidents is.
People do not understand that we are volunteers in these tasks, and for example, unlike the leaders of the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK) we do not receive wages.
At the same time, we need to make sure that the sport type federation is eligible for funding, as only 10% of the necessary amounts are received from the country's LPF.
During the Olympic Games, I had a formal and informal meeting with representatives of the international Federation and various international programmes, including international sponsors.
"The negotiations have also been introduced and I have worked to make Riga one of the world's eras in 2018," said Pone.
In 2015, LPF’s revenue totalled EUR 249,444, which is less than EUR 36,000 than in 2014.
About 40% of this amount only constituted the targets received, with an increase of around 10 000 euros compared to 2014.
In addition, LPF received about 43% of its revenue or EUR 109,442 in the form of companies, investments and other annual contributions.
The federation received only EUR 35 532 in the form of calls and grants.
The federal expenditure was increased by around EUR 70 000 in 2014, totalling EUR 263,876 in 2015.
The higher expenditure was not linked to the payment of money to persons, neither to material expenditure, nor to salaries - EUR 215 733 as "other expenditure".
Money payments cost people €20,549, while pay is €14,684.
If the 2014 federation had concluded with a positive balance sheet, the LPF would have concluded with a negative balance sheet in 2015.
As reported, the Ministry of Education and Science (IZM) asked the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK) for clarification on the participation of LPF President Pone in the Olympic Games of Riodezáneiro, on which he had not taken part, by trainer Ribakovas of the Latvian footballer Jakubovski.
Latvia's citizens in Thailand have not been injured, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (AM)'s entry on the social website Twitter shows.
The Ministry has indicated that, in accordance with the information provided by the Latvian Gothian Consul in Thailand, Latvia's state-owned explosives have not been damaged.
LETA has already said that it calls on travellers to regularly follow along with information on the development of the political and security situation in the country, as well as to ensure the safety of the place of residence, indicating that there is a high threat of terrorism in the country.
Latvia calls on the AMO to avoid places of detention, be particularly careful and serious, while maintaining public places, and to follow the instructions of local authorities.
Travellers who are in Thailand’s districts or are planning to continue their journey are invited by the Ministry to contact travel operators or airlines by specifying whether the travel path will be carried out in accordance with the plan.
The Ministry also calls on travellers to regularly follow along with information on the development of the political and security situation in the country, as well as to ensure the safety of the place of residence.
There is a high threat of terrorism in the country.
Given the unstable security situation in the country, it is not recommended to go to the Thailand and Cambodia border, as well as to the provinces of the Thailand and Malaysia border - Patania, Jala, Narathivata and Sonkhla.
In an emergency situation, the Ministry invites you to contact the Consular Department daily on the telephone +371 26 33 77 11 or e-mail palidziba@mfa.gov.lv.
It also strongly recommends that anyone travelling abroad, before travelling to purchase a life and health insurance policy, which also provides for repatriation in the event of sickness or death, as well as register in the Consular Register.
However, the masses will not be able to read Argentina football.
After a short sale, however, the football superstar Lionel Mesi decided to return to the country of Argentina on Friday, the player himself announced.
In July Argentina, the second year after the fall of the Copa America tournament failed to re-examine the Chilean transition.
Shortly after the loss, the Messiah announced that he would finish his career in the State, but then he was told that he could return to the election.
"I seriously consider the possibility of leaving the election, but my love for Argentina and the election is too great," said 29-year-old Messi.
The Spanish Great Barcelona attacker of the Messi National Union in total 112 games won 55 words, which is the best indicator all the time.
Together with adult education, the Messiah has not been a great success, although Argentina has still become a world vice-president in 2014.
Mesis five times called the world's best football player.
For the Chinese Son and Dzelina, Rio has doubled its flight distance 20 km.
On Friday, Chinese runners Vans Dzeņs and Cai Dzelins raced for the 20 km race of a double-wave Riodzejaneiro Olympic game.
The Olympic champion was crowned by Jens, who held the distance in 19 minutes and four seconds at the end of 12 seconds at the time of his arrest.
In contrast, Australian sailor Deins Börds-Smits, who lost his son 23 seconds.
The family's favorite Kaju Bonfims improved the Brazilian record, but he lacked five seconds to climb to a good piano.
Four years ago in London, he received a bronze medal.
At the same time, he had two copper champions in the metal world.
Júdo Coach Baskin: Níkiforenko is not a real heavy burden.
Latvian Jewish trainer Olíegs Baskin kindly acknowledged that Artura Žikiforenko Rio’s Olympics were not as extraordinary as to overcome the Russians of the most powerful Azerbaijani athlete, Usangi Kukauri.
Practically, it was not only minimal if it had been issued to drive it to a way or to a party.
We were already planning on it.
He was prepared for the right fight, but the enemy was stronger.
The opponent was well - known, for he had fought twice before and lost Arthur.
But he's tougher.
Arturus is artificially transferred to the worst weight category to join the Olympic team.
The weight category has already been taken up to 100 kilograms, so Arthur used the European quota in the heavy weight category.
Arthritis weighing 100 pounds [100 kg] was fought against a Jew who has 140 pounds [140 kg] and who has won several times in heavy tournaments.
In heavy weight, there is a very small moment of insensibility.
If in light weight categories in years all the opposite, then in heavy - very rare.
On the question of whether Níkiforenko would be better able to fight one step in the lightest weight category, Baskin responded positively.
I think you should - Artura would better fight in the category up to 100 kilograms.
It's his real weight category.
He's not really heavy.
65% of Russians want to leave Maduro, the question is whether they are willing to fight for it.
Two of the three Venetians want to congratulate President Nicolas Maduro, but the question is whether they are ready to fight for it.
The day after the National Election Board announced that "no time" for the vote that would take place this year, with which Chivims will be at the gates of power by 2019, people on the streets of Karakas continued waiting for their arrival days as if nothing had happened.
"I didn't hear it because I saw the Olympics and how Michael Felps got two more medals," said Rafaels Deans, a 36-year-old office worker who was resting in the Altamir field.
At the beginning of 2014, the Altamir area in the east of Karakas was the center of the aus, which protested against the Maduro regime.
However, now that opposition has to exert greater pressure than ever in order to achieve a referendum this year, people throughout the country are no longer displaying such energy.
"I want a referendum, but for security reasons, there are no protests," said Deans.
Others, more informed, want to mobilize in the future, but recognize that the Russians are not so motivated.
The president of the Board of Appeal, Tibijes Lusena, commented on the claim that the government is interrupting the withdrawal process.
I will protest only when opposition calls for protest, but I know that some of my friends are afraid," Roberto Reyes, (60), said Fox News Latino.
Thus, in addition to all the barriers the government has called for to delay the referendum, the opposition is now facing a new challenge: to motivate people to go out and protest.
More recently, the referendum initiative was a broad support - people were still in the middle of the summit at the signing phase.
However, when it comes to protesting the government's attempts to block the efforts, the number on the coins is smaller.
"Some people are focusing on the development of food lines, while others are at risk after 2014 arrests and deaths for many," said Cipriano Eredia, the opposition lawyer.
After Lusena announced that, until the next stage of the referendum process - even more to gather signatures across the country - those against the socialist government will have to wait until October, they will claim that President Maduro and his followers are simply trying to remove the Russians' fears by letting them believe that the vote is practically impossible this year.
According to the Constitution, if the referendum was to be held in 2017, Maduro could be removed from office, but he would be allowed to appoint the next president.
If he is allowed today, he has a duty to issue a general election.
The Department of State of the United States will address this issue on Thursday afternoon by calling on the Venezuelan authorities to guarantee compliance with Russian constitutional law.
"The remaining steps for the implementation of the president's resignation referendum should be made clear, concrete and immediate, thus contributing to the rapid and effective solution to the current political, economic and social difficulties of the country," it was written.
Luis Salamanka, a policy analyst, who has been a member of the Governing Council for the period 2006-2009, is not expected to change as soon as possible.
"I think this year the referendum will not be, unless social unrest and protests become even stronger," he said FNL.
He said that Lucena and the government are violating the law, but as a result, they will achieve their goal if people do not protest.
The opposition called for a broad demonstration in September. Firstly, in Karakas, to ask for speeding up the process so that the withdrawal could take place this year.
We want people from all over the country to be mobilized in the capital today.
The government will feel pressure," Eredia said.
On the other hand, Salamak feels that it is not possible to wait so long in this situation.
"They should respond more quickly and more strongly to the Lusen Communication, as it has virtually killed the referendum," said expert FNL.
Congressman Eredia acknowledges that some opposition parties want to get a demonstration to take place faster, but others want more time to organize.
The opposition needs to be cautious right now.
If people feel insecure in this situation, there is a risk that the second signing campaign will be low," Salamak said.
In order to activate the referendum process, 20 per cent of national voters, nearly 4 million people, have to be supported.
Salamanca and other analysts are convinced that even if the withdrawal takes place in 2017, Chiavis will be expected.
However, some people are not so optimistic.
Our party wants political changes today.
"If the government closes the path to elections, we will have to explore other legal options," Eredia said FNL.
In time, LNSC Director A.Pukiti will be removed from office.
On 12 August, at the emergency meeting of the House of Commons, the majority of Members supported the resignation of the Director of the Lielvárde Nova Sport Centre (LNSC), Ainara Puíšės, from the time of the performance of the duties until the service inspection was carried out.
In the near future, it is intended to clarify the conditions of a sports drug visitor in his presentation.
Of course, during the visit of the trainer, the LNSC client lost his head trauma.
The valley is the centre of the new sports centre in the town of Lielvärde.
In view of the seriousness of the situation and the possible appeal of the client to the court, the Commission was set up by Vice-President Vitas Volontes, the Vice-President of the House of Appeal.
Its task is to carry out a service inspection at the Sport Centre and to deliver an opinion by 16 August this year.
The next Tuesday, it is planned to reconvene the Council's emergency session to decide on the next action.
It should be noted that during a particular accident, A.Puketis was on vacation.
The Executive Director of the Sports Centre shall be the Deputy Director of the Service from Friday to Friday at the post office in Oksana Grimalüka-Nazarova.
Ogres senior sports are sacred.
Today, at the stadium of the centre of Ogres New Year's Sport, the Ogres pensioners' company celebrated the Sport.
The seniors at the stadium were hosted by the organizer of the sports development work of the Ores Sports Centre, Sanita Tauriņa, who had prepared a special programme for the members of the Sport Festival.
The individual results will not be assessed at this time, but the participants will be divided into four teams.
"Each participant's contributor will be paid as a result of the team," explains S.Taurinja.
The participants will have to perform four tasks - basketball fast, the construction of the Eiffel Tower together with a memory game, the florball activity staff, summer cover.
In order to succeed in all four Christmas programmes disciplines, participants had to carry out admiring tasks - the "Union Circle", the "Rinngo Dance", the "Complet" and the three staphets - to work with the horse, to perform the leisure and badminton elements.
All the assignments were prepared in an attractive way, and the participants in the sport were happy, smiling and pleasant comments, others supporting each other.
A special feeling caused the darkness of the summer, which occurred at the expense of the organizers.
The competitions followed closely with the volunteers of the Ogrés innovative Sport Centre, who took the lead, fixed the results and did not follow the advice.
There was also the Ogres symbol of Čiekur, who inspired the members of the sports festival.
The elderly have proved to be fine, attractive, and good in sports.
The green team's representative Peter Zeps spent an eight-minute period of eight times in the modified bomb basketball, only for one successful year his team member Janis Staugz stayed.
The pensioners are active in the fire.
In the excursions, the bus is always full, and about 300 people enter the halls.
"Two weeks later, we arrive at the Family Support Centre, where we can play novels, table tennis, use coaches," says the president of the Ogres Pension Society, Janis Staudžs.
At the end of the sports holidays, all participants received thanks from the Ogresnovada Sports Centre for their participation, but the greatest benefit is in fresh air, good weather and shared time.
2016/2017 Premises No.19 West Bromwich Albion
Guardian journalists predicts heading 14 (Note: it is not only Alana Smith's forecast, but our journalists' advice as a whole)
Point 14 of last season
Facts to win the league (with Oddschecker) 1000-1
Until last week, it was considered after a new season, such as the old Bromwich Albion: 2016/2017 season will be again fighting for pleasure or stagnation, depending on how much "glass" is still the pragmatic Tony Pulasa.
However, Jerome wrote that 88% of his club's shares were sold by Guocuana Lai and Pulasam, where the bookmaker immediately made his favorite first unfathomable manager's role.
The situation is inevitablely changed by the Balack Country - not only Hawkhorns, but also some of the winds on the north of Volverhampton, where young Chinese owners have been spending too much time, turning their backs on Kenya Jäcket services.
The police, however, confirmed that his work was not immediately endangered, and the company has also expressed its desire not to change the club culture.
"I don't want to change the club's beliefs or start unsustainable fun," he said, taking over the responsibilities.
I want to be a good owner and to invest in this club for a long time.
First of all, our goal is to ensure that we stay in Premierly and then go further, I would like to see the club's strengthening dividends up.
I think it's the best deal in the world, and I'd like to take this club as far as possible.
This is the achievements of Pulisa, and the first aspect should not be challenged.
The next goal is to extend to the top of the table, but to the new owner and the increasingly broken fan base it will be important to expect a rapid display on the top of the table to find out that this is an extremely difficult task, given the essential work that has recently been invested among the other teams near the table.
In order to go beyond the 14th place of the previous season, there will certainly be more work to be done.
Only Aston Villa, located on the table, has a smaller name, and it is worth remembering that the Christmas Albion average made less than one wall per wall in 90 minutes, almost or twice the worst indicator.
They did not succeed in getting 13 of the 38 games, and they start more than one in nine.
Of them 10 won no one in the game were able to get more than one words, and seven games ended with 1-0.
As already expected, a total of 34 doors were obtained from standard positions.
There is no wonder that the Hawthorn's team was infamous, possibly most noticeable after the shocking 0-0 did not break up with Villa at the end of January when the guest team looked better.
On the other hand, only six best teams were the best indicators in the protection - although no club has issued a list of four semi-protections of the centre.
These defences are often not sufficiently assessed, in particular, by John Evanss, whom you would like to become Arsenal, taking into account their recent crisis with regard to the players involved.
The international team in Northern Ireland had a great start at the European Championship, and Albion would have to spend most of it to sell.
Bens Foster's names are reliable, and they are well integrated in the middle line.
Darens Flechers, a large-scale like Evans, showed in a large way that he was still able to play at a high level at the age of 32 and that Claudius James was poor enough.
It is disturbing to all parties that the future of the clock and the clock of Saido Berahino is still not clear.
The owner's order rates from Stoke and Crystal Palace were rejected, but they still maintain peace and Mark Hüdz is ready to expand.
After the last season is close to liquidation, it is worth taking action by all the parties involved.
The striker is undoubtedly talented, but, as Paul has said several times, he's been raising you on one side, on the other hand, for a long time it's seen that such relationships are not working.
Albion argues that it is necessary to sign the exchange documents before allowing the former English U-21 member to go, but his 15 million-year-old tour with Diafru Saho took place a few days before the transfer, claiming that he had passed medical examinations and had reached agreement on everything, but he had a dark mood that would mean he would be able to read the beginning of the season.
This causes great pressure on Venetian Solomon Rondon, who had looked very cheap in the past season, but he had to improve the supply of his nine names, especially if Ricky Lamberts continued to be so ineffective.
The decision to release Victor Anicébi and Stefan Sesegno also appears in retrospect.
The pool in all its career is a terrible celebration with its slow new players heading up to three lines - Jonathana Leko, Sama Filda and Taylor Roberts' appearances last season in the last season with a non-divisible 1-1 with Liverpool, quite or become a norm.
He will return to those who are already tested and tested, but Leko is worth keeping watch.
The 17-year-old middle-aged total participated in five games in the previous season, becoming the first-born Premier in 1999, which is also highly valued in the English Youth Football System.
While Philips, with a 5.5 million contract with Queens Park Rangers, will be quick, but he is the only new player who participated in the first weekend.
This would not have been guaranteed if the end could have been quite steady.
"All," said the Polish last week, Express and Star about what would improve.
Any position you see.
We need to strengthen backgamut players, middle players in the field and forward players.
The goals are, we know what we want.
They may be made much harder than planned, mainly because of a lack of clarity about the process of withdrawal.
Seasons could determine how they have started with seven large-scale winning games before the complex competitions with Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Leicester from mid-October.
At that time pressure on Pulis will be less or less persistent.
And what you know, maybe even Berahino will have found a new club.
Tata Steel UK closer to the rescue transaction after the change in pensions of authorised aid
After Tata Steel UK pensioners said that the scheme could be restructured, without involving the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), by increasing the company's prospects of closing the rescue transaction.
The British steel sector pension scheme has a commitment of 15 billion stars and, by calculation, at least 700 million stars lack, creating serious obstacles to the conclusion of rescue transactions between Tata Steel UK and Port Talbot Steelworks in Vels.
Tata Steel is increasingly convinced of its British business, which employs 11,000 people, to secure the future after negotiations with the economic minister and pension regulator.
The company plans to combine its European activities, including the British business with ThyssenKrupp, the German conglomerate.
However, the conclusion of the transaction depends on whether the British steel sector pension scheme will be restructured and the government will provide financial support.
Alan Johnson, the retired president of the pension, said that this scheme could avoid PPF if the benefits of employees were modified.
Although, compared with other schemes, this is well funded, with a deficit that has been reduced to 300 million stars for individual measures, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp wants to control its commitments.
Johnston said that the authorities admitted that it was "not real" to the joint venture or to any Tata Steel Uk purchaser to take responsibility for the financing of the current and future deficit.
The modification of the benefits resulting from the scheme was much more binding than the addition of the PGF, he added where workers should accept the most favourable conditions.
Father Steel cautions that it could still sell Port Talbot.
The company has consistently refused to guarantee the future of steel pipelines, since March negotiations on the future of its British business have begun, and this has been believed in a case as a short conversation with the British government.
Kušiks Čaterje, Executive Director of Tata Steel Europe, said that India's conglomerate wants to make its steel business "sustainable".
Speaking at the Tata Steel annual meeting in India, Čaterj said that negotiations on pension schemes were moving forward, but he assumed that the scheme was well-financed.
"We speak to various stakeholders, including the British Government and other stakeholders, such as the Welsh Government, etc.," said Čaterje, reports Times of India.
There is a view that pensions have a known impact on products such as steel business, so we need to find a structural solution that will not prevent business progress.
The authorised wish to cooperate in the discussion on the restructuring of the scheme will be supported by Tata Steel.
The potential changes in the scheme include a shift in how the annual inflation-based benefit increase is measured from the retail price index to the lower consumer price index, as well as limiting future pension payments to the minimum laid down in law.
Johnston adds: "The qualified and its advisers have provided Tata Steel, the government and pension regulator with evidence of the scheme's ability to pay modified benefits for an unlimited period of time and at low risk beyond the Pension Protection Fund.
Our investment strategy has meant that the scheme's funding position has not affected the recent downturn of the securities market in the same way as other British pension schemes. We are still convinced of the scheme's ability to provide benefits at an adequate level.
CBS commenter enjoys Michael Felpsu and Rayenu Lohti throughout the competition
The Canadian Radio Organisation CBC Olympics' commentary on Thursday evening caused a shower by mixing Michael Felps with his competitor Rainen Lohti.
Eliots Fridmens both enjoyed a total of 200 metres of individual falsification, where he won the Felps, killing his 22 Olympic gold medal.
When Felps crossed the line, Fridmens held him as Lohti, the people of Pelpsa, and already the competitors of the world at the top of the top.
And he said, "He will do it."
Raiens Lohthe has won Michael Felps in this race!
Felps could not even get into a good pedagogue.
However, Felps won, but Lohthe finished fourth.
As soon as Pelps was at the gold, CBS was in circulation.
In the event of surprise, the judge immediately acknowledged his error.
I'm sorry, I'm getting along the way.
"Felps with gold," he said.
A Canadian commenter, whose professionalism was widely appreciated after an error, admitted his error again in the next hour after the event and apologized to the viewers on Twitter.
I'm sorry.
I'm surprised.
"No justification," he wrote.
At the same time, Felps exceeded the 2,168-year-old record as the greatest winner of the Olympic victory.
The previous record belonged to Leonida from Rhodes Island, who in the ancient Olympic Games had more Olympic title than any other.
Russian hackers attacked an ex-NATO commander's computer.
Hackers published the list and data on one of Sorosa's funds.
The same hackers who had been able to carry out an attack on the US Democratic Party's e-mails and have published their lists may also be criticized in the new attack series, reports the Bloomberg Agency.
Following the information received, these cybersurgeons have launched attacks on the former NATO Commander General Filipa Bridlov's list of European forces and the services of the Open Society Institute, which is part of the million-supported projects supported by George Soros.
The publisher has published the information obtained on DCLeaks.com.
The list of Bridlova and data on the activities of the "Open Society" institution are included.
It is reported that hackers have access to the fund computers for about a year.
The news agency claims to be talking about the same hackers that launched the attack on U.S. Democrat Party computers and led by the Russian spyist.
The U.S. intelligence officer had already warned Congress senior officials of the possible attack on the Democratic Party.
The News Agency, Reuters, writes that it has information that the spies have recently reported various policies - cyber attacks coordinate two Russian intelligence officers or their controlled organisations.
However, Congressmen were unable to pass this information on to the victims of cybercrime because it was blind.
The scandal of attacks on the Democratic Party's computers began after some 20,000 emails were posted online, written by the representatives of the Party during the presidential campaign.
The party's candidate, Hilaria Clinton, announced that the broadcast of these letters was organised by Russian spyists.
The Russian President's secretary, Dmitry Peskovs, said that Russia had no say in terms of cyberterrorists.

If the owners of the apartment are very expensive and specifically told about the technical condition of the building, if there is such an opportunity to receive support and to arrange the building in any way possible, then it is quite easy not to use it.
One of the most important changes is that EU co-financing will be possible from this year for any multi-citizen house, the only condition is that the building phase must be forced to be burned.
In the past, it was possible to use only the homes of a serialized multi-animal population.
The most frequent housekeepers are also providing housing owners with meetings.
The crucial problem is that 67% of housing owners are currently in need of consent.
"The previous programme required 51%," says SIA "The Manager of Liepaja's House" (LNA) project manager Tom Cyrulis.
"Of course it is very difficult to ensure it because in most of the congregations there is no mention of the number of owners of such housing," says Gint Lochmelis, director of the company's "Home Service APSE" project.
The largest household managers in Liepaā - "Home Service APSE" and LNA, which serves around 900 buildings, plan to renovate at least 50 multi-resident homes in the new planning period by 2020.

I also needed some bank credit, 76% of the household population.

Those provisions have been amended by the representatives of the financial institutions of the ALTUM.
They explain that 51% of the votes in banks are not possible to attract the necessary funding, which has been experienced in the past planning period.
In most of the commercial banks, there is a need for two thirds of the owners of the apartment.
As one of the recommendations for home managers, the Head of the European Union Fund of the Department of Economic Affairs, Anda Lagzdin, has the opportunity to identify people with existing examples and the various benefits that will arise by renewing buildings such as energy saving.
In the new world, Aaron was long - suffering in the face of his mother’s death.
A potential suicide bomber's arrest operation in Canada was worthy of pressure movies.
It all started when the Canadian police received a revised video entry from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.
About tomorrow, the Canadian Royal Police have received reliable information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Among other things, it contained a video from the so-called "mocycle" video that was recorded by an unknown person who was clearly present at the final attack stage.
"And he was preparing to do it with a real shot," said Canadian police chief Michael Cabana.
In the video, a black masked man in English and Arabic spoke threats to Canadians and promised to take care of everything they have done to Muslims.
In about three hours, using facial and voice recognition computer programs, the Canadian police have been able to get to know this man.
It was 24 - year - old Aaron Drivers.
He has already been in charge of the probation service for the celebration of the ideas of terrorism and radical Islam on the Internet.
The Court ruled that it was prohibited for the driver to continue to do so and also to participate in any radical organisation.
However, the authorities did not until then consider that Dravirs could cause some physical danger to the surroundings.
When the police came to her home in the city of Stratrojas in Ontario, the young man was outside and sat at a taxi stop.
At the time, the officers tried to arrest him, but Drevers, sitting on the back seat, had been in a hurry.
To prevent the detonation of the second shell, the police called on the new man.
From the traumas he's dead.
There is no damage to taxometra driver.
The father of an untracled terrorist, Wayne Drevers, told Canadian television that his son would be facing Islam in the teenage years.
This initially helped him to break free from drugs and alcohol.
However, Aaron was a troubled teenager who had long been crying out to the world about his mother’s death.
Only when I heard the video today did I realize how far he had gone.
I didn't realize he was so radical.
"And I didn't know he was so good at speaking Arabic," said Aaron's father.
The Canadian police recognize - if they had entered a few hours later, the development of events might have been slightly different.
Radéviča to Rio files as a tourist and will support Latvia's facilities.
The former Olympics and Lightweights of Ineta Radjevica LTV in the Olympics said that the performance of the seven sportsmen of Lauras Ikonies-Admidinės Friday in the first two disciplines was not bad, given that the athlete was traumatized.
On the other hand, at the height of Laura’s life, she had a good leg rather than a left.
Radjevica pointed out that this is comparable - just as a person who has the experience of writing with a good hand would soon be forced to write with a cross.
Therefore, the outcome of the Ikonies-Admidinas, taking into account the trauma, is not bad.
Radjevica discovered that she had not in the past been contacted by Ikonunieci-Admidin, but actively followed with her on the way to and be with her.
Ineta was aware of Laura’s trauma recently and gave support to the athlete by stating that the opening did not begin to create its own security pillars, but showed the character and length of the fighter.
Regarding other forms of sport, Radévica considers that the Olympics are very high, so one of the Latvian athletes says that he is a tourist in Rio is wrong.
She remembered that she also went to the first Olympics, where she had crossed the 13th place, was called a tourist, and this caused negative emotions.
Ineta reminds herself of its beginnings, not only from the Olympics.
"I like to remember my emotions, not the results," Radévica opened with her experience in sports.
She told me that it was always important that there was someone in the tribe who would give the same energy.
This year, however, Radjevic will be a tourist - he will be going to Riodzejaneiro next week to support Latvian athletes in the countryside.
She points out that you will definitely go to the lighthouse competitions.
Ineta Radjevica won the European Championship in 2010.
In 2004, in the Olympic Games in Athens, she took 13 places on the phone and 20 points on the trisole, but in 2008 the athlete did not start because he was waiting for his son.
In London, as already mentioned, Radjevic was on the 4th floor.
In the walls will show the film "Quanta Code" with physics in Kascheev's main role.
The film annotation says that parallel to the scanning of electrons in the laboratory Kaščejevs is a dreamer, a teacher, a socially active and urban thinking man and father seeking contact with Vistvarenno.
In the case of Latvian television, "Rita Panoráma" pointed out that he had an interesting experience in taking the film.
I've learned about how to top the movie, how to film it, how to record the sound.
"And really great work," said the physicist.
He admits that the film's gone for two years.
The biggest controversy with the director was about the title of the film.
I'm categorically against that name.
No quota code.
"There is no secret which, by reading the film, could be known and is all clear," added the LLU associate professor.
Kacheev admits that he likes to have the film first in the morning directly at Murjani's free movie tonight.
They are organized by friends from the "Viegli" fund, and these movies will be held every evening until 9 September.
Four people were injured in bomb blasts in the tourist resorts in Thailand
After the people of Thailand voted for the adoption of the Constitution supported by the military, Thursday and Friday in the five provinces of the south of Thailand - in the popular tourist destinations - a number of bombings took place, where four people were injured and many people were injured.
The first two rounds of the sea lay in the coastal district of Huahai on Thursday evening, next Friday morning.
The city is about 200 kilometers south of Bangkok.
The police reported that in the first case, one woman had been killed and 20 people had been wounded, 10 of whom had been aliens.
Our authorities confirmed that other explosions took place in the southern city of Phuket, Tran and Surathan.
Two bombs hit Phuket in the town of Paton and two others in the province of Phhan in the region of tourism to the north of Phuket.
In the last 24 hours, 11 bombs exploded in Thailand.
On Friday, Kristian Patanaçaroens announced that the explosion was not related to Islamic extremists and is considered to be local stalemate acts.
"There's still too much to make conclusions," he said.
"But we are absolutely certain that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, that is, in fact, to local level, and we are trying to find victims."
On 12 August 2016, following a small blast of power in Huahai, the investigators collected evidence from the crime scene.
On 12 August, officials reported that four people were killed in the bombings in the important tourism sector in Thailand, and the competent authorities tried to justify and find them guilty.
There is no conflict in the country as a result of which terrorists could be found in the country.
"That is why we can say that these incidents are not terrorist attacks," he continued.
No group has yet taken responsibility for the attack and the competent authorities have not challenged any specific group, but the resolution took place on the same week when the Thai voters approved the new Constitution.
All three southern provinces - Huahina, Phūketa and Phhanna - rejected the referendum supported by the military, and in the provinces of southern Thailand, where most of the people are Muslims, since early 2004, more than 6500 people have been injured.
The events took place on the day of the birth of the kingdom of Thailand, which is the day of the national festival in Thailand.
In Huahin is the city of King Klai Kangwon or a "full from the roots", where the Thai royal family often lives.
King Bumibols Aduljade was the longest ruler in the monarchy.
WARNING: The medicine has been approved in the past.
Social networks have reported that some ghosts have been called by the nurse.
Let's help you find it!

Porgijs and Besa, which we have already won!
There's a lot of operas that have never been played in Latvia.
It's very rare.
However, it seems as if George Géršvina’s Opus Porgiy and Besa has not been studied or studied since the past seventeen years, nor has Besa been able to count the number of hrestomatic solos such as Summertime's periodic trust in viewers (including the summer festival of Ines Galantes), individual students’ projects, exhibitions and similar.
That is why - since Latvia is a civilized country in the Western world, it is bound by the rules and copyrights of the Géršina family, which are applicable to Portugal and Bess by 2030.
The harmonisation procedures are not simple.
In addition, in completing the study, the author wanted all fourteen students to be black people.
In Latvia, of course, the existing discussions and contexts of the U.S. operation in the area of race are not known and the wish of the composer would be difficult.
On August 6th, the concert created by the compromise with four artistic American poets and their Latvian amateur brothers and sisters was reminiscent of the famous music festival of Cessian art on the 10th of August, reminiscent of Gäršvina's beautiful song, in which his European classical music traditions with American poetry rhythms, games, early 20th-century fashions and hemits were celebrated by the famous Ugabe of Ketfishr and the beautiful Besas art of music that would have won over the history of music.
First, for LNSO and Director Andre Pogas.
The orchestra is located near the view of the soloist and singer (and great hit!) race When, the overall scan was stylistically unsatisfied, with contrasts rich and precise both strong and metal instruments and keyboard parts (Martinųz Zilberts).
Second, you'll be fine for the team.
The charismatic dramatic baritone of Lester Linčs (Portugal) is a player in Europe and America who has both baritone and Basbariton parties, particularly in the Valdi operas.
Portugal has played an unprecedented role, including Kraunu - in this operation he feels like a fish in the water and also encouraged the visual partners even to raise the emotional air of the suffering of the poor people's solidarity.
In his second concert in Portugal and Bessa (the first one in 2012 was no more, not less than with the Berlin Philharmonics and Simonus Retlu Sir), Latvia discovered as a vitally plastic combination of various vocal styles with a dramaticly tonned room and a fantastic piano top register.
Not yet, she is one of the most fascinating of today's ideas.
For the attractive German-born tenor, Jeremy Smith, who was interviewed by Andris Poga at his own time in Boston study, the role of a drug dealer in Sportinlaifa is a company in four continents.
In it he shows his contemporary art of singing and singing as a well-trained musical actor.
Smits is one of the rare cases in which the voice appears to be hidden from unopened vocal possibilities than 15 years ago when the opera voice has not been found, trying to silence the young.
Unbelievably, even from row 24 and relatively dark German Smita’s expressive tastes allow her to smell a mixture of sweets in her hands even if it is not there at least.
How can Besa not follow such a mephesophile healer, who, in an empty place, allows the illusion of a wonderful life in New York?
The crown was a symbol of the warmth of Rodney Clarks.
The greatest vocal surprise in the Latvian soloist team in the Cēss study was Sonora Vaices, a gray top registrant, a skilled balance between the spoken and sung text, according to changing the voice position, the vocal acrobatics and dramatism, the gift of both Sirina's prayers My Man is Gone Now, and the stylized lecturer in general prayer Oh, Doctor Jesus.
As a clarinet, Margaritas Wilson's voice sounded good, but the iconic Summertime at the very beginning caused a little confusion about the sound and the nervousness of its true character in the repression.
The colors and colors were produced by the parties entrusted to Mihal Čulpajev, Rihard Mačanovski, Andrim Lapinas (particularly the seller of Krabjes located on the shores of the city is responsible for Irmas Pavar's delicious land seller in the Soprana test).
Written by Ilonas Bagelles, Rihard Millera, Emila Kivlenek, as well as in the talks that were delivered by Ivo Martinson, an investigator and a white lawyer in the form of Arčdeil, the director of the Cés Festival and activist Juris Žagars.
In the local design of the concert hall in the village of Kariša, the choir worked on the steps, primarily in the procession, often by climbing or walking along the steps.
In sufficient dynamic activity, a small number of commissions were made in the hands of Latvian soldiers.
There is also a proselytism for this.
First of all, some soloists played several episodes (sometimes made it difficult to track their visual identity).
Secondly, there are a lot of dialogues in Portugal and Bessa, and I would like to ask the phrase, a response that will make it easier to follow up with the events ahead.
The sound car was a great help to the audience at the busy opera show in the city’s Nyanas.
The weather was over, and the first part of the concert was quite long.
However, this did not stop most of the audience from leaving to the end in order to attract artists.
Nine o'clock in the evening is almost ready to start full-length operations, especially if it is expected to take longer home from Jerusalem, but the opera Porgij and Besa have returned to Latvian music and will probably become one of the most exciting musical experiences of this summer.
Even in Liepaa, where it appeared at night and in all other acoustic conditions.
In the Riga game field, the man was afraid of children with a fever.
On the evening of 11 August, about eight o’clock in the evening, the State police received a report from an audited child’s parents, who were shocked that there was a man in the village of Lomonosova who was afraid of children.
The law guards immediately responded to the strike and went into the scene, where they also met this man with a syringe, which was at the time very large in the alcohol supply - 3.07 prom.
It was made clear that in 1962, a man who was married had previously feared children so as not to grieve.
This time, however, an aggressive man used a syringe that was placed under the child’s garden’s equipment.
The man was arrested.
In the context of the incident, a criminal process has been initiated on the disruption of the social order of therupies, which appears to be in obvious danger to the public or to the law, ignoring the general standards of behaviour and disrupting the peace of the people.
Such offences shall be punishable by the withdrawal of liberty for a period of up to two years or by the withdrawal of temporary freedom, or by forced labour, or by the penalty of money and by the monitoring of probation for a period of up to three years.
The presidents of the Federation usually use guest accreditations in Olympic games.
The presidents of the sports Federation usually enter the Olympic Games place for a few days and use guest accreditations that can change their names, so they have several owners during their competitions, the LETA was told by the representative of the Latvian Olympics Unit (LOV), Marita Wilcija.
On the third day, a large riot took place following the words of the Olympic pilot Alonas Ribakovas trainer German Jakubovska, who discovered that the last time the trainer had decided to go to Riodezáneiro Olympics, the leader of the Latvian Football Federation (LPF), Kaspars Pone, while the trainer had to stay at home.
Later it became known that Mr. Pone had gone to Brazil with a trainer's accreditation, which the president himself had expressed surprise, because "no one is in now".
As reported by Vilnius, only two of the presidents of the federations of the Olympics in London, as well as the leader of the Latvian Vieglatlactic Union (LVS) of Guntis Zálitis, lived in the village of the Olympics.
The Olympics live in the village of Olympics, as well as the official persons involved, such as coaches, doctors, delegation administration.
In addition, there was probably a trainer's accreditation in London.
"The presidents of the other federations are coming in as a guest, and they have their accreditations changed - income for a couple of days and then someone else is already used," Wilcija told her, explaining that this federation president is therefore not also living in the Olympic village.
Mr Riodezáneiro has already arrived at the end of July and will leave Brazil on 13 August, so he will probably be there at the top of all the national federations.
It is clear that Latvia's openings started only one day on August 10th.
Latvia Riodezáneiro will be represented in 11 sports games in the Olympic Games, and the Agency's LETA calculations show that six or seven federations will lead to the most important competitions for four years.
The meeting will take place in Brazil on Saturday, the President of the Latvian Ritengrauding Federation (LRF) Igo Japinš will be on the BMX competitions scheduled for next week, the Latvian Windsérfing Federation President Ansis Dále on Riodezáneiro has planned to fly on August 16, when Ketija Birzule has already begun, but Latvian President Dintar Urbančik - day earlier.
Also, the next week, the president of the Latvian Association of Smuggling, Karlis Kēslinš, was planning to enter, once the beginning of this campaign for the Danish Upelnik has already been completed.
The Latvian Federation President, Raimonds Rublovskis, at least during the Latvian sports competitions, did not find Riodzejaneiro, although he was planning his entry, the Latvian Canoe Federation is not currently president, but the Latvian mining company continues to have a conflict and its sportsmen are invited by the Latvian Olympic Committee to international competitions.
Before long, the President of the Latvian Federation Atis Sausniitis and the leader of the Latvian Tennis Union, Juris Savickis, decided not to take part in Riodezáneiro.
Vasilev assesses the natural breast of Latvian women.
World-class Russian fashion historian, interior decorator, scriptographer, book author, lecturer and collector Alexander Vasiljev has visited Latvia very often in recent years.
Recently, he finalized "Miss and Mysters Latvia 2016" and acknowledged that Latvian players, unlike Russian gender, can be beautiful with natural breasts and lips that are not improved with silicon and botulin injections.
In a conversation with "Vakar News" Alexander Vasiljevs said that for years he has been president of the jury in a popular "Wes Russia" concert.
That is why he also took a keen interest in the evaluation of the "Miss and Mysters Latvia 2016" participants.
As regards the different standards of Latvian beauty competition from similar competitions in Russia, Vasilijevs stressed that Latvia and Russia have very different figures: "Russia beauty contestants have a lower heart rate than Latvian competitors."
However, young Latvians are well dressed and freshened, and can be beautiful with natural beauty, not with the magical works performed by plastic surgery.
This is why I particularly welcome the Latvian parties to the beauty contest with their natural beauty.
With regard to its professional activity in Latvia, Vasilijeva has great plans.
Today the exhibition of a fashion historian's collection "Auxiliary Nature" is seen in the Decorative Museum of Art and Design.
On the other hand, in Ventspil, at the Livonia Order, Vasiljeva exhibition "Cazu Rate 1860-2010".
Vasiljev was so impressed with Ventspil that he enjoyed the city’s hospitality for a few days and went on walking along the sea.
I like Latvia very much.
It is especially now that there is a threat of terrorism across Europe, here is a true pillar of paradise.
"The time to spend in Latvia and rest is pure pleasure," admitted the fashion guru.
In addition, on 23 November Aleksandr Vasiljevs will discover a private fashion museum.
Please help!
We ask our son, brother, to take care of the baby.
We, the Rinalda family, are grateful for the wonderful people around us and for God’s ability to save Rinalda, but, unfortunately, it is not now possible to fully cover medical costs.
Renalds Grinbergs is 11 years old, with a brain tumor diagnosed at the end of July.
This year he graduated from the 4th class of Milzkalnes at the beginning of high school, a powerful athlete and a very talented artist.
It's like he's been given everything.
A healthy, life-saving, undeterred, eager and active child.
Always funny and slow.
On July 26, our family will remember forever.
In the last few weeks, he suffered from headaches and headaches, but his doctor took him to a kidney virus.
And at first, they thought it was the same.
Because someone could have thought that such “unscientific” symptoms at the dance are much more serious than the mind is unexplained.
The diagnosis received on July 26 - Rinaldam is a brain tumor.
The rapid storage fluid in the head of the brain, but all that doctors can help in Latvia is to perform a drilling operation to modernise the fluid in the blood, as the plant is not practically available for direct surgery.
Also, it cannot be determined whether the plant is good or bad.
The next national payment plan: start explosion and see what's going on.
It's like being in a bad mood - we'll experiment with you, we'll look at the results.
The results of Rinalda's studies were successful in showing the doctor in Spain.
He is the vice-president of the World Neurosurgery Association, one of the world’s leading neurosurgery.
He accepted an operation and showed that he had to operate immediately.
The tumor causes a tremendous pressure on the brain, and the risk of complications is too high.
It is also urgent to know whether the plant is good or bad to develop plans for further treatment.
Not surprisingly, the parents chose to go to Spain to save their son.
At fantastic speed, Rinalds, along with his mother, Eviu, was in Spain on August 8 and was operated on August 9.
A very difficult operation was performed over 6 hours.
The operation was performed at Santa Elena's clinic.
The outputs removed most of the plant, reduced pressure, obtained samples of analysis.
Rinalds is already on the way from the bed and as a good teenager, asking for evening potatoes.
The results of oncological analysis should be expected.
Thank your doctor for Arazaz and for the clinical management of the situation and for the immediate operation without receiving full prior treatment.
They hoped that the remaining amount would be paid only EUR 10 000 for the first contribution in order to operate and save Rinalda's life.
6 000 euros for parents were spent selling techniques, but the other necessary amounts for road expenses, housing, hospital initial contributions were taken from radio and friends.
However, at least EUR 24 000 is needed to determine the first treatment phase in Spain and to repay the money we have borrowed from the first contribution.
Please help us reimburse Rinalda's health so important, surgery.
Each euro is important in order to help cover the costs of the operation already carried out and to enable Rinalda to continue its treatment successfully.
A question is raised in Ukraine: What is Vladimir Putin’s advice?
We have been able to discuss the truth of these allegations.
Ukraine prohibits them, while the US and the European Union argues that Russia has not provided any evidence.
The Open Analysis Group, Digital Forensic Research Lab, has identified some signs of six days of depression, but very little to stop Moscow's big plans.
Russia is familiar with the outbreak of events or the misunderstanding of political reasons, in particular in the context of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
This does not mean that all Russian claims are unfounded.
In the past year, Ukraine's opposition forces have destroyed the power stations that were supplying power to Crimea, and some of them have also been involved in criminal activities and human rights violations.
The attempted attack in Crimea remains an issue, although there is little reason to believe that the Ukrainian Government would sponsor a scenario of such events.
In order to do so, open-source analyses show that Russia has continued to increase its military presence since at least six days ago - before an attack is expected.
It is seen as a force of heavy weapons moving across the sides, including rail systems intended for the protection of the coast.
Remarkable Russian Escalation
The individual reports show that Russia's forces had already planned a rotation that could help explain activities, although it would be very embarrassing that it was just expected to take place in one of the most complete periods since the accession in 2014.
In order to make this also known at the end of the week, Mr Putina will no doubt be more inclined to Ukraine by choosing to use this episode so as to be as real as it would be for a greater purpose.
The analysts point to the disturbing parallels with how Russia stood right before the previous military action against Ukraine.
In February 2014, with similar talks and military maneuvers, it was ensured that the members of the freedom to oppose Crimea, who were still in control of Ukraine, were protected from the threat of entry into force only to discover that they were actually the Russian special units that started military occupation.
In August when Russian-supported separatists did not exercise their powers across the border in eastern Ukraine, Putin warned that they might need the "protection" of the Russian civilian population in Ukraine, which he said was attacked.
He organized an aid package for the region, which, according to NATO information, was only a defence of Russian invasion forces.
What is Mr Putina's plan to do in Crimea?
Some have said that Moscow alone is not planning another military intervention.
The war in eastern Ukraine has been halted, just as it was before the attack in August 2014.
But this seeming parallel could be the point when it is intended to introduce fear from military actions rather than from actual actions - it brings Putin short of relations with Ukraine and Western countries.
Marks Galeoti, professor at the University of New York, who studied Russia, pointed out that Crime would be less important than a point from which to start military action against eastern Ukraine, which limits the part of Russia's territory, not Crime, and that the rest of the country is better protected.
"There is a very small possibility if the Russians really plan a large degree of offensive," said Mr. Galeito.
Sooner, "we can observe the classic Russian strategy in creating pressure."
The international peace talks on Ukraine, which once was a mechanism with Putin's contacts with Western leaders who ignored him because of the crisis, are increasingly considered to be ineffective and unnecessary.
By suggesting that there is a threat that a conflict can happen again, Putin is giving talks of a new advantage: perhaps his legacy from the homeless.
"There is a standard Putin tactic - he wants to try to start from the position of force," Galeito said about the next peace talks scheduled for early September.
"And the only strong side is to say, "If I wanted, I could do everything more, much worse."
To reach agreement with the West
Putin also said this week that during the crisis, there was little importance in continuing the negotiations by letting the other parties convince them to return to the table and go to the centre of the process.
What does that really do for him?
First of all, it allows Russia to continue to strengthen as a world power, although its economic dimensions are smaller than Australia.
Secondly, it positions Moscow as one of those who have the right to rule over the sovereignty of Ukraine, to a certain extent by maintaining the country in Russia's control.
This can also be good for Putin's long long long long long long long long long long-term hope of a broad agreement with the United States that would resolve their disputes on the issue of Ukraine and Syria, with the favourable conditions of Moscow, of course - also ending the Western sanctions against Russia.
Half houses for this objective since the deterioration of the national economy in 2014, have been said several times, mainly due to a reduction in national oil and gas export value.
Since an attack in Syria last Friday, he has repeatedly called on the West to join him in a great coalition against extremists.
However, Russian leaders may consider it necessary to provide such an agreement before the end of President Obama's term of office.
Russian officials are based on the view that the next president will be Hilaria Clinton, which is more favourable to Moscow.
Donalds J. Tramps, although mine friendly to Russia, is still considered unpredictable.
In contrast, Obama is regarded as one who "searches for solutions rather than conflicts," Galeito said.
It is therefore worth closing the room to make sure that something is done quickly.
As long as it is not possible to reach a broad agreement, Putin is considered satisfied with the lack of a Russian neighbour by saying what is going to happen next.
In the earlier version of this article, the year Russia denied Crime from Ukraine was wrong.
It happened in 2014, not in 2013.
At the convention on the street, the White House directed resources against the Zika virus
On the fourth day, Obama’s administration said that it would divert $81 million from biomedical research and anti-nutrition and health care programmes to pay for vaccines against the development of the Zika virus by turning to emergency measures because Congress did not approve new funding for the fight against virus.
The Secretary of Health and Human Services, Silvia Metjūsa Barvela, wrote to the Congress that, without the targeted means, the National Institute of Health and the Institute of Advanced Research and Development of Biomedicine will remain free of money for the fight against skin disease until the end of the month.
Therefore, the development of vaccines would be halted at an important time, increasing the number of cases of Zika’s disease in the country.
In the United States last week 7,350 cases of Zika virus were recorded, mostly in Puerto Rico (in accordance with data from the Disease Control and Prevention Centre).
Ms. Barvelava said that 15 infants were born with birth defects related to Zika’s virus.
The virus may cause brain development anomalies and other serious defects in pregnant mothers.
The spread of disease in the continental part of the United States, when the first cases were recorded at the end of last month, has increased the political rate of the federal government's response.
Hilaria Clinton stopped in Vainvud, Miami in a camp where there was a local outbreak of the Zika virus, and forced Congress to return from its five-week stop to confirm emergency funding for the fight against the virus.
President Obama and the Republicans of Congress have been in conflict with the Zika virus issues for the most part of the year.
In February Obama requested US$ 1.9 billion for emergency funding.
The Republicans suspended this request for a more detailed account of what money will be spent on.
For months, legislators have debated how much money should be given and how it should be spent.
In the past month, democracy blocked the review of the action proposed by the Republicans when $1.1 billion was given to fight against Zika's virus but included the conditions prohibiting the allocation of funds for family planning to provide contraceptives in relation to a virus that could be transmitted to the sex field.
Because of this stroke, the White House was forced in April to transfer $589 million to the US dollar that was intended to fight the Ebola virus, to fight the Zika virus. About two thirds of funding is intended to be used within the country.
On the fourth day, Mrs Barvelava said that her department had spent most of its money and that it would be spent in full by the end of August.
"The inability to make a decision on emergency funding for the fight against the Zika virus has allowed the administration to choose between the removal of essential vaccine development work and the establishment of other valuable national programmes in order to avoid it temporarily," wrote Barvela.
Democrats have made this announcement in order to transmit to the Republicans additional non-money to fight the Zika virus.
At the press conference, the representative of Nensija Pelosi from California, the leader of the minority, called on the representatives of Pol D.Raien, the members of the House of Representatives, to remind the Congress of the continuation of this measure.
"All the possibilities have been exhausted, and now we are addressing the National Health Institute," said Mrs. Pelosi.
Mr Rainen's advisers said that the shift of funds was a step that had to be taken long ago and that Obama's administration had made it possible for the Zika virus to express maximum political benefits.
Last week, the National Health Institute announced that vaccines have begun clinical trials against Zika virus with 80 people, and that the second phase "Zika virus epidemic countries" was launched in early 2017.
However, as the officials claimed on Thursday, without immediate additional funding, the study will cease.
Barvela said he would turn against the Zika virus to $34 million from the National Health Service, which is intended to seek treatment for other diseases, including cancer and diabetes.
Another 47 million will be reported to the Biomedicine Advanced Research and Development Authority, which supports the development of medicines and vaccines in response to emergencies in the public health field.
This money will come from several accounts, including $19 million from the programme in which heat subsidies are granted to small-scale families, and $4 million from the material dependence programmes, such as opioid dependence.
Even as Barvela said, additional money will only be made in the next month when the agencies will "mainly destroy their activity" in the fight against the Zika virus if Congress does not do so.
In the last four months, the Disease Control and Prevention Centre has spent 60 million dollars to help states protect pregnant women, 25 million US dollars to strengthen their preparedness for Zika virus and plans to fight it, and 16 million US dollars to help it develop data recovery systems to quickly detect microcephalal and other symptoms related to Zika viruses.
Thailand's leader links attacks to tourist destinations with constitutional changes
The Thai dog leader called on the public on Friday to be patient until the investigators discovered the number of fatal bombings that took place in Thailand last week.
General Prajuts Čan-oča, leader of the dog and prime minister, said that the criminals had been "bad people" protesting against the new Constitution, which the voters approved on Sunday in the referendum.
"There are still bad people, and they were already working before the referendum," he spoke to the people.
The bombings took place in five provinces on Thursday and Friday, including in Phuket and Huah, between the tourist destinations, killed four and wounded thousands of people.
The competent authorities claim that fires in another country are related.
Analysts claim that the aim of the bombing was not to kill many people but to harm the tourism sector, one of the highlights of the Thai economy.
At least nine foreign tourists were injured in Huanhin.
"In order to be motivated, explosives and fire-fighting attacks are against the dog's claim that the post-reference situation will be stable," said Sunajs Fasusus, an organisation's senior researcher Human Rights Watch.
These attacks result in the distributive effects of power institutions, terrorizing society and harming the tourism-based economy.
Photo of Thailand's rescue services staff took care of the bomb on Friday at the bomb blast in Huahai.
The police claim that in their view these findings are not related to international terrorism or to the prolonged Islamic terror in southern Thailand.
They consider attacks on "local character satellites" rather than terrorism.
There is a strong political symbol for the time and place of the selected attack.
The events occurred on Friday when the people were ready to celebrate the birth of the king of Syria, which is thought to be the Day of Atonement in Thailand.
Four explosions took place in the city of Huahai, about 125 south of Bangkok, where the majority of the victims were also wounded.
The Constitution prepared by the militarists will reduce the influence of political parties and give the military more authority even if the government is again in control of civilians.
Hunta helped to ensure its victory by not allowing opponents to campaign against it.
Mureys Hiberts, South-East Asia expert at the Strategic and International Studies Centre in Washington, pointed to the military's suspicion that the attacks were carried out by people who were not satisfied with the vote.
The solutions were "precisely coordinated, but the eyes were clearly designed to create fear and confusion, not mass damage and damage and damage," he said.
In the last year, 20 people were killed, mostly tourists from China, at the famous Erevan Festival in Bangkok.
Thai officials were bound by the outbreaks of eggs that were not satisfied with more than 100 eggs returned to China.
The General Bureau, which has been operating since 2014 when civil government was established, said that this week's explosion "pangs the hearts of criminals."
Why is it now that the country is better off when the economy goes better and the tourism sector is better?" he said.
We need to ask why and what did it do.
Green Reaction: How Simones Manuela’s historical miracle appeared
In the course of the war this summer, I will try to remove from my shoulders the weight of the black community, which is something that I do not have with myself simply to be in such a position.
I hope, however, that this will be all right.
I am more than happy that I can serve others for advice and, hopefully, differ in this kind of sport.
At the same time, however, I would like to be the day when we have more, and it is not Simone, the blacksmith, because the sign of the blacksmith makes it look like I shouldn't be able to cut gold medals or that I shouldn't be able to skip records.
This is not because I worked as hard as everyone else, and I love sports and I want to win the same as everyone else.
War on students - lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgenders (L.G.B.T.) - Protection in Colombia
Two years ago, 16 - year - old Sergio Urrego moved away from the shopping center in Bogotá before leaving a message about his suicide on Facebook, reading the song "Goodbye Cruel World" ("Ardiev evil world").
His death was the first of the protests that took place in Colombia this week, where the rights of L.G.B.T. were seen in the wider political wars that divided the countries into two camps.
After his death Urrego's mother, Alba Reijesa, filed a complaint against school officials accusing them of excluding her only child when it was found that she and her classmates had had intimate relations.
A year later, the Supreme Court of Colombia announced to her a favourable decision calling on schools to develop a clearer policy across the country to prevent discrimination.
The decision was part of the legal victory series for the movement of gay rights in Colombia.
However, this week they fought for equality with the barrier, because the Minister of Education, who is open-minded, has become scandalous about the application of this rule in the scandal.
The scandal began when social media began to circling sexual content from the pornography magazine, telling people that it was part of the textbooks issued by the Ministry of Education.
Perdia did it in the woods.
Although the Ministry offered school assistance on issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity with a view to helping them to pay attention to the rule, it did not try to emphasize the standardized rules.
"What we want for schools is a tool for resolving conflicts," said Mrs. Perdodias in an interview on Thursday.
The debate began before the national debates on the future in a country where peace talks between the government and the revolutionary armed forces of Colombia, or the FARC, were to be held.
The political coalition and Catholic church leaders in the opposition of the government have been exaggerating very quickly by accusing President Juan Manuela Santos of promoting the union of one sex and the promotion of gender change.
To make it even more difficult for all, a delegation of governments participating in talks with the FARC in Havana recently reached a gender agreement and the equal rights of L.G.B.T., with which the Government is invited to adopt more inclusive policies.
The government’s criticism and peace negotiations, which took place for the 42-year-old Perudian, the Colombian policy-making star.
They have repeatedly demonstrated papal posters, and some have also threatened to resort to violence against them and their partners, Sesílya Alvaresa-Correa Glen, former trade ministers.
Perodia maintained complete peace for a whole week, trying to correct the mistake and resume the debate with constructive conditions.
"Partly what keeps me standing and keeping my head clear is the realization that there are children who will only be discovered," she said.
This is a very complicated field of work and a very lonely time.
She also pointed to the commitment between the peace process and the debate on L.G.B.T. students.
As the Colombians continue to assess the benefits of the transaction with FARC, which would be a point of reference to the earthquake in the country, they must consider the origin of the conflict, she said.
"You are a peaceful country that promotes inclusion or exclusion; is it the one in which everyone has the same opportunities?" she asked the question.
Although this week she was not pleased with the goal of criticism and transmission, she is glad that today in Colombia, high school students can take the example of her and think that they can also try to become ministers one day.
"I am very important that they are peaceful and realize that they can fully realize their potential," said Mrs. Perdias.
We can't expect a new suicide to start to change something.
Keep a vote on cyberdryer - The New York Times
"AsV is looking for ways to keep hackers together from the elections" (letter of knowledge, August 4th)
Minister of Internal Security George Johnson says that Obama's administration is thinking of further protection of the security of the national election system.
These changes may be necessary and should be considered immediately.
With different statements and recent disclosure that external forces, possibly national countries, are increasingly interested in the impact of our elections, require the federal government to pay additional attention to ensuring our electoral systems and possibly to consider them part of our country's important infrastructure.
Johnson should immediately contact the thousands of national jurisdictions that help to conduct elections and offer assistance, advice and management to the Department of Homeland Security.
As long as the diversity of our voting infrastructure and the different nature of the situation hinders efforts to ensure it, it sends us a message that the process must begin as soon as possible.
The writer, a democracy from Mississippi, is a member of the National Security Committee.
A child injured in a wheelchair in Pennsylvania, a third case already this week in the parking lot
The fourth day, hiding from the barracks, the funeral of a child was taken to the Pittsburgh hospital. The emergency relief service and park officials said this was the third incident this week in the United States of America's attractions in the park where the children were injured.
A child whose name is not revealed was sent to a child hospital in Pittsburgh, about 50 miles (80 km) west of Aidlwald and Soukzon Attraction Park in Laidzonjer, Pennsylvania, said the representative of the emergency relief services in the Westmurland area.
The three - year - old son who had been visiting with his brother while he was being assisted on the spot was informed by the e-mail representative of the park, Jeff Kruschers.
The Krushurs said that the "Rollo Coaster" attraction to the event will be closed.
For children with disabilities, at least 3 feet (91 cm) of foot (91 cm) must be visited in a wheelchair, and those who are shorter than 4 feet (122 cm) should be in adult arms.
The attraction, according to the information published on its website, was built in 1938 and the Department of Agriculture indicated that it was checked in August.
The representative of the hospital will comment on the health situation of the child in the refusal.
On Sunday, a 10 - year - old son died from a coal miner who was taken from the world’s highest water source in Kansas, Kansas.
Three 6, 10 and 16-year-old girls aged more than 30 feet (9 m) were delivered to the hospital on the first day of the day, reporting local media during the changing annual marketing schedule in Grinville, Tennessee.
Japanese Prime Minister Abe Second World War doesn't visit a church in honor of a war-threatening memory:
The news agency Jiji reports that Japanese Prime Minister Sindzo Abe Japan will not visit a well-valued Tokyo shrine during the Second World War, in which the memory of the war is honored.
On Thursday, Jiji reported, however, that Abe was planning to send Yasukoni to the Christmas ritual gift for the year.
The festival also commemorates 14 Japanese caravans, who have only been convicted as war criminals, and China and South Korea consider it a symbol of the Japanese royal military.
Both did not visit the shrine since December 2013 when he announced that he had visited to show respect for those who died for his family.
In the new Japanese Minister of Defence Tomomi Inada has not answered the question of whether she will visit the shrine, explaining that this is a matter of conscience.
Inada - close to Abe, a supporter of the amendments to the Japanese Pacific Constitution - has regularly visited Yasukoni in the past.
The news agency Kyodo reports that the Minister of Construction of the affected areas of Japan visited the shrine on Thursday and said he was praying for peace and prosperity in Japan.
The relationship between China and Japan, the two major economies in Asia, has become stronger after the growing protection of China's coast and the presence of other national vessels in the conflict islands near the South China Sea, known in Japan as the Sekaku, but in China as the Diarous.
Two suspects stopped in the planning of Rio Olympic terrorist acts: police
On Thursday, the police stopped two people suspected of supporting the Islamic State in planning a possible attack on the Olympic Games during Rio de Janeiro.
Before the fourth day, the operation police had already arrested 12 persons, all suspected of cooperating with the Islamic State fighters.
The Brazilian Federal Police report that three more persons were tortured and subsequently released.
Both arrests are Brazilian on Thursday, but the police do not disclose their names and other information.
Although the history of Brazil has not been in conflict with known groups of warriors, the Government reports that because of the Olympic Games, the country has become a more current goal, especially because the countries fighting the Islamic state participate in the games.
Its fighters control certain territories of Iraq and Syria, and the U.S. leadership coalition has launched air attacks against them.
The group is supported worldwide by supporters who have committed abuses and exploitation of civilians.
An official complaint is filed against the newly suspected French priest
In the past month's investigation of the secretarial investigation by the French priest against the men arrested earlier, Reuters reported the source of information to the police on Friday.
The investigation carried out by 21-year-old suspects on cooperation with terrorists is carried out and he has planned attacks on people, the source of information said.
The man was on the phone with Adel Kermiço and Abdeu Malik Petitdjan, who stopped the church service at Stettejéne du Ruvi, West France, on July 26, and turned his hands over 85 years to the old Roman Catholic priest Zakam Amélam.
Both of them were shot by the police.
The suspect was driven from his home, located near Tullus, to St.
The young man who had not previously been convicted of criminal punishment recognized that he had been there for the night, but told the investigators that he was on the next day for nine days because he had not had a good relationship with Kermiç and Petitdján, said the source of information.
The investigators were trying to determine whether Kermiča and Petitdjan were members of France and whether they were associated with the Islamic State that has taken responsibility for the attack.
At the end of last month, Petitdjana was subjected to a pretrial arrest.
Doruss de Vriess before moving to Celtic for medical examination
Nottingham Forest Club hosted Doruss de Vriess in Glazgo, as I intend to conclude an agreement on moving to Celtic.
De Vriess was photographed, entering Roshola's hospital before medical examination after Hoops agreed on conditions with Sky Bet Chempion's club.
The director of the Parkhead Club, Brendans Rodgers, is looking for the protection of the experienced centre so that the current first number of Crete Gordons would be competitive.
However, Rogers was 35 years old at the age of de Vriesam because he worked with the Dutch in the Swansea club.
He played 51 games in Swansea, which led by Rogers in 2011.
He has changed the shape of the wild to add "Wilki" and has been City Ground since 2013.
During his career he has also played in Scotland after the period spent on Diunfermline, after the transition back in 2006.
His stay in Istendpair ended with a shock, however, the part of a double agonized, being "sended to a high level" before the loss in the Celtic Scotia village.
According to the contract, there was still a year left in the Forest, and Celtic was reported to have to pay only a nominal fee in order to become his signature.
Macy's gonna lock up 100 stores.
The Great Giant Macy's Thursday announced its plans to close 100 shops, which are a dramatic step towards helping the business chain to face potential emerging problems: in America, it claims to be too many businesses for online shopping.
Macy's regularly reduces its business portfolio, often closing several dunes not enough profitable business immediately after annual holiday smoking.
However, the next summer's announcement that it will close 15 per cent of its 728 trading venues, trade chains, seems to have adopted a much more aggressive position than that of many representatives of the retail sector with regard to the reduction in the number of their businesses by adapting to the very changing procurement environment.
The owners and buyers are going to take Macy's business to New York.
The retail giant announced that it is planning to close 100 shops.
Macy's has many reasons to try to change: many of its businesses are located in small regional shopping centres, as the number of buyers has particularly affected the growth of e-commerce.
In general, the wholesale category has become more difficult, as buyers will increasingly choose lower price traders such as T.J.Max and fast fashion works such as H&M.
These factors, to the extent of short-term difficulties such as the ever smaller international tourist prices and season, are not consistent with the weather conditions that Macy's has established in a unstable situation that is already on the rise over the course of the year.
On the fourth day, the company reported that its relative sales volume in the last quarter had dropped by 2.6 per cent, a weak indicator that was nevertheless an improvement, taking into account very poor 6.1 per cent increase in the year in which it was found in the previous quarter.
A retailer's income was $5.87 billion ($7.64 billion) by 3.9 per cent less than during this period.
Macy's said that the closure of the business would cost it about $1 billion for the annual turnover of the US dollar.
At the same time, the closure of such a large number of businesses could be considered to be the recognition of a retailer’s claim.
However, the value of the company’s shares decreased by 17 per cent on Thursday, indicating that the investors consider these trends to be a proactive measure which is sent to Macy’s more powerful future.
In my opinion, the fact that Macy's reduces the number of businesses should not be surprising.
Mr Lundgren, Director-General of the Smallest Trader, has already said that there are too many shops in the chain.
The top-level managers said for a while that they have adopted a new strategy, with special emphasis being placed on 150 of its most profitable businesses, trying to achieve greater sales in already profitable trading sites.
Jeff Janete, Director of Macy's, who has been appointed at the place of Lundgren since 2017, said in his statement that almost all the businesses planned to close the company are those in which sales volumes and profitability fall to the ground.
"We recognize that in these trading places we still do not get adequate return from investments and that there is often no level of purchase experience for buyers that reflects our efforts in connection with Macy's brand," said Janet.
The company announced that it would come forward with a list of goods to be closed later.
Macy's said that we are still faced with the decision of closed shops and that therefore we are not yet aware of how many employees will be released.
The retailer is not entirely out of the main markets where he is currently a business, but he thinks of closing the shops that are located in less active places.
This journey is more likely to be inappropriate for the management of shopping centres, which will account for large customers such as Macy's, in order to attract and maintain other smaller businesses in their shopping centres.
Do you have dangerous bacteria in your water bottle?
According to a new study, the drink from the refilled bottle can be "a lot worse than cutting off your dog's toy", taking into account how many bacteria will deal with it.
The Home Page Treadmill Reviews commissioned EmLab P&K to check 12 four different kinds of water bottle - with a spindle, with an abandoned curve, with a pressure curve, and with a salmine.
Each bottle has been used for a week without washing.
Your refilled water bottle may be as unclean as a dog’s toy.
"On the basis of the 12 of our water-tested bottles, we found that the re-use can have a large number of viable bacteria cells: more than 300,000 colonies forming units per square centimetre (KVV/kv.cm.)," said Treadmill Reviews.
In bottles with abandoned containers, the largest quantity of microb was found, with more than 900 000 colonies forming units per square centimetre (CVV/kv.cm.)
The vials were microbes that could cause skin infections, pneumonia or blood clotting.
The bottle with pressure pumps was the worst of the next 162,000 KVV/kv.cm, but the tyres with propellers were only slightly less than 160 000 KVV/kv.cm.
"Derst water from such bottles may be worse than eating from your pet's pain," says the website.
The greener skin is observed for bottles with salmon, where only part of the bacteria in the other bottle was detected - only 25 KVV/kv.cm.
This could be because the water runs down to the lattice, not into its mouth, and thus attaching to the smelling microbuses.
The existing microbes with salmon are described as "increasing safely."
"On the basis of our test results, it is recommended that we select bottles with salmon and small bacteria and because of the absence of harmful microbes," says the website.
We also know that when it comes to bottles and bacteria, the stainless steel is a better choice than plastic.
In addition, water bottles with no washing and hard cleaning sites will be less microbe.
Home page readers are advised to lower the bottles after each use, ideally with a weak washing solution.
Religion must become a modern or a forgotten religion
In the United States, the Democratic Party has recently appointed Hilary Klintoni as its president's candidate.
If the results of the last polls will show the same choice, in January America will grow its first president - a woman.
The previous week, across the ocean, British Prime Minister Teresa Meja discussed the British expiry of the European rules with the German Chancellor Angel Merkeli.
Women raised in Western society have been raised to know that, thanks to education, ambition and hard work, they can be competent and successful in any field of professional activity.
And today, young girls can be targeted at several existing role models in the field of higher leadership.
So, is there really a long and hard fight on women's equality finally over?
Hillary Clinton is ready to become the president of the United States at any time, but the leadership of women in religion remains a controversial issue.
Okay, not completely.
Women's leadership in the field of religion is still a controversial issue.
Last week, Pope Francis announced the establishment of a new commission with a view to assessing whether women would be introduced as diacones in the Catholic Church.
The Anglican Church adopted Libya Lein as the first female church in January 2015, but it was only after an unsuccessful attempt in 2012.
As long as the reform in the Jewish movement of women in the Arab world has been organized in the Arab world since the early 1970s and in the conservative movement since the early 1980s, there is still a strong opposition to the Orthodoxy of women in the Arab world.
In November 2015, the American Council of Orthodoxal rabies, in its third attempt to stop the growing wave of support for fair women's ordering of rabies, published a message of concern to the public that the concept of women-rabine is contrary to the law.
Not without Iran, when Hillary Clinton was appointed as presidential candidate, a group of U.S. leaders of the right rabbi, who opposed the women's organization, started several "debates" on this controversial issue.
Why is such a difference between time and age?
Orthodox Judaism, like most other religions, seeks stability in what it considers to be long-term values.
This shows the ability to resist pressure to adapt to changing society.
Those who are against women's classification do so on the basis that it's not "traditional."
However, the acquisition of traditions in this way is its price.
And such a unilateral thought price can be paradoxically incorporated into the tradition of itself by excluding traditional Community oxygen that it needs to sustain life.
In the book "August Firearms", in the history of World War I, Barbara Tačmena stresses the danger of giving priority to tradition to what has become known as "the tragedy of sarkano biz."
Until the beginning of World War I, when war broke out in the near-war distances to the heavier artillery, which is generated from the further distance, it became beneficial to hide the chariots as long as possible.
The British and German armies responded to these changes by replacing their fragile uniforms against the brunts and brunts.
The French soldiers, however, still wore the same red hats and biscuits that made them easy targets.
The French war minister Ádolfa Mesim proposed that his soldiers in his custody might act similarly, which was perceived to be cruel and hostile.
The massacres reflected the flagships and prestige of the army, and the traditionalists were not ready to reject it.
In Parliament, former war minister Eigen Etjén spoke on behalf of France.
"Remain from the red biscuits?" he called out.
Sometimes!
"It was an inexhaustible and idiotic annex to the most visible of all colours," later wrote in the Messiah, "it was supposed to have bad consequences."
The religious leaders who fight for women’s membership in religious roles could be included in the same churches.
Focusing only on "traditional" religion, rather than asking an important question: "What changes are needed to break up the religion?" They risk losing about 50 percent of their followers.
They also reject the whole community of talents, skills and enthusiasm that women would otherwise give.
To stop men from feeding pigs when they are talking about religion may be traditional, but as a red cow is shown, it may not be worth it.
Dina Breivere is the founder of JOFA (Sievies Orthodox Women's Association) in Britain and a student of Orthodox rabbinicism in New York City.
The newborn of Paradise was surrounded by new skills.
From 1 August to 6 August, at the centre of Rojupe’s children and young people’s initiative, the "Varavíkskas tilts", during which participants were created to express, to play, and to acquire new skills.
On the day of the end of the day, the children had a great sense of humor surrounding the glass jars.
A youth affairs specialist at the centre of Rojupe’s children and youth initiative told Mara Folkmane that this was one of the activities that the participants enjoyed most.
The visit of the "Mazbebriņi" of the Nyara Kalnini ship also brought great joy.
Most of the children liked lasergrave because it was possible to see how the label on the computer was placed at least on the screen.
E. Kalniņš has told us what subjects should be taught in school if you want to work in the shipyard, namely mathematics, especially geometry, computer science, and technical marking and breeding.
He also stressed the need to work more in this profession than in the muscles.
There are individual orders on a small street, and it is important first to plan everything.
In order to get to know each other better, participants took part in various games, as well as jointly formed the "gerbones".
On the third day, a crossing took place from the Red Sea to Žocene, and natural materials were collected along the roads that were later used for the production of maps.
Sports games were also held that were of particular importance to the participants.
We went to the homes of many people, where we had sports and restrooms, played football and the network bomb.
Children like sports activities, we have many children playing football, basketball, and every time they ask for something sports.
Girls like more peaceful jobs.
On another day, with the help of self-adhesive mass, the decorative beads that will later be used as brand-holders.
It was also a tantrum evening, and the children themselves chose to stand together, and one evening they were assigned to the front.
The board games were also played, each in his knowledge could show during the orientation of the photo, where objects were to be found and photographed after the drawings.
The task was to meet differently in each picture.
We also color Mandalas - some like it more, some less.
There will never be one activity that everyone will like - the next one is sports, the next creative activity.
"Now everyone seems to be working out with glass coating," explained Mr. Folkmane.
At the end of the decade, diplomas on creativity, sport and assistance were issued, and several children were directly involved in economic activities.
The name of the designation "Varavíknis tungsten" was created because it includes children from three associations - the centre of the Rojupes and Melsila children and young people's initiatives, as well as the new Roja's multifunctional centre "Strops".
These are the same beliefs.
If parents think things out quickly, we take ideas; if otherwise, they will turn away from us.
We share experience.
This year 30 participants were involved - children active during the year.
"We had planned that there would be 30, and it also came," says Mr. Folkmane.
It was already five years ago.
It began in 2010, when the social services of the new Rojas decided that it was necessary for families and missing families to organize a holiday in summer.
However, the situation in Russia has improved, and it is now intended for new citizens who come and work in youth centres.
The goal is content and universally to spend free time.
Two abortions occurred before and 20 children were involved in each, but now because the number of children in the country in general is reduced, only one abortion is performed.
Similar activities take place during the last year.
The children mark, surrounded by glass, came in close to Einar Kalniņš, who taught wood burning, car creation from wood, with figurines of various forms.
There is also a new technique - encaustic, it's coloring with hot wax.
The teacher, Ilze Šelkova, was involved in the production of polymer materials, made bricks, and various obstacles.
Made of natural materials, interesting mandalas from apples, roots, liszees, green leaves.
Let's try to use what we have around us.
The youth centre in the winter works from 15.00 to 20.00, while in the summer - from 14.00 to 20.00.
"In the street youth centre averages 15 children a day," says Mr. Folkmane.
She stresses that great support is given to the new idea of Paradise, which understands that it is necessary to give children the means because they form our future.
Charlton Athletic fan "may be season tickets only if you sign the behavior contract" and agree not to criticize the club's social media.
Although we recognize that everyone has the right to his personal opinion, the publication of oral comments on such websites is not good.
In the area of administration, he was then told that he would have to receive a ticket personally from the senior police inspector, Clifa Iger, who joined the club in the last month after 35 years of career police force.
The letter continues: "I need to inform you that the granting of the season ticket will be renewed provided that you will sign "ABC of the Harmonised Conduct Treaty" (ABC), which will provide that you will continue to be able to publish misleading or misleading comments on persons representing the club or the club on all forms of social media pages or any other kind of behaviour that might be considered antisocial."
Speaking to Daily Telegraph, the fan described how he called the club after the season ticket fee that was not received, and two days later he received a letter by mail.
Yesterday he went to the front of the club and said, "They told me that I was too "stupid," letting others laugh too."
Riveting free days of the Dhalmation
What do you think of the word "crime"?
I drove you out of all the power," said Colina, a former U.S. Navy commander who just pulled 25 sailboats across some uneven part of the central part of the island of Croatia, without leaving, except for the Spanish flag and the wave of fierce seamen thrown out in the lovely mountains.
Some trainers call the sky or the number of children’s activities to make it easier for them to be in the mountains.
The Colin Association Petija recommends "The Small Engine That Cool" (The Little Engine).
The other number of times or just suffers during the course, thinking what it requires to go through a similar situation as the railways are talking about.
Colin is more intense than individual.
Bringing some tears to her in front is what it's like in the back of Hyu Grant as a film at the beginning of the "Courts and One Child".
She and my mission is a long "lusus" yacht and trainboat along the Croatian North-West Coast and islands organized by Freedom Treks.
Rising in the summer's heat by standing mountain places such as Croatia may not meet every sense of error, but it says that North-Wetlandation is easier to get out than South-Wetlands, our fields are soft, and when we completed the booking forms, free and convincingly before all those months, there was a ship that would not have been able to provide us with a battery loaded with e-vesicle.
The luxury part of the deal is our beautiful home for a week, completely new Melody.
At the end of the voyage, we can gather our bicycles at our guides Ivana and Ivana and the ship's back in the green water, without having to touch the seas, the rocks, and other people on the rough rocks, which are called the beaches.
In June the water temperature in the sea is perfect, all agree: enough ice to take off, but not gold.
Melody has masks and breathing pipes and some things, if someone feels energy after heavy tomorrow on his knees.
Instead, most of us will return to our cabins with air conditioning, where Helen, the ship's mask - I don't care - will have already opened our bedrooms, added our minibars and left on the table a new box with chocolates.
Ivan says that exposure after riding is very important, and on the afternoon we learn to stand on our balls or with colorfully painted clothes on the upper floor with baby Antonio, who is always ready to prepare one of his own cocktails.
"Melody", 42 m long with 15 cats and half of the crews, not a superhero, but a quiet little cruise ship.
It goes against the small island port between the fishing vessels and the fleet fleets, and we are pleased to have access to them.
Colina and Petija belong to meteup.com group of friends from Washington (Colombia): to sports and public activists after 45, as they call themselves.
Last year’s big and white holidays in the Netherlands were so expensive that they decided to try something even more rich for their vacations, and they are now in Croatia.
The competitive hat from their church is a ship and a bicycle on the free days of Provence, and every afternoon the competitive Facebook publications pingong rally.
The element of holiday receptions can be overwhelming because our graph is nothing unless a specific mode is set.
"Brokasti and the evenings are eight," Ivans announced to the new participants at the opening meeting when we started our journey from the beautiful old Trogir port, located near Split.
One ship’s call signal shows that the buffet is open, while the other is at the end of the meal calls for a listening and careful listening to the following information.
"Good!" is a cultural context that may have been lost all but not in the British continent.
One difference is that the entertainment has already taken over, some come from the crowd, while Ivana has issued a day's tour map, but we all feel that we are afraid of shooting, shooting and profiles with wings and screams, even though there would be any surprise in Croatia's sailing that begins and ends at sea level.
"It's like a heart monitor," says Ivan.
Complete equality is not recommended.
Ivans conducts information meetings in parallel, freely transferring from English to German.
There are weeks when he has to go to the end with twelve different people, but we are a simple group - Swiss, Swiss, American and British, who can easily meet at tables where two speak English, but one - German.
On the way, we're all friends.
Rising promotes society, and the only competition is inside, respectively, itself.
You will not remember when the dynamics of the group would be more harmonious and relaxed.
Soon we were climbing to Ivana's neck.
A small step is a weakness that should not be affected by a imbalance that is good.
The matatas are serpentine and straight forward means right: simple but not always easy.
The driving instructions are always the same and the same: "Use one by one, keep the distance, and they are not competitions.
We're in the desert in nine.
All right, five too, remember you're free.
Take plenty of water with you.
From Trogir we will take two days across the north through the Cornati archipelago, where we will take almost all the way out of Dugi Otok - in the Croatian language "garo island" - and after a small amount of effort to reach the Teláscikas natural park to satisfy the climates and the salt of the lake, where the sea flows through the canal.
They say that those who fall into it, thanks to its power, will become younger.
If we do that, will our legs become weaker and stronger?
In the small island of Molata, we are again moving south, moving from the continent to the nearby islands, seemingly unheard of.
Most of our journeys are on empty small roads outside the country with wide sea views and a variety of plants: olive groves, vineyards, lakes of plants, Mediterranean sands and countless lakes in the air.
We're going ahead, there's always a hurry, but when Ivan stops, there's always a big window, and small holes are like a prize for those who come in faster.
Sports and public activists spend a lot of time in the weekend, and they know the rules of conduct, by sending warnings on the line and leaving free places so that motorists can carry out escape maneuvers much safer.
"You're almost tired," said one trainer to each other after the heavy car driver decided to carry out the escape manoeuvre in an inexhaustible room and quickly broke down.
They worked for the good of the brakes.
Ivan has divided us into three groups on each end to take a short step along the main roads, with Ivan on his own back to encourage and "give time", as Ivans says.
If we have to cross the main road, we all meet, get out of the bicycles and safety after crossing with our bicycles on the other side as we have been instructed, not before.
"Do you think Ivans will realize that he is not talking to a group of children?" asked the Swiss trainer when we stand on the street and wait for a signal when we can break it.
Not all afternoons we can take a little rest.
In the city, Zadar, a Roman forum and a sea oars are open to play music, which plays as a role of the sea’s terror, through stone-made pipes in promenade and open water.
The glorious sunset of Zadar is perfect for the time between the main dinner and the bottle, and after the dark introduction we return to the shores and watch the violet lights on the glass of glass, which is actually a rain floor.
When "Melody" starts early in the morning on the way to the beautiful Biograd Square, there's nothing more than a stick.
On the fifth day, we are completely free from routing.
Brauciens went up to the island of Krkas to look at its water scripts; then the afternoon visit to Sibeni, where we look at the cathedral of thought, the master of Dalmatian Renaissance, as well as the beauty of the holiday on the peaceful island of Zlarina, looking for its local treasure coral, makes this day interesting.
Lurda's ready to take the saints in the scene of the attack
During the annual Catholic pilgrimage, people flocked to the church of Lords.
The French security forces are at high risk, as thousands of Catholics meet at the Lord’s Evening Meal each year in several terrorist acts.
On August 15, each year tens of thousands of people flocked to the Festival of Booths on the Mount of Olives to celebrate the marriage of the new Mary in heaven.
This year the celebration takes place when Catholics have been shocked by the murder of the oldest French priest on 26 July, by two Islamic extremists, who entered the temple in northern France during the month and turned their hands around him.
Žaka Amela's arrest took place two weeks after a Tunisians -- investigators claim that they have radicalized the online video material of the Jihads -- they were involved with a truck in the pursuit of Bastalia's day dancers in the city of Nicosia, killing 85 people.
After three large attacks in 18 months, many French citizens were cautious about visiting public events.
The number of tourists declined gradually, and the authorities felt that the number of pilgrims this year could be baptized quickly.
However, the fear of mass references has not been materialized -- and some organizers say that there has been a recent call for visitors' applications.
About 25,000 faithful ones are expected to enter, including large groups from Italy and Belgium and about 200 Eastern Christians - a proper delegation of representatives.
Many pilgrims have announced that they will not be intimidated.
"We don't think to stop living," 66-year-old visitor Christ told the AFP agency, describing prayer as "one weapon" in the fight against violence.
"It's important to show that life is going on," said Matthew Gwinnars - one of the coordinators.
We will not abandon our faith, our beliefs, and our way of life only because some fanatics are trying to overcome fear.
In view of the concerns about safety in France since the attack in Nicosia, a number of large-scale measures have been lifted, including a large stock market in the northern city of Lille and a European railway campaign that was scheduled to take place in Nicosia in September.
"In the last week I lived in fear that my phone will be called in a single call to withdraw applications," said Fabiens Ležesne, a priest who was responsible for the official Christmas event last week.
"This is the second time - it seems that the attacks have mobilized faith," he said and reported on the recent appeal.
Kristian Žels, head of the local hotel staff unit, confirmed "improved interest" for the following attacks.
About the place where young Mary was in 1858 when a poor man appeared to Bernadette Subirū, there was a set of extremely strict security measures.
The site is protected by approximately 250 police officers and two dozen soldiers, including bomb neutralisation experts and explosive search dogs.
The number of access points was reduced from twelve to three at the entrance to safety bars.
At the beginning of this month, Katherine Simkoksa, who traveled from northwestern England to Lurdu, described the enhanced security measures.
"To Thursday morning at the shrine, armed guards were found, and then through doors (with metal bars) could only enter one, as well as search for soma," she said The Local.
"This all scared my three children who've gone to Lurda, and it was hard not to stop them when they asked why it happened," she said.
It didn’t hurt my effect, but I was shocked at the need for it, and I realized that many people were disappointed by these measures.
The five-day opening process route has also been reduced - instead of starting in the city of Lurda and moving further to the shrine, it will begin and end at the shrine.
Other measures include the closure of the airspace for flights over Lurda, the closure of roads in the vicinity of the traffic hall and the replacement of waste uranium against passing plastic masses.
French Interior Minister Bernard Kazenev will examine security measures on Saturday.
About six million people go to Lurdu, making it one of the largest Catholic pilgrimages in the world.
Many visitors come from relatives who are sick or disabled and who come to visit the village where Bernadette has seen Maria, to touch the medical qualities of the water.
In Turkey, Castio, one of the organizers, described this year's celebration as "very unusual", taking into account "the risk of being found in France."
However, he claimed that this would not affect the quality and depth of his experience.
The 58-year-old volunteer, who helped the poor pilgrims, recognized that, in his view, the presence of the armed warriors in civil war was "some of the most humiliating."
However, if it all works out, it's good.
The Saragos marketing centre is damaged by two injured persons
Two people were severely beaten after a man opened fire at the shopping center in Saragos in northern Spain.
The incident took place at the end of the 11th morning in the full Aragonia Trade Centre in Saragos.

Discovering the nearby riverbird forest season.
Each year, on the second 6th of August, the water birds' forest season is opened.
This year it will begin at 16:00 p.m., so the State police call on both citizens and citizens to be particularly careful and to comply with security rules.
Waterbird forests occur not only in the fields of forests but also in public waterways, and although weather conditions do not result in cloud as in other years, it is possible to use the wastewater cycle alone with farmers.
For both farmers and seafarers, calls to be particularly cautious in the vicinity of lakes and rivers, and to comply with safety rules, thus not endangering neither themselves nor others.
As it has been observed in the past years that the opening of the season in the first days of the water birds in the forest is taking place in large numbers of farmers, this year the State police, in cooperation with the State Forest Service, will also carry out an enhanced control of forests.
During the control of the law, attention will be paid to the compliance of arms and ammunition with the law and will be monitored to ensure that the forest is safe from the effects of alcohol and drugs.
The police recall that the use of semi-automatic firearms in aquatic forests, whose total content is more than three cartridges, including focusing on amendments to the Arms and Special Measures Act, in particular Article 22(91), which states that persons who are armed with firearms or large-power pneumatic weapons registered with or for goods or sports, and during a short stop up to two hours when these weapons are carried on or off, have the right to hold weapons and ammunition in a vehicle during the course of their journey, but they must be placed in a safe place to drive them away, to avoid the use of firearms or other weapons, to drive them off, to use them, to drive them off, or to avoid them.
The police call on us to take care of the safety of their and their fellow citizens during the winter season and, if there are legal irregularities or threats to safety, we call on them to report immediately, calling on the phone 110.
In the event of any threat, the law is ready to respond to the information provided by the public.
New Caledonian shores have ruined 7,2 magnets of landfills
On Friday, the New Caledonian coast hit 7.2 magnets and sent seismologists to indicate that there was no threat to tsunamis.
The earthquake epicenter found nine kilometres deep 109 kilometres east of New Caledonia plkst.1.26 after the time of Griniča (pc.4.26 after the time of Latvia), the U.S. Geology Research Centre announced.
On the other hand, the Cunami Training Centre indicated that there is no warning or recommendation in relation to possible dangers to the Cunami region.
"The earthquake in this region is not unusual, nor is it unusual in the last days of the activity," said the oldest seismologist, Fils Kamins, of Geoscience Australia.
It could potentially be felt in Vanuatu or New Caledonia, but I doubt whether it is so powerful to make decisions.
New Caledonia is located in the "Uguns Valley" - in the Pacific Tetanical Activity Area, where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions often occur.
Colombia and Venezuela agree to open the border.
Colombia and Venezuela agreed to open control points at the borders of the two countries which were closed on Thursday following the Venezuelan initiative.
The initial border points will only be open to passengers.
From the beginning of the 6th day, five border points will be opened every day from 8 to 20.
The opening of the road for transport will be possible after certain international agreements on security, trade and energy have been concluded by the President.
In August only Maduro had to close the border by reacting to an attack by the Colombian military on the Venezuelan border patrol.
Three Venezuelan soldiers were attacked in this attack.
In July this year, Venezuela opened the border twice as a result of the economic crisis in the face of the serious economic crisis - the Russians who had been in poverty tried to cross the border in order to buy the first goods in trade.
This expenditure was used by 200 000 Venezuelan citizens.
This time it's time for one of us to come to Latvia, a sympathetic Madara Palameiki.

She's a Latvian lighthouse starting in the race for the race.
Her coach is Gint Palameik's father.
The Latvian record is breaking down in the mix.
After participating in the 2012 Summer Olympics, several times participating in the World and European Championship (the 4th place held at the 2014 European Championship), the 2015 Diamond League joined third place.
Facebook offers a fight advertising to blockers.
The world's most used social network Facebook has appeared as a warning to the crowd, to understand that blocking advertising banners through special tools is not acceptable and users will also see advertising.
The popularity of special advertising blockers is increasing, but this means that companies whose main source of income is directly advertising will be reduced.
Facebook has now made it clear that you understand the nature of advertising banners, but users will also live with them.
However, they will be provided with tools so that they can choose for themselves what type of material they are shown to be reported to the BBC.
"As we provide people with more and more control opportunities, we also start to show advertising to those who use advertising blocking software," said Facebook advertising vice-president Andrew Bosvorts.
In other words, users will be able to choose what kind of advertising they see by selecting the brands and sectors that they seem interesting to them.
"People don't like to see advertising that doesn't apply to them or interferes with the taste of content," Bosworth added.
The advertising blocking tools on mobile devices usually do not work, from which Facebook receives the largest visit, but the reduction of the banner exposure generated by them in the same currency is measured in billions.
According to BBC information, advertising blockers employ about 200 million people.
It has been reported that on the fourth quarter of the previous business year, Facebook revenue from advertising was $6.2 billion or €5.55 billion.
It must be said that this is not the first time Facebook is actively involved by determining what network users see in their new streams.
As one of the last steps, Facebook just started to act to collect or at least limit the new flows with "study" headlines, which actually hide the "empty" news.
At night, the Freedom Street will carry out asphalt work; traffic restrictions should be calculated.
To destroy the freeway phase from Bárzaunes Street to Gustava Zemgala Street will be carried out asphalt recording work, so that drivers have to be calculated with limited traffic in this route.
As the LETA was informed in Riga, the traffic restrictions will start this stage from plkt.21 this morning and the asphalt work will last until 12 August.7.
The traffic towards the South will be turned over by tramway lights.
Car drivers should be calculated with limited traffic at this stage and additional time spent on the road.
The Government calls for a reasonable response to the restrictions imposed and compliance with the rules of conduct of the organisation.
The next refurbishment will take place in the capital city's capital streets - Freedom street from Raina Boulevard to Lačlaša Street and from the Air tower to Juglas Street, Lačplėš Street from Salu tower to Avota Street, Juglas Street from Kvile to Malinas Street and Lielvárde Street from the Dzelzava Street to the 84th Secondary School.

Medvedev’s vice-president, Riga, believed in secret with several ZZS ministers.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitria Medvedeveva, Vice-President Arkadijs Dvorkovich last week visited Riga, secretly believing with the three ministers of the Green and Agricultural Union (ZZS) in a fish processing industry.
The informal meeting took place in the fish processing industry "Kaija", and was attended by the finance minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola, Minister of Transport Uldis Augustis and Minister of Agriculture Janis Dúklavs, mail Internet portal "sees.lv".
After such a meeting, the Portal approved Reisniece-Ozola.
She explained that during the meeting there was a mention of the abolition of sanctions against fishermen and the Inçukalna gas station.
The anti-deployment of diplomatic practice has taken place without the involvement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The organizer of the meeting was Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Vešnákovs.
It is estimated that more than €130,000 of the collection will be booked.
The State Police (DP) Department of Economic Crime Prevention (ENAP) was informed by Gita Gzibovska, a representative of the Gjibovska, of the agency's accounts that have been operating in Riga for 20 years.
The current information shows that the suspect woman has been engaged in illegal activities for several years and has suffered more than EUR 130 thousand in total.
In view of the lack of careful monitoring of the cash flow and confidence of the company’s staff, they knew only a few years later about the manoeuvres.
VP ENAP police arrested suspects in this month for a woman who was pregnant in 1963 and committed sexual harassment in the company.
In relation to the case, the criminal proceedings for the arrest were initiated if it was made in large quantities.
Derogation of freedom from such offences for a period of up to ten years by confiscating property or without property.
The detained person is currently subject to a security measure which does not relate to the withdrawal of freedom.
In Estonia, Zika virus has been detected for nine people.
In Estonia, nine people were analysed by Zika virus antibodies, which meant that they could have been infected with this infection, the public radio organisation of Estonia sent ERR.
The information provided by the laboratory indicates that this year Zika’s virus tests were conducted for 121 samples and nine of them were positive.
The first cases of Zika have been found in the countries near Estonia in Finland and Sweden.
The health data of Estonia show that no acute infection of the Zika virus in the country has been recorded and that people should not be tested for the Zika virus in case of flu-like symptoms, but should be approached by their family doctor.
We have found IgG (class G immunoglobulin G) antibodies that show that the tested person is currently infected with Zika or a similar virus.
"It doesn't mean that the patient is sick with the Zika virus," explained Paul Nabers, head of the Section for Synlab infection.
"Aedes" is a skin-ginning skin in the mouth of the Zika virus.
In Latvia there is a problem with the development of high-quality car purchases, BNS said in an interview with the Auto Association Vice-President Ingus Rutinš.
It is estimated that even in the car sector, there are potential problems with dumping prices, Rutinš replied positively.
Of course.
Cars are also different from service services, which are easier to manipulate at prices.
The final result of the car must be paid in any case because it must be purchased from the manufacturer.
However, the problem is and can be classified in two groups.
Whether the purchaser is not competent or not to create a quality purchase, as a result, it is often not known as "purchase".
"Or a very well-known purchase is built to get something specific, and there is now all the wonder," said the Vice-President of the Auto Association.
He pointed out that it is now popular to talk about moving forward from the lowest price offer to the most economically profitable offer as a criterion for determining the winner of the purchase, but in part the public still has a false idea of these things.
Now it's very popular - let's get from the lowest price to the most economically profitable offer!
However, the criteria must be laid down in both cases, and when they are taken into account and assessed, the decision shall be taken unanimously on the basis of the lower price principle.
The technical criteria for quality procurement should be very accurate and appropriate to the market.
However, there is no need to value anything that can be expressed in terms of money.
The points do not need to be evaluated for fuel consumption, volume of emissions, service services and similar cases.
It should be known as the expected life cycle of the car, taken, etc., then all can simply be calculated together.
"The question then is only about which of the scenarios is interested by the author himself?" Rutish explained.
On the other hand, the head of Auto Association projects, Peter Rubulis, noted that problems are often linked to the fact that only one person and the same person form purchases for both cars and jobs and food and these purchases are removed from one sample.
We have also brought to the consultation details of the procurement reserve, which was also difficult to mention as a detailed absurdity.
"The problem is that the buyer is very often lacking any understanding of the subject of the purchase and the requirements are simply part of something," Rubulus admits.
On the other hand, the Russians add - because there is a smaller structure that exposes the purchase, because there may be more problems.
"It is obviously because of a lack of human resources and competence," said the vice-president to the associations.
Latvian volleyballists do not go to war on medals.

"The Answer" accuses "A suicide unit" of touching the style.
The South African Group "Die Answer" accused the director of the film "Suicide Sqaud" ("A suicide unit") of the group's unique use without permission, calling the respected director "feeded food".
The group's leader, Jolandi, on the "Instagram" mobile phone, will address the director of the "Warner Bros" film studio, saying, "That's right, David Aier, you're looking at our style".
As she claims, the film stars Karas Delavinia and Jéreda Leto have been told that Ayrs are yours in the "Die Answer" film field.
"But you didn't ask permission to arrest us," said the singer.
At 31 years of age, music claims that his group's friend Ninja (Ninja) will certainly turn to Aer, but he "no answer no, how will this particular food be killed".
Jolandi argues that Ayrs has recovered cars from the 2011 Umshini Wam, the introduction of the film, which shows South Africa's hippopathic dunes.
She also published a video clip that proved it to be that Ayrs Joker and Harly's pictures were taken from both players.
At the same time, let's just assume that the original Joker picture is based on the romantic image of David Bowie.
Jolandi finally voted in favour of the critical assessment carried out by the film after the show.
Jolandi and Ninja, in the real words of Andri du Tuata and Watkins Tudors Jones, gained fame with three repa studio entries, popularizing the African "Zef" conturgence.

Turkey is looking for missing diplomats after the trial
Turkey shall seek at least 32 diplomats, which shall not return to the staff member referred to after the trial on 15 July.
Foreign Minister Mevits Čavušogols said Friday that 208 Turkish Ministerial staff were dismissed from workplaces around the world during the search for evidence for an attempt to investigate Ankara, and 32 were missing "without permission".
Some 18,000 civilians, military leaders and academics have been arrested or withdrawn from their occupations in Turkey by the government, considering them to be loyal U.S. official Fatul Gulenu, who accuses them of developing a government recovery plan.
Gulens, who lives in Pennsylvania, is one of Turkey's most sought-for-profits.
Kavooglu said that the U.S. Department of Justice would be visiting Turkey later this month to discuss his possible release.
This issue has become a problem for the US with Turkey, NATO Member State.
The US opposed Turkey's President Regjepa Tajipa Erdogan's powerful armed tactic, and Turkey responded by trying to establish closer ties with Russia.
Kavooglu said that Turkish military allies in Greece had fled to Italy, the mayor in Kuwait tried to flee to Saudi Arabia, but were sent back, and two generals from Afghanistan were arrested in Dubai and sent to Turkey.
He also said that two officials in Bangladesh fled to New York, and one from Russia went to Japan.
Ankar newspaper Daily Hurryiet, quoting military sources, reported that the loss is also a Turkish military companion in Jordan.
Wall Street Journal, quoting an American officer who is aware of the situation, reported that the NATO commander based in Virginia has requested US asylum.
There are those who have managed to escape.
There have also been refugees among our diplomats," Kavosoglu said to the radio organisation NTV in the interview.
Since evening, the time has passed for those who were initially rejected.
We will act against those who do not return.
Olympic game organizers are trying to clean up the green bottom of the dance pool
The Olympics, for whom the training was scheduled on Friday, entered the closed pool, as the organizers needed more time to clean up the dirty water before the first individual competitions in the Rio Olympics.
The water quickly changed color on Tuesday, during the synchronous cooling season.
The organizers claimed that water sinks were safe even after the nearby pool of water pools and the synchronous evaporated evaporation had been easily absorbed.
It was not yet possible for athletes to enter the morning inhalation, although the pool was finally opened at 13.00 p.m. after local time - just 2 1/2 hours before women’s 3 meters race.
The water color looked closer to its normal color, yet it remained green.
The U.S. Secretary of State Ebia Johnstone, who was on the tramline, told me that she was just going to the front door to find out that the base was closed without any warning.
She wrote in her tweet that "#FixTheSwamp should be fashionable.
British narrator Tom Delijs, who was excommunicated in the bronze synchronous platform, also commented on the base position in the tweet.
We hope that this means that in the last days, we are not as bad as we are!
Mario Andrada, the main speaker of the local organizers' committee, stressed that the base of competition is safe by giving green light to 3 meters ahead.
He admitted that some sportsmen were disturbed by water, but he said that this was the result of the cleansing effort.
"We repeat what we have said all the time - water in no way endangers the health of sportsmen," he said.
On the first day of such a water situation, one or two athletes complained that they were blind.
This was the result that the first reaction when we saw how the water turned green was to use one of the chemicals - chlorine - it is used very often in the pools.
We quickly reduced the amount.
We checked the water again, and it fully responded to the parameters.
Simon Lengford, the main speaker at the centre of the water sports centre of Marias Lenka, said that the pool was closed for additional cleaning work.
He said that the decision was supported by the world’s leading organisation FINA (International Federation of Pedestrians).
"The idea is that the water needs to be peaceful so that the pool can go back to its green colors as soon as possible," Lengfords said in his statement.
Andrada said that the deterioration of the state of basein has caused the organizers to be surprised by the lack of preparation.
"Chemical isn't the exact science," he said.
Some things you can see are long.
In the last few days, the naturalization of water colour has become even more difficult.
"There's nothing wrong with Lietus," said Andrada.
He added that sportsmen were available summer trains from the morning, but he realized that it was "not ideal."
He explained that basin colour changes were increased due to alkaline levels, such as aqueous water may become green if not adequately monitored.
When we started doing something to avoid greens, there were discussions about the best chemicals.
We can't use too much chemicals in water because athletes are training it," said Andrada.
We certainly could have done better at the beginning to prevent the water from becoming green.
When it gets green, we're going to make a mistake again.

Shanhaja, Taipei, on the strength of the cross-border communication, will, however, take the lead
On Friday, however, the annual urban forum for Shanghai and Taipei will be held in Taipei from 22 to 23 August, despite the suspension of cross-border communication mechanisms.
High-level municipal officer She Hailins Shanhajas will lead the delegation represented in the forum in the task of Yanga Ksinga, as announced by the Shanghai Government in its official microblog account, Sina Weibo.
The forum has been in the rotation of both cities since 2010.
The 2016 Forum will focus on the exchange of experience in areas such as health care, electronic administrative services, culture and transport, trying to "increase the exchange of experience and cooperation in different aspects" between the two cities, as reported by the Government of Shanghai.
The Taiwanese party did not recognize the agreement reached in 1992 with which one Chinese principle was confirmed, since the new leader Tsai Ing-Wen took office in May, as a result of the suspension of communication and consultation mechanisms.
Ma Ksiaoguang , Taiwan's Office of the State Council spoke on Friday that peaceful cross-border relations may exist while the Taiwanese party adhered to the 1992 agreement on political foundations.
"We have an active and open attitude to the exchange of experience between the two sides," said MA, stressing that the cross-border relationship and the reality of the exchange of experiences of cities should be correctly interpreted.

On the fourth day, with the Chinese Foreign Minister Vangu Ji, Uganda's President Joveri Museveni thanked China for its continued support for Uganda's development and expressed hope for closer cooperation.
It was said that China was an old friend of Uganda and Africa who supported the liberation of the African continent from colonialism and later supported the economic and social development of Africa.
