The Members of the Assembly (AM, for their signs in English) of Wales are concerned about "the appearance of muppets"
Some members of the Assembly are disappointed by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Gales Parliament (MWP, for their signals in English).
This misunderstanding arises from the plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly of the whole political spectrum are concerned that this can be reticulated.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said his group was concerned about "who stays with Twp and Pwp".
For the outside readers of Wales: In Gales, twp means tonto y pwp means cata.
A member of the Gales Party Assembly commented that his entire group was "satisfied" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Gales Conservative Party stated that his group was "open" to the change of name, but pointed out that the drop in MWP to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Gales is similar to that of the letter of Yorkshire.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently drawing up legislation to introduce the change in the name, declares: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the appointment of the members of the Assembly will be the subject of its own members."
The Law 2017 of the Government of Wales granted the Assembly of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which revealed broad support to call the Assembly Parliament of Wales.
On the issue of the title of the members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Wales Parliament (or the WMP), but the MWP option received most of the support in a public consultation.
It appears that the members of the Assembly are suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could lead to the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who should send the draft law on changes in a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the Assembly, such as rules on the incapacity of members of the Assembly and the design of the system of committees.
The members of the Assembly will have the last word on the question of how they should be called when deciding on legislation.
Macedonians call on the Urs to vote in favour of a referendum on the change in the country's name
The voters will vote on Sunday on whether the name of their country will be changed to "Northern Macedonian Republic".
The popular vote was called on in an attempt to resolve a conflict of decades with the neighbouring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its neighbour in the north is a claim from its territory and repeatedly objected to its application for accession to the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the plebiscite on the change in name, said that the vote would be rejected.
However, the referendum parties, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, maintain that the change in name is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
San Martín's campaigns remain silent because of the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
"History, the older people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's nothing or anything."
He pointed out that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"Now socialize people differently," he says.
"The bars are no longer the rooms of being of the neighborhoods to which neighbors go regularly."
With regard to the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will not last as long as the leaders wait and that "before or after, they will return to the point of departure".
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartments full of people who will not help the saints who are in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people," he said, "and, therefore, they will speed up the closure of these churches, since it is unlikely that most people who move to these apartments are finally members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolitan community in 1870 and San Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation was in the 30th century.
A black congregation that rendered worship close to the house acquired the building.
A black congregation took San Martín’s reindeer, under the direction of Governor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to street merchants 125, a main way of buying Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
In 1939 a fire left the building severely damaged, and while Father Johnson’s happy men planned to rebuild it, they also carried the carrollon.
Reverendo David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in San Martin, proudly called him "the campaigns of the poor".
In July, the expert who played the chariot called "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, of Michigan University, noted that it was the world's first carroll used by a black music, Dionysio A. Lind, who went to play the Riverside Church carroll, the largest, 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that San Martin did not replace it.
What has happened in San Martín in recent months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought by the lay church leaders and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish meeting, the governing body of the parishes, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July expressing its concern that the diocese "has tried to pass the costs" to the council, although it had not participated in the contracting of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some happy people complained about the lack of transparency by diocese.
Tiburón yesterday to a 13-year-old boy who was swimming in search of langousts in California
A tiger attacked and kidnapped a 13-year-old boy on the Sabbath while he was swimming in search of gorillas in California on the day the season was opened, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before the 7th of the morning near Beacon's Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel reported to San Diego's KSWB-TV channel that he had been swimming with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the child asking for help, so he approached a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel commented that, at first, he thought he was so excited that he had caught a nail, but then he realized that "he was screaming that they had killed him.
%s, Free space: %s,
I had the broken keyboard," observed Hammel when he arrived with the child.
"I cried to everyone who came out of the water because there was a tiger," Hammel added.
The child was transported to the Rady Children Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The type of tyburon responsible for the attack is unknown.
The casualty, Captain Larry Giles, commented on a press street that had been shot in the area a few weeks ago, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries in the upper part of the torso.
The authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, Casablad, to Swami Beach, Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of tigers in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sansbury's plans stimulate the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many employees specialized in the steps of their style and beauty.
In order to significantly promote the United Kingdom's beauty market, estimated at 2800 billion pounds and with an increase that is increasing compared to the drop in sales in fashion and the threat of home, larger beauty passports will be tested in 11 shops across the country and, if they are successful, will be done at the same store next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time that this chain of supermarkets seeks ways to use space in stations that are often directed to televisions, microwaves and household threats.
Sainsbury's said he would double his beauty offer with up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, there will be more space for the existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other facilities, such as Boots.
The chain will also launch its Boutique maquillage range with a majority of products that respect animals, something that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
Also, in the perfume The Fragrance Shop will test its concessions in two Saninsbury's establishments, the first recently opened in Croydon, south of London, last week. The second will be opened in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, later this year.
Online stores and the change to the daily purchase of small quantities of food in local stores require supermarkets to work to convince people that they are visiting them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, has stated that stores will become increasingly like commercial centers while the supermarket chain tries to fight Aldi and Lidl discounts by offering more services and products that are not food.
Sainsbury's has integrated points of sale of Argos discounts in hundreds of establishments and has introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago. It is considered that this has prompted the sales of food and made these acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket chain to renew its beauty and pharmaceutical departments was a failure.
Sansbury's tested a joint operation with Boots in early 2000, but the collaboration ended after a discussion on how to divide the income of the pharmaceutical product sales points into its supermarkets.
The new strategy is based on the sale of 281 pharmaceutical establishments from Sainsbury to Celesio, a company owned by the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding a wide range of luxury brands for skin care, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, director of the Sansbury's business, commented: "We have transformed the aspect and environment of our beautiful landscapes in a way that enables the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in a specialized staff that will be available to offer advice.
Our brand offers are designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, an attractive environment and a comfortable location makes us an irresistible destination of beauty products, challenging the old way of buying."
Peter Jones's "frequency" after Holly Willoughby broke an 11 million pounds deal.
Peter Jones, Dragon's Den's star, became "frequency" after the television interviewer Holly Willoughby broke a 11 million-dollar deal with his business life-style line to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to dedicate to the fashion brand and Truly plugins.
This business has been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old representative of This Morning announced that he had abandoned his business in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has forced Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, to abandon his lucrative lifestyle business in the last minute to focus on his extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources consulted, Jones was "frequency" when the gold girl of the television admitted that her new agreements, valued at up to 1.5 million pounds, did not leave time to dedicate to Truly, her fashion brand and supplements, during a intense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The business had been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and was described as favorite to double Willoughby's fortune, of about 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37 years old, announced that he had left his business in Instagram, Jones left Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one source commented: "Truly was, unlike, Holly's main priority.
It would be his long-term future, which would last for the next two decades.
His decision to abandon all those who were fully involved.
No one could believe what happened Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at Marlow's headquarters, ready products for sale."
Experts believe that the release of this morning's representative, one of the most profitable stars in Britain, could cost millions to the company due to the important investment in products that come from coins and clothes, and possibly even delay its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and ten years ago who maintain a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined as president in March.
Couples were on vacation together and Jones had a 40 per cent share in Baldwin's TV producer.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador to M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a program representative I'm A Celebrity on the ITV channel.
A source near Jones said last night, "it wasn't about business topics."
A hard conversation "and then we love ourselves"
She spoke of the criticisms received by the media for making a comment that some would consider "the short presidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump commented with his voice bulson of "noticer".
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in meeting him again after Trump welcomed the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which he considered to be a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearization have been halted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's main diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, explained to the world leaders gathered at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that his country did not see an "appropriate response" from the United States to the first steps for North Korea's disarmament.
On the contrary, he pointed out that the United States continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump's perspective was much more optimistic in the speech he gave during his myth.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results: the end of the missile tests, help free hostages and bring the deaths of U.S. soldiers back home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach to talking about relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but so, instead of 10,000 people there were trying to enter this filled stadium, we would have about 200 people right here," said Trump, pointing to the people who were right in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island, leaving hundreds of missing
Following the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had had to move, there was no national emergency, a prior requirement for catalytic international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have left it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, which is a little complicated," said Mrs. Sumbong.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team that will send to Palu, they are still not sure if foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national emergency agency, explained that the authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations were allowed to provide assistance.
Given that the land is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country continues to be incredibly little prepared when nature breaks its anger.
Although refugees have been built for tsunamis in Aceh, they are not found in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami alert sirens in Palu, even though there was a prior warning, has contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best case, traveling from one island of Indonesia to another presents a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship located in Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake is headed to Palu, but it will be at least three days after reaching the key of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo turned the improvement of Indonesia's waste infrastructure in the central axis of its electoral campaign, and has devoted a lot of money to road and rail lines.
However, the lack of funding has affected Mr Joko's administration, which is facing a re-election next year.
In addition, it must face the pressure of persistent sectoral tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority of Muslims have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were missing and tens of thousands had to leave their homes while Christians and Muslims fought on the streets using masks, bows and arrows, and other handguns.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool, the marker before Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the First League before Chelsea with a gol in 89 minutes on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri to something more than 27 metres from Chelsea's port when the marker was 1-0.
He put the balloon on his left foot with a touch before he threw it to the second floor.
The action was sent above the area and directed to the top right corner of the network.
Finally, the balloon passed on top of Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop it with a jump and fell into the network.
"I was trying to put myself in that position to do with the ball and players like Shaq always play very advanced, so I tried to give me as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I see Kante approaches and gives him a touch. I didn't think too much of it, I just shot him."
Chelsea was winning 1-0 in the first half after the Belgian star Eden Hazard marked a gol in the 25th minute.
The middle point of the Blues made a taco pass to Matthew Kovacic in that game, before turning a regatta near the middle field and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic quickly passed the balloon and went out running in the middle field.
Then he made a beautiful passage to the space he took to Hazard to the area.
Hazard stood in front of the defense and ended up throwing the balloon into the network of the second post with a pad with the left foot that Alison Becker, of Liverpool, could not stop.
On Wednesday at 15:00, Liverpool plays against Naples in the season of the League Championships. The meeting will be held at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
On the other hand, Chelsea faces Videoton in UEFA Europe League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of victims by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the country's emergency agency on Sunday.
Many people were trapped between the walls of the buildings that collapsed during the quake of magnitude 7.5 that occurred on Friday and that destroyed waves of up to six meters, according to the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press round.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by remains of destroyed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man as a suspect of murder after a woman was beaten to death
A murder investigation has been opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 in Grayson Mews, John Street, who was accused of arresting a 32-year-old man as a suspect of murder.
The police have called on people in the area who have seen or heard anything from the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in the initial stages, but would encourage anyone who was close to Jonh Street in Birkenhead, and who has seen or heard anything suspicious about contacting us.
In addition, I would recommend that any person, especially taxi drivers, have been able to catch something in Dashcam to contact us, because they can have vital information for our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body has been found is from Birkenhead and that was buried inside a property.
This afternoon some people who think they know the woman came to the scene of the crime to know where they had found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victims' families.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his room, but the police tell him that nobody can come in or get out of the building.
He fell asleep when he found out what had happened.
The residents are now informed that they will be allowed to enter again in a few hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in the place in tears.
Don't stop repeating "the terrible."
At two o'clock in the afternoon, there were two police cars inside and out.
Several agents remained standing inside the cord by controlling the block of floors.
Any person who has information that sends an e-mail to DM @MerPolCC is requested to call 101 or contact Crimestopers anonymously in number 0800 555 111, register 247 of 30 September.
Parliament's Cromwell Statute becomes the last memorable success by "rewriting history"
His ban would be an act of poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of many cultural and religious objects in England carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestions as a "place" and a "test to re-write history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate on the elimination of statues, it was inevitable that taking the figure of Oliver Cromwell from the Westminster Palace would become a goal.
The iconoclacy of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
It may sacrifice to Cromwell mistakenly for the actions of his predecessor, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is a proof of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many consider worthy of celebrating.
As Mr Goldsmith pointed out to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than at the present time, a parliamentary defender against external pressure, in this case, is clear, monarchy.
If this is a completely accurate description, it is a matter of continuing with the historical debate.
What is true is that the middle conflict of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognized figure that represents a face of that division.
Their achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebrating and remembering."
A serial killer attacks a Chinese winner
A hero attacked and killed a winner in a market in southwestern China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his nickname "Yuan", was found dead with a split and blood-covered artery near a handful of Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou, as the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, a farmer of pigs is preparing to inject vaccines to pigs from a village in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Apparently, he traveled with his cousin from Yunnan's nearby province on Wednesdays to sell 15 beers on the market.
The next morning, his first find him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby village was open.
He said there was a big snake with blood in his mouth in his pocket.
The federal review confirmed that nearly 250 kilograms of beer had attacked the winner until death, according to the report.
"My first legs were bleeding and destroyed," said the first, to whom they were directed by their appeal, "Wu", to The Guiyang Evening News.
The images of the security camera showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan nor to his firstborn.
A market manager told The Evening News that the jury was closed to prevent anyone else from attacking, while the police collected evidence at the site.
It seems that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they're rare, it's not the first time a hero attacks a person.
In 2016 a silversmith attacked a woman and her husband in their Massachusetts farm, leaving the wounded man with a gravity.
Ten years ago, a nearly 295 pounds [295 kg] silver mined a winner in his tractor until his wife threatened the animal.
After, in 2012, a winner of Manitoba declared to CBC News that the bears are not often aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "smoker".
"They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... their intention is not to hurt.
What needs to be done is to have proper respect for them," he said.
The rest of the Rosa hurricane will leave strong global floods in the southwestern United States.
As planned, the Rosa hurricane is weakening as it moves over the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains all north of Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa caused wind speeds of more than 136 km/h, a category 1 hurricane from Sunday to Friday morning (the Eastern Time) and was located almost 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean they are starting to generate low pressures, which are moving towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the low California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will start to push the intense tropical rain in the north, towards the southwestern United States.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimetres of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when tropical rain shocks with the low pressure that is approaching, there will be strong generalised precipitations in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimetres of rain will cause dangerous sudden floods, floods of forests and possible eruptions in the desert.
Tropical intense rainfall will cause almost 5 to 8 centimetres per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimetres of rain are expected in parts of the south-west, especially in most of Arizona.
Because of the widespread nature of tropical rain, it is possible that there are sudden floods with conditions that rapidly worsen.
Because of this threat of tropical torrential floods, it is not recommended that you make an adventure in the desert on foot.
The heavy rains could turn cannons into brittle rivers and storms will cause torrential winds and dust clouds locally.
The approaching low pressure will leave strong floods in concrete parts of southern California.
The torrential rains may leave almost two centimetres of water, which could cause small streams of rain and make roads rebalancing.
This would be the first torrential rains in the region during the wet season.
Some dispersioned tropical hats will start approaching Arizona at the last hour of the Sunday and the first hour of the moon, before the rain is generalised at the end of the Mondays and Tuesdays.
The mighty floods will be extended to the Four Esquins on Tuesday and during all Wednesdays.
In October some intense changes in the U.S. temperature can be observed by the freezing of the Arctic and the heat of the tropicals.
Sometimes this implies dramatic changes in temperature in short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen in the entire center of the U.S. Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha (Nebraska), and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to recover and expand again.
In a large part of the center and east of the U.S., a warm start is expected, with generalised temperatures ranging from 26 degrees south to the north.
On March, in New York temperatures will be around 26 degrees Fahrenheit [26 ° C] above average.
Our long-term forecast shows high probability of temperatures higher than the average for the U.S. East during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw the proportion of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people followed out of the testimonies that Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a alleged sexual aggression in the 1980s, gave the Thursday in six television chains.
Meanwhile, the policy continued at a dead end and the media interrupted its usual programming to transmit the latest news of the Fridays: an agreement designed by Senator Jeff Blake, Arizona, so that the FBI can conduct a week's investigation of the charges.
Ford informed the Senate's Judicial Commission that he was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh had touched her in a state of pregnancy and that he was trying to get her clothes off at an institute party.
During his passionate witness, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely sure that had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people who commented on Nielsen on Friday have seen it.
The company accounted for the average audit in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that retransmitted it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen often has some problems to calculate how many people get something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is an audience similar to that of an American football game of the playoffs or Oscar prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose territorials have strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, fueled the lead channel, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during a comparison that lasted all day, noted Nielsen.
ABC occupied the second place, with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2,52 million, Nielsen commented.
After the comparison, he continued to show great interest.
Flake was the central character of the Friday drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican to issue a communication informing that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, the CNN and CBS Chambers in the morning saw how some protestors shouted when they tried to raise an elevator to attend a conference with the Judicial Commission.
While receiving these complaints, transmitted directly by the CNN, he was adamant.
"Looking at my face," said one woman.
"Do you think you're telling the truth to the country?"
And he continued: "You have power when there are many women who don't have it."
Flake said that his office had issued a communication and, before the elevator doors were closed, he would tell more about his comparability to the Commission.
The cable and broadcasting television chains issued it all in direct hours later, when the Judicial Commission had to vote to propose Kavanaugh's application to the Senate to vote.
However, Blake said that he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the candidate for the next week, which had been requesting some Democrats.
Flake was convinced, in part, by the conversations he had with his friend, the Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Blake made his decision.
Flake's decision was fundamental, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation on allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political" with Brexit
First Minister Theresa May accused the critics of his plan to leave the European Union to "politicalize" the future of Britain and shake national interest in an interview with the daily Sunday Times.
The first British Minister, Theresa May, comes to Congress of the Conservative Party to be held in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published with her on the cover of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on the above-mentioned Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal for Britain and the EU to cover the other's tariffs was " utterly absurd".
Wade's murder: The police arrested Dyteon Simpson as suspect of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect for the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU football player, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, has been arrested and imprisoned for a second-grad murder charge, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities made a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police indicated that Sims lost his gloves during the battle.
The police recovered the gloves in the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, according to WAFB, CBS's branch.
After questioning Simpson, the police say they admitted to shoot Wade.
A $350,000 loan has been established, according to the defence.
The Baton Rouge District Instructor This published a preliminary report on Friday in which it indicated that the cause of death had been a bullet wound in the neck that had reached the head.
The Department recognises the merits of the units of refugees of the State Police of Louisiana, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the Southern University police and the citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, sports director of the LSU, thanked the police forces in the area for their "diligency and search for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who measured more than two meters, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played the ball player in LSU.
It had obtained an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 reboots in a game of the last season.
The Friday morning, Will Wade, LSU ballistic trainer, said his team is "damaged" and "in shock" for the death of Wade.
"These are the things that people always worry about," Wade commented.
A red volcano in Mexico City
Ceenza from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the neighborhoods located south of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans that they would stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and recorded 183 gas and greenhouse emissions in 24 hours.
The centre recorded several drums and saccuits.
In the social networks, images showed fine censorship caps covering the parabiles of vehicles in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have observed a greater activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometres west of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Six persons were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after independent protesters were confronted with the anti-disturbies while thousands of people participated in opposition demonstrations matching the first anniversary of the Catalan referendum on the secession.
A group of separatists trapped in which anti-disturbies had cut the pace threw eggs and paint in dust, creating dark dust clouds on the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
There were also confrontations in later hours, and the police used pores to contain the fight.
For several hours, independent groups, with messages such as "I forget or forgive", faced Unionists with the cry of "Viva Spain".
Forty people were subjected to mild injuries during protests, according to local media.
The tensions continue to be high in this region one year after the vote on 1 October, considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters elected for a vast majority of independence, although participation was low, as those who opposed the section voted in favour of the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the vote at electoral stations throughout the region, where violent confrontations were made.
In favour of independence, groups camped on Friday night to avoid a demonstration of support to the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife said he had no hope that Catalunja would be independent.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying happy to be able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite achieving a vital victory, although strict, in the last December regional elections, the pro-Catalanist parties have fought to keep the momentum this year, since many of their most well-known leaders, whether in the self-taxed or held exile, are awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been warned by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in preventive prison since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in elections to the European Parliament next year.
"To be candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for embezzlement of a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after re-examination of a Londonderry house with a car.
The incident took place on Thursday at 19:30 in Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that there were damages to access and the building itself.
At some point, it may have been shot in the car with a ballast.
Menga's attack gives 1-0 victory to Livingston against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston guaranteed victory
A promoted Livingston impressed the Rangers by winning the second defeat for Steven Gerarrd in 18 parties as the trainer of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's attack marked the difference. Gary Holt's men took a position, with the Hibernian second position.
This time, Gerard's men have not yet won any victory outside the house, and the next Sunday they face Hearts, leaders of the table with eight points of advantage.
Previously, the Rangers received the Fast Vienna Thursday in the European Union.
In the meantime, Livingston expanded his race of victories in the division of six parties. Holt, the master trainer, has not enjoyed the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston leaves opportunities to face a continuant visitor
Holt's team had to have gone a step forward long before marking, causing all kinds of problems to Rangers for their direct game.
Scott Robinson exceeded the defense, but his attempt failed in front of the door. Then Alan Lithgow pulled out the shot after he stepped in to finish Craig Halkett's head centre in front of the door.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for visitors with stop-ball players.
That's how the decisive wave came.
The Rangers gave them a free shot and Livingston sought an entrance, with a combined game from Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, which hit the balloon and marked from the center of the area.
At that time, the Rangers dominated the possession, but they could not pass over the shelter and the porter, Liam Kelly, was quite quiet.
That game continued until the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop from Kelly.
Allan McGregor, the Ranger porter refused a shot of Scott Pittman from a patty, and Lithgow stayed away from another play in Livingston.
In the Livingston area, long walks were constantly blocked, but they were always dismissed. Two petitions were rejected, one after one of Halkett's entry on Glenn Middleton and the other by one hand.
Livingston's "Fenomenal" (analysis)
Lasadair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
An act and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
The unanimical opinion is that they made an excellent game that continued to overcome the expectations of an ascending trajectory.
Its game style and pattern have only experienced changes since its rise, but this is largely due to Holt in the way it has strengthened the team since its arrival.
I was counting on a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain of the team, was enormously organized and directed a wonderfully organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall alert at all times.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
Although they had very good moments with Gerard, they were short.
They failed to materialize the games, as they only managed to get into the opposite field once, which is a call for attention to the Rangers, which are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguity in Colombia
On Saturday, 29 September, there was a blue sky and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to restore relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Later, Erdogan headed to Colombia to open up a huge new mix.
The city welcomes the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called for security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from meeting in front of the meeting, but many sympathetic people stood on the steps to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents were also heard, many of them Kurds, who condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive it in the country.
These demonstrations reflect the distributiveness that this visitor, received as a hero by some German Turks, and considered an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist fails after collision with a vehicle
A cyclist died in a car accident in London.
The accident took place near the top of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a competition road from Deptford, in the north of the city, at 10:15.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was cared for by the paramedics, but he fell right there.
The accident takes place after another cycler dies after being hit by a vehicle that ran off in Childers Street, nearly two kilometres from the scene of the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the agents were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been cut off and buses have been removed, and drivers who avoid the area have been advised.
Long Lartin Prison: Six wounded agents after a series of disturbances
Six prison officials have been injured in an alternative produced in a high-security prison for men, according to the Office of the Prison Centre.
The disturbances began in Long Lartin prison, Worcestershire, at 9:30 a.m. and continued.
Specialists of an elite team (called "Tornado") are in charge of controlling the alternates, who participate in eight interiors and affect a palace.
The agents were assisted by light injuries on the ground.
A spokesman for the prison service commented: "A specialized prison staff has been deployed to deal with the incident in the course of Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members have received health assistance for injuries.
In our prisons violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that the officers will be put in the police's hands and that they could spend more time between kings."
Long Lartin prison accommodates more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical assistance after a prisoner had been attacked.
In addition, in October last year, anti-disturbing agents were asked to go to prison to face a serious alternative in which prison personnel were attacked with billing balls.
The hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (arid areas could be benefited)
It is not uncommon for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen at the beginning of the week that will come when the last collections of the Rosa hurricane crossing the southeastern part of the desert, with the risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorology Service has already issued alerts by current floods for the moon and Tuesdays in the west of Arizona, the south and east of Nevada and the west of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa is headed directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain at the end of the moon.
The Phoenix National Weather Service commented in a tweet that only "ten hurricanes had preserved their state of tropical storms or depression on a radius of 321 kilometres from Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina approached nearly 65 kilometres from Arizona's border."
The latest models of the National Centre of Huracanes range from 5 to 10 centimetres of torrential rain, which can reach the 15 centimetres in isolated areas of the Mogollón Escarpe, Arizona.
It is likely that they fall between 2 and 5 centimetres of rain, with the possibility of reaching 10 in isolated places, in other southwestern parts of the desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Grand Cuenca.
In places where there is no risk of sudden floods, the rivers of Rosa can be considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, it is likely that part of these torrential floods will be beneficial because of the dry conditions currently being experienced in the south-west.
According to the U.S. Seikia Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is suffering, at least extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported in weather.com.
First of all, the Rosa hurricane router will azota the peninsula of Baja California, Mexico.
Rosa, who will still have a hurcanized force with maximum speeds of 136 kilometres per hour, is 619 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north to 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it's losing strength.
Thus, it is expected to recover in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm along the afternoon of the moon.
Strong torrents could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
"There are expected torrential floods between 7 and 15 centimetres from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 centimetres", as reported in weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north of Mexico as a tropical storm, before arriving at the Arizona border in the first hours of the morning as a tropical depression. Later, Arizona will move south of Utah at the last hour of the night of March.
"The main danger of Rosa or her remains is the strong torrential rain in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora and the southwestern of the U.S. desert."
These floods are expected to cause dangerous sudden floods and floods in deserts, as well as land degradation in mountain areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old have been arrested as suspects of a attempted murder after they had found another 16-year-old with white weapons wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was injured in the Excelsior Terrace area, in Midsomer Norton, at 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
It was transferred to a hospital where it remains stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18 and one 20 were arrested that same night in Radstock area, Avon, according to Somerset Police.
The agents have made a call to anyone who may have recorded what happened with the mobile.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has suffered the blending and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"Voice in favour of Judge Kavanaugh is voted to reject the bitter and angry tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump in a myth held in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "has suffered from the mixed and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the process of appointment.
Kavanaugh testified before the Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she had been sexually abused decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed at the session on this charge.
On Saturday, the president said that that day, "the Americans saw Kavanaugh's enthusiasm, quality and bravery."
"Voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to confirm one of the legislators with more achievements of our day, a lawyer with an amazing history of public service," said his followers in West Virginia.
The President made indirect references to Kavanaugh's candidacy when he spoke of the importance of Republican participation in the elections in the mid-term term.
"Five weeks pass for one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not presenting it, but it's a career," he pointed out.
"That's why I'm going from one place to another fighting to get big candidates."
Trump claimed that Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will be held not later than Friday, a high-ranking task was reported to CNN by the Republican Party.
Hundreds of falls in a earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the figure is rising
At least 384 people have died and many have been dragged down by the huge waves that slammed the beaches after a mighty earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as the authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six meters came to the coast at night, dragging many to death and destroying everything at its feet.
The tsunami occurred after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When yesterday it was announced that a tsunami could occur, the people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they were victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman of the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB, for their Indonesian signals, in a press street in Yakarta.
"Tsunami didn't come alone, dragged cars, tanks, houses, stole everything that was on the ground," commented Nugroho. The tsunami had moved by the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had gone up to the trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, bridges broken down and destroyed, and a water mix.
The Replica continued to strike the city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT, by its indonesia signals) reported in a communication that the energy released by the great earthquake of Friday was 200 times higher than the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the city's geography, which is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "important" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial centres and hotels had been destroyed.
According to him, bodies of some victims were found under the walls of the damaged buildings. In addition, 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho pointed out that the number of victims and damages could be larger along the 300 km north of Palu, a area called Dodrea, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely paralysed and there was no information" from Dongrea, Nugroho commented.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a communiqué, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy of itself, but it could be much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency received many criticisms not to report that a tsunami had taken Palu, although the officials claim that the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a recording taken by an affidavit and shared in social networks, a man is heard who was at the last floor of a building warning people on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
In the matter of minutes, a water wall hits the coast, bringing it forward buildings and cars.
Reuters could not validate the immediate material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a great wave that cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army began to send cargo aircraft from Yakarta and other cities, declaring the authorities, but refugees still need food and other basic products.
The city airport has been reopened only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to Paul's evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of victims by the tsunami in Indonesia is over 800.
It's something very bad.
Although the staff of the World Vision of Dodhea arrived healthy and safe in the city of Palu, where employees fled under a ladder installed in the garden of their offices, they saw a devastating panorama on their way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they had seen many destroyed houses," he said.
It's something very bad.
Even while relief groups had launched emergency assistance campaigns, some people regretted that the transfer to Palu of cooperatives with extensive experience was not permitted.
According to the Indonesian legislation, funding, supplies and provision of foreign personnel can be used only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," commented Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for Red Cross in Indonesia.
"As the Government says it is a national disaster, we can begin to provide international assistance, but it has not yet happened."
At the fall of the second night in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami of the Fridays, friends and family of the people who were still missing still had the hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that bring some light to the disillusive stories that record natural disasters.
The Sabbath was brought out to a little boy from a workshop.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the shoulder for two days along with her mother's body.
Gendon Subbandon, the instructor of the national Indonesian parapet team, had trained two missing parapentists for Asian Games, who had completed the same month in Indonesia.
Others who were arrested at the Roa Roa Roa hotel, including Mr Mandani, were students.
"For my experience in the parapet field, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the disclosure of the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had been destroyed in the parapet community, he had sent desperate messages from WhatsApp to Palu's competitors, who participated in the festival that was held on the beach.
However, their messages showed only a grey check mark, not two blues.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Ladrones takes $26,750 during a recharge of an automatic casing at Newport on the Level
On Friday morning, some thieves attacked a Brink employee who was recharged with an automatic cashier at Newport on the Level, carrying $26,750, according to a press note from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had emptyed an automatic cage located in the center of the ocean and was prepared to recharge it with more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the note.
While he was busy, another man "proceeded to run behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money for the recharge.
According to the note, there were witnesses who had seen several suspects in the area, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information on his identity must contact the Newport Police in number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapist changes his name to Ye
The boy Kanye West will start calling him Yes.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person previously known as Kanye West."
It's been a while since West, 41 years old, was introduced to Ye, the name he used as title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to present its new album, Yandhi.
It replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel his performance for "emotional reasons", as the programme creator commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious significance for him.
"I think it's the most used word in the Bible, which means 'tu'," said West at the beginning of this year while talking about the title of the album with the Big Boy radio speaker.
"I'm you, I'm us, it means us.
It turned out to be Kanye, which means 'the only one', to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confused things, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
It's one of the many famous rappers that has changed the name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would prefer the names Love and Brother Love.
An old West collaborator, JAY-Z, has used his name in mauscules or miniscules, with or without guinea pig.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, elected Mexican President, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now about 50 anniversary of a bloody repression against students in the country.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that "he would never use the army to suppress the people of Mexico".
On October 2, 1968, the troops fired against a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were under way throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has committed to providing support to young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those who study and open more free public universities.
He stated that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to become involved in criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the funding of I.A.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an I.A. investor and professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the announcements on I.A. by several parts of the United States Government, even when, in general, the United States lacks an official I.A. strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: its objective is to become number 1 in innovation in I A. for 2030.
"Dublining the budget for I.A. research would be a good start, as all other countries go very far behind the United States. We have the view in the next step in the field of I.A.", notes Lee.
The double funding means the two possibilities for the next major achievement in I.A. to be reached in the United States, as Lee said in an interview with the CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by the editorial Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, the Executive Director of Synoving Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most important companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked in an I.A. system that won the best US player in Othello. Later, he was executive in Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee recognized the previous United States Government technological competitions, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be next, which would enable the next generation of viewers to identify.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, Lee commented.
"It's not China that's taking the academic leaders; they're the corporations," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired high-ranking people from universities to work in I.A.
Lee commented that changes in migration policy could also help the United States to intensify its initiatives in I.A.
"I think doctors in I.A. should have permanent residence cards automatically," he said.
The Council of State of China presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China finance people from academic institutions such as the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations finance U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, notes Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, whose purpose is to attract partners from industrial and academic areas. The White House announced the formation of a Selection Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a $2000 million investment in an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in I.A.
Meanwhile, the United States legislation which sought to establish a National Committee on Artificial Intelligence has not carried out any action in months.
Macedonians decided in a referendum on whether they would change the name of their country
The people of Macedonia decided on a referendum held on Sunday on whether their name would change to the "Northern Republic of Macedonia", a gesture that would resolve a decade-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked their application for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its neighbour in the north is a claim of its territory and has led to its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both Governments reached an agreement on the new name proposed, but nationalist opponents claimed that the change would reduce the ethnic identity of the Slav population, mostly in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign had questioned whether the participation would be at least 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid.
The referendum paper raised the following question: "Is it in favour of accession to NATO and the EU with the adoption of the agreement with Greece?"
The parties to the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries that are emerging from Yugoslavia's deintegration, to try to access bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for Macedonia's young people, so that they can live freely within the framework of the European Union, because this represents a safer life for all," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote in order to be decisive.
The change in name requires a majority of two-thirds in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no irregularities had been reported in the afternoon.
However, the participation was only 16%, compared with 34% of the last elections to Parliament held in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters deposited their vote.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Zoran Zaev, the first Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko, deposited their vote in the Macedonian referendum on a change in the country's name which would open the way to join NATO and the European Union in Struca (Macedonia) on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament, in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, prepared a small scenario and removed chairs in front of the campaign stores planted by those who were going to vote for the referendum.
"We are willing to enter NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our head well, not at the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to join Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and form part of Euro-Asian integration."
First Minister Zaev said that accession to NATO would contribute to the investment needed by Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is above 20%.
"I think the great majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
He said that a positive outcome would be a "confirmation of our future".
In a survey published last month by the Policy Research Institute, it was ensured that between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters would participate in the referendum, which meant a lower participation of the applicant.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia revealed that 57% of the respondents had decided to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said he would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be considered a success, participation must be more than 50% more than one vote.
In the event of failure, it would be the first serious attack on the policy of the proocdential government since it reached power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Agurero, from Manchester City, exorcised all the defence of Brighton to mark a gol
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling re-enacted the defence of Brighton in the 2-0 victory that Manchester City won on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium of Manchester, England.
For Aghuro, it was ridiculously easy to mark a gol in the minute 65.
The Argentine midpoint received a passage in the middle field at the beginning of the game.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before entering the open field.
Once there, I saw around four green shirts.
He went to a defense before crossing several more on the border of the Brighton area.
He took a walk to the left, where Sterling was.
The English front used its first touch in the area to return the balloon to Aguroro, who hit it with the right foot to avoid the porter Matthew Ryan with a shot that reached the right side of the network.
"There are some problems in the foot," said Pep Guardiola, a city trainer, to journalists.
"We're talking about playing between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that there was a gol at that time."
However, it was Sterling that gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the content of the First League.
The bullet arrived at 29 minutes.
In that game, Aguro received the balloon very inside Brighton's territory.
He made a beautiful balloon pass on the left side for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him a few touches before leading Sterling to the second floor.
Sky Blues' front launched the balloon to the network just before leaving the limits.
The City faces Hoffenheim in a team of the Campeones League on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhine-Neckar-Arena of Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to celebrate the Rockies party
With the Nationals removed from the content by the playoffs, there was no reason to force another opening.
However, the always competitive Scherzer expects to force the assembly on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if they are, they raced to Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division of the National League, they still have opportunities in the playoffs.
The Rockies provided at least one Wildcard post thanks to the victory 5-2 on the Nationals on Friday night, but still pursue their first division title.
"Although we don't play anything, at least we can push the rubber with the assurance that the denver public will be excited and that the other team will probably play at the highest level than I have faced this year.
Why didn't you want to participate?"
The Nationals still have to announce an opening for Sunday, but they seem inclined to let Scherzer go in that situation.
Scherzer, who would open his number 34, had a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
The history of Washington's diet is of 18 victories and 7 victories, with an ERA of 2,53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 entries.
Temporarily in West Virginia
The President made indirect references to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his election to the Supreme Court, when he spoke of the importance of Republican participation in the elections in mid-mission elections.
"In November everything we've done is in play.
Five weeks are missing for one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the most important things. I don't know, but it's a career, so I'm going from one place to another fighting for great candidates," he said.
And he continued: "We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all the means necessary, if it is mixed up, evil.
They don't care who harms or who has to pass over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on board a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"We've seen it in the last four days," he said, saying that Democrats "were angry, bad, terrible and lying."
He referred to the Senate's Judicial Commission, appointing democratic senator Diane Feinstein, who received public abuses.
"Do you remember your answer?
Can you filter the document?
Mmm, mmm, what?
No, no mmm, I hope a response. His body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party already covers a wide range of opinions.
It's intolerant with people who say what they think
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I was just surprised.
After all, I am the last of a series of Members of the Parliament of the Labour Party who is told that he is not welcome, and just to say what we think.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, received a treatment that seems to be categorically opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
It was inconsistencies with the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe.
As demonstrated in the announcement of the Meeting of the Nottingham Eastern Labour Party on Friday, "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During most of the eight years in which I have been a member of the Parliament of the Local Labour Party, that is exactly what has been the evening meetings of the General Committee Fridays.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more kind and kinder" policy is already more than forgotten, if it is really applied at some point.
It is becoming more and more clear that discrepancies are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on whether the party's leaders consider it acceptable or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues who had previously thought that he shared a similar political vision began to expect radical change of opinion and adopt positions with which he would never have agreed, whether on national security or on the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a range of abuses on social networks demanding my withdrawal, discontinuing the central policies, saying that I should not be in the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one you've experienced.
In fact, I know I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because comments about me tend to be political.
I am surprised by the professionality and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexual or racist abuses daily, but never flee.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn stated that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and, with each motion "censorship" or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes closer.
In the last two years, I have received many advice that recommended keeping my head down and not making me hear so much and that it would be "good".
But I didn't get involved in politics to do that.
Since 32 years ago I joined the Labour Party as a secondary student, motivated by the neglect of the Government of Thatcher that left my school in total literally in ruin, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them more, whether as a councilman or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my political ideas, nor in the last elections.
It is impossible for someone in Nottingham East to recognize my political positions or areas where he was not in agreement with the current leaders.
The only thing I would say to those who have promoted the movement of Friday is that I do not understand these hopes of wasting time and energy with questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country is headed by a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the voters, whether of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or any political opportunity will prevent me from acting according to what I think is best for all of you.

Air 38 - Melrose 17: an eagle's nest upstairs
Two tests at the end of the game may have decided to a certain extent the final result, but, of course, Ayr deserved the victory in this interesting party of the day of Tennt's Premiership.
They now head the table and are the only invited team of the ten who participate.
In the end, it was the superiority of its defence, as well as its ability to better take advantage of the opportunities, which gave victory to the local team, so that trainer Peter Murchie had all the right to be happy.
"They've tested us in all the parties and followed inquisitions, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, commented: "Ayr deserves recognition, they took better chances than us."
Grant Anderson's test at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, placed the Ayr in front; but a yellow card to the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, loan from the Warriors to the party, enabled Melrose to take advantage of this disadvantage of the opponent and Jason Baggot gained an unconverted test.
Climo extended the advantage of Ayr with a penalty. Before, just in the middle of the time, he marked and turned a solo test, which left the marker in 17-5 to the Ayr in favor of the rest.
However, the Melrose started well the second part and Patrick Anderson's test, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
Then there was a long interruption by a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, to which they had to get out of the camel, and when the game was resumed, the Ayr advanced with a test of Stafford McDowell converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of the Ayr, enabled Melrose to re-use that they had a man with an unconverted tests from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of great pressure.
However, the locals recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Sruan Hutchinson for playing Climo without the balloon, from the penal line, MacPherson did a test when he was on the back of the ball that was advancing.
Climo turned it, just as he had been doing it almost since the party was resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the balloon sent by David Armstrong from a patada and sent Gregor Henry to the bottom to do the fifth test of the locals.
Still Game's protagonist wants to guide his career towards the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, the protagonist of Still Game, seems determined to go through the restoration sector after it turns out that he has been appointed director of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC program, who writes and co-protagonizes with his many-year-old comedy partner, Greg Hemphil.
The second has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to be making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the Director of Agymorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the matter, although a Scottish Sun source pointed out that Kiernan wanted to be involved in the "floating restoration market" of Glasgow.
"The sea belongs to us": a non-literal Bolivia has the hope of the court reopening the path to the Pacific
Marines are watching a general Naval Square in La Paz.
In public buildings there are blue flags on the sea.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases show the theme: "The sea belongs to us by law,
It's a duty to recover it."
Throughout Bolivia, a landless land still remembers the cost lost before Chile in a bloody conflict over the resources that took place in the 19th century, in addition to the wish to sail again by the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the biggest in decades, as Bolivia expects a resolution from the International Court of Justice for one October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and seriousness, and of course she is waiting for the result with a positive vision," commented Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will note the failure of the International Court of Justice in large screens distributed throughout the country, with the hope that the Hague tribunal will declare itself in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent negotiations, Chile has the obligation to negotiate to provide Bolivia with a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the indigenous charismatic president of Bolivia, who delivers a controversial battle for the re-election next year, also has much to say about the resolution of the moon.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did.
The United Nations agency, located in the Netherlands, has no power to assist Chilean territory and has determined that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the resolution of the International Court of Justice reached only six months after the final allegations indicated that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, an expert in international law.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, it may have been infected in the last four years.
"The problem of sea access has been captured by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
In addition, he suggested that moralist rhetoric has threatened any good residual Chilean will.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak for a while, but it will be extremely difficult to keep conversations after this.
The two countries do not exchange ambassadors since 1962.
President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusual.
Monday will be offered to Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility to "end up to 139 years of mutual benefit disputes", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, would use the maritime theme as a political model.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave behind the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can be trusted in the United States.
Ri Yong Ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, says his nation will never be the first to complete nuclear disarmament if it can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday to the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit held in Singapore among rival leaders.
His comments arrive at the time when Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, seems to be about to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear matters that have been paralysed more than three months after this summit with the North Korean leader Kim Jong U.
Ri points out that the continuation of continued sanctions and the United States' opposition to a declaration ending with the Korean War to submit to the north is a "climate".
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration without Pyongyang making any significant disarmament movement before.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to celebrate another summit.
However, there is a generalised speculation about Pyongyang's seriousness of giving up an arsenal that the country is likely to consider as the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang the month that comes to prepare another summit among the mandaters.
Paris fashion files reveal the last line of huge shadows that are about to land in a store street near you
If you want to increase your collection of shadows or completely protect yourself from the sun, don't look for more.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne presented a set of large-scale eccentric shadows for their summer spring collection in 2019 on the passageway, revealing the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible shadows have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have brought their spectacular creations to the passerala.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was a beige shade with a wide range of flowers that involved the heads of the models.
Other large-scale supplements were sandwiches with joyas, a brown shade and even a pine, but they are not designed to keep the hot head.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of masked aliens, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masked colors had cut lips and remembered Hannibal Lecter more than the high costume.
One creation reminded a team of complete, snorkel and gloves included, while another seemed to be a detachable ice-cream.
If you like big-sized fashion, you're lucky.
Style hunters predict that huge shadows could begin to appear on store streets.
The big snakes arrive swimming strong from "La Bomba", with a shoe hat with a width of more than 60 cm used by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The brand of worship after this so-called so-called so-called so-called social networks presented another great creation in the corridor: a beach bag as large as the model in the bathroom that was carrying it.
The dark orange box, decorated with rags and a white leather bag, was the main part of the collection La Riviera de Jacquemus for the spring-war 2019 season in the Paris Fashion Week.
As the famous artist Luke Armitage commented to the FC: "The next summer, I hope to see huge shadows and beach bags in the commercial streets. Since the designer has had a great impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-scale supplements."
John Edward: Linguistic competencies are essential for citizens of the world
The independent educational centres of Scotland have an academic excellence trajectory that has continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary results in the individual and collective successes collected in the areas of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges (SCIS, by their signals in English), are trying to provide the best level of service to students and progenitors.
Independent colleges aim to prepare their students to continue their higher education studies, for the career they choose and for the place they serve as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted study plan, it is noted that modern languages remain a popular and desirable assignment in the centres.
As Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language that he understands, the message comes to his head.
If you speak it in your tongue, it comes to your heart."
This is a powerful reminder that, if relations are to be established and to generate confidence with people from other countries, it cannot depend solely on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year's examinations, we can note that languages are at the highest of the classification tables, being the higher approval rates in the independent colleges.
In total, 68% of students studying foreign languages received the highest score A.
The data collected from 74 centres that are part of the SCIS showed that 72% of students obtained an A in mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also obtained an A.
This shows that the independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages by considering them a fundamental competence that both children and young people will need in the future without any doubt.
Currently, languages are considered to be at the same level as CTIM allocations (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the study plans of independent colleges and everywhere.
A 2014 survey by the Commission on Employment and Skills of the United Kingdom revealed that 17% of the reasons given to entrepreneurs about the difficulties encountered at work were due to the lack of linguistic skills.
Therefore, linguistic competences are increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
The potential labour opportunities that require languages are increasing, so these competencies are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the race that someone has chosen, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last for all life.
The fact that you can communicate directly with persons from foreign countries will allow that person to automatically advance to competition.
According to a survey by YouGov among more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% did not speak any foreign language enough to keep a conversation. It was also established that the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, the 15%, was French.
For this reason, investing in language learning is now important for today's children.
If you know several languages, especially those of the developing economies, children will be equipped to have better opportunities to find a quality job.
In Scotland, each college will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach the most important languages for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in independent colleges you can always choose between several languages learned by staff specialized in this regard.
The independent educational centres in Scotland devote all their efforts to provide a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever their future.
At these times, it is inevitable that, in a global business environment, languages remain vital for the country's future, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "competences for international communication".
Independent colleges will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You need to do it.
John Edward is head of the Independent Colleges Council
LeBron starts with the Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The hope of the fans waiting to see LeBron James in his first party with Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, has announced that James will play the opening part of the premier that will be held on Sunday against the denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is still up to determine how many minutes it will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Lakers' reporter Mike Trudell published in a tweet that it was likely that James would play for a few minutes.
After a training session at the beginning of this week, James was asked by his plans for the pre-term program of six Lakers.
"In this stage of my career I don't need premature parties to prepare me," he said.
Time of the storm in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign missions this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of the five planned Tromps for the next week, including stops at locations with sidewalks, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a vote of confirmation of his candidate to cover the vacancy of the Supreme Court pending, Trump intends to receive support for the next half-period elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when the votes are deposited in November.
What time is Trump's myth in West Virginia this night, and how can you see online?
The Tromp mit in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see it online via a direct retransmission on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump commented on the comments of this week of the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who had been detained because of allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct and had been waiting for an early vote to confirm the Senate during, for a week, while the FBI investigated them.
However, the main objective of this series of missiles is to help the Republicans who are facing the November elections to take the lead.
Thus, President Trump's campaign noted that the next five members of the next week were "enhancing volunteers and supporters while the Republicans tried to protect and expand the majority of those who remained in the Senate and in the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so crucial for its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as possible while we enter the campaign," said Reuters a transporter from Trump who did not want to give his name.
Programmed at the Wesbanco Arena Stadium of Wheeling this night's myth could attract sympathy from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as coverage in Pittsburgh's media", as West Virginia Metro News reported.
The Saturday will be the second time in one month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which it won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate to the West Virginia Senate, who is staying behind in the investigation.
"For Morrisey it is not a good sign that the president has to come to give him an excuse in the investigations," commented Simon Haeder, politician of West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows that it dares to fight to keep the hope alive for the individual parties on Sunday.
After three individual sessions, it may be that Saturday morning's holidays are what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating push pendulum is a fully invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, even more in competitions like these.
So where would they say the impulse is now?
"They took us six points of advantage and now they take us four, so I guess that can be considered a little push," Jordan Spieth commented at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has a advantage: four points ahead with twelve more in the game.
As Spieth points out, the United States feels that they have something of wind in favor and reasons to be excited, among other reasons by the couple formed by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and got three points of four each.
Spieth has been a relative of tea to green and preach with the example.
The guitar calls of celebration rose from volume to volume as their round progressed, introducing a vital poutt to empathize the fourth party when he and Thomas were two down behind two floors.
The poem that the party gave them in the 15th was received with a similar cry from those who transmit the idea that the U.S. team has not yet been out.
"What needs to be done to double the effort and concentrate on the party," Spieth commented.
That's what these players have done.
18-year-olds to leave her alone.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the incredible story of Ryder Cup.
The strange and lovely pair of Europe wears four and nothing can hurt them.
"Molywood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey on the afternoon, but also avoided the bogies on the morning, on the Friday morning and on the last nine Fridays on the morning.
This race and the way it flows its energy with the public bulletarian makes it clear that these are the players who have to win Sunday, and that there will not be other popular players such as Fleetwood and Molinari to celebrate a possible European victory when the sun sets in Le Golf National.
preferable, both at the same time in different ages.
Still, it is premature to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson broke up with Sergio García, the hero of four tomorrow's balls, after forming a partner with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the nine first leaves buried the Spanish and Swedish in a cave that they could not get out.
But on Sunday there will be no kind of help to get out of the caves.
Furballs and fursoms are fascinating to see them close because interaction between couples, advice given and those not given, and the way in which a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a great advantage over the last day, but this forum session has also shown that the U.S. team dares to fight, something that some, especially the Americans, have doubted.
Europe is moving forward for the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe begins with a good advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup, after completing the coaches and coaches with a score of 10-6 on the United States.
The motivated two-way compositions by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the content with two victories over a Tiger Woods that was seen in powders, moving forward four points in the classification of Le Golf National.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to preserve the trophie that I lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that made many mistakes during the morning's exercises, which ended 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the forums, winning two parties, but it was not able to cut distances.
U.S. Jim Furyk needs to get eight points from the 12 individual parties on Sunday to preserve the trophie.
Fleetwood is the first new European to win four consecutive points. In addition, he and Molinari, who received the "Mollywood" support after a seven-week sedentary end, are the second pair to win four points in their first four parties in the history of Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed on the Fourballs, his great union served to defeat a disanominated Woods and the new U.S. Bryson Decahmbeau for a round 5-4.
Woods, who had not gone too far on the two parties on the Sabbath, had occasional moments of brightness, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 parties of furballs and fursoms, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who was resting for the fourballs in the morning, returned to be Henrik Stenson's partner in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and number three of the worlds, respectively, with a 2-1 result.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in the southeastern of Paris, Europe did not have all of it.
The winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as a reference to the United States, getting two points on Saturday.
They won a stunning victory 2-1 before Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the suburbs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4-3 in the suburbs after losing the two initial houses.
In the history of Ryder Cup, a team recovers from a difference of four points in individual parties only happened on two occasions, although Furyk, as the owner of the trophy, only needs an empathy to preserve it.
Although it has been the best seconds for two days, it seems that carrying out a counterattack on Sunday is beyond its possibilities.
North Korea says "there is no possibility" that they will be fired first unilaterally if they have no confidence
On Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions had deepened its confidence in the United States and that there was no possibility that his country would abandon nuclear weapons unilaterally under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho stated before the annual General Assembly of the international body that North Korea had adopted " important measures of good will" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, disarming facilities for nuclear tests and committed to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we received no similar response from the United States," he said.
"If we do not trust the United States, we cannot trust our national security, and under these circumstances there is no possibility that we will be first unilaterally disarmed."
Although Ri repeated the known complaints of North Korea by the resistance of Washington to a "phase" denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it gives gradual steps, its declaration is important, since it refused without further unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump after the first summit between an active US president and a Norwegian leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim committed to working for the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" and Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up his nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States has insisted on denuclearization first and has increased the pressure by means of sanctions in order to achieve its objective in a coherent manner, even putting objections to a declaration of end- war," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a camera of people who don't know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our distrust."
Ri did not mention any of the plans of a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced to the U.S. leader at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings held between Kim and Moon Jae, leader of South Korea in the last five months, and added: "If South Korea had been the party to denuclearization instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been in a similar stagnation."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year's speech, when he told the General Assembly of the United Nations that it was impossible to direct North Korea's missions to the U.S. soil after the "bad president" Trump, on a suicide mission, was called Kim "cohete man".
This year in the United Nations, Trump, that last year threatened to "destroy" North Korea, commended Kim for her courage in the move towards disarmament, but said that it was still much to do and that it was necessary to continue to apply sanctions until North Korea was denuclearized.
Wednesday, Trump said there was no time set for this: "We can be two years, three years or five months, no matter."
China and Russia insist that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: "The imposition of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue with energy and without failure until final denuclearization is realized and fully verified."
The Security Council has consistently imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut funding for the ballistic and nuclear missile programmes in Pyongyang.
Pompeo spoke with Ri outside the General Assembly of the United Nations and later commented that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not well.
He was from Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but, a few hours later, North Korea complained that his "needs were the ones of a mafia".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed itself to disarming a missile location and a nuclear complex if the United States applied the "relevant measures".
He said Kim had informed him that the "relevant measures" he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to relax enough
Thanks to a new course that takes place this year at Harvard University, all university students spend more time in an attempt to fight the growing machinist culture of studying all night drinking caffeine.
One teacher found that students at the number one university in the world often have no idea about the basic care of the same person.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist in Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, it is believed that the first of his class was in the United States.
Its motivation to launch the course arose after giving a talk on how the deprivation of sleep affects learning.
"At the end of the course, a girl approached and asked me why she had just heard about this in her last year.
He said that no one had ever talked to him about the importance of dream, which surprised me," he commented to The Telegraph.
The course, first learned this year, explains to students the basic concepts of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance, in addition to improving general wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, noted that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students only sleep during the week.
The duration course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, cortinas, sports shoes and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on sports performance and the importance of establishing a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart failure, embolism, depression and cancer.
Then, an icon of the camps with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know that students' behaviour will not change immediately.
However, we believe that they have the right to know, just as everyone has the right to know the effects on tobacco health," added Professor Czeisler.
He stated that the culture of pride for "to spend the night on the street" still exists and added that modern technology and the pressure on which students were subjected meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping in enough time and a good quality sleep should be "the secret weapon" of students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid weight gain, as sleep deprivation makes the brain generates a sense of hunger, so they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiaian who studied chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year in Harvard.
He pointed out that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to extend it all over the campus.
It is hoped that the next step will be to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler's recommendation is that students consider setting up an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and that they are aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emits the screens of electrical devices and LEDs, which can change the circular rhythms, so they would end up having problems to stay asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's gol Tumba to Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another post-home depression episode when Dolly Menga's attack destroyed Steven Gerarrd's disintegrated team at a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
Ibrox's men wanted to win their first victory out of the house from the triumph of 4-1 February in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerard for the second time in 18 parties as a coach, leaving his team at eight points of the Hearts, deposed leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga's attack occurred six minutes before the medium-time and the little inspired alignment of the Rangers was not at all.
Now, the Rangers are down to the sixth position, Livingston goes up to the third, behind the Hibernian by the difference of waves.
The Rangers may have had more problems, as the Calum Spence online judge had to receive medical assistance for a wound in his head after, of course, someone had to launch an object from the visiting fund.
Gerard changed to eight of the holders who won the party against the Ayr, entering the semifinals of the Scotia League Cup.
For his part, Holt took out the 11 players from Livingston who started a point to Hearts last week and would have been happy to see how his organization's tenth team made the opponents all the time.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston took better advantage of the balloon when he had it.
They should have marked the two minutes from the beginning, when Menga took a walk in space for Scott Pittman who passed between the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the medium camper sent him out.
Keaghan Jacobs made a deep lack of Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only send her out for the long pole.
The Rangers recovered control, but there seemed to be more hopes than conviction about their game in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt that he had been sentenced in 15 minutes at the party, when he and Steven Lawless were shocked, but Archbishop Steven Thomson had heard loud applause from the Colombian petition.
The Rangers had two shots at the port in the first half, but the old porter of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, just saw himself in trouble to fight with Lassana Coulibaly's head and the boring launch of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the goal marked at 34 minutes by Livingston was against all prognostics, no one can deny that it was worth the effort.
Again, the Rangers were unable to face a deep ball of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher hit the balloon for Scott Robinson, who kept calm and went through Menga to mark the gol.
In the rest, Gerard replaced Coulibaly by Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact, since the flightr passed it to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly went out of his line to block it.
Even so, Livingston continued to take visitors exactly to the kind of game he likes, with Lithgow and Halkett spending a long time after each other.
The Holts could have gained more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor remained firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow finished a haircut that didn't come in.
The replacement of the Rangers, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty to the end of the party after a meeting with Jacobs, but again, Thomson looked at the other side.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Count
And now, a page from the "Sunday Morning" section: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and CONTANDO... was born in Germany the physical future of Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that culminated in the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Count Geiger, who has since become a pillar of science, has also become a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Campaigns of Coronado", with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the apparently incompatible papers of vacuum scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
You can hear the effect of the waves emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals."
Evans, "It's like a radio!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, when he was about 63 years old.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" evil cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" evil cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells to a patient and alter them in the laboratory.
So they can see a common protein to many cancers and rejuvenate them.
A vaccine test is producing promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize the evil cells, saw as her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells to a patient and alter them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein to many cancers called HER2 and then rejuvenate the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotions the growth of different types of cancer", such as mother, ovary, lung, or colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and "instructing them" to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West sailed in a Diary in favor of Trump with a MAGA gor after its appearance in SNL.
It didn't work out well.
Kanye West was abused in the Saturday Night Live study after an erroneous act in which he commended U.S. president Donald Trump, and said he would be presented to the elections in 2020.
After the third night's song, called Ghost Town, during which he used the gold with the message Make America Great Again, he began to deport the Democrats and reiterate his support to Trump.
"Many times I talk to someone white and ask me how I can like Trump if he's racist.
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have gone from the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the program with Matt Damon's sketch, in which Hollywood star was exaggerating from Brett Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate's Judicial Committee regarding allegations of sexual aggression by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it has not been retransmitted, comic Chris Rock has raised the recording of the West bunk on social networks.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to redefine West with the publication.
In addition, West said to the public that it had been bad between vessels to carry that hill.
"They set me up.
They told me not to go out with the top.
They set me up!
And then they tell me I'm asleep," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see what I am?" and added that "Now put your hat on a superman, because that meant that no one could tell you what I had to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try with love."
His comments were received by the public on at least two occasions and SNL members seemed to be embarrassed, according to Variety. One person said to the magazine: "The study was completely silent".
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose novelty, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West interfered with many when he went out the stage to sing I Love it dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who killed: "To one of the most powerful spirits: GREENS FOR RESISTENCE TO THE MUCHEDUMBRE".
Karen Hunter, a representative of an interview programme, said that West was just "to be himself and that is absolutely wonderful".
"But I do not decide to award to someone (by understanding his music or his dress, or by supporting his art) who I think he's wearing and spreading a dangerous ideology for my community.
He's free.
We too," he added.
Before the program, the rapist announced on Twitter that his name had changed, saying that he was now "the person previously known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, following Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg has also been called Snoop Lion, without forgetting the missing legend of music, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist previously known as Prince.
attempted murder by torture in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was shot at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to the Police.
It is expected that the accused will be compared to Monday in the first instance of Belfast.
Taxation will review the duties.
Kit Harington, Tronos game star, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Nieve in the violent series of medieval fantasy of the HBO, Tronos game.
The actor, aged 31, has attacked the stereotype of male hero, saying that these papers on screen were often transmitted to young boys who had to be hard to be respected.
In an interview given to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that he believes that "something has gone wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his partner in Tronos Game, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that it seems "very important" to him to address this issue.
"I personally feel very important at this moment, Where have we been wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems they now face?"
Kit believes that television can be part of the responsibility for increasing toxic masculinity due to its male personalities.
And he continued: "What is innate, and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, that makes young people feel that they have to be this concrete form of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time. How do we change it?
'Cause it's clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not take part in any pre-game or school of Tronos when the series ends next summer, saying he is "hard of battle camps and horses".
Since November, Kit will protagonize True West, Sam Shepard's theatre work that tells the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Shortly ago, the actor revealed that he believes that knowing his wife Rose is the best thing he's ever got out of Tronos' game.
"I knew my wife in the series, so, in that sense, she has given me my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose represented Ygritte, the loving interest of Kit's character, Jon Nieve, in the fantastic series with Emmy prizes.
The couple agreed to marry in June 2018 at a branch of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% more of new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to the health authorities.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of these were sexually infected, making a difference with regard to the past.
Traditionally, HIV was spread rapidly by some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced in practice, the health authorities of China declared at a convention in Yunnan province.
Each year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by some 100,000 people.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem in China's LGTB community.
Homosexuality was abolished in China in 1997, but the LGTB collective suffered much discrimination.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70 per cent and 90 per cent of men who have sexual relations with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are because they do not use adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised universal access to drugs against HIV as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denied that a member of her staff would filter data from senators of the Republican Party and warned that it was "hazardous lies" and "conspiration theories"
The representative of Maxine Waters criticized Saturday the allegations that a member of his staff had published the personal data of three U.S. senators of the Republican Party on Wikipedia pages on legislators.
The democracy of Los Angeles stated that these accusations were inspired by commentators and websites of "extreme right".
"Ministers, lies and most lying cities," Waters commented in a post on Twitter.
Accordingly, the information published included the addresses and telephone numbers of United States senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person from the Chapter published information on the Internet during a session of the Senate panel on inappropriate sexual conduct charges against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The filtration was carried out sometime after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of publications was associated with the Waters Office and made the data available to public by a member of Waters staff, according to the Chapter.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, was not responsible for the filtering of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
The Waters statement raised immediate criticisms on the Internet, including those of the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleescher.
"Rejecting this information with emphasis," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that it does not take the time to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something that he has not done, he should not get angry.
You don't have to rebel.
The reasons of the accused must not be questioned.
It must remain calm and serenity."
It seems that Fleischer wanted to compare the reaction of Waters with the criticisms of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, to whom the tractors accused of being too hot during the juvey's appearance.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who plans to disband Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's very serious," he said.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had warned "the relevant authorities and entities responsible for the enforcement of these fraudulent charges".
"We will ensure that the authors are discovered," he continued, "and that they are legally considered responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions for all members of my staff."
Critic of Johnny English: Again in action. The parody of Rowan Atkinson's Spice is short
Now it has become a tradition to look for clues to Brexit in any new film with a British approach. This seems to be what it is appropriate to do with this new release of the traditional franchise of action and comedy Johnny English, who started with Johnny English in 2003 and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will this self-sacrifice ironic about the obvious surprise that we are the new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his inexpressive eyes and face, has renewed his license to put the boat a second time. Only his name already gives clues that, more than anything, is a comical creation designed for non-English language cinematographic territories.
Of course, it is the secret agent who, despite his strange claims to defeat glamur, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a piece of that kind that touched a single note on the theme of the Fire Cars that was played at the 2012 opening ceremony of the London Olympics.
In addition, it was based on the mysterious traveling and international man represented years ago by Atkinson in the already forgotten news ads of Barclaycard, sowing the fall behind him.
In this last delivery, there's one or two good moments.
I liked to see Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor while the helicopters were shooting at the helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps to the view, but humor is very short and is extremely superfluous, especially now that film franchises "serious" like 007 and Mission can't add chemical ingredients without problems.
Humor seems more directed to children than adults and, to me, the absurd deviations of Johnny English are not as clever and as honest as the silent kisses of Atkinson in Mr. Bean's role.
Now, the repeated current argument is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer pirate has been infiltrated into the supersecret network of British spies, revealing the identity of all his agents active in front of the arrest of the service agent, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the goth that hits the van for the first minister, a pompus and acorralized character that is seeing how his political popularity collapses: Emma Thompson gives the best of himself in this character that is almost like Theresa May, but the guison doesn't leave much margin to work.
Your intelligence consultants inform you that, as all the spies are at risk, you will have to resort to someone who is being withdrawn.
It has to be Johnny English torpe, who now teaches in a play college, although it gives extra-official classes about how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as it is about a rock school-like spying academy.
English is transferred to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets with his former partner Bugh, again represented by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a married man with a submarine captain, a nice role for which Vicki Pepperdine doesn't use enough.
Thus, Batman and Robin who do things terriblely wrong in His Majesty's Secret Service return to action, with the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the first minister is falling into the dangerous traps of a multimillionaire charismatic world of technology that says he can solve the computer problems of Great Britain: Sister Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bugh begin their fantasy of absurd situations: they break out of the bedrooms, fire a French elegant restaurant, throw the fall hidden in the luxurious Yate of Volta; and, in addition, English becomes anarchy by attempting to use a virtual reality box to familiarize themselves with the inside of the Volta house.
Finally, they were employed in the last sequence, but, thanks to great grace and strictity, the whole continues to convey a sense of childishness.
A pretty regular product.
Like Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help wondering if the British cinema industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that makes true justice to his talent.
The Labour Party refuses to draw up a plan for British workers to work four days a week, but they cover five
Jeremy Corbyn's Laborist Party is going to think of a radical plan with which British workers would work four days a week, but they would cover five.
Accordingly, the party wants the owners of companies to appoint the savings obtained through the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) to the workers, giving them an additional day free.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend of the same salary.
According to sources, the idea of "incarceration" in the plans and economic agenda of the party to move the country to the benefit of workers.
This change to a four-day week has been supported by the Trade Union Congress, as it is a way for workers to get a share of the changing economy.
As a high position of the Labour Party commented to The Sunday Times: An announcement of a revision of the directive is expected before the end of the year.
"It will not be achieved from one day to another, but the working week of four days is definitely a matter which the party expects to incorporate in order to rebalance the economy in favour of the worker, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this type of idea, as the Green Party has already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the general elections in 2017.
At the moment, however, not all the Labour Party supports this decision.
One employer said: "The four-day working week is not part of the party's policy and is not going to be discussed right now."
Hacienda's minister in the shadow, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference that was held last week to expose his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to recover powers from "anonymous directors" and "used" for public services companies.
The Minister's plans include the idea that the current shareholders of water companies will not recover their full participation, as a labourer government could apply deductions corresponding to the irregularities identified.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers in corporate management councils and to create inclusive ownership funds in which 10 per cent of the private-sector business shares should be allocated to employees, which would provide them with annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking at "60 Minutes" about FBI research around Kavanaugh and if you could make them change their mind
The FBI's investigation of allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has taken at least one week's final vote for its confirmation as a Supreme Court judge and also raises the question of whether the findings that have been concluded could affect a Republican senator who decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview on Sunday, the journalist "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley, asked Republican senators. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham are talking about whether the FBI could get the information that would change their opinion.
Kennedy showed himself more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course, of course," said Kennedy.
"I was pleased to proceed with the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, that he would come out and ask him, 'Did you do it?'
It's a company show, resolution, silence."
Graham's vote, however, seems immeasurable.
"I already have a decision to make around Brett Kavanaugh and I would raise the charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett did it secretly," said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she named have been able to confirm.
36 years ago.
It is always the same, I see nothing new in this case."
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Has it been able to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, where an impressive starboard is gathered for a equally impressive mission: ending with poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see how tens of thousands of people will move to the Great Law of Central Park to enjoy events such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to realize the real goal of the event: ending with extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
If you want to receive a free entry for the event (unless a VIP entry can be paid), concert participants have had to complete a number of tasks or "actions", as volunteers, send e-mail to a world leader, make a phone call or anything else that is needed to realize their goal of ending poverty.
However, what has the Global Citizen achieved for 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade people to take action or not more than a form of what is called "clictivism", which is called the posture we take when we think we're really doing something useful by signing an online request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million "actions" of its partners in favour of a large number of different objectives.
As a result of these actions, they claim that world leaders have been able to announce commitments and policies at a value of more than $37,000 million, which will affect the lives of more than 2250 million people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10,000 has already been disbursed or reimbursed.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments are "The Power of Nutrition", an association of investors and executives with headquarters in the United Kingdom combined with the common commitment to "help children grow and develop with all their potential". To this end, it has been proposed to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end the country's malnutrition after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens' colleagues.
"Thanks to the support of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and global citizens as you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of social injustice of malnutrition," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of "The Power of Nutrition", to the crowd during a concert in April 2018 in London.
The Group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions had been taken to improve nutrition in the United Kingdom for mothers and children, the Government announced the financing of a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children would benefit from nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequent questions raised on your website about what we believe can be done to address extreme poverty,
a Global Citizen collaborator replied: "It will be a long and hard road and, on many occasions, we will stumble and fall.
But, as the human rights movements have already achieved before, and against apartheid, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monée are some of the events we will count on in the New York event this year, which will be presented by Debora-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Armada to block energy exports from Russia - Interior Secretariat
"If necessary", Washington could resort to its Army to prevent Russian energy from distorting markets, including the Middle East, revealed by the Secretary of the United States of America, Ryan Zinke, as published in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's alliance with Syria, in particular where it operates within the legitimate government, is no more than a prerequisite for expansion in new markets.
"I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, just as they do with Eastern Europe, becoming the supplier most south of Europe," he said.
Furthermore, according to official information, there are ways and means to address this issue.
"The United States, with its Armada, has the ability to ensure that maritime roads remain open and, when the case has come, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end in the market," he said.
Zinke addressed those who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is defined as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches that Washington maintains in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
"The economic alternative in Iran and Russia consists mainly of using and replacing fuels," he warned, pointing out that Russia only knows to do one thing, which is based on its economy on fossil fuels.
These statements are made when the Trump administration has been trying to encourage the export of its natural gas to Europe and to recognize its role in Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that end, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "inappropriate" project of the Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump, will turn Berlin into Moscow's mine.
Moscow has insisted at all times that the North Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which achieves a value of $11,000 million and is expected to double the current gas pipeline capacity of 110 million cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project only responds to economic reasons and is a more independent example of competition.
"I believe that we all share the idea that energy cannot be converted into a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, following a meeting with Rick Perry, the Secretary of Energy of the United States, last September in Moscow.
The US position has, however, been found with Germany's refusal, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The organization leading the industry in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policy or in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"There is a big problem when a third state intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempp, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully analyze the possibility of presenting himself as a candidate to the presidency in 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
The Senator by Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would study the possibility of joining the presidential career after the election in mid-mission.
During a comparison in the Holyoke Assembly, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being raised.
"It is time for women to reach Washington to change our fragrant government and, finally, there are women among the leaders," he said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously take the opportunity to present myself as a candidate to the presidency."
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a meeting and stated that "he was taking the country for the wrong path".
"I really care about the damage Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren spoke without prejudice to Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet last Friday, Warren stated that "it is absolutely necessary that the FBI investigate what happened before the vote".
The Thursday was published in which, however, a majority of Warren's own voters do not believe that they should be presented for the 2020 elections.
58% of Massachusetts's "possible" voters said that the senator should not be present, according to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
A 32% of respondents, however, supported their application.
The investigation showed greater support for the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38% support for a possible candidate and 48% against.
Other recognized members of the Democratic Party discussed the possible candidate for 2020 by former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, according to the Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin speaks of track Palin's post-uramatic stress disorder in a myth of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after graduating in September.
Last Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"The situation that is going through my son, for all that has happened since his return, is well known to other families who suffer the effects of TEPT and other injuries with which our soldiers return," Donald Trump said to the public that he gathered in a myth in favour of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo of whom no one wants to talk, and commented on his son and other war veterans who "come back with a different attitude, frustrated, wondering if there really is such respect for what his fellow soldiers and aircraft, as well as all the other members of the army, have given to his country."
The Monday was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, accused of an episode of domestic violence towards a woman, who interfered with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the effects of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman from the police department of Wasilla.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to achieve a new asylum policy
18 states and the Columbia District support a judicial remedy to the new United States policy that rejects asylum for victims fleeing from domestic violence or from pandemics.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district presented a "friendly" letter on Friday in Washington to show their support for an asylum applicant facing the current directive, reported NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the case "Grace v. Sessions" that the EU Civil Liberties Union (ACLU, American Civil Liberties Union) presented in August was not revealed against federal policy.
She said her partner "and her children, who are members of a violent gang," abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers representing these states that depend on Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications in the United States, as nations facing generalized problems related to domestic violence and pandemics.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Migration Appeals Board (IAA, for its signals in English) by which undocumented immigrants who fled from domestic violence could apply for asylum in this country.
The Attorney-General of the Columbia District, Karl Racine, made a statement on Friday in which he stated that the new policy "includes decades of international, federal and state law".
"In accordance with federal law, all asylum applications must fail because of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim and, instead, this exception violates that principle," says the friend curiae.
Lawyers also pointed out in the letter that the policy denying entry to immigrants damages the U.S. economy by claiming that they often become more frequent entrepreneurs and "suppose a necessary job".
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing from domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"People who leave their countries of origin for persecution or threats of race, religion, nationality or belong to a particular social group or political opinion may apply for asylum," said Sessions when this Directive was announced on 11 June.
The asylum has never been created as a measure to solve all the problems, not even all the serious problems facing people around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while increasing the number of deaths in a race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was increasingly difficult.
"The situation is very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while trying to console her baby with fever in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute they get ambulances with more bodies.
And the clean water is gone."
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to re-equipped among the few unsubstantiated properties that they are in an effort to recover as much as they can.
There are hundreds of injured persons and hospitals, also affected by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, who are displaced.
Some of the wounded; among them, Dwi Haris, who has the support and a broken home, rested on the outside of the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the building due to continued repetitions, too strong.
I couldn't avoid crying when he told us about the violent earthquake he lived while he was on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was caught in the remains of the ruined wall, I think," said Haras to Associated Press. He and his family were in the city to celebrate a wedding.
"I listened to my wife asking for help and then a tremendous silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
US ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propagandistic ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page announcement in a U.S. newspaper that promoted the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread its propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the additional payment of China Daily in the Ten Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after he accused China of wanting to join in the elections at the United States Congress on 6 November, something that China has repeatedly rejected.
The accusations that Trump launched on Beijing's attempt to influence US elections marked what U.S. officials indicated Reuters as a new phase in a growing campaign initiated by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign Governments to publish ads to promote their trade activities, Beijing and Washington are currently blocked in a growing trade war that has led them to increase tariff levels in both parties' imports.
China's countervailing tariffs applied at the beginning of the trade war were thought to relocate to the exporters of states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, according to Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, who is one of China's major exporters of agricultural products, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
According to Branstad, in an article of opinion in the Des Moines Register of Sunday, China "is still intensifying that pressure with advertising publications in our free press".
"To try to spread its propaganda, the government of China is in favour of the precious North American tradition of freedom of expression and free press when trying to publish a payment notice in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the corner of the street where we are here in Beijing, there are only a few discrepancy voices and no real reflection of the missing opinions that people in China may have about the worrying trajectory that is taking the economy of their country, as the media are controlled by the strong pressure of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most relevant newspapers has made the offer to publish" his article, although he did not specify what journal it was.
Analysts point out that the Republicans are staying away from women before the vote in mid-legislation with the debation of Kavanaugh
As many renouncing Republicans are closing lines in favour of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh against the various allegations of sexual aggression, analysts have warned that a delay, especially by women, may occur in the next voting held in mid-legislation.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been very intense and many Republicans have shown that they want to proceed with the vote.
"In this kind of thing it is impossible to go back," said Grant Reeher, a professor of Political Sciences at the Maxwell School of the University of Siracusa, at The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last attempt to position himself in favour of the FBI's investigation would be sufficient to calm down the disgruntled voters on this issue.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow or November," said the Friday Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman of the progressive movementOn group, according to the Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the delegates gathered at the door of the Senate agreed "November is coming!" (November will come soon!) at the time when the Republicans who controlled the Judicial Committee decided to proceed with the candidate of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, told the Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the democracies comes from all prognostics," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partist political analyst at the news site.
"People say that the impact is already very relevant and, in fact, it is.
But it could be even bigger, especially among women who have little choice in the neighborhoods of young people and voters, between 18 and 29 years of age, who do not often vote even though the president does not like them."
Even before Ford's public testimony in which he had given details of his allegations of sexual abuse against the candidate of the Supreme Court, the analysts indicated that a delay could be made if the Republicans continued with the confirmation.
"This matter has become a major issue for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Committee of the Republican Republic, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is no longer just a matter of the Committee's vote or final vote, nor even of whether they sit in the bathroom in Kavanaugh; it is also the way the Republicans have managed all this and how they have dealt with it," said the press release Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA (a group that helps in the democratic elections).
However, the Americans seem to be divided; they do not know who they should believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's witnesses, although they are a few more who are part of this last.
In a new YouGov survey, it is indicated that 41% of the respondents have definitively or likely to believe in Ford's testimony, while 35% claim to believe in Kavanaugh in a definitive or probable way.
In addition, 38% said he thought that Kavanaugh had lied during his testimony, while 30% said Ford himself.
After Flake's campaign, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's statements, and at least the other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judicial Commission last week and indicated that Kavanaugh was drinking it at the age of 17.
On his behalf, Ramirez claimed that the candidate to the Supreme Court showed him his genitals at a party when he studied in Yale in the '80s.
The World Wide Web inventor is planning to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the last project of the legend of technology. A company based on the open source platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "dominating the world".
"It has to be now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable users to create their own "saving of personal data online" or a POD.
It can contain lists, lists of pending tasks, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser at the same time.
The only thing that is unique in personal data storage is that the user is who decides fully who can access the type of information.
The company calls it "personal training through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the Director-General of the Company, John Bruce, is to incorporate the necessary resources, processes and skills so that Solid can reach the whole world.
At the moment, the company is formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that bought IBM, some of the developers included in the template that were hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, technological developers around the world could create their own decentralised apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce or not a radical change where all their business models are completely modified from one day to another.
"We're not going to ask permission."
In a publication in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that "his mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website created in Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) founded the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Despite being launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next time of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: the clergy who won a victory in World War I
The only clergy of the Church of England who won a Cross Victoria during World War I as a fighter has been honored in its birth city 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann received this condecoration on September 29, 1918 in the Bellenglish and Lehacourt attack.
However, a franchisor killed him four days later, and I never imagined they had given him the greatest British military honor.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren discovered a memorial stone in a file in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "of a special symbolism" that would discover the stone just 100 years after the battle that made him deserve the comfort of his grandmother.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal of Saint-Quentin "through a black and under the intense fire of amplifiers and cannons".
Then he ran up to the fire line and, with the "great bravery", made the line advance before reaching a cannon with one hand and reached three of the highlights.
Colonel Vann killed him on October 4, 1918, just a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions he carried out his grandfather were "so great that I could never reach his age, but they were very exciting."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown of flowers after the file, which included the participation of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a privilege for him to be part of the file" and added that "the value of a genuine hero is patented when it is shown to him so many support."
MMA's followers were awake all night for Bellator 206, but they only saw Peppa Pig
Imagine staying all night awake to see all Bellator 206 so that at last they don't let him see the main event.
San José's cartel had 13 matches, six included in the main card, and in the United Kingdom was to be retransmitted directly by night in Canal 5.
At 6 p.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face them, the United Kingdom televisions became enthusiastic when the program changed Peppa Pig.
To some he did not surprise them after having had to stay awake until the first hour of the morning just to see the fight.
A follow-up on Twitter described the change to animated drawings as "a heavy joke".
"There is a government regulation that regulates the content issued from 6 a.m. and this was inappropriate, so they had to change the programming of children," said Dave Schwartz, senior marketing and communication vice-president of Bellator, when we asked him about the transmission.
"Pappa la verdita," yes.
The president of Bellator, Scott Cooker, said that they would change the program to include British spectators in the next issues.
"When I think about the retransmission option, I think it can work," said Coker.
"But it's at 6:00 a.m. on Sunday, so we can't do it until Sunday at our time, which would already be Mondays for them.
We're seeing how to do it.
I believe that when the programming changed, a large number of messages were received and not all were kind, precisely.
We're trying to fix it, because in principle we think it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was a government problem.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We will reduce it to five battles instead of six, which are the ones we normally have done. We try to offer more than usual so that the fans were happy and we pass on.
It's a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt lower because of his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says that he grew up feeling lower than the rest because of his sexuality, although this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a triunfator.
At the age of 24, he told us that he didn't count until the second came that "they weren't all like me."
In the first program of Desert Island Discs of Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said his intention in discussing gay rights was to transmit "hope" to others.
He also told us to become a father who began to care for the importance of winning in the Olympics.
The usual representative of this mythical program, Kirsty Young, will be absent for a few months by illness.
In Laverne's first program, Daley, which appeared to himself as a marginalized, commented that he felt "lower" to the rest during his childhood, because "it was not socially accepted that you would like children and girls."
He said: "To this day, that feeling of inferiority and differentness has been what has really given me power and strength to triumph."
I wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he did not despair when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals in the Olympics has become a prominent profile of the LGBT movement and his image has been used in the Games of the Commonwealth of this year held in Australia to claim that more countries are violating homosexuality.
He said he told him because he felt lucky to live in freedom, without repressions, and wanted to transmit that "hope" to others.
The three times the world champion said that for him it was also a surprise to fall in love with a man, American cinematographer Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013.
Daley married a 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, although she specified that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you live so young" (when your first Olympic Games were 14 years old and your father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has passed by the same heights and bottoms as you.
The couple had a son in June to whom Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said their "global perspective" had changed.
"If they had asked me last year, all the answers would have turned around 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is, of course, Robbie."
His son is called his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father didn't accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked was whether they had steps for London 2012, because he wanted to be on the first line.
"I couldn't tell him I couldn't be in the first row," she said.
"I had his hand between me when he stopped breathing and wasn't until that exact moment when he stopped breathing and died telling me that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"At that moment I realized that that was what I had dreamed of all my life: competed in the pool before mine in some Olympic Games, there was nothing better," he said.
This fact was also what inspired him at the time of choosing his first song, Proud de Heather Small, who accompanied him in the preparation phase of the Olympic Games. He was still wearing the yellow skin.
Desert Island Discs is released on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in low shape, stayed in the bathroom at Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th part of the Ryder Cup, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to avoid becoming a sad dog.
Mickelson, who was playing at the event every two years to get a record for 12th time, was debanked by Captain Furyk for Forballs and Forsoms on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as has been done for the United States so many times, the five-time champion of major tournaments had to comply with encouraging in a few moments and, in others, trying to improve their game in the field and thus correct what it hurts.
Never the direct driver, not even at the highest point in his career, the 48-year-old player is not in his best shape for the Le Golf National field, where the long race continues to beat with wrong shots.
And if the field is no longer sufficiently discouraging, Mickelson, at the ninth party of the Sunday, faces the brilliant champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has joined the beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win the four parties that have played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points below the start of the 12 individual parties, started in an impressive way, the Mickelson party could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his companion, and I couldn't say much more.
"He fully understood the role I had today, gave me a palm in the back and, round me with his arm, said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's in the Fama Hall and has contributed a lot to these teams before this week.
I probably didn't think of it playing two games.
I thought they'd be more, but that's how he went out and that's how we thought he had to be.
He wants to be there, like the rest."
On Sunday, Mickelson will exceed Nick Faldo's brand of more games played by Ryder Cup.
It could be the last of all a Ryder Cups trajectory that had never been so clearly equal to the levels of its individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 gains, 20 losses and 7 equals, although Furyk said his presence brought many more intangible values to the team.
"It's fun, it's sarcastic, it's intelligent, it's fun to get out of others; it's great to have it on the team," he explained.
"I think younger players have liked to have it as support, too this week; it was fun.
It's a lot more than just a game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that leadership can disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, although with a substantial advantage in the last days of Ryder Cup, it can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
The Danish made his debut at the 1997 party in Valderrama, where a band headed by Seve Ballesteros kept a five-point advantage over the Americans, but finally only they managed to end up with the other pianists on a minimum margin, winning 141⁄2-131/2.
"Don't stop reminding you that we did a great tournament in Valderrama; we also did it in Brooklyn and lost it, we did it in Valderrama and won but very little," said Bjorn, retraced, after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 Friday and lead it with a 10-6 in Le Golf National.
The story will teach me and the whole world that this team is not finished.
You had to give it all morning.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
This doesn't end until the points are in the marker.
We have a goal to achieve, that is to win this trophy, and that's the only thing we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, not even less, than the best players in the world."
proud of what his players have done in a very hard golf field, Bjorn added: "I don't want to slow down.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow is individual actions and this is different.
It's great to share what's going on with a partner when things go well, but when they're alone, you try all your ability as a golfer.
That's the message you have to send to players, get the best out of the same morning.
Now it's about leaving one side to your partner, going and getting the best out of one."
In front of Bjorn, his homologous Jim Furyk will try to make his players do better individually than they did as partners, being the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who made three points of four.
The same Furyk has been in both extremes in the last days of these big tournaments and has become part of the team that won Brooklyn and then lost when Europe carried out the "Migrate of Medinah".
"I remember every word," he told us when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
"We have 12 super important games tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medinah.
When we all move forward in a direction, all the pressure comes in those intermediate games.
We defined our strategy and made them feel that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas is assigned the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the main party, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans on the second half of the list.
"I went with this group of boys in this order because I think they're covering the whole trip," Bjorn said about his individual selections.
The new German warship, put again
The new flagship of the German Navy should have been charged in 2014 to replace the old vessels of the Cold War era, but it will not be done until at least the year due to defective systems and the progressive increase in costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship which is headed by the new Baden-Württemberg class, has now been posted until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship should have joined the Armada in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery had shaken the conclusion of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuertemberg class that requested Marina in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class fractals.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of ancient missiles and antibukes, as well as some invisible technologies, such as radar signals, infrareds and very small acoustics.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed for up to two years from the port of origin.
However, the continued delays have caused the ship's innovations (which were supposed to allow Germany to design its power over further) to be early as they begin to serve, points Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 crashed took possession last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship in operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss facility in Hamburg.
It's been the first time Marina returned a boat to an astler after her delivery.
It was little known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that left the ship practically useless if it was sent to a combat mission.
The software deficits were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuertemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors: half of the staff that had been in the old Bremen class fractures.
It was also found that the ship has excessive overload, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future updates.
It is believed that the 7000-tonnes "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy as other similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price of the whole project, including the training of the crew, has also been a problem.
It is believed that it has reached €3300 million (3600 million), instead of €2200 million initials.
The problems of new obstacles are particularly relevant in the light of recent warnings about the reduction of German shipping power.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, recognized that the Armada is "inspired without ships capable of depleting".
The officer said that the problem was getting worse with time, because old ships were given down, but they did not replace others.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wertemberg class fractures could have joined the Navy.
The National Trust reflects the secret life of the mutants
This new investigation, which has been carried out in a state of the Scottish Highlands, tries to find out how the mutants use the landscape in their search for food.
It is expected that all that has been observed will be shed more light on the behavior of the only flying mammals and will help guide the next conservation activities.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common and supranational mussels, as well as the Daubenton River mussels and long earmarks from the Inverwe gardens in West Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in strategic property locations to track the activities of the mutants during the period.
NHS template and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations with portable detectors.
Experts will analyze the sounds gathered in recordings to discover the frequency of the calls of the killers and what species they do.
A report and a map of the behavior will then be produced to create a detailed picture of the environment and its behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation consultant for NTS, expects the results to reveal which habitat areas are most important for the mutants and how they are used by each species.
This information will determine the benefits of the habitat management work, such as the creation of pests and how forests should be maintained for mutants and other associated species.
The populations of mutants in Scotland and the United Kingdom have been considerably reduced in the last century.
They are under threat of construction and development affecting their nests and loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and electric cable can also pose a risk for them, as well as insecticides and other chemical treatments of construction materials or attacks of domestic cats.
The killers aren't really blind,
but because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes to achieve their goal.
They use a sophisticated eco-calculation technique that locates hormones and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the theme of the very serious massacres.
He has ten trained experts on the subject, who are dedicated to carrying out regular investigations, kidney inspections and, on occasion, rescues.
The organization has even opened up the first and only reserve dedicated to Scotsmen in the state of Threve in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the ten species of Scots.
Property Director David Thompson says it's the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Thrive, we have a fantastic area for mutants," he said.
"We have old buildings, many vet trees and all the proper housing.
However, there are still many unknown things about the mutants, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand better what they need to develop."
It stresses the importance of checking whether there are mutants before carrying out maintenance tasks within the property, as an involuntarily built colony can be destroyed and 400 women and children could be killed, which would cause the whole local population to be neglected.
The mutants are protected and it is illegal to kill them, to intimidate them or destroy them, as well as to destroy their colonies.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer responsible for Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to cooperate.
He said: "We still have much to learn about mutants and many other species that we do not know how their populations evolve."
Ronaldo denies the allegations of rape at the same time as his lawyers pursue the German magazine
Cristian Ronaldo has categorized rape complaints as "fake news", saying that people "want to get to know" at the expense of their name.
Her lawyers have received instructions to denounce the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were published.
In front of Portugal and the Juventus he was accused of rapeing a U.S. woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is accused of paying $375 000 to cover the incident, according to Der Spiegel's report on Friday.
With an Instagram Live video that has already accumulated 142 million followers an hour after the news was published, Ronaldo, 33 years old, took the report as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is false," says the fifth winner of the Gold Balloon watching the camera.
"They only want publicity at my name's expense.
It's the same story forever.
They want to be famous just to mention me, but that's how I can't avoid it.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player, laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a request to Der Spiegel for accusations that appear in what they have called "an unacceptable report of suspects in the area of privacy", reports Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player will try to obtain compensation for "the moral damages due to a number of the severity of the injury, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years".
It appears that the incident took place in June 2009 in a follow-up to the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a night club, Ronaldo and Mayor went to the player's room, and he reportedly violated it once, according to the documents recorded in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga stated that Ronaldo had grown up after the alleged incident and told him that he was in a "99 per cent" a "good boy" and that he had broken that "one per cent" remaining.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was permitted.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that they took photos of the injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed to come to an extrajudicial arrangement because she had "terrorous repressions" and was concerned about "be humiliated in public".
The woman, 34 years old, claims that she is trying to cancel the agreement, since she is still traumatized by the facts.
When the alleged aggression occurred, Ronaldo was about to join the Royal Madrid from Manchester United and this summer has changed to Juve, a large Italian football for a 100 million € contract.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would always regret losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "repent all life" if it lost its position as world leader in the manufacture of cars after Brexit, said the Secretary of Industry, Greg Clark.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK communicated to the BBC that, if Britain had left the EU without an agreement, production would be temporarily stopped in its Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer stated that the impact of delays in customs in the case of a Brexit could cause the loss of work.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures models Auris and Avenis de Toyota, produced about 150 000 cars last year, of which 90 % were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that, if Britain breaks up with the EU at the end of March, there will be production patterns in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director General of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have shown their fears about the EU's exit without an agreement, especially in relation to cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says she will close her Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns addressed by car manufacturers are the problems that could arise in the installation chains in the case of an unaccompanied Brexit.
The Toyota production line is based on the adjusted production mode ("just in time"), where the pieces arrive every 37 minutes from United Kingdom and EU suppliers to manufacture cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement on 29 March, an interruption could occur within the border which, according to the sector, could lead to delays and dissuasiveness.
For Toyota it would be impossible to rent the amount of equivalent materials to more than one day of inventory on its Derbyshire plant, the company said and, in that case, the production would stop.
Mr Clark said that theresa May's Chequers plan, where future relations with the EU are established, is "required precisely to avoid these controls at border crossings".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best deal that not only allows us to get out of the way right now but we have to take advantage of the opportunity," said BBC Radio 4.
"The evidence of Toyota, among many other manufacturers, is that we have to be able to continue with what has so far been a set of very successful supply chains."
Toyota has not been able to say how long production would be stopped, but warned that, in the long term, the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and, ultimately, the costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is responsible for the U.S. union in the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "My experience says that once these jobs are lost, they will never be recovered."
A spokesman from the government said: "We have launched a precise and convincing plan that limits our future relations with the EU."
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be resumed, according to the White House
The high-risk meeting of Donald Trump with general vice-fiscal Rod Rosenstein could "be held next week", as the debate continued on the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating interventions in the Russian elections, links between the assistance of Trump and Russia, and a possible obstacle to justice by the President.
The expectation before Trump decides to send the general vice-fiscal or not and thus compromise Mueller's independence has fed Washington's quotas for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had written the conversations that he had with Trump with a microphone that he himself had to try to contact the president by amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied that it was true.
However, last month he went to the White House, among news that he was about to give up.
A meeting with Trump (at the time in the United Nations in New York) was announced for Thursday.
Trump said that "I wouldn't prefer" to send Rosenstein, but the meeting had to be held to prevent a conflict with the hearing of the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual aggression, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh for a week, although this would delay the vote of the Senate's plenary.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "No date has been defined, it could be this week or another, considering all that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We're going to decide on the move and I'm going to report to the press, like I'm going to do."
Some journalists would reject this statement: Sanders has not carried out any press round in the White House since September 10.
The rapporteur, Chris Wallace, asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said that the lack of print wheels was not due to a warning to TV journalists who act with great skill, although he said, "I will not disagree with the fact that they fanfaron."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press should be increased.
"The President held more meetings of questions and answers than any other President had before him," he said, as he said without proof: "We have opposed those numbers."
Press wheels will continue to be carried out, Sanders said, but "if the press has the option to ask the President of the United States directly, I think it's much better than you do to me.
We've tried to do it many times and you've seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press wheel when you could talk to the president of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when it comes to the White House or when he participates in public meetings or press wheels with the dignitaries who visit him.
Press conferences with him only take place on very rare occasions.
In fact, this week, in New York, the president showed why he was like this, where he made a sudden appearance and, at strange times, before the journalists who were gathered there.
The Secretary of State of Health writes to EU workers of NHS Scotland about their fears in Brexit
The Secretary of State of Health has written to the EU template working at the HHS of Scotland to express the country's gratitude and wish to accompany them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter only six months before the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU.
The Swedish Government has already committed itself to covering the cost of citizenship applications for EU members working in public services that do not depend on central power.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union have followed up on the outcome of the expected decisions this autumn.
However, the Government of the United Kingdom has also intensified preparations around a possible stage in which it had not agreed.
I know all this must be very disagreeable for you.
And it is, therefore, that I would like to reiterate now the value of the contribution of each staff member regardless of their nationality.
Professionals from across the EU and other countries contribute valuable experience and many skills that strengthen and improve the work of health service, benefiting patients and communities to which we serve.
Escocia is, of course, your home and would like us to continue telling you."
Christion Abercrombie is operating urgently after suffering a stroke in her head
Christion Abercrombie, player of Tennessee State Tigers was surgically intervened after a head injury last Saturday, when they lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The trainer of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"I came to the band and dropped out right there," said Reed.
Both trainers and medical personnel administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the band line before placing it on a camel and bringing it to the depth to examine it.
A member of the Tennessee State template told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there was no details about the type of injury yet or the damage caused" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, redshirt sophomore, is playing in its first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tacs on Saturday before leaving the camp, with which he took a total of 18 throughout the season.
Foreigners will be subject to a high-end transmission tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom
Foreigners will be subject to a high-end transmission tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom and the extra money collected by this measure will be used to cover the "without cover" according to the new conservation plans.
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in fines tax will be imposed on those persons who are not paying taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to collect up to £120 million a year for the "no roof"
The additional money collected with the increase in the tax of transmission of fines to foreign buyers of property in the United Kingdom will be allocated to aid to the "no roof", Today Theresa May announced.
The measure is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger voters and to those with higher incomes.
The increase in fines tax will be recorded to individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and that money will be aimed at encouraging government policy to combat the problem of disability in the streets.
The recharge, which is an addition to the current transmission tax, including the increase in levels introduced two years ago on second-hand housing and the "buy-to-let" system, could be up to 3%.
The Treasury expects to collect up to £120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13% of the properties of the new construction in London are purchased by people who do not reside in the United Kingdom, resulting in an increase in prices and difficulty that people who buy for the first time can access affordable housing.
Many of the most advanced areas of the country (in particular, in capital) have become "fathom cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson claims a reduction in transmission tax in order to help young people buy their first home.
He urged the large builders to maintain high prices in the properties when buying land with no intention of using it and urged Mrs. May to remove the quotas applicable to affordable housing to solve the "stupid housing problem" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of very attractive reforms for housing, including rental controls and the end of unreasonably leave.
It also proposes to provide local authorities with the most powerful to build new homes.
Ms. May said: " Last year I said that I would dedicate my first Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the life of each new generation.
And that means solving the housing market, which is so destructive.
Great Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, can buy dwellings with greater ease than the British working class.
The dream of having a house has become something too difficult to reach for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street is still too real."
Jack Ross: My primary goal is to direct Scotland
The Sunderland trainer says his "primorial goal" is to become a trainer in Scotland at some point.
The Scottish, 42 years old, is illustrated by the possibility of revitalising the club in the north-west, which currently occupys the third place in the League One (the third division of links in England), to three points from the first.
He passed the Stadium of Light this summer after taking to St. Mirren again to the Scottish Premier the last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I just got a B gor," Ross told Sportsound in BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up to see Scotland in Hampden with my father when he was a child and it's something he's always done that he wants to come back.
That opportunity will only become reality, however, if I succeed in leading a club."
Among the presidents of Ross as director of the Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former management of the Athletic Alliance said that he felt no fear when he went through so many names set up in such a big club, after rejecting the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At this moment, the success for me is measured according to whether I can return to this club to the Premier League,
because the structure and facilities of this club are undoubtedly the ones of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get it, but I can only think I've achieved my goal here when I can go back to the club where I'm supposed to be."
Ross only spent three years as a trainer, after being a time assistant in Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the Hearts technical body.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the decline to the third division and made St. Mirren turn to be on the edge of the decline to win the champion in the next season.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartplepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably an encrusted authentic," he recalled in reference to when he was charged with the Alloa.
"I always thought the direction was the best I could do, much more than play.
It can sound strange, because it was good, I was able to earn my life very well with it, and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer the stress and pressure of this work; however, I feel good in the direction.
I always wanted to train and now I've been able to do it, is the time of my adult life in which I feel better, no doubt."

According to one survey, the perfect time for a painting is 5.30 a.m. on Saturday evening
The summer heat wave has stimulated the profits in the British pubs who struggle to survive, but focused all the pressure on restaurants chains.
Pubs and bars saw how their sales increased by 2.7% in July, while restaurant profits decreased by 4.8%, according to figures.
Peter Martin, from CGA's consultant, who was responsible for collecting the figures, commented: "The heat of these days and the fact that England continues to be in the world have still made it possible to maintain the pattern of the previous month of June, in which pubs increased a 2.8% profit, although restaurants have fallen even more.
The fall of 1.8% in the commercial activity of restaurants in June was even worse in July.
The pubs and bars serving mainly drinks had their own strength, in front of most restaurants, in which they reduced profits.
Pubs serving mainly food also suffered with heat, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to get out for a drink.
In managed bars and pubs, drinking sales rose to 6.6% during the month, while food decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, of RSM's hostel analysts and eight, said: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Time and the impact of very important social events or sports events remain the most relevant factors in the business market outside home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to fight, although the 4.8% drop in sales compared with last year will result in particularly painful results in continued cost pressures.
The long and warm summer could not have arrived at a worse time for gastronomic operators and the time will say if the most moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide the relief they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new ones that have opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand implants.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the UK restaurants, bars and pubs sector, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined invoice of more than $9,000 million and is the market reference value.
One out of every five children has secret accounts on social networks in support of their parents
One out of every five children (some even 11 years old) has secret accounts on social networks in support of their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
The survey, conducted by 20,000 secondary students, revealed an increase in the false pages of Instagram
News has exposed the fears that sexual content is published
A 20% of students said they had a "primary" account showing their parents
One out of every five children (some even 11 years old) creates social networks that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced in the false accounts of Instagram, a reference site to share photos.
News has exposed the fears that sexual content is published.
A 20 per cent of the students claimed that they had a healthy "primary" account that they showed to their parents, while others were private.
A mother who found herself casually with her 13-year-old daughter's secret site saw how a teenager encouraged others to "violar me".
The research conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmasters" Conference of Independent Colleges (HMC) found that about 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It's alarming that so many teenagers feel tempted to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers can't find them."
Elidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" in Scotland's athletic Federation Directive
Elidh Doyle has been elected to form part of the Scotland athletic Federation Directive as non-executive director at the annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is the most gifted athlete in the course and field of Scotland and its president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who claim that sport benefits from its great international experience in the past decade.
"Eilid is recognized and respected throughout the community of athletics in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the whole world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from counting with it in their directive," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I like to be the spokesman for the athletes, and I hope I can bring things and help develop sports in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta between the four gold he won and is now a regular expert in the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I suffered a cerebral accident.
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time would determine whether I would recover or how much I would do.
It's been boring, but I was able to recover completely, I had to learn again to walk, and I'm currently doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the messages and words of the heart!"
The announcement of sacales where mothers are compared with cows divide the opinion on the Internet
A marketing company has divided the public opinion on the Internet with an ad where it compares to mothers who give birth with cows to whom they order.
To mark the launch of what in theory is the "first silent sacales of the world", the technology company for consumer Elvie published an inspired announcement in a video with an ironic music that shows to mothers who have the freedom that the new milk extractor gives them.
Four real women dance in a garden full of hay in dance mode, along with some cows, with letters like, "Yes, I order myself alone, but I don't have cola" and "Because if you didn't notice, they're not trees, they're my bones."
The heart continues: "Order them, order them, I feed their babies, command them, order them, I command my women."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, has created a great controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say it is possible to focus on the "tortures" of the milk sector.
"A very unhappy decision to place cows to announce this product.
Like us, they must be forced before giving light to produce milk, with the exception that they leave them to their babies days after divorce," wrote a person.
The milk extractor Elvie is clearly adapted to a lactating subjecter (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Trumatic for mother and baby.
But, yes, why not use them to announce a milk extractor for mothers who are staying with their babies?"
Another comment was, "Go to a more relaxed announcement."
Other people, however, defended the announcement, as a woman who admitted that the song was "distinct".
"I think it's a great idea.
If he still says he's a mom, I'm sure he'd have one.
When I used the bomb, I felt totally like a cow.
The ad is a little adjective, but I don't give you any more back to it.
It's a product genius," a woman told us.
Another person commented: "It's a gracious announcement directed to mothers who use a lactating bomb (in cases at work or in public places), which makes them feel like cows.
In the announcement it is neither praised nor judged by the milk sector."
At the end of the video, the group of women showed that they had been dancing with the discrepancies placed within the subject.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who take milk with the bomb say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no cables or tubes, and is tightly attached inside the lactating subject, which enables its users to move, submit to their babies, and even get out the street with the bomb in operation.
Ana Balarin, mother's partner and ECD, tells us: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a humiliating and provocative launch.
In showing parallelism between expressive women and cow milk, what we intended was to draw attention to the use of lactating bombs and their challenges, as we demonstrated in a manner that was interesting and close to the incredible sense of freedom that the new bomb offers.
This is not the first time the Elvie bomb appears in the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children went down the path for designer Martha Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of minor immigrants discreetly moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of juveniles detained has experienced a significant increase, although the monthly flow on the border has practically remained at the usual levels. In part, this is due to the fact that the rhetorical strength and policies introduced by the Administration of Trump are being complicated by the possibility of abducting these children.
Traditionally, most of the parents, who were also undocumented immigrants at their time, feared that the fact of being proposed to accommodate a child at risk was their own stay in the country.
This risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that parental potentials and other adult members of their families should present their fingerprints and that data would be shared with governmental immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking officer from the Immigration and Customs Office, witnessed before the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had asked to be apartrire to unaccompanied children.
The agency confirmed after 70 per cent of the arrests had no criminal precedents.
"About 80% of the sponsors or their families are illegal in the country, and most of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people," Albence said.
In their efforts to process the most demanding minors, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a maximum period of one month from detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to the staff of the reception centres.
Many of them will testify by videoconference, rather than by person, to defend their legal status before a judge for immigration matters.
Those who are not considered fit for the amps will be deported as soon as possible.
According to the staff of the reception centres and the system reports that have emerged over the past few months, the longer they remain under guard, the more likely they are to suffer anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent arrests or attempted suicide.
According to the defenders, these concerns are growing even more in larger facilities, such as the Tornillo, where it is more likely that, due to its size, there will be high rates of abuse in these children.
In addition, the transfer to the camp without having given them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to leave their friends could cause them a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria requests the United States ' occupation forces, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return to their homes, although the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the vice-primary minister, said that foreign forces were illegally found in Syrian territory under the pretext of the fight against terrorism and that the theme "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must be withdrawn immediately and without conditions," the Assembly said.
Moulalem insisted that "war against terrorism has virtually ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight in this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories" both of the terrorist groups and of "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 land soldiers in this country destroyed by the war.
On the refugee issue, Moualem stated that the conditions were given to return and blame "some Western countries" for "screaming irrational fears" that made refugees decide to stay out of the country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicating what should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment area in the last important rebel ship of Idlib has created an opportunity to strengthen political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a large-scale attack by the Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made it clear that the agreement had a "clear time" and expressed the hope that military action would focus on the Yihadists, including the fighters of the Nusra Front (connected to Al-Qaeda), who "will be expelled".
Staffan de Mistura, a special envoy of the United Nations, looks forward to convening the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to drafting a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem established conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee, arguing that the work of the panel should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would win the re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators are sure to expect, a destination or a scandal will end in the early stages of its presidency.
This would be no doubt "The most dramatic end of a presidency ever seen!"
Currently there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the maximum hearing time indicators have doubled to 1.05 million for the CNN and have virtually tripled to 1.6 million for the MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in maximum hearing hours, compared to 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" of MSNBC has exceeded the cable channels with 3.5 million viewers for the main night news programs.
"It's a strange attraction that we still cannot understand," Neal Baer, author-producer of "Designed Survivor", comments an ABC drama series on a secretary of the office who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Chapter.
In Savoell, a veteran comedians writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip he made in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him he'd vote for Trump.
Why? He asked him.
"Because it makes me laugh," was the answer that Savoell received.
The fall is always high in the world of entertainment.
Of course, and unlike anything else on television, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe Case against Wade, the possibility that immigrant families can meet or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only privileged viewers can be allowed.
However, the information goes beyond the limits when you notice that you take six hours to see an expert panel discussing the use of "deep background" sources that Bob Woodward used for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000-year-old leather hunter ("a demeshed pride grab", in The Washington Post) and the implications of the extensive descriptions of Stormy Daniels of Trump's Anatomy.
As far as I'm concerned, I'll never see Super Mario again the same way.
"By offering something new every night, it's partly what makes everything look like a real show," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", when we talk about the alternative distribution of the Trump show and its daily trends (whether entering a fight against NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).

When I was going to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a 27-degree sunny day in the north coast of Kauai, but he was refugee inside the house when he saw MSNBC when he wrote CNN.
I couldn't get rid of the TV, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate's Judicial Commission and with the future of the Supreme Court in custody of a child.
"I remember when in those days we made all these programming holes and people told us that it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss comments.
"I thought it was all a joke, but eventually it turned out they were right."

External money flows in the most adjusted half-mandatory elections of the Chamber of Representatives
It is not surprising that the money flow is reaching the 17th Pennsylvania district, thanks to the restructuring of a Congress district with two candidates seeking reelection for the same stage.
This Pittsburg residential district, whose structure is recently redesigned, has the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his chance in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another candidate for re-election, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the former district 12 of Pennsylvania, a district that is largely isolated with the new 17.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January that the former districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The new 17 race has launched a funding content for the campaigns between the main financial arms of the parties, the National Democratic Campaign Committee (NCDCC) and the National Campaign Committee (NCRC).
The name Lamb became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a special election held in March for the 18th Congress district of Pennsylvania.
This scandal had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
Political experts have given Democrats a light advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support to China, even after exodus behind
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a clear refusal from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners left the management team of the Trump Organization.
The officials of the Department of State decided to return to the heads of the United States diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions to abandon recognition in Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the representative of the department, in a communiqué this month.
But it was decided only to punish El Salvador, which had already received some 140 million US dollars for, among other things, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions to certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to avoid immigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, the senior officials of the administration had made it clear that their intention was to continue the conference, which would end any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is planning to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, if diplomatics, is seen as a sign of the importance of the administration of the meeting.
The three United States envoys returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or punishments on the part of Washington.
A spokesman from the White House of Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to deal with internal deliberations under anonymity.
His explanations were reinforced by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under an anonymous condition.
The History Study
The next step could be the report of Special Advocate Robert Mueller on the possible obstacle to the justice of Trump, of which there is already considerable evidence in the public record.
It is thought that Mueller is also taking this research into the possibility that the Trump campaign was working in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the Congress changes its hands, Trump will see account before that camera, just when it is prepared to be presented again to the voters, and perhaps finally to a jury of his parents.
This is a set of conditions, and I therefore do not suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable, nor is it the equivalent of it in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an impact on the duration of the container.
In 1938, German officials were ready to give a state strike against Hitler. Only the West had to resist and support the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of famine that followed.
The transition from history to these points of influence, and the inexorable course of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now faced with several of these inflation points.
What will we do if Trump sends the Vicefiscal General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has seen it in a good way since this newspaper reported that last year he had suggested writing in secret to the president and had been speculating about his inability to carry out the task.
Rosenstein says the explanation of The Times is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or fair, or if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court in spite of the credible allegations of sexual aggression and disseminating testimony?
In addition to all this, will we vote in the mid-mand elections a Congress that will account for Trump?
If we fail these tests, we will meet with a long winter for democracy.
But thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I don't think we'll fail.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador’s home.
He managed to survive, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later he sent me to set the sails of the Sabbath on the same beautiful table with a swastika.
With that heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, Optimist before the meeting against the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play the Thursday at home against Rapid Vienna, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive campaign in Spain against the Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a strong position to be classified in the G Group of the European Union.
An injury on the wheel prevented mediocamp Graham Dorrans from reaching his first appearance from the season until the impact of 2-2 against the Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a trampoline for larger things.
"We were able to get a good point, because Villarreal is a good team," said 31-year-old player.
"We started the game believing we could get something and we went out with a point.
Maybe we could have won the victory at the end, but in general, the empath was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the rest we went out for all and we were the best team.
This Thursday we will have another big European night.
I hope we can achieve the three points, but it will be a difficult party because they've already achieved a good outcome in the previous game, but with all the public support, I'm sure we can advance and get a positive result.
The last year was definitely hard with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now a general environment is noted that everything will be fine.
The team is well located, the boys are having a lot of fun and we're having a good training.
I hope we can advance, leave behind the past season and succeed."
Fear of retirement savings is causing some women to lose their sleep
Despite the fact that participants in the survey had a clear idea of how to care for them, few people were talking about it with their families.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationalwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children on this subject.
"People want to take care of a family, but they are not taking steps to have this conversation," says Holly Snyder, vice-president of the National Life Insurance Company.
This is the way to start.
Talk to your wife and children: you will not be able to prepare your family for care if you do not express your wishes with sufficient advance.
Work with your consultant and your family to talk about where and how to get attention, as these options can be a determinant factor of the cost.
Include in the conversion to your financial adviser, as it can also help you find a way to pay those costs.
Your long-term care financing options may include a long-term long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with real value to help you cover your expenses or to make sure yourself with your own savings, whenever you have money.
Trade your legal documents: advance to legal battles.
It is a responsibility to obtain medical attention power to designate a trusted person who oversees his medical attention and ensures that professionals comply with their own wishes if they cannot communicate.
He can also prepare a significant power for his finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on his behalf and ensure that his invoices are paid if he is incapacitated.
Do not forget the little details: imagine that your old father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that they are always the point.
"It's not just the finances that are in play: what doctors are going to deal with?" asks Martin.
"What drugs are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
You have to have everything planned."
Several times shoot a man with a carbine in Ilfracombe
They shot a man several times while he was walking home after going out at night.
The victim, a man about 40 years old, was in the area of Oxford Grove de Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdominal and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place about 02:30 (British hour), as a "alternative act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
Its injuries are not fatal and the police have made a call to possible witnesses.
Terremotos and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, the authorities said that the number of deaths is expected to increase.
With the blocked communications, the assistance staff were unable to obtain any information from the Dondrya regime, a region in the north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Dondria, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami took place.
Dondrea is a kingdom that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of litoral in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, which is a somewhat lower administrative region in the province, had a estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Sulawesi Central, particularly in the northern region of Dodrea.
Nikhal mines are also important in the province, but they focus mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dodhria have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesia Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dodrya.
A tsunami also struck the west of Dondrea in 1996, with nine fatal casualties.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Centre, a region of great sysmic activity, and often suffers from earthquakes.
We then sum up some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh of Indonesia, north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and claimed 226,000 lives on the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of the victims occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
There were hundreds of dead victims on the island of Nias, in front of the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most popular island, and caused tsunamis that affected the southern border, with almost 700 fatal casualties.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Isle of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A deep earthquake struck the kingdom of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic by recalling the destruction of the earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but the destruction of buildings caused the death of more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) had a series of large-scale earthquakes that caused the death of more than 500 people, most in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily displaced.
The eldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of Alaska's former governor and candidate to Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault charges.
Palin, 29 years old and a citizen of Wasilla (Alaska), was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to the report published on Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to that police report, when a acquaintance tried to call the police to accuse the alleged crimes, he removed his phone.
Palin has been sentenced to preventive prison in Mat-Su Pretreal Facility and is detained with an unencumbered fine of $500, KTUU reported.
On Saturday before the court, where it was declared "definitely innocent" when its declaration was requested, the chain was informed.
Palin faces three minor offences in Class A, which means he could spend up to a year in prison and get a fine of $250,000.
He has also been accused of a minor crime in Class B, with a penalty of one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of adding his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic aggression, of interfering in the prosecution of a crime of domestic violence and of having a weapon in the state of emergency, in relation to the incident.
His bride had said she had given him a kiss on her face.
Several groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior with the post-uramatic stress disorder resulting from her service in Iraq.
Terremoth and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of fatal casualties
At least 384 people failed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The earthquake of a 7.5 magnitude caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have fallen and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just next to the center of Sulawesi, which is located in the north of Yakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos that surround social networks and show the time of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal taxes except for the death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
New York's federal prosecutors are looking for the capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, reportedly used a home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike on the West Side of the Manhattan Bay, passing through the pedestrians and cyclists he found on his way.
In order to justify a death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intensely" and had "intended" serious physical injuries, in accordance with the warning of the death penalty application in the South New York District.
The two charges bring possible death penalty, according to the legal document.
Several weeks after the attack, a large federal jury presented Saipov with 22 charges that included eight murder charges with the help of organized crime, which often used federal taxes in these cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation", according to the prosecutors, which described the way Saipov carried it out as "atrocity, cruelty and abuse".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucco", is specified in the notice of intentions.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the South District of New York has been processing a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but finally he was sentenced to eternal chain in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a New York federal case was performed in Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This marriage was executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit a spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The two Rosenberg were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, demonstrated his lack of revenge during the days and months following the attack, according to judicial documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that for his attack he was inspired to see ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be put in his hospital room, the police said.
It has been declared innocent of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defence lawyers representing Saipov, said they are "of course disappointed" with the tax decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a declaration of guilt with an eternal chain sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all persons involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously requested the prosecutors who would not ask for the death penalty.
Mr Tory says that NIGEL FARGE should be responsible for Brexit's negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised "movilize the popular army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the UKIP said politicians had to "sit the heat" of the Eurosceptics, while one of the Members of Theresa May suggested that he should be involved in negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham concentration that the United Kingdom "would have gone out" if Farage had been Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Prime Minister May to reconcile its divided ranks has even more when a group of Tories for the sake of sustainability has joined an opposition protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain the commitment plan signed in Chequers in the midst of the attacks of those favouring Brexit, its opponents and the EU.
The allies stressed that they would continue to try to reach agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and would force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and the "caos".
Mr Bone said at the Leave Means Leave concentration in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that a position should have been given to Farage with responsibility in negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would've gone out," he said.
This Member of Parliament by Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
It is good to reject the suggestions that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that we have changed British opinion and we want to stay in the European Union is completely false."
The Tory Pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also in the concentration, where he told the reporters: "I just say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The public in general does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition is not going to vote in favour and is not popular between our party and our activists, who are actually going out the streets and voting first.
Forget about Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added: The first ministers hold their duties when they fulfill their promises."
Farage told the concentrates that they should make the politicians "feel anger" if they see that they are going to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let them out with theirs."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, sit hot.
"We will mobilize the popular army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the supporters of the residence traveled the streets of Birmingham before two hours in the city center.
Some activists went to Tories Against Brexit after the group's presentation this weekend.
Labourer Lord Adonis was exaggerated by the conservatives because of the security problems they had with the party's application during the opening of the conference.
"These are the same people who tell us they can implement computer systems and all technology for Canada Plus, for the harmony border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a total grass.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit," he added.
Warren considers all possibilities to be presented to the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says "will consider all the possibilities for the presidency" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that Massachusetts's democracy spoke about its future during a municipal meeting held on Saturday in the west of Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular criticism of President Donald Trump, will be presented to the re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican State Representative, who was co-chaired by the Tromp Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility that Warren faced Trump in 2020.
The Sunday afternoon event in Holyoke was its thirty-sixth meeting with the electors using the municipal format since Trump took over the job.
An assistant asked him if he had intended to present himself to the presidency.
Warren replied that it was time for "women to go to Washington to arrange our irregular government, and that includes a woman in the highest."
A shot at the murder with a gun from the LSU Sims player
Baton Rouge's police announced this Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for the death of Wade Sims, LSU's ballistic player last Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, at a press conference at 11 o'clock in the morning.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify a man who was seen in the video.
Sims, aged 20, was killed by shots near the campus of the Southern University at the first hour of the Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a shot by shooting at his head that eventually caused his disappearance," said police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, for 247 sport.
Wade was defending a friend and got a Simpson shot.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted that he had been in the scene of the crime, had a gun and had shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was detained at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, an original player of Baton Rouge of 1.98 meters height, played in 32 games the past season, being titled in 10 of them, and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 reboots per game.
Russia's Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the team's orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since the time Valtteri Bottas was classified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was evident that Mercedes's team orders would play an important role in the race.
From the field, Bottas had a good start, and almost stopped Hamilton forgetting to defend his position on the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to get into boxes and let Hamilton run into the team's chair, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes came out with a strong return later and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton stepped forward after an action with nearly stuck wheels that made Ferrari's pilot have to give up the inner gain of risk of resisting after a double move to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 years old that day, began from the last row of the parrilla and was placed in the seventh place at the end of the first round.
He then led a large part of the race while stuck to his neumatics to achieve a quick end and overcome Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth position.
Finally, he entered boxes in turn 44, but could not increase his pace in the remaining eight times when he recovered Raikkonen the fourth position.
It's been a hard day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real horseman when he let me through.
The team has done an extraordinary job to get a perfect couple," Hamilton said.
That's been a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump was excommunicated by Senator Diane Feinstein on a Wednesday night by his insistent that he did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which he accused of sexual assault on Brett Kavanaugh, appointed for the Supreme Court.
Speaking in a myth in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony for Ford to the Trial Committee of the Senate, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that there are people who are "bad, repugnant and false".
"The only thing that could happen and the good thing that's happening these last days in the Senate is when anger is seen, when it's seen people who are bad, rebellious and lying," he said.
"When you read publications and filtrations, and then they say, "But if I didn't.
I didn't."
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember his answer... did you filter the document?--"Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't filter it."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we filter? No, we didn't filter it," he added while imitating the senator.
The letter was sent to Feinstein, in which the charges against Kavanaugh were detailed by Ford in July, and was filtered in early September, but Feinstein refused to have his office's future filtration.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't filter his story," said Feinstein to the committee, as The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep him confidential and therefore I did."
But his negatives didn't seem to sit well with the president, which during the afternoon afternoon night he commented: "I'll tell you one thing: it's been a really bad body language."
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing with its defence to the appointment of the Supreme Court, which has been accused of inappropriate sexual conduct by three women, the President suggested that Democrats were using accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see evil and revenge, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to struggle to gain power and control," said the president as mediaite reported.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer marked two holes for the Giants against the Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired the defeat on Friday at the Elite League in front of the Belfast Giants by winning the party back on Saturday for 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants won an initial two-dollar victory thanks to the attacks of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie got the local empath before Dwyer restores the leadership of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard joined the Dundee before the two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen will ensure their victory.
This has been the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who came to win Dundee for 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won the previous three parties.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to Kendall McFaull's assistance, while David Rutherford provided assistance so that Beauvilleer could double the advantage four minutes later.
In what can be considered a very encouraging initial period, Sullivan returned to the local team with a wish to play at 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to equal the match at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants would take advantage of the first break when he marked his second round of the night at the end of the first part.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once more matched the game with a ball at 27:37 p.m.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined in helping Nielsen to give Dundee the lead for the first time in the party when the end of the second part arrived and he assured the victory with the fifth goal of his team as the end drew near.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five parties, play at home before Milton Keynes in his next party of Friday.
An air traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape on the ground plane
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being called a hero after his death to ensure that a plane that carried hundreds of people was safely able to disappear.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared after a large-scale earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
The Replica forces continue to absorb the area, and many find themselves trapped between the caves in the city of Palu.
Although his companions fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his seat in the Mutiara airport control tower Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu. This tower was being hit by a strong balance.
It was held firm to ensure that the flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was on the track at the time, could safely disappear.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought he was breaking down.
He died later in the hospital.
The Indonesian Air Navigation spokesman Johannes Sirait said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian channel ABC News.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Sadly, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"Our hearts break when they hear this," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of dead can reach several thousand people. The National Disaster Mitigation Agency claims that access to the cities of Dodrya, Sigi and Botong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, as there were still many corpses under the ruins and it has not been possible to contact many people," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, manager of the agency.
Some waves that have reached up to six meters have destroyed Palu, which will celebrate a massive funeral on Sunday.
Assistance and supplies are being carried on military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with more bodies.
The clean water is gone.
The mini-markets are being taken everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to the CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is trying to help the survivors as much as possible, but we don't know what they'll find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday and told the army of the country: "I ask everyone who works day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" reported the CNN.
Indonesia had already been seized at the beginning of this year by earthquakes in Lombok where more than 550 people died.
Air accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man has disappeared after the plane crash in a lake
The airline, which operated a flight that was straddled in a Pacific lake in Micronesia, now says that a man has disappeared, after saying that the 47 passengers and crew had evacuated healthy and saved the aircraft that was being drowned.
Air Niugini said in a communiqué that a male passenger could not be counted from Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to more detailed requests about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the aircraft was stranded against the water while trying to land at the airport of Chuuk.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers followed on Saturday in the hospital and that everyone was in a stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The U.S. Air Company and the U.S. Army said the plane landed in the lake before the track.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the landing track.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane got very low.
"That's something extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes notes that he and other travelers managed to advance through a water that reached them to the dock until the air rush out of the plane began to fall.
He said that the pilots entered panic and screamed, and that he suffered a mild injury in his head.
The U.S. Army said that mariners who had done some work to improve a mussel also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank some 30 feet (100 feet) below water.
The aviation safety data indicate that 111 people have been missing from air companies registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor concluded his arguments on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of smoking alive to a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
I explained to the jury how he used mobile phone records to end the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old accused, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night he died.
Rowlett said he received the location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, thus contradicting his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone had been with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police were talking to Sanford.
Sanford went up to the street on the Sabbath and testified that he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "going, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Mobile records indicated that they were known only a week ago.
Rowlett said that sometime after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted the messages, calls and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
"The waste of your life," said Hale.
The defence has scheduled to begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the judge to be in the hands of the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
A third of hip hop wants to fill your music with positive messages to retain the negative image of the gender.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that the hip hop separated from its political message sources and dealt with social issues.
They want to return to their roots and make the hip hop conscious be popular again.
Interpreters like The Refugees and Common have seen a recent rise in the United Kingdom thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York girl asked a couple to send her away after a "racist" text
A New York girl is going to ask a spouse for a discriminatory divorce after having received an erroneous text message from her mother complaining that she was "another black person".
The couple refuse to be racist and compare the demand with a case of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed his surprise when she found out that the new child nurse, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived at her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OTHER NEGRA PERSON", wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she was sent to Maurice twice.
After taking account of his Pat's medal, a "inccommodation" Plasco-Flaxman sent Maurice by saying that his ex-girlfriend, who was African, had done very hard work and that he was looking forward to a Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for work one day and was sent home to Uber.
Maurice is now requesting the spouse for compensation for the disbursement in order to receive a compensation of $350 per day for the position of six months of internal work for which she had been hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show you that things don't do that," he told The Post on Friday and added, "I know it's a case of discrimination."
The couple replied to claims that they were racist saying that the end of Maurice's employment was the most reasonable, since they were afraid they could not trust her after she had offended her.
"My wife had sent you something I didn't mean to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said husband Joel Plasco to Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been angry with, though it was wrong?
Your recent birth?
Come on!"
Comparing the demand as a "extortion", Plato said that his wife had given the baby two months ago and that he was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you going for someone like that?
That's not just a very decent thing," the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still under way, the court of the public opinion has taken action to denounce the couple on social networks, criticising them for their conduct and logic.
Paddington's editors feared readers wouldn't identify with a talking ear, revealing a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It was hard to place someone who read it for the first time before his publication.
Thank you very much for knowing what we know now about the great success of Paddington."
After saying that his father, who had worked from the BBC camera before he was inspired in an obstetric play to write the book for children, trusted that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was something "agridulce" after his disappearance last year.
From Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", she added that her father was very proud of her final success.
"He was a very quiet man and he didn't like to borrow," he said.
"But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child that did something important: you're proud of him, though you're not really worthy of yours.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington's own."
My daughter was dying and I had to give up on the phone.
Upon landing, his daughter was rushed to Niza's Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors worked in a van to save her life.
"Nothing was called regularly to say that the situation was really bad, which was not expected to be achieved," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got Nad's call to tell me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to leave her.
And that's how I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given him to keep the bomb in his heart were slowly absorbed and left his system.
She had died before and everything was gone.
I could just sit there and wait, knowing that all of this was happening.
I couldn't cry, cry, or cry because I was in an environment surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep myself firm."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers, along with the terrible experience she was experiencing.
"No one knew it," he said.
"My head and tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight where I felt this awful feeling of sympathy for Nad.
I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I wanted her."
Women in combat put cards to prevent suicides is a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from losing their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards in a Gales bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to ask for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer depression and was murdered at the age of 18.
"I don't want no father to feel what I feel every day," he said.
Davis, aged 45 and living in Lydney, said his son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew her for her smile.
They always said that his smile lighted anywhere."
However, he quit his job before he died because he was found "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after his death.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that I might have an impact."
Davis created the cards "for people to know that there are people you can visit and who you can talk to, even if you're a friend.
You don't feel quiet, you have to talk to him."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, lost Mark, his partner who was 15 years old, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he would feel depressed or anything like that," he comments.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed their change of attitude.
The day of Christmas came to its lowest point: when the children opened their gifts, he did not even look at them."
He said his death was a great tragedy for them, but they had to overcome him: "Leave a void throughout the family.
He's left us destroyed.
But we all have to keep fighting."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh takes place at the time the FBI began its investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get something like what was asking (a limited investigation in time, with limited scope), maybe we could bring a little unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be "in a bit" in the midst of a party parallelation.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigation to be carried out?
Its negative is due entirely to chronology.
There are only five weeks left for half-mandatory elections on 6 November. If, as expected, the Republicans have bad results, their efforts to achieve the election of the man they want for the highest court in the country will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling the senators, Pressing them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife, Ashley, who was the Chairman's personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to break the patent and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's deserters' figures "caen" with Kim
The number of North Korean deserters in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un arrived in power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of the South Union, said there were 1.127 deserts last year, compared with 2.706 of 2011.
Park said that the strictest border controls between North Korea and China, and the high rates of trafficking in persons, have been key factors.
Pyongyang has not made public comments on this.
To the vast majority of the deserts of the north, they are finally offered the South Korean citizenship.
Seul says they have illegally crossed the border of more than 30,000 North Koreans since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) is strongly protected between the two Koreans.
China considers that the deserters are illegal immigrants rather than refugees and are often repatriated.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still technically in war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to have discussions focused on denuclearization negotiations.
This occurred after the historic meeting in June between United States President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, which agreed in general terms to work on a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed US sanctions for lack of progress.
"Without the confidence of the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not be the first in unilateral disarmament," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls "historic" to Brett Kavanaugh and says it's not appropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, leader of the minority of the Chamber of Representatives, said that the appointed Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was a "historic" and was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival of Austin (Texas).
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said it was a story," Pelosi said about her reaction to the witness that Kavanaugh gave the Thursday to the Senate Judicial Committee.
Kavanaugh was moved to deny the allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh showed very excited, at times almost crying and shaking while talking about his family and his years of secondary education.
In the Committee, he also explicitly condemned Democrats, qualifying their allegations against "grossed and clearly coordinated difamas" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that, in his opinion, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that this could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed its share of democracy.
"I think he is disqualifying himself with those statements and how he has persecuted Clinton and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi raised his objections when he was asked if he would oppose Kavanaugh if he was confirmed in charge and that the Democrats had obtained most of the Chamber of Representatives.
"I'll just say one thing: if you're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, it won't be appropriate not only to be in the Supreme Court, nor will it even be to be in the court where it is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Washington Circuit Appeals Tribunal D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about the possible judgements of Kavanaugh against the Health Care Act or the Wade Roe Case, since he was considered a conservative judge.
In its confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be rejected.
"This is not the time for a historical and impartial person to go to court and wait for us to feel all right," Pelosi said.
And women have to punish him.
It's a justified diaphragm, it's months and years of anger breaking apart, and she can't leave it without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that's so weird, do I?
He continued: "I was very helped by a woman who was executive in some company and who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique for which when she was angry and started to cry, she told the person she was talking to: "Sometimes you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
So no, I'm angry."
And then I went on with what I was doing.
I thought it was great."
The tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories that I have of one of my first jobs, in a man-dominated office, was once I found crying with an unexpressable anger. A older woman, a serious manager of whom had always had a slight fear, got me into the corner and dragged me to a ladder.
"Don't let them never see you cry," he told me.
"They have no idea you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're going to be happy because they think they've made you feel better."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Congressman in Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential careers.
In 1987, when they sailed to Hart on an extramarital adventure on board a ship called Monkey Business by which I had to withdraw from the presidential career, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, it occurred to him that there was no reason not to explore the idea that she himself would be presented to the presidency.
"It wasn't a very premeditated decision," he told me between rice 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
Someone referred to us as Blancanieves and the seven orphans."
As the campaign was already very advanced, it remained behind the fund-raising, so it was promised that it would never be able to get into the race again unless it was worth two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
He found out that some of his supporters who gave $1,000 to men, she only gave him $250.
"Do you think I have a discount?" he asked.
When he announced his speech to announce that he would not have a formal campaign, he became so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude by the people who had supported him, frustration by a system that made it difficult to raise funds and focused on the arrest of voters instead of delegates, and angered against sex).
"The logic would have been to think that he had had a nervous crisis," Schroeder said, recalling the press reaction.
"You might have thought Kleineex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna put in my leg?
"Flore"?
The trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first survivors of the US-China trade war were conscripts, and although there is still much to do with the end of the war, a break between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts believe.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, launched the first warning at the beginning of the year by placing gold at China's main exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant scale took place this week with new tariffs affecting $200,000 million ($15,000 million) in products, taxing half of the products entering the United States from China.
At all times, Beijing has taken equivalent repressions, recently applying five to ten percent of North American products for a value of $60,000 million.
China has committed itself to equalizing US attacks, and it is unlikely that the second most powerful economy in the world will soon collapse.
Making Washington retrocessed would mean surrendering to demands, but being publicly submitted to the United States would be too shameful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its letters well, US trade pressure could help China in a long-term way by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a fast political decision in Washington or Beijing can be made under conditions to begin a fall in the economy in any of the two countries is actually much more dangerous than the viewers have recognized so far," said Abigail Grace, an Asian-based research associate for the strategic office Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready for refugees to return, said the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks help to rebuild a country destroyed by a war that has taken more than seven years.
In a speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions of the country were improving.
"The situation on the ground is more stable and secure today thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The Government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists in an attempt to restore normality.
All conditions for voluntary return to the country of refugees who had to leave it because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and means of life are already in place.
The United Nations estimates that, since the beginning of the war in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are six million others who still live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would appreciate assistance in rebuilding the desolate country.
But he also stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that promoted emergency.
Europe with Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final marker from 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, in the suburbs of Paris (France).
The United States has now carried six consecutive defeats on European soil since the last time it won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when the Danish captain's team Thomas Bjorn achieved the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight during most of the tournament, launched his exit point to water on the 16rd floor, thus acknowledging his defeat before Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari highlighted in all of his rounds, becoming one of the four players who have never achieved a 5-0-0 since he started the current tournament format in 1979.
U.S. Jordan Spieth fell 5 and 4 before the player with the lowest rating of the European team, the Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world's number one player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 before Ian Poulter, who might have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio García, a veteran who has already taken eight Ryder Cups, has become European with more victories of the tournament of all times, with 25.5 points in his career.
"I can't cry, but today I can't avoid it.
It's been a very hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy to have been able to recover the cup.
It is a success of the entire team and I am very happy that I have been able to help," said an excited García after the victory of the European team.
Now he's got antorcha to his partner John Rahm, who's already defeated Sunday at the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods for 2 and 1 in an individual party.
"I feel an incredible pride when I beat Tiger Woods, because I've grown up to see this man," said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost the four parties in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in his Ryder Cup career.
This is a statistical stranger for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 great titles, remaining behind Jack Nicklaus alone.
The U.S. team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a large-level golf game throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after the disappointing performance of his team: "I am very proud of these boys, they have never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we heated the situation in Europe.
But we're gonna lose him.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a big captain.
Your 12 players have performed a very good game.
We will regroup, I will meet with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will continue.
I want a lot of these 12 guys and I'm proud to be your captain.
Now it's about turning our head.
They've overcome us."
