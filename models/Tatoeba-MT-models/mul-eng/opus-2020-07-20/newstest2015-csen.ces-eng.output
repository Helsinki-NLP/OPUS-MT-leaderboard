Petr Czech: What's the last minute?
It's all possible.
Today is the last day when you can still jump through the transfer window and make a big move.
The next chance comes in winter.
Petr Čech, currently rewards Chelsea's banker, but now he doesn't sit on a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
It sits in the funny NH Hotel, talks with Czech journalists and talks with Czech representatives to the General's hero from the United States and then to the sharp start of the Euro 2016 qualification against the Netherlands.
In the Chelsea branch, the Premier League takes over Thibaut Courtois, which was first in ten years in the London club.
In time, it was speculated that Czechs might be interested in Real Madrid.
He lost the Spanish Superpohar at the beginning of the season in love with Atlétika and did not even enter the league when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastian.
It also reflected the interest of Paris SG.
This French league was held in two victories and two medals on Sunday at St. Etienne 5:0.
Relatively the most pressure on the bot club AS Monaco.
He's in bed with balance 1-1-2 and he broke up with Lille at 1:1 a.m. on the weekend.
On the Bulgarian English websites today, reports of Czechs might want to visit Queens Park Rangers.
According to the English bookmakers, the Czechs' departure from Chelsea for the last time is not too likely.
The skipper wrote a course 4:1 on it.
Peter, is it possible for you to change your dress during the remaining hours?
I don't count on it, but it's never a percentage in the football.
Maybe there'll be a offer that won't go back in the day.
How should such a offer look?
(Laughter) "Well, I still don't know what kind of offer you can't refuse, actually looks like.
It would have to come to the agreement of all sides. First of all, it would depend on the existence of Chelsea, whether or not the appropriate offer of the club has been resolved.
Is it really technically realistic to make such a move when you're in Prague now?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere in a new way?
So I didn't think about it.
But in such a situation, there are a lot of players today, everyone is somewhere on the stage, and certainly today there are still a lot of obstacles to stop.
So somehow it would be realistic.
How many clubs on the planet could afford you?
Well, I don't really know.
So you're not going to leave?
The situation when I caught up with the first three matches of the new season was new to me after fifteen years of career.
However, there's no reason to panic, to fight, to go somewhere.
I want to continue to participate in this file on the position of the Chelsea banker and is on the trainer who chooses what decision he will make during the following weeks.
What role does family play in your decision?
I'll take all the factors into account.
It is essential for me to be physically active in sports, but I am also looking at this from a personal website, which is of course part of the family’s needs.
Is it possible you could get another club in England?
That's the question I thought I'd never be affected.
But it's all possible in the football.
I don't want anything out of it.
I don't know the answer.

George Webster accused of rape in hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
The husband will be brought before the court for charges of rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was informed of charges during hearing at the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He reportedly had to rape a woman on 7 June 2013 in Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in the county of Perthshire.
According to Webster's claim, she was attacked while "she wasn't in science, asleep and unable to give her consent."
Next, Webster is motivated to rape other women at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn in Scotland on May 4, 2014.
The Court of Justice of Lady Rae set the date of the appeal on 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Renewing the very American idea that labour rights are equal to human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a law to protect the community as a civil law.
"According to the functioning of the committees, jobs for the middle class are working," says Ellison, a democratic senator for Minnesota, who is co-chairing the Congress Committee.
That is why I am so proud that, together with John Lewis' example of temporary rights, I can present a law that strengthens the position of employees.
This Rules of Procedure give workers the same legal opportunity to avoid discrimination when organizing committees, as in other forms of discrimination, and to stop counter-argument forces.
The law on labour relations so as to enable all employees who face discrimination, if they wish to join the committees, to be brought before the civil court - and to condemn the damage or compensation of damage - is a proper and necessary initiative.
But it's certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and other legal advocates have to do is to link it again to an American ideal.
Even in recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan and other States, the Americans have at times supported countries around the world to accept, expand and respect labour rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember when a country was celebrating democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of press and the right to assembly.
When the United States occupied Japan after the second world war, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt the proposed constitution in order to ensure that the Hideki Toya military autocratic will be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their committees played a role in the formation of new Japan, included in their languages and openly recognized that "the right of employees to assemble, collectively unite and to do so is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after the second world war, General David Eisenhower and his advisers urged Germany to establish a constitution that would ensure that the Fascism of Adolf Hitler would be replaced by strong democracy.
The Germans realized that employees would need to organize and organize in the new nation and therefore include clauses that are open to say: “The right to create societies that will secure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each individual and to each individual and to any call or profession.
Agreements restricting or imposing this right will be abolished, and measures leading to such a purpose shall be illegal.
When former President Eleanor Roosevelt, President of the International Commission for Human Rights, who proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, the sponsors and Roosevelt guarantee that "each has the right to establish and enter into a committee within the framework of the protection of its interests."
The American generation has accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When the country was working in another country, such as the establishment of a civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to create working groups - and their participation in collective interaction with companies and government agencies in the position of a balanced partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights have been violated in America, it is crucial to return to the American idea that workers must have the right to organize and work in a free and open society.
As reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said ten years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today everyone knows that the forces of the people have not diminished, but they have expanded it.
They have raised the standard of living for millions of people, created a market for industry, and led to an uneasiness of production.
Those who attack the councils forget these simple truths, but history reminds them.
History won't be forgotten and we wouldn't have to.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protection in order to prevent discrimination in the organisation of committees - is very late.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that brought America and made it a real commitment to democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked the law that could close all the hospital clinics in Louisiana
On Sunday, the Federal Court of Justice temporarily blocked the Law of Louisiana, which, according to lawyers, would probably close all five hospitals operating in the state.
The Regulation, which was signed by Louisian Governor Bobby Jindal in June, to enter into force on 1 September, would require doctors to have the right to receive a patient in a hospital up to 30 miles from their practice.
The hearing of the judge means that doctors may continue to carry out legal procedures temporarily and must, inter alia, take this leave.
"The proposed party will be able to carry out its work legally and, inter alia, obtain permission," said Federal Judge John deGravelles.
The hearing will be planned within one month so that the judge can issue a more lasting resolution concerning the law.
Right-of-occupancy activists, who are the last in the series of similar measures, welcomed and said that they would give doctors more time to obtain permission.
"Today's decision ensures women in Louisiana to be safe from the cold law to prepare them for health and their rights," declared Nancy Northup, president and executive director of the Centre for Reproductive Law, who, on behalf of the three of the five clinics, decided to block the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision concerns doctors from two clinics who were not among the complainants, and they also request that this authorisation be granted.
Louisiana is one of the eleven states that have adopted similar laws, while the courts in Alabama and Mississippi have declared such measures to be contrary to the provisions.
The key parts of the Texas law, which would close most of the remaining clinics in the state, blocked the federal court on Friday.
Women's rights fighters to travel together with the Association of American Family and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association claim that it is necessary to have this authorisation for doctors who do not require medical care.
The sponsors claimed that the measures aimed at protecting the health of women and that some also welcomed the fact that the measures would have closed the clinics.
The Reproductive Law Centre indicated that in Louisiana, only one doctor has permission to perform the exercises.
If all doctors in the state were to be prevented from carrying out the procedures, this doctor would also stop taking steps out of fear of his safety, the group said.
The Lousian authorities indicated in response that doctors who have lost will not be tested while waiting for a claim for a right to be granted.
Due to background diagnosis and poor access to treatment, the external cancer of the ovaries is more common
Angelina Jolie and her brother, James, published a video containing her pregnant mother who died of cancer in 2007.
Women in Australia abroad are at higher risk of dying from cancer than those in the city’s rivals.
Researchers analyzed medical records of more than 1100 Australians diagnosed in 2005 with cancer cancer and found that only 35% lived five years after diagnosis.
A study by Susan Jordan of QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute indicated that women in foreign and remote regions of the state were about twenty percent higher likely to die during the study than in women in urban areas.
MALÁ STUDIE: New medicines can reduce cancer of the lungs and the kidneys
The researchers were following treatment for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the chance of survival affected the age of women in the age of diagnosis, the type of carcinoma, other existing disabilities and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate was reported in elderly women whose cancer was diagnosed in a more advanced stage.
In women in foreign and remote parts of the state, about 20 percent were more likely to die during the study than in women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of cancer, Dr. Jordan says that factors could be a late diagnosis and poor access to treatment.
"It is not possible to treat gynaecologists who usually sit in larger cities," she said.
Even by improving medical services far beyond the barrier, the doctor suggested that it would help strengthen transport services that would enable specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programmes to support people who are treated far from their family and friends.
Jordan’s study said that long-term survival of women with cancer vaccines is low in the country, which underscores the need for better treatment and preventive programs.
A research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer today is published in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, a 33-year-old mother of Elisha Neaveva from the city of Gold Coast was diagnosed with aggressive form of vaccines.
The garden centre is suffering from a decrease in the number of owners
According to the HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with the extraordinary residence of households under 35 years of age could lead to the arrival of a “main age group of farmers” by today’s generation of consumers, the garden centres will reach up to ten million pounds per year.
According to the report, it will lose its people’s property, which is to be found in the average 55 % of the shares that will be lost by the people who live in it.
As other threats to the sector, which produces five billion pounds per year, there is an increase in the number of people living in very urbanised areas where there are no gardens, the location of the pre-review site used as parking space and reducing the size of the garden.
In the area of Great London, where the share of its own households fell from 61 % to 43 % over the six years, the lowest household expenditure on gardening products in Britain falls to one household.
HTA and the Royal Garden Company indicated that housing in the basement or lack of space does not mean that people could not plant crops.
Guy Barter, the main gardener for RHS, said: “The tenants have a very favorite crop in the flowers - when they move, they can take plants with them."
The HTA report stated that the "gold Age" of the garden retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of households and economic prosperity from 80 to half of 90 years.
This year, he also proposed higher retirement due to a better period of time that came after unreceptive conditions in the summer and the autumn.
When the East dictator says about democracy.
After Putin became a member of his youth organization, which most often reminds me of Hitler, he hailed the nuclear weapons and, above all, made it clear that their views were stolen from him, he gave us today a talk on democracy.
But I have such a feeling that the current regime in Russia is showing a lot of roses in the Fascist state.
The great nations have one common and that is that they can control them as well as nationalism, although the complex of minorities can be transformed into imperialist spells.
The time is going to go east, obviously different from the west.
While the Western world thought that the war on power over Europe was already far away , in the east it thought it had been over for a long time and it needed to regain its international position.
In the three-year period, the government in Germany was in a state of shock and frustration, and it followed the explosions of nationalism in Russia.
And then the whole common cult of a strong leader, the migrating of journalists, the killing of uncomfortable political opponents, the discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, is quite similar.
The ruling of Putin and of course the majority of Russia will be proud of the time when Russia ruled half the world and the other part will rise before them.
Maybe Western politicians charged themselves, maybe a little Vladimir paid for the shoulder, maybe they didn't invite him where he lived, and maybe they began to underestimate him, and he was just acting like a typical Russian man.
He made a show at home, pretends he didn't even want to go anywhere and broke his knife.
Now he's decided he'll be back in a lost position.
It starts slowly, it's time.
The leader's probably alive, where he'd run.
He sent Kavkazani, now he sent Ukrainians, and they're on a series of torture stakes from Pobalt.
You've had enough of a Russian bear in your skin for a long time.
I'm sure you're aware of this, too, of China, who's doing a lot of good, and he's probably making a move on the way out.
And the Germans of the Vladimíra are also very well aware of how well they are, and I gave them in 45 so on the back.
That's how to do one new Novosie in Karlov's Wares.
It would be the foundation and ours are there a lot and how they're printed there, and even though they're trying to get rid of them.
Our veterans remember how they were in Czechoslovakia.
Now vote for their Prime Minister, Mr Sobotka, he's so soft, he can run like a bicycle and I'm afraid of the whole EU.
It'd be so much fun to get to the big Russians.
They need to remember where their place is.
And as explosives, we use our landmen who live on their land.
The Russians are everywhere, and if they say they're there, they're just there and we're not doing it, we're protecting them.
And the Russians will rule again , because he has been born into something other than that .
But Europe is just as good as a proposal to which the hero Ivan can dance a goat.
Turkey appealed to the American diplomat for a spy report
The Turkish Foreign Minister called on the highest established American diplomat in the country to explain the report on American and British spy activity in Turkey.
The mayor of the Bulent government said that the American charge of business and the Turkish state officials were talking about the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet magazine The Intercept stated that according to documents provided by the former U.S. National Security Agency, Turkey was the priority goal of the American and British reporting services.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has considered the importance of the report and announced that all important states are closely following each other.
The oldest report, according to which the German reporting service has also been targeted at Ankara, has led to a more explosive reaction to the Turkish government.
The series of the game on the tower presented other tricks fourth series
The series of games on drums is currently covering the episodes of the fifth series of the cultural series.
At the same time, they were confused by the appearance of the third series of tricks.

Police commander in Magaluf accused of corruption
On Friday, the complainants submitted evidence to the Office of the Mallor State Prosecutor on the withdrawal of police and state officials from the Calvia Office in the area of self-government.
The leader of the police in Calvia on the island of Mallorca was arrested on charges of rioting businessmen and bar owners in the unexplained festival quarter in Magaluf.
Superintendent José Antonio Navarro was taken to the investigation after he was charged with the corruption of several companies from Punta Ballena, the street where most bars and night business in Magaluf are located.
According to the online debt of Mallorca Diario, five of the prosecutors of the Mallorian Authority have submitted evidence against corruption by police and state officials in the independent area of Calvia.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish State police because of their involvement in the charge of corruption and together with Navarre is a hearing officer.
The Spanish National ABC has cited the restless owners of the night business, according to which public factors have a serious impact on their business.
"It's not about making money for a long time, but about surviving," said one of the entrepreneurs in court.
Don't play with our lives.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf arrived at the world’s top pages of magazines after a video on YouTube released by eight-year-old British tourists, who gave oral sex to 24 men during the tour.
Since that time, the island authorities have been trying to take account of the drinkers and exhibitors in a number of holiday parties in Magabura by reducing the number of well-known alcohol tournaments by bars.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where an oral sex event occurred, was forced to close and, together with tour organizers on Carnage's bars, to pay the rent of 55,000 euros ($73 000).
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is especially popular in Britain, was also a witness of many abuses under the influence of alcohol, including fashion waves known as “balconing” where people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony into the hotel pool.
The first spring day was marked by rain and storms that had an impact on the airport in Adelaide
JARO brought a surprise south of South Australia, with a strong rain and a cold wind that hit the airport in Adelaide.
The next 5 mm cut should fit in the city up to nine hours of night and the other 6.6 mm will fall during the night of the week.
The last rain was presented together with a few short turns connected with the storm and wind currents that began eight hours ago, and during about ten minutes they brought almost 4 mm of ice.
After several hours of iron came after winter, the temperature in the city was only 15.8 °C on Monday.
It's because the storm season has joined the late Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was to arrive after 19:30, but at a short distance it was subject to a change in speed or direction of wind and was forced to remain.
The wind currents at the airport in Adelaide at this time reached the ground speed of about 50 km/h.
The flight data indicated that the aircraft had to leave the second landing and finally arrived at 20:40.
The delay of the aircraft subsequently led to the delay of the following years, including the flight of Emirates from Dubai and the flight of Kantas from Sydney.
According to the forecast, they reach a maximum of 16 °C in the adhesion temperature and one or two transmitters may occur.
Children of Israel returning to school after war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the area near Gaza returned to school on Monday after spending years in anti-Bambombic shelters, while during the seventeenth war between Israel and Hamas in their homes, rockets and mines were attacked. However, the schools in Gaza remained closed while the lands were remembered for fighting.
The beginning of the school brought to the community the marked attacks of joy and excitement in southern Israel, but the signs of wars are still noticeable.
In Ashdoda, a town in the south of the country, the school staff, who had a rocket attack, removed the rest of the wall after the blast and freely expected the children to return.
"We're a little scared, but otherwise we're happy," said Ronit Bartov, a local language teacher and a local language teacher.
A lot of children in this area really need to get back to their daily routine.
Her eleven-year-old daughter, Shani Bartov, made it "it's a little special" to go back to school once again.
"We survived a few difficult moments and we didn't even leave the house," she said.
Kibuc, located near the border with Gaza, visited President Reuben Rivlin to offer his support to the citizens.
Until the end of the last week of the war, thousands of border residents like Saad remained inside their homes or homes and left to safer areas from Gaza to escape rockets and mines.
A lot of Nachal Oz, a village close to the border with Gaza, where she shot a four-year-old boy from a Palestinian mine.
The Minister of Education said that about twelve families were still missing.
Their children were temporarily placed in boarding schools.
The president of the government of Benjamin Netanyahu visited the school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza, which had been severely damaged by the Palestinian ball.
He urged the children to study carefully and added: “We will receive you education and security. ”
Israel and Hamas last Tuesday agreed to a time of unprecedented peace.
The stop of the fires of the river led to an immediate end of wars, however, not solving key problems such as Hamas' requirement for the end of the Israeli-Egypt block of Gaza and the reopening of airports and ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the repatriation of Hamas and the return of the body of two soldiers who fell into battle.
It is expected that a new round of indirect meetings will begin later this month in Egypt.
According to the estimates of the Palestinians and the UN in the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians died, of whom three quarter were created by civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel suspects this number and estimates that at least half of the killings were radical, although there is no clear evidence for this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians died, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other giants of Gaza fired during the fighting in Israel’s cities, mainly south of the country, 4,591 rockets and ammunition.
The Israeli army also carried out more than 5,000 air raids and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and as a result, 250 000 people have been hiding in the United Nations school, which has become temporary shelters.
Because of the tens of thousands of people still in hiding, and because of ongoing wars, school officials left the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope that they will open the school quickly so that we can complete the same education as Jewish children and other children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from the school in the largest city of Gaza.
I'm standing behind you.
Lafatu treated the fever
The Czech Football Representative met today in Prague before noon in the middle of the morning with the US and the next opening of the European Mission's qualification against the Netherlands.
The three-year-old team has problems with partner attacker David Lafata, who suffers from heat.
David's not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, there were more players, and David's probably got a little more problems.
But we want him to be here and be all right first," said the coach Paul Vrba.
"If it's two or three days or tomorrow it's gonna fit, it'll be seen according to his health status, which our doctor decides about," he added.
The other players are all right.
"Of course someone has a disease, but it's not like they can't train or take part in a game in the middle of the US," said the Czech coach.
On Sunday evening, Vrba called as the last player of the partner's representative Luke Vach.
He admitted that this was not an easy decision, given the fact that other mediators also appeared.
I decided on the basis of Luke's perspective of 25 years.
The decision was very difficult, but I stand for it," the Wrba Vachov brought to you.
What about Shural?
We'll see what's going on with Latatou.
It is not excluded that in the case of health problems, nominations could still be changed.
On the weekend with great performance, for example, a liberarian Joseph Schural, who gave hattrick.
Of course, there are players who have shown the form lately.
We'll see how David Lafata will be on it.
If it is not possible in the middle to be available, I do not claim that I can nominate any of the players who were involved in the Czech league," the Vrba subpoena.
The afternoon is waiting for the train representative on Strahva, and on Tuesday the classic pre-mier train will be opened for fans and followed by autograms.
A run with the Americans is played in the middle of 20:15 and a national team in it will be forced by the prime winner under the Wrbo.
In the previous three preparatory steps, he won two remixes and once lost.
The qualification file with the Netherlands is then on programme 9 September from 20:45.
Dogs go to the Netherlands to Italy
I'm glad he's got more time on the train than before.
It's good if you have players for eight days and you can get some things that we need not have so much time before.
Now we will be able to focus only on preparing for the best in the Netherlands," Wrba praised.
The Dutch will be represented in Prague on Thursday in Italy and the duel will personally follow the former temporary representative poet Josef Pešice.
Give us the information that's from the game.
But it's not just about him, we're gonna have a party and we're gonna have a fight and we're gonna get him out of here.
A new coach will come to the Netherlands, we will see what changes there will be," Wrba said to bronze medalists from the recent world champion.
According to very closely monitored housing prices in the winter period have grown in the last seven years.
According to the housing price index in the Australian capital RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic increased by 1.1 % in August, the agency indicated in the afternoon.
The increase led to a total increase in red, red and gray by 4.2 %, the highest in winter since 2007.
The annual price increase increased by 10,9 %, more than doubled by one year until August 2013, however, the profit was not distributed equally in the country.
RP Data Tim Lawless stated that Sydney and Melbourne are on the market.
The figures for the RP Data show that the prices of apartments in Sydney increased by 16.1% last year, while the prices in Melbourne increased by 11.7%.
Among the other strongest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin with an increase in prices between five and six per cent.
On the other hand, Canberra was located, which damaged the State of the expenditure reduction regulation and where prices increased by only 1.4 % during the year.
Lawless said that as soon as the market began to slow down, the number of real estates on sale will rise in the following months, which will be “a real test”.
"In view of the sustainable high rate of auctions, generally high sales speed and low rate rates, it is likely that the value of living will increase over the next three months," he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never killed me.
He never said, "I love you."
Henry was born in 1958 as one of the seven children of Japanese immigrants in Dudley in Midlands.
With his father, who died when Henry was 19, and who worked in the factory, they had a colder relationship.
Henry's trying comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and which is part of the Radio 4.
Soundtrack is mixed reggae and rap and melody is optimistic.
But Henry had to consult with some unpleasant memories from childhood.
After the death of his mother, Henry went through "relevant" therapy and now he thinks about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You have never seen his face, but you have heard his voice saying: “Stop this frame.
Leave your sister alone.
Get out of here!
I want to look at the cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a child, they were grown up - they went to the bar with him and searched things like the shape of a doll with a beer or the beauty of a doll in the cake.
I never talked to him like that.
Most of my life was a serious guy in the kitchen what you read in the newspaper.
Recently, Henry visited Dudley in the library, and although the conditions were better than in his father's time, he saw what life had to be for him.
Today, there's more light there, but it's still dark, dirty, dirty labyrinth, where the flames explode and there's a lot of smoke and satisfactory.
Dad always went out and lay there, and it was to hear how he slowly started singing for himself because he laughed at him.
When I walked around, I realized that he was making this year to enjoy his family, and I started to respect him more.
Even so, Henry survived childhood without parental love.
Dad didn't kill anyone, he didn't say, "I like you."
When Mom was sick and dying, we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter, Billie, who's with Dawn Frank, let him live the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop with that "I like you"?
Don't worry about me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn Frank.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
Frank, who was married for 25 years, is still a good friend.
Dawn's nice.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I had a lot, a lot of stress and began to show signs of diabetes, the doctor said, “You have to make radical changes. ”
So I started going to the big fitness center, and I had to keep a messy diet to get rid of the presents.
It's very hard.
It's strange.
No one wants to eat the same junk.
The change in the direction of Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, short-sighted beard.
After he had received recognition from Othell's critics, he went down to the theater.
She's been tracking Comedie with a lot of mistakes and a fleet of Augusta Wilson.
It's a different experience than sitcoms and comedians who have fulfilled his ethical work life.
He started when he was 16 and worked in the factory.
The DJ looked at him on the floor as someone appeared, and wrote about him in the talent competition New Faces.
His television career began in the mid - 70 ’ s: “I have been the only black imitator / comic on television for a long time. ”
He learned to walk.
In addition to having to pay attention to the public, I also had to learn how to think of the functioning tapes, be stars and be on television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
In view of his manager's right to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a fun program in which the clergy were turning black, Henry finally released his comedy five years later.
That's why my family was already mine.
I hope it never happened, but I don't hate it.
Even though it was a special and embarrassing position, I worked on big scenes and learned how to work with the tax.
What was "years and years evaluated was the main product of British television", but it was also the "big black parody."
In the 1980 ’ s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and presented the compositions, which at the same time made fun of and celebrated British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began to be sent in 1984 and in the 1990s, he was also known as chief of the Gareth Blacklocks in the Chef Comedy Series!.
For the next decade, he was arrested for advertising, documents, TV series and roles in the movies, but after sending his series of LennyHenry.TV to BBC in 2008, he said: “So you're going to do now, Lene, it seems a little bit like you've been in one place, or you're getting out of the way."
Next on the series was the documentary series on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?/What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I had a serious allergy on Shakespeare.
We didn't teach him properly at school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
All of those with whom we had a conversation on the agenda, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dencho, said, "You should try it."
Don't worry about what you're talking about if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and you'll see why we all like Shakespeare.
Henry presented twenty lines of Othell's final words for the document, and it's already in it.
It made me feel like I could.
It's like it's giving me a lift.
"That's it. It's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the text, find out something about it.
So the test was tough, and before that, I've been playing this game for months and months.
And it was a success.
Looks like they're waiting for the past, which didn't happen.
Soon he started playing in Comedy with a lot of mistakes.
I was in the National Festival right away, and I couldn't believe it.
One moment I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical event, and Henry instinctively felt he had to take responsibility for the entertainment of the audience.
"The voice in my head said to me, 'Before he fixs the computer, you have to take them ten minutes now.'
Instead, the governor announced that the presentation would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I went out of jail and I was told, "Hm, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can solve it for me.
"You're playing, so stay in the role."
Henry in Plotech in Duchess Theatre
Learning the Plot's text was a challenge.
Panika's pretty good, he's making a decision.
The game was also well accepted, so it is like God’s sign that says: “You should do this. ”
Of course, that's what we say.
So I'm staying in it.
I really like that.
I'm glad to try.
Henry, however, remains a comedian's brain - our conversation is interrupted by humorous exposure when it enters and emerges from the role of the imitator.
I decided not to stand up because having peace from a room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I would say.
If you're still looking for something, you can get into the dark street.
Sometimes when I want to, I do live at the Apollo, but I don't like it anymore.
I was wondering if he'd ever organize some stand-up tournaments.
The joy of sitting in one room with a director who helps to give pictures of the beginning, the middle and the end of the journey - I don't think I would ever want to give it up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I'm having a good time.
It's fun.
You're still telling stories that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers state officials to congratulate an absent employee
Kenya began with the biometric registration of all its state officials to try to remove from the government's payroll of non-existent employees.
According to the government's declaration, employees who do not register within the next two weeks will cease to receive payment.
The government believes that thousands of people get paid even after they leave the state service.
After taking over the office in 2013, President Uhura Kenyatta announced that he would put an end to corruption in the state administration.
The audit carried out this year showed that the state is coming monthly at least one million dollars (700,000 pounds) on payments to non-permanent employees and on other use of official power.
The government suspects that payments are still placed on bank accounts even after the death of the employee or after the employee leaves the state administration, the BBC reporter from Nairobi, Wandaw Chebusiri.
All state officials must be provided within the next two weeks to the identification centres where their data will be biometrically recorded, in a government declaration.
It goes on to say that anyone who does not have enough excuses will be excluded from the payroll.
"The award of the actual public service will contribute significantly to its business and will also be used to clean up the payroll at both levels and address the problem of non-existent employees," said Anne Waiguru, secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Ten Turkish police officers are arrested for "smarting" against the government
The local media state that Turkey has been detained because of suspicion of "smart against the government" by all 33 police officers.
The police office has not yet commented on the case.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, there were fourteen high-ranking officials.
Some of them were involved in a procrastination investigation, which focused on government officials, including four ministers.
A number of Turkish police officers were arrested in July for the specific organisation of criminal gangs and telephony.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at the time of the President of the Government) marked their conduct as part of the action of Islamic spiritual Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children have returned to Ukraine to school
Most schools in Ukraine were reopened on Monday (September 1st) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents and president of the government of Arsenij Jaceňuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told the local journalists that not all schools were reopened, but that the country was determined to defend for the next generation:
Not all schools held a traditional ceremony until September 1.
Not throughout Ukraine is peace.
We have to fight for peace.
The entire Ukraine, a united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastekhov, a teacher at the school in Slavian, who visits Jaceňok's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain knowledge that will benefit them in the future.
On the first day of school, children are traditionally celebrating their clothes, bring balloons, and teachers give flowers.
In Roño Fairhead, maybe BBC found a head for hard times.
Bring with it a cloud of glory from the world of banking, media management and internal conservative sides.
She's got her own experience on the front lines.
The career started in the consultation company Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearson.
Seven years she was executive director of the Financial Times. She refused when the highest role in Pearson's parent company was placed by her younger colleague.
It is said that her departures were nearing a million pounds.
Her political portfolio is also wide.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Browne, former director of BP, when Cameron in Whitehall needed a private expertise: he became a government advisory body.
Her husband was a former member of the City Council.
In May, I described the manager's work as kalic with food.
Not only is BBC a wide and online entity in the center of public life but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
Corporation is turning to two directions: inside the top type of hierarchy of its own leadership BBC, but also outside the public voice in times when things do not work.
It's about almost unsustainable monopolies that require a fundamental reform.
But the director would risk coming to a company that is composed of Chinese dynasty, dissipating it, and thus preparing itself for work.
It's a difficult challenge.
If it wasn't so hard, many people would like to see how BBC is decreasing - her power, her finances - and how she's revising her status.
With the expansion of the competition area and the lack of old security, the direct and indirect consultation of concessional payments for the BBC is a major danger.
For a modest amount of 145.50 pounds per year, the British public buys part of something that is certainly the largest media business in the world.
The BBC reports a good history: it claims that its production reaches 96% of households and that there are only 40 pensions a day.
Moreover, the figure of the BBC is apparent: at 53 % of the bidders, 31 % were sold ten years ago.
The use of BBC services has changed: Today, I can look at the iPlayer on my mobile phone and on the order I've been through.
But BBC still remains a very loving and wonderful institution.
She needs a great director - I hope she found one.
The Texas Governor Perry claims that an offensive tweet has not been accepted
A tweet from the official Twitter account of the Texas governor Rick Perry, who was published on Sunday, contained an impressive picture of the democratic state parliament that initiated Perry's criminal charge of abuse of power.
The Twitter was later removed and the Perry account was published next time he was away from the previous account.
He left my account with a tweet that was not authorized.
"I disagree with the tweet and stopped him," said another post.
Perry's assistant didn't answer the questions immediately.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it is not clear who is actually responsible for his management.
Previous tweet published an unliquidious, humorous picture of Travis County Rosemary Lehmbergo's national convention, which was judged in April 2013.
When she refused to refuse, Perry refused to pay for her office, which Perry, a potential candidate for the president in the 2016 elections, brought this month before a large jury in Austin.
“ I don’t always conduct three times more alcohol in the blood than is allowed to limit... but when I’m done, I’m sorry that the governor of Perry is calling me responsible for this. ”
I'm the best democracy in Texas.
The investigation against Perry has not been carried out by Lehmberg's office.
He had Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonia, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry was followed by an innocent and accused of a tactical, political manoeuvre.
His qualified legal team requested a judge to dismiss the charges because the use of the laws to appeal to the court of the most powerful governor in the history of the Texas is counterproductive.
Perry cancelled the payment of $7.5 million from the State Fund for the Department of Public Interest Debt, which has a seat in Travis County and is responsible for corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to refuse.
The refusal caused formal disease to the left-oriented group of civil activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes even celebrates.
After he finished his presidential campaign in Iowé in 2012 at the fifth place in his country committee, Perry responded to the speculation that he could finish the tweet with his own photo as he ran near the lake and said: “Here I am, South Carolina!
According to Berkeley, the market with accommodation returns "to normal"
One of the most prominent companies in London has ensured that the market with housing in South-East England "returns" to normal level of activity.
The residence in the main city was the subject of high demand and rising prices and increased concern from the credit bubbles were agreed in June by the Bank of England to set limits on mortgages.
Tony Pidgley, the founder and president of the development company for dedicated customers in Berkeley, said on Monday: "From the beginning of the current financial year, the market from the top point in 2013 has returned to normal level of transaction." He adds that it provides "a stable environment for functioning."
London’s housing market was successful during the decline because foreign buyers had flown into the main city.
According to the Catastral Authority, prices in the city rose by 18.5 % in the last year, which far exceeded average 6.7% in England and throughout Wales.
The average sales prices of private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley were about five years ago, and at the end of the day, 423,000 were released.
However, because of the strengthening librarians, they are not so attractive in recent months for foreign purchases of London property - some of them have also threatened the introduction of new property taxes and the possible "sedential taxes" with which politicians came before the elections of the next spring.
Last week, the London real office of Foxtons warned that a thorough market review with mortgages, which represented stricter rules for loans, also slows the market growth rate in sales of property and prices during the second half of the year.
The new bank of England data showed a decrease in the number of approved mortgages in June, which indicates that the housing market is declining.
Hamptons International, another real office, has reduced based on the fact that domestic prices have already begun to decline, its forecast of growth in prices of London's properties by 3% in 2015.
The volume of transactions according to the actual office of WA Ellis in London's most expensive quarters, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, was reduced by quarter each year.
However, the demand for residence in the main city for Berkeley was blessed because it increased the willingness to sell goods for more than 2.2 billion pounds.
Pidgley added: "The problem of the right, well-being living in a good place remained the same and, thanks to this, the forward sale continued."
In June, the company reported that from the beginning of the year to the end of the year, 3,742 properties were sold, almost a third more than before the outbreak of the crisis in 2007.
The annual profit before tax increased by 40% to 380 million pounds, by 18% to 1.6 billion pounds.
On Monday before the annual meeting of the Pidgley company, it was expected that the annual results of Berkeley would be in line with the current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual profit before tax will be 450 million pounds.
The actions of Berkeley were suspended on Sunday at the London storm on 23.96 February.
Hacker posted photos of Jennifer Lawrencové on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence's coming to the 85th anniversary of Cen Academy.
Photos of Oscar’s holder Jennifer Lawrenc’s unique online hacker who claimed to have a “list” photo of other hundreds of beginners.
Speaking stars of the "Hunger Games" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were true and hacker criticised for "extraordinary personal abuse."
The offices have already been contacted and will attract anyone who has stolen the photos of Jennifer Lawrence public.
Hacker photos, which were originally posted on the 4chan photo sharing server, were apparently obtained thanks to the interfaces in the Apple iCloud web site system. A list of photos of hacked victims according to BuzzFeed includes the names of dozens of stars including Rihanny, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winston and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is not clear how many photos are authentic, yet the star of the film "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" Winstead also criticized the act on Twitter.
"I hope that those of you who look at the photos we had with your husband years ago in private homes are at peace," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, known from the series of cable televisions Nikolodeon “iCarly” and “Victorious” claimed that the photos would be true. On Twitter she said: “This is my personal photos are PODVRH, people.”
It's better to avoid it in the dispersion. *A meaningful word cry*.
Buzzfeed announced on Sunday night that talking people's stars, Ariany Grande, had foretold that certain photographs would be true.
An outstanding demonstration of the famous new novel Howard Jacobson on love and letter "J"
They were released, that's the best way to describe it. They were gradually distributed as a cardboard box that someone left on the floor.
Just a while ago, a woman told him that he was too serious, complicated, stupid, isolated, and possibly a little disparaging.
And then she gave him her hand.
I'm afraid you've let it go.
He could pee like a dog, yeah.
The last victim of his ability was a queerly merciful cry, which more than usually promised to relieve him of his loneliness and may even provide him with some relief.
Ailinn Solomon's was a Greek beauty with a wildly sinful hair and a heart of the village on the northern island, which was even lighter and more unhindered than Port Reuben.
The older company that Kevern thought was her aunt who gave birth to her daughter in a wolf but a beautiful valley called the Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for years.
The drums spread out, the corpses were dead, the drummers bowed themselves to the window, as if they thought that this place belonged to them, the garden was grown, and the flood reminded the huge heads of the wild.
The house seemed like a qualm from children's stories, scary and shocking, they're playing full of secrets.
Author's profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of appointments to Man Booker Prize 2014.
The next week will be announced.
Kevern and Ailinn sat on long-distance crosswalks and held their hands, suddenly enjoying a warm summer afternoon, unbelievably located a public station, where the country was listening to his father’s warm music and comforting reports, when he remembered the old song of a long - forgotten black comedy comedy that his father liked to listen to.
You've got too big legs.
Because of their natural aggression, such songs were no longer played in radios.
They were not forbidden - they were indeed forbidden nothing - they were just not allowed to play.
They helped them get into trouble, just like a word of disappointment.
Human experience has demonstrated what would never have been proved by laws and regulations outside the law, and just like people in books, they choose memories in which the poor will become rich, cooks and merciful Romans, so they will choose ballasts in music.
Kavern was allowed to watch the day and started playing on an imaginary piano and a rough, comical voice singing the series of Aillin's big walkers.
I don't think so.
"It was a favorite song from the piano pianist Fats Waller," he said and automatically added two fingers to his fingers.
He always did that to his father when he wanted to write a letter before he left his mouth.
It started as a game when he was a kid.
His father told him the game was playing with his father.
If you were in the word that started on the j, not before two fingers, you'd be paid a penny.
It wasn't very funny at the time, and it wasn't even now.
He just knew it was expected from him, it was all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn never heard of anyone.
Even Jazz, even though he wasn't directly established outside the law, they didn't play.
The improvisation came out of fashion.
There was a place in life for only one "if".
When she started playing melodies, people wanted to know exactly where it's going to end.
It's the same in humor.
His invisibility went into people's nerves.
And jazz was an expression of humor.
Although he didn't hear about Sammy Davis Junior until ten years ago, Kevern knew jazz from his father's flight collection of old CDs.
At least Aillin didn't say Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she could not remember the time when the favorite songs were not black.
No laws or pressure.
A voluntary society is the one in which each part of it is grateful - thanks to those who have been happy relief - agrees with the principle of collective gratitude.
The people of the African-Carobian origin were in the heat and constructions for babies and athletes, and so they sang and ran.
People from the Indian subcontinent, such as natural electronic transmission, have taken responsibility for the fact that no family will be without a functional phone.
The remaining Poles were the installers, the Greeks, the remaining ones, the furniture.
Those from the states of the Persian Gulf and the Levant, whose relatives quickly left the country, while doing it, CO STALO, KDYBYS IT STALO - were afraid to blame it for being put into the fire, they were afraid that the fire would soon last - they opened a restaurant where the lions were sold and burned the water bottles, they did not pay attention to themselves, and the lack of it was slow.
Everyone according to his talent.
Because she listened only to the ballads, Ailinn was hard to understand how the simple words Kavern just sang could produce music.
Music was an expression of love.
"In fact, they're not free," Kevern said.
Maybe only for people who have too big legs.
My father never hurt anyone, but he liked this song.
He spoke too much, but the missing garden provided a safe illusion.
He could not ignore even the word behind the lyrics.
Ailinn still didn't get it.
Why would your father like something like that?
He meant it was a joke, but he seemed to put two fingers in her face again.
You already thought it was weird.
"It seemed funny to him," he said at last.
Unbelievably, she raised her head and gave Kevin a look.
Around the world, there was nothing more visible than the change in her hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"When you think," she mistakenly said.
But it still doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
She seemed really divorced.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked again.
She didn't walk that way.
Maybe a little cocktails...
You're saying you hate me because I'm so fat?
I hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could say, "I love you," but it was too fast.
"Your fat bastards just touch me," he tried.
I'm so tired.
That's not true.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, he often got into trouble, because, like his father, he had done the trick needed to be able to cut the weight he was reading.
Maybe his father was cruel deliberately.
Maybe he was mentally cruel Kavern.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn of Solomon's ruins and rose from the palace, radio-cooled, and poured unspoiled wine.
No wine, so he can't drink for it.
She seemed like a palm leaf in the storm in her divorce.
"My return seems to me that you're a fool," she said...
Until it doesn't bother me.
And he was sorry for her words which she could not speak, and for the fear that she had in her eyes when she stood up against him.
Did you think she'd hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life on the cold North Pole, where she grew up, but she didn't doubt that it was the same as here.
They were covered with the same broad and ice-cream.
The same men, then, CO SE STALO, even more subtle and hateful than their predecessors, pastors and punishments, were furiously bloated from home to home, prepared to raise their hand against any woman who would consider refusing or laughing at them.
Blbec?
If she doesn't pay attention, they'll bring her their guns!
The first thing you can do about it - it's become the most common expression for a erotic relationship between a man and a woman: the enemy of a soft ball of love that the radio has protected - the first one that killed her, then one murder.
According to Kever's view, there is a lot of culture because it was just about the act of violence.
Ailinn Solomon's unverbalally meant him to leave.
He got out of bed like an old man.
She felt confused herself, but her silence surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They almost didn't know each other.
She looked at how it goes - like if she looked at him from the window in the mirror - the man who touched what he had done.
Adam left the garden, thinking.
Her heart was broken because of him and for all the men in general, regardless of how many of them broke her.
The man turned his back on her, the shoulder of a refined, crushed, crushed, all battle - why did she seem to know this view well, even though she couldn't afford the only moment until today that she'd ever seen it?
Ailinn, Solomon's himself, looked at his legs.
Nearly twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and advanced twelve-year study at Offnow, a non-statutory monitoring system of the Public Administration, prepared a short article on the continuation of light and medium-term violent acts in the areas of the country where its balance or direct suspension is expected, most expected if there were cash and energy supplies to be placed on its disposal.
"It has done a lot and has to do it a lot more," she wrote, "to calm down the angry people who have fought in many wars and most of them have won, especially in busy, difficult places in the countries, where even through the cracks of church castles that appeared on the live plants of human kindness, historically revealed only a scratch."
However, some things are unsatisfied.
It might seem that the higher the church wall, the lower the pudses.
Citizens rise above sentimental ballasts, complain of unhappy experiences and proclaim that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that in rural areas old brutality is as strong as in urban agglomerations, but evidence also shows that home, at work, driving and even at sports crime shows new and violent intolerance.
"I'm sorry you have a tendency to be too vegetarian," she pointed out.
I'd like you to read less novels.
We're Nussbaum's head off.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
"I think I don't have to answer," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
We have renewed our right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
Keep it quiet.
"I don't ask for that," Rabbinowitz finally said, "that I would have something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We don't have a premise on this job.
We serve unpretentious companies.
But a certain kind of feeling that is simply friendly and praiseworthy can sometimes express judgment as you did.
Obviously you are themselves presumably opposed to the church - things that you call "hard" and "brutal" could also be interpreted as expressions of natural strength and energy.
Keep working out the CO STALO, KYBYBY STALO, as if it happened if it happened yesterday, preparing the country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
His head on the bright pink table looked at the recommendation that Offnow sent to the world in the last quarter or more.
Sing to your neighbor, sing about your partner, listen to the ballasts, go to the music, use your phone, talk, explain, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than hiding, singing is better than writing, but there is nothing better than love.
"I just understand your rewards," replied Esme Nussbaum’s silence when she was sure that her head was over, "and I no longer claim that the wound didn’t disappear as we thought it was.
My main concern is that if we are not previously warned about this, we repeat the same mistake that led to CO SE STALO, KDYBYBY TO STALO.
But this time, we're not going to vent on the rest of us.
Luther Rabinowitz put together the ends of his fingers.
It should have meant endless patience.
"You live too far," he said, "if the steps that may have taken and may not have done your ancestors, you describe them as mistakes.
You're far too far away to talk about the ventilating of your "debt" and "incredulity" on the "other."
I should not remind anyone at your place that in understanding the past and in protecting our presence, we are not talking about "we" and "they."
There was no "we" and there was no "they."
All we know is that it's about Chaotic times.
"During those who, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme mustered up courage, "we are no innocent people.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, it happened.
That was before.
That's not what we're going to do - we agree in this together.
And just as there is no wine that would be given to someone, there are no things that should be made, even if the arrangement was appropriate and possible.
But what is the past that we may learn from it?
There's a pardon to forget about her.
If I can add something to it--
Luther Rabinowitz broke the end of his fingers.
"Your message will be taken into account," he said and abandoned her.
The day after she went to work as usual, she found a motorcycle driver who hired a driver in a way that the coroner described as “brotherly and harsh."
The deal's happening.
The Army of the Lesoth Kingdom claims that no bullet is planned - the president of the government remains in South Africa
The military officials of the Lesoth kingdom announced that they would organize a gun for government interference and claim that they were opposing the police suspected of attempting to arms up political fanatics.
The president of the government, Thomas Thabane, fled the country and said that the army had broken his official seat and had a government building in the capital city of Maser.
After reporting that he was threatened with death, the prime minister took his family to the neighboring South African Republic.
The spokesman's army, Major Ntle Ntoi, said that there was actually no conflict, but the response of the army to the “political fanatics” wave that the police were trying to fire.
"Today, this morning, the driving of the defence components of the Kingdom of Lesotho, was followed by several reports from information services that a number of groups are being deployed in police departments, which are planning to equip certain radical, political fanatics who are trying to make themselves available in the country of refuge," said the Voice of America.
Speaking South African government Clayson Monyela said military actions seemed like an attempt to undermine the government.
"Since no one has reported that the government has been seized with the aid of force, it has been said that the actions of the Lesothian defence components are not a sign of the state's return," he said.
The military representatives of the Lesoth kingdom said that the soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday, and the city was quiet.
During Thaban's absence, the Deputy Prime Minister will be responsible for Mothetjoa Metsing.
Thabane stated that, according to his view, the attack is an ongoing attack because of my efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane has stopped sitting in Parliament for internal disputes, it has been in Lesotho.
He declared that despite the wrong claim, he would not be covered by his government.
The product in the euro area is at a minimum of three months
The growth of the product was reduced at a minimum of thirty-monthly.
The final index of purchase managers in the euro area (PMI) from the June 51.8 clauses in August to 50.7.
The number is greater than 50 means expansion.
New orders have been passed and industry has damaged increasing tensions between the EU and Russia due to Ukraine.
The figures are from the fourth meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets will want a clear plan from the banks to deal with remote euro area treatment and the threat of inflation by 0.3 %.
The speculation was expressed that the ECB director Mario Draghi may have indicated this week that he considers the quantitative release of the euro area, similar to what the United Kingdom and the United States had experienced during the financial crisis.
"Because at least some growth is better than no growth, the rapid effect which has a growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty on the producer is still more visible," said Rob Dobson, the main market economy.
Germany's manufacturing PMI, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to a minimum of 51,4 per month.
In the second largest economy in the area, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
You know, you're worried about France, Italy's gone from expansion to stagnation.
The signs of the collapse of the driving force in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands are also not too comforting," Dobson said.
The decline in industry is likely to add oil to the fire to analysts who are expected to implement other exchange or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI grew to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, head of the IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing about the product review of purchase managers for the Serbian is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
Add: Producers in the euro area have a very complex life at present because increasing geopolitical tension - especially between Russia and Ukraine - adds still more uncertainty in many countries.
This growing uncertainty of trade has been demonstrated - and in particular consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be rejected or even cancelled, especially the cost.
He pointed out that as "more likely" it is that the ECB will eventually have to carry out some form of quantitative release, "although we expect it to be limited."
Ten years of Hell for survivors from Beslana: Ten years since the game with the school in which the children are still suffering
Ten years ago, the Czech radicals at school in Beslan in southern Russia were held as a handcuff for thousands of people
During the three-day period of torture that shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of whom were children
We went back to Beslan to look for some of the victims who died at the school's zoo.
Just ten years after the terrible concentration of the school in Beslan, where 334 people, including 186 children, were killed, were protected by survivors of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When, on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, they attacked and murdered fanatical terrorist children and parents, it looked like the deepest bottom of hell.
The resistance to the tragedy combined the east and west, which led to the destruction and the future of this disaster.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to look for some of the victims who died during the school environment.
We have found wonderful young people who have experienced misfortunes, even though the memory of the terrible terrorist in them will continue to live.
What is their greatest wish?
That the war that is now destroying Ukraine - and that children like them - is already over.
Girl trying to get back to the destroyed school gym
She was caught by the former Russian photographer Dimitria Beliakov, as she only tries to get back into the bombed school cell after the bomb exploded in her.
The suspect Aida was hoping to find her mother, Larsu, who is now fourteen.
They were worried that both of them were dead, but they actually survived.
"Some woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn't," said Aida.
I had legs from blood.
I got up and went back to find my mom.
She was saved by a soldier.
After several operations, she thought she was completely cured, but yesterday she said: “Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to do another operation.
My knees are stuck in my knees.
Her goal is to be a dentist so that she can help people like doctors helped her.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but it has definitely not destroyed him," she said determinedly.
"It just happened to me and it won't change.
Once a year, I go to the zoo to remind myself of those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we're trying not to talk to our friends about it.
This disease is very serious.
My best friend and future partner of George Gappe's class were killed there.
As little as we played together and we imagined how we would go to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I finish school and start a career.
I'll think about my family later.
She says she didn't forget about the engagement, but her memories are kind of green every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my photo on the Internet, like a school window, I say that many people will see it first, understand the disaster and stop it from coming back.
A boy who ran away from the rain and believed his mother was dead.
It was his first day of school (in Russia children start school in seven years) and survived the school's graduation in the presence of his mother Tamary.
At the time, a seven - year - old said: “My mother told me that if an explosion occurred, I would lie down and hold her by the hand.
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, "Get out of here."
He was afraid that he was dead, ran away, saw the payoffs, fell into the arm, and ran away from the windmill.
His father, Vladimir, who got him outside, said, "Damir told me his mother is dead."
She says, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara sought freedom and was in the hospital with her injured leg and thought that her son had died.
After meeting again, she said: “I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He came in and killed me.
Damir then flew to London, where he was then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, were declared victorious by Bernardo's Children.
"This horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can say that memories are getting cold.
I remember right after that, I took all my guns to play.
But today I can play computer games that shoots, and I don't have a problem with that.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the body, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the kids I played in the yard with and they didn't get out.
We'll never say they killed her or died.
We say they stayed in the body.
On a trip to London, I remember well, especially how I could choose anything I wanted and how I ate with a cabriot.
But now he's worried about a place like Ukraine where war is suffering as much as he and his friends did.
This mess gets back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
"I am very sorry for anyone who has to go through such a horror," says Damir, who participated in volunteer activities in the monastery last week.
I want to be very helpful.
I want to work with the police once and I hope that next year they'll take me to the academy.
His mother, Tamara, 48, says: “If 37 children were killed in our neighborhood, would you imagine?
I remember that quiet right after the attack, and there were no children who would scream and run here, and that took months.
Life reminds you of the road with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people were crying.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her commitment to the award and the possibility of going south to London in 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and tell myself that even though it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember how Damir had a taste for the bottle, and they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember how he played with the readers in the restaurant, Damir shot them out of the water gun and they ran and played with him.
And it was only a month from the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain with us and how they supported us.
She says: “I still think the world has not changed for the better in ten years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think it's gonna be and it'll still kill a lot of children.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think for many people, war is just something in the news that they hear when they offer or while they do something else.
I know what these people live for. What's so horrible.
I'm still feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people always want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir grew up and he's nice and quiet, he's not aggressive or nervous at all.
For example, he doesn't care about the place, he doesn't care.
I know he doesn't like to mention it, but he's got a lot closer to six employees, and from time to time, he's going to the gym and burning candles there.
When he was younger, he had problems with that, and I remember how he used to sleep on the couch with a face turned off from us, and sometimes he was like that.
He didn't sleep. He had eyes open.
I also remember that he fired all his guns or other weapons to play. Damir's 17th is higher than I, nice, smart and healthy.
I can't believe I've been dead for a few hours and I'll never see him again.
When I woke up after the explosion and stood on my feet, I looked around and saw that hell, there were human bodies lying around.
I was pretty sure my boyfriend didn't have a chance to survive this shit.
“I remember calling ‘Damire, run, run!’, but I was convinced that he didn’t hear me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our life is different from that of others.
Greek Ilyn, 17
A boy whose photo was taken after the attack became a symbol of the game in Beslan
Relief: He survived Beslan Grigory Ilyin with his mother Fatim after an attack in 2004, today's Grigory device
When he escaped from life after the Czech terrorist shot his colleagues, he was terrified of a bloody face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of the beast in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, took him to school the first day and rushed to take his older son Vladimir to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists entered the door, so my boy stayed there for three days," she recalled.
Not entirely because we had friends there, but everyone died there.
He only survived my Grigory.
As the date approaches, it's still harder to think and talk about it.
Neuplyn's not even one day so we don't remember this tragedy.
It doesn't seem to us that it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments are coming back.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Still returning memories: Photo Grigorija (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was celebrated as salt (right)
I remember how Grigory enjoyed school that day, saying he wanted to include his teacher.
That he's alive, I learned when I saw him on TV.
In San Marino, there's even the salt of Grigory's crying.
Grigory looks at the picture and we have her hidden in the library.
I understand that, but I also think that because of this picture, people all over the world know what pain we feel.
Today, Grigory says: “It is important not to repeat this.
"I doubt we'll ever learn the truth.
Similar tragedies continue to be investigated, but no one will ever find out the truth.
Now they're investigating the threat of war in Ukraine.
Do we ever find out what the cause was?
This world is waiting for something very bad.
"I don't understand why this is happening because when people ask you, no one wants war as much as it is possible?
Ten years is nothing for such a disease.
It takes ten years for us to forget.
It had an effect on my health, I still feel it.
For three or four years, I had a nightmare attack, but then it got better.
Then, when I returned to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I was thinking of my friends and colleagues who were killed.
So when it's close to September 1st, I'm going to the gym.
I want to learn the memory of a childhood friend.
It's hard for me to get into that body, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is a past.
I don't forget that, but I don't complain.
My life goes on.
This year I graduated from school and began to study medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a heart surgeon.
I wanted to go into the army first.
I wanted to be a soldier, but because of my health, I couldn't.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't work.
Gorgory Farniyev, 20
A boy who survived, despite being held in the arms of a killer terrorist
Surprising: Gregory Farniyev was held in the hands of a murderer terrorist during an attack, yet he was able to survive
When the attack was in full progress, he was caught in a prison cell as he sat next to the bomb in the mouth of a killer terrorist.
It's a real surprise he survived.
"It seems to us as if it were yesterday," said Gregory, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service, but because of the injuries he suffered during the attack, he could not.
It's still with me, it's not something I've been holding my head.
Now I'm older and it's said that kids can handle bad experiences better - I have to say it's not true.
"In 2006, I went to psychologists and was a little better, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - then - this was the first and last time I came into the body again.
I was thinking.
I'll never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I'm sitting on that well-known picture.
Survivors: Gregory Farniev today, on the notebook with his photo taken in the hospital after the attack
This disease is huge and they don't have it with them every day.
Friends know I don't like thinking about it or talking about it, and they never ask me at school.
As far as physical health is concerned, I'm fine.
I have to be careful about my knee, which I've been on for a while, but I'm walking normally.
But I couldn't get up and study at the FBS Academy in Petrohrad as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and I answered that it was not possible.
My next favorites are animals, so I'm on the vet.
I've been there for another year.
It teaches how to treat all animals from “the dog after the dog”.
He said: “I know that I will never tell my children about it.
It's not something that kids should know about and not anything they should do anymore.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: “The pain is still here.
He's inside and he's messing with the next year.
I'm participating in memorial ceremonies.
I know Grigory's not coming.
It must have been even stronger for him because he was different from me.
I was waiting for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful that he brought it back to me.
It stays with us.
Gregory's grown up today, but he's still here.
It's hard to accept if something so terrible happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's been under a couple of operations, he can walk, but he can't dance.
I'd say 50 percent has overcome the fear, but to overcome it completely and not forget it.
This terrible experience with us will continue.
During the attack, many of our friends and neighbors were killed, and this only makes the pain worse.
I lost a lot of people I loved and those who were close to me.
My son is with me, and it's the greatest gift God could give me, but it hurts the loss of my life.
I know families in which other children were born, but also widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how little my heart jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I see what's going on in the world -- wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The train is now approaching our country, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we were one friendly country, so how did we get to fight together now?
People and children are suffering, I'm sure many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If we could get all those rebels together and get rid of them - how he didn't get it going.
Allyona Tskaeva, 10
A child brought to safety by a special command
Saved: Allyon Tskaev leads to a secure Russian special command (left).
Now she's ten (right) and she doesn't even remember the tragedy
In 2004, the world was sinking to the ground when a small Allyon came out of the Russian police station.
The terrorists abandoned her, however, in the school exercise, leaving her thirty-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Kristin and brother Makhara.
Makhar, who was three years old at the time, was single, Alyonina's mother and sister died at the time of the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan was remarried, and his new wife, Lightlan, had a daughter whom they named Kristina after her dead daughter.
The neighbors say that Alyona, who is now ten, has never remembered the attack and has grown up with her as a strong and happy girl.
A close friend said that "it's a great happy family and Alyon and Makhar are great children."
Ruslan is a wonderful father and wants to keep the children away from the memory that he has remembered for ten years.
You can understand why.

4 types, how to manage better photos and videos under water
If you are interested in focusing or putting under water, you have a great choice of equipment.
The best option is a compact such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an output camera type GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which is about $300.
I've arranged these photos for a family celebration of a few photographers, all of them stood at less than $350.
It's one of the equipment you use, but there are several rules to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the batteries and other parts are closed.
Next set up the camera according to which type of photo or video you will list.
Some cameras and video cameras have a scenario or a tracking mode that optimizes the exposure to the dark environment under the water.
And before you get into it, you'll find out how deep you can get on with your equipment.
Some cameras are only assigned to 5 degrees, other to 50 to 60 degrees.
Read our guide with purchase and evaluation of digital cameras in normal and waterproof executions.
Always make a few photos - a lot of them won't come out.
The compact photo devices have LCDs that can help you with composite photos, but the outsiders don't have it.
Even if you have LCDs, it's going to look bad under the water and the closure composition will be invisible.
So always make more photos.
If you have a camera with a bursting mode that makes a series of photos with a slightly different range of exposure, use it.
Stay close to the cold.
With a deeper shadow of light, he's clearly dying.
If possible, stay in the swimming pool, lake or sea near the cold.
It will also allow you to capture more light on the photos - the deeper you fall, the less color you will see.
Get close to the photographed object.
This is an excellent advice if you take photos of the dust, but under water is even more important because of the darker light.
This is especially important if you are connected to the external camera: Such devices usually have a strong and wide range of screens, which means that if you want to fill the camera, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose personality power was able to change things even in a huge organization like NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he opened his career to relieve the patient of the disease caused by disability and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was the officer MI6, who had to live with the consequences of the torture that had tortured him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focus on diagnosis and disability, patients treated in the wood most are completely interested in something else: disease.
One day in 2007, however, it was the one who began to suffer.
"I don't feel in my skin," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt like I had no energy.
He suffered from symptoms of seizures and found that he was impatient and his wife, Juliet, was involved in the seizures.
He said, "I want you to do it before you do it later."
When Juliet went on a week's journey, Lawson was unusual and unexplained.
Something wasn't right.
His colleague made the X-ray.
He was lying in the French Alps two weeks ago.
The results of the X-ray came.
He had a mesothel, an unrecognizable tumor that reaches the backbones or if the blast of the lungs.
In most cancers, it is difficult to determine what caused them.
Although some smokers will get cancer of the lung, not all patients with cancer of the lung burned.
Mesotellium is different.
In all cases, it is the cause of exposure to asbestos - a building material that was previously marked as “extraordinary”, but today it is known that it is deadly dangerous.
For most of us, it wasn't hard to ignore.
Azbest, the end, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since it entered into force since the ban on the use of asbestos in the industry.
Even when asbestos was used, only certain groups of people, such as insulators, buildings, Tesserians and workers, came into contact with it.
Toxin used in the industry in another era is difficult today as a reason for concern.
That's kind of selfish, but it's not on the spot.
As you can see, in Britain today the mesotellium epidemic is rising.
The number of deaths on mesotel is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths in this disease are twice a year more than the number of car accidents.
Number of deaths due to mesotellium per year since 1980 and estimated death in the future in Great Britain
The reason why we feel its effects right now, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all kinds of asbestos have been banned by the law in 1999) is that it usually lasts for several decades before the mesotheles develop.
The mass in the form of mesothelium is not only the veterans of the construction industry.
Azbest was, and in many cases he's still present in the homes we live in, in the offices where we work, in schools where we learn, and in the shops we buy.
Thus, it does not respect social class, wealth, calling or age.
Privileged farms from London’s business homes after public school do not reveal their secrets.
And Parliament is full of asbestos.
Even patients who should treat us are responsible for this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even believe in isolation.
He was trying to find out where he could get in touch with asbestos.
Then he came for it.
"It is possible that there was a lot of asbestos in Guy's Hospital's sidewalks, where I spent six years in practice," he wrote.
All - students, sisters, doctors and door - walkers used.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease?
Unfortunately, this was a question he could answer in part.
"Of the four doctors who were in practice at Guy's Hospital and who have been exposed to mesothelitis in the last five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I am the only person who is still alive."
How many of us are sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothel when he was 48.
When he died on 17th of this year, he was 55.
Living with this diagnosis is not normal for so long.
55% of people diagnosed with mesotellium die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always deadly.
Now we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us are sick with the same disease? ”
According to former British experts at Professor Julian Peta's Mesothelel, the best idea is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic is taking place in Britain, about 90,000 people will die.
Most of them at present have no idea that they will die this way.
Azbesto's farm in Quebec, Canada
A regular look at the records from the archives of the courts, on which the findings are often referred and require a balance, shows how much the mesothelytic group has expanded.
For example, the company Marks & Spencer acknowledged that she had been exposed to Janice Allen's asbestos from the accident.
She worked for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she looked at two sales in the clothing section - one of the places was a train ship, a trade on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18, when M&S started working.
Today he has two children over twenty.
"Before it happened," she says, "I've never heard of a mesothellium before, I barely knew anything about asbestos.
I've never felt in my dreams that I might have something to do with it.
There's not much people who know about asbestos.
Actually, there's no asbestos one substance, but a group of six minerals.
His name was given thanks to his fibrosis structure, which gives him strength and courage.
Three of the six miners were used in the building.
Most often today, he has been found in buildings where he can find a crystal, usually known as a white azbez.
It has been used in wind panels, floor panels, balleric pressure and even in the air conditioning.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, the EU and WHO still consider it a "high health risk" that can cause death.
It's more dangerous, but it's hot asbesty and blue asbeest (crokydolite).
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of hot asbestos and experts said that “there is convincing but unbiased evidence that this was the main cause of an unusual high demand for mesothelium [in the United Kingdom]."
The employee Mark & Spencer was presented in a train sale in Oxford Street in London.
Janice Allen may not be considered a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Juliana Peta's work indicates that her story is not unusual at all.
His study of patients claims that “the most significant part of the cases of mesothelium without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home was probably caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment.”
A significant part of this exposure is due to the "normal use and disposal" of buildings.
Looks like no one can be sure he's safe.
The report of Goddard Consulting, which was studied by the Westminster Palace, shows that even people in the government don't have to know that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report that states that the official discharges and attempts at the parliamentary committee's premises are contaminated by asbestos, which the deadly train could be damaged by something as harmless as "a severe air flow."
Ministers are often accused of seeking only their own interests, but in this case it can be true.
Despite the fact that the Parliament's Service Board has maintained that the Westminster Palace has received a "good medical certificate", it is now estimated that it will require a million free and several years of work to be thoroughly monitored, updated and removed by Parliament, and that after the 2015 elections, the Members will sit in the Conference Centre of King Algebét II more than on green grapes in Westminster.
According to the report of Goddardu, "the privacy of asbestos is not in accordance with some regulations."
It's not possible to say if this disagreement will take place.
Everyone can just wait now.
One of the people who had never been able to determine when they came to the exposure of asbestos was Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) suspects that he was exposed to asbestos at work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where the presence of asbestos was demonstrated," he says, "but in my case I cannot prove it.
It's hard to remember all the places where he worked and when he worked there.
Of course, she remembers the day of the beginning of December 2009, when she got something like a winter.
He was 45, he was at night, and he was in the middle of surgery.
I suddenly broke up.
It's come back.
It was terrible.
I thought I wouldn't get a car home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew that the pain was coming from the backyard, the blast around the lungs.
But just like Janice Allen, he had no reason to think he was talking about mesothell.
He's been home for a month.
The suspect doctors made him a kidney Xerxes and introduced him to the brain catheter to remove the fluid that they sent to the discussion.
They still didn't have a diagnosis.
His attitude gradually improved and he returned to work.
From time to time, however, his symptoms returned, often after what he had grown up and died.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients with similar symptoms came to the operating room and subsequently was diagnosed with mesothelitis.
Even then, however, Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older, and he got in direct contact with asbestos at work.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again and his doctor consulted his CT photo and X-ray with the expertise panel.
In December 2011, just two years after Abbott began to feel bad, he had a probe equipped with a camera.
I'm optimistic.
I have a tendency to hate anything too much," she says.
To be honest, I didn't care much about it.
But Rachel, my wife, took care of her.
The results of the biopsy reached between Christmas and New Year: “They told me that it was mesotellel."
Graham Abbott: Diagnostic with mesotellium
Abbott started dating sisters from Macmillan's charity organization, and one advised him to contact the lawyer.
Now you've realized the extent of the epidemic.
"It has been shown that asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos heat in the hole," he says.
In the people who were exposed to these buildings, disease now begins to develop.
The mesotellium is now becoming the focus of younger people who have no risk of calling.
Therefore, the most dangerous tumors that were heat-insulated with asbestos were found in the patients in the suterene, and it was unlikely that patients would be threatened.
All members of the staff who were passing by sidewalks (such as Andrew Lawson) or who ate in side meals (as often as Graham Abbott) certainly came in contact with toxic substances.
As is now shown, several decades after the war of the hospital were a place where patients could save their lives, but also a place that could endanger the lives of doctors who treated them.
Azbest is getting rid of it today.
Bunsen's cage has been built on asbestos floor
And it's not just about the hospital.
Azbest was often used in offices, shops, libraries and workshops because of its excellent isolation and non-healing properties.
In schools, too.
In fact, a lot of people were already exposed to asbestos at school.
Sometime in uncountable hours, the students put Bunsen's couch on an asbeticted floor.
The websites that deal with the question of asbestos in schools have come up.
Any such harmful things as floor floor coverings or ceilings on the device in our homes have often contained asbestos.
"It's about industrial food built into a large number of homes," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his complaint against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact with asbestos that a woman suffered from mesothelium was in the 1970s when fighting a garden home.
So be careful how you fight the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is untreated, the impact of diagnosis is enormous.
"It takes a while before it comes to you," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to go and settle down with myself.
Well, I don't get any more friends.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the doctor's position to the patient's position.
As an uncountable number of patients before him, he remembers how he felt confused with the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand everything," she says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How long does it take for me?’
I was told twelve months.
I remember saying: “Well, I don’t get any more friends.
That's right."
Mezotelium is especially destructive because the only mechanism of what keeps us alive - breathing itself - is what causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelium are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Azbeth creates a small train.
If the azobetics are damaged and the train is breathing, they can be placed in the backyard, the blast of the lungs.
Azbesto's hairdryer's tail and can cause mutating of the bowel.
"The problem is that an abscessive train in the form of a rifle," explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiochirg who arrived in 2001 at Guy's Hospital.
In the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos, which is a paradoxical center for mesotellium treatment.
Treasure Lawson knows and has been treated by other patients who have been exposed to asbestos during practice in the hospital.
Azobetics get into the dark clouds, says Treasure, and “a single breath is pressed on the side where the exposure is located.
His attitude is invasive from the very beginning.
The usual treatment options used in other types of cancer do not take so much on mesothelel.
For example, there is a debate on the effectiveness of the operation.
According to some, she'd be trying.
Treasure does not agree.
"You can't remove the trash," she says.
You don't have enough shoes.
The vaccine ‘pregnantly does not respond to chemotherapy’, which means ‘has any effect’ but does not cure.
“There will always be someone who survives cancer,” says Treasure.
But eventually everyone will die.
Unfortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After finding out the mesotellium, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual supporter and consultant for the same people.
When they called, he said, "Good day, you're welcome to the center of the cancer."
"It was very positive," says Abbott.
He was diagnosed with a disease four years ago and was still very active.
At the beginning of Abbotto, six cycles of chemotherapy were offered that would last for four months and probably only one month.
"I was confident," she says.
I wanted to give it up.
Lawson, however, "has been able to show things in a more optimistic light."
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski from the heart surgery department in Guy's Hospital.
"I was lucky I didn't wait until I was sent to him, but I just called there and they looked at me," admits Graham.
A normal patient would have to get a claim and they would have to accept his reward.
In order to get the best treatment available, money is key for patients with mesothelioma.
But when various treatments are finally inevitable, many patients are headed by another financial age - about the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they turn to the courts and want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan with Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"As early as 1898, asbestos was known to be harmful to health," says Morgan.
In the 1960s, however, it was found that even a very small amount of it could pose a health risk.
And here we're meeting with a company that doesn't care.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually recovered, but Morgan said it wasn't "complete balance", because Lawson could not definitively prove that mesothellians were the result of the exposure of asbestos in Guy's Hospital.
However, after an investigation of the case, speaking Guy's Hospital confirmed that "freedom was removed in the criminalised subsidiary in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
The exposure of deadly asbestos to one company or place of work - usually ten years after what happened - has been shown to patients with mesothelio who have been struggling to compensate.
Many former workplaces have changed their owners or have collapsed.
The record has disappeared.
And those who are now charged with defense have their time on their side, which is certainly not their petitioners.
In response to this, a new legislation was adopted this year, which makes it easier for patients with mesotellium to resolve, even if it is not possible to control their former employees.
The Law has created a 350 million financial reserve, which builds insurance and is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove that they have been exposed to asbestos, but have no one to complain.
In such a case, 80 % of the amounts that would normally be added to the court would be equal to about 120 000 pounds.
Each year 300 successful applications are expected.
Andrew Morgan, like patients with mesothelytics, thinks 350 million pounds is "good work".
"It is an agreement signed with insurance insurance," she says and indicates that the sum is the fourth of what insurance policy would have to be paid if it did not involve time and people with mesothelium would be able to monitor existing employees and in a normal way appeal to them.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law "had mercenaries."
But Penning and Morgan admit that, given the seven deaths each year, there was a need for quick consultation.
"People are too patient and they need help now," said Penning in December last year during the second reading of the law on mesothelium.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After the initial consultations, Lang-Lazdun's surgery was recommended, which he, unlike Tom Treasura, thought had a positive effect.
After surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy were followed - a three-fold treatment in which Lang-Lazdunski can be breast-feeding for up to 40% of patients.
Abbotta made it happen.
"Of course this is not the most important thing," says Abbott.
You're still seeing it in patients.
There's something moving you.
If you give up, your attitude can get worse quickly.
Graham Abbott undertook an operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
The controls did not show any signs of weakness.
I went to the next check in March [2014].
In the chest I had a couple of broken ribs.
My fifteenth birthdays were just getting closer.
It doesn't endanger life.
Take it.
Abbott re-entered six cycles of chemotherapy.
At the present time, there are no stages of recovery in his body.
But it's a physical and emotional draining process.
You have to think about practical things - about financial insurance when I die, or about showing a woman how the building works.
When you learn the bad news, you start to be negative.
You have to look forward.
As for Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14) it's not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," she says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my attitude meant that I would never be old.
Their reactions were different.
There's a lot of social and wildness in there.
She told her friends and we started calling a lot of people at once.
Ellie was more stable.
She didn't say much.
All patients with cancer must face such conversations.
In patients with mesothelium but such discussions are not hopeless or only a sign of the chance to survive.
The disease brings itself (and in the end it brings Stephen Jay Gold) unpleasant security.

China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leadership - demonstrators promise instead
The Chinese Parliament, despite much debate on democratic reform on Sunday, decided not to allow voters in Hong Kong to appoint candidates for elections in 2017.
It is likely that this step will lead to long-standing protests in Hong Kong's trading district, as activists began to organize and only a few hours after this announcement.
The Chinese People's Congress is essentially allowing communist leaders to organize any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"It didn't surprise us, but it upsets us," said legislator Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People in Hong Kong lied.
And it's clear that we have something to do with the authoritarian regime.
In defense of the Chinese decision, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of Li Fei said that making public nominations in Hong Kong elections would make the "chaos".
Since 1997, when Britain has returned China to Hong Kong, Beijing promises that as of 2017, citizens will be able to vote in executive power.
The Chinese leaders presented Sunday decisions as a democratic role because Hong Kong allows direct voting, but also makes it clear that the Chinese leaders are firmly in the process of appointing the committee, which is closely controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and Hong Kong" will be eligible.
The decision came after the summer months, which recorded one of the largest and most followed-up protests in Hong Kong in a few years.
For most of the pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong, the occupation of the Central is marked by love and peace, which the organizers threatened with closing the financial quarter if Beijing does not grant them a general voting right.
On Sunday night, just a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of harvesters gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong government headquarters.
The organizers announced that their attacks would enter the new phase of civil disobedience and that protests would begin in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, obviously wanting to avoid problems with the authorities.
In their online release, organizers said that the strike “considered the Centre’s occupation only as a last step in the event that all dialogue options were exhausted and no other vote would be won.
We need to be aware by policy that today all the possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and the central containment is inevitable.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcements all day long and have strengthened the protection of government seats and have placed police and baricades on Sunday.
In many Hong Kong residents, the earthquake is a sign of a slow loss of control over the city.
The presence of strong people increases competition in the field of products and services.
I am also concerned that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are rising pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticise the occupation of the Central and say that their demonstrations threaten trade - a rescue member of Hong Kong.
"The protest he is talking about could cause much more economic damage according to how many people are involved and how long," says political Regina Ip, who is critical of the long term.
We don't want the fear of Hong Kong getting out of control.
Such a perception could damage investment.
China's state media also came in the last few days with reports that democratic activists in Hong Kong say they are undercover.
In the summer, the informal referendum on voting rights was organised by 780,000 participants - more than five voters in Hong Kong.
And in July tens of thousands of people participated in one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the area.
A double act?
The League in Jihlava bears the name according to the political thread
The small group plays in the country city of Exocini about 1,600 amateur athletes.
And their highest competition is a new name for the Jilah League.
The name was given according to one angle that goes into the regular municipal elections.
The tenth of his candidates is also the head of the small crown in Jihlav Jan Márka.
"It was a holy assembly where there was no problem with that," said Mark.
In the context of the first League of Small Capsules, the lawmakers of the Jihlav Republic had already been removed and recommended to change the system of distribution of applications.
The little bastard got a lot on the city's website about a million kroner.
And this year it's about a percentage of hundreds of thousands.
According to the legal opinion, there is no procedure for a small copy in dispute with the law or the directive of the Magistrate.
However, the situation is for the Authority to fix the rules for awarding grants and grants," said the speech teacher Radek Tulis.
Cut off the donation from the city and at the same time express as a small cup of support in the elections of one political party, that is probably not going to happen anymore.
A similar policy requirement has not yet come to the high-level "great" football.
That the ČSSD national audit, ODS division or KDU-CHSL 1.
What about class and similar competitions?
I wouldn't be for it.
On the contrary, I would like to be approached by sponsors from a number of companies," said the president of the national football club Miroslav Vráček.
The head of the small football team on the other side and the ring on the name of the league will not be allowed
According to the players, this sport in Jihlava would deserve its own space with six chairs, chairs and social equipment.
"For example, on Stupach is not ours, we're in the rent," warned Ondréj Lapeš from Starlet Jihlava club.
The most suitable location would be Czech mileage.
But there will be, for example, a mindless space for skiers that are about to fall in Jihlwa," Márka warned.
The prime minister of Jihlav Vymazal (ODS) responded that a small bastard uses a garden with an artificial grass in the streets of Rosiché and Na Stoupach, which are owned by the city.
We want to build a place like this that has maximum benefits.
We're trying to modernise or build a gym in schools that will be available in the afternoons.
I think he's made huge progress in recent years for the little bastard," he added.
Other political parties in the names of the lie will not appear according to Jan Dark.
We have limitations.
If someone from the same class enters our partnership, we will no longer give one to another," he explained.
"The political momentum in the name of the League, I consider it to be at least an unfortunate step," said a member of the Advisory Commission for Sport Karel Voldán.
"But please consider whether Mr. Mrák is using a small village of Jihlav and the supply of cities for political purposes, or not," he added.
American tradition leads to university life - the first can be seen by a train
We are pleased that we can respond to the request by submitting the first luxury travel services for students in Britain.
For the purpose of leaving the best income at the university, the company also offers the possibility of transporting a private printer or a Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 vehicle.
Stewart also announced that the service has its own security site.
Service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to pull their things across the whole state in a dangerous car.
We are pleased that with our VIF (very important hairdresser - very important first) options for students this year, we will ensure that the university comes with minimal nervousness and maximum luxus.
In view of the fact that the services were first released, the company said that there was no reservation, but he added: “The students will start making reservations within a few weeks. ”
The company also indicated that although students pay an annual school fee of 9,000 pounds, it is expected that the service will find their place on the market.
In comparison with students before ten, twenty, thirty or four years ago, students are different today, as regards expectations and expectations - it is more important than ever to do the right first lesson and the VIF programme is exactly the appropriate way to achieve it.
The National Union of Students, however, criticized the service as a failure.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Union for Higher Education, noted: “For most students, such a project is impossible.
Many students who attend university this month have to face thousands of pounds of something as simple as getting on the road, to deal with the financial crisis, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot take steps at the cost of basic needs.
Women's against racism and police behaviour after the events in Ferguson
At the beginning of the month, a police officer in Ferguson killed an unarmed young man in Missouri.
A fellow waiting for the funeral with his hands on the roof is crying out: “Hands up, don't shoot!”
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson in Missouri due to the shoot of unarmed young Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Peréz's arrest in online discussions with white women.
She found that when it comes to the exercise of reproductive rights and equality of income, white feminists promote sex before race.
With increasing pressure on the Middle West, which attracted the attention of the national press, Perés noted that the reaction of the whites was focused on race by 100 %.
In comparison with the blacks soon after the shooting of 9 August, personal articles with inscriptions such as “the idea of a protein over Ferguson” or “Feminismus is not only about women's harassment” appeared relatively late.
According to Perez, this is an important change.
"I don't think there are too many people in feminist fervor who would talk about race and excellence at such a level," she said.
People felt that what happened had to be expressed.
For the crisis we are facing, it is characteristic, because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially protected that they have to pay attention to it.
According to English professors at the State University in Ohio Korthy Mitchell, Ferguson brought about problems that the Africans must face every day and that are not considered to be "female questions" in the cultural sphere.
"I can publish funny stories on Facebook with my partner and get 150 people from all over the world," Mitchell said.
When I write something about the color in my own country, it's quiet listening.
"How is it possible that a woman can talk publicly about matters, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For such black people as Mitchell, who were concerned about race, sex and sexuality in American history, there are no racial issues and no dichotomy.
Black people said they couldn't get to Luxus because of these problems: they live every day in this mixed reality.
Despite today's white questions of race and sex in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, professor of female questions and gendarmeral studies at George Mason University, says they did the same.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 blacks were sealed and the reason was almost in all cases the violence of whites," Hattery said.
You need to work with white people to reason on the link.
According to Hattery's speech between whites and blacks, he came when soldiers for voluntary law like Susan B. Anthony studied at the end of the 19th century and realized that the election law could have only one group of men - women or blacks.
"They decided to insert cards on the voting rights for women and the right to blacks later," Hattery explained.
When we realize this, we gain an important view of why colorful women do not believe in whites.
We didn't get a good job.
We never helped black people protect their husbands and children.
And after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years before they started organizing an association of South Asian women to pass a divorce.
The group was born 40 years after the Blackman first said anything about help.
According to Mitchell, the reaction of white feminists to questions raised in Ferguson - the issue of police behaviour, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to "get" questions with which black people had been born.
"It wouldn't be great if activists in these spaces [traditional feminism] were to have the right to raise a child as seriously as they had the right to an anti-conception?" said Mitchell.
The second wave of feminists who have done their career fighting for reproductive rights and access to anti-conceptives now find out what that means.
Prominent feminist activists like Gloria Steinem took two weeks after Michael Browna was shot at by Facebook, where they published Rebecca Carroll's column from Guardian, who demanded that the white Americans protest more differently against racism.
"I hope that women who have different but still similar reasons for understanding the danger in society - and views on race that are clearly lacking in public opinion - will be forced to change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinemo has stopped intersessional feminism, which includes questions of race and sex, its comments on the question of race in America have been made by some gay people.
The American Enterprise Institute of Christina Sommers, author of the book “Who stole feminism?”, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men, are “more vulnerable than their sisters,” but the comments of Steinem’s side Ferguson have been critical of the criticisms that she has had in the past.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small program of My Brother's Keper, which had helped vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it caused many feminists, including Gloria Steinem's frustrated reaction.
The relationship of the police to the Black Community is not the only problem that is facing the interests of mainstream feminism.
After the United States border police held this year on the west side of the country nearly 63,000 young people without enforcement, a question arose again as a question of reform of immigration laws - this time as a woman question.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for the reform of immigration laws, said that to be a possible question as a matter of necessity for women, the only thing she had to do was to share the stories of immigrants.
"He speaks for himself," says Mercado.
In view of the fact that most employment permits are granted to men, women who come with them are considered to be vulnerable to domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have a voice in women's organizations," she said.
Living room in Ipswichi for sale
The real office removed a picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when she published it, she was resting on it in the living dog.
One-bedroom private house, which is for sale for 120 000 pounds, is on a private trip to Ipswichi.
The information photographs included a picture of the living room in which it rest with its head on a sandbag.
The real office of Connells indicated that the dog on the photo is the owner's pet.
"The photo was wrong there, and that's why it was already removed," said the spokesman of the office.
In the information about property, the real office of Connells described the former prayer as “a single single single single-room home."
Although the photo office has already removed it from its websites, propaganda material continues to appear.
The sale of the house attracted interest on social networks where some asked whether the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, Harvey's city is on the south side of a pure millionaire.
The lottery player in Harvey gets a million.
He spends his spare time on a new millionaire in South Perth, a lucky man who brings $1.1 million from his Saturday lottery.
Traffic in Harvey had already doubled over the past five years, and in November 2009, a million dollars had been won.
The pure height, but you have to sign up first.
The owner of the store Steve Forward said he's talking about the win all over the city on the south side of Perth.
It's the main theme, and they're all solutions.
We thought a similar prize was on the dock.
Eight winners in Western Australia won one prize last month, ending several happy weeks.
Last weekend the player in Canning Vale became one of five Serbian millionaires and just a few weeks ago in Belmont won an incredible $7.5 million.
The winning couple sat down for 20 years and said that the prize would allow them to process the world and buy a new house.
A million from Harvey is the only lottery winner in Western Australia this year, totalling $85 million.
The Deutsche Bahn trains won't leave tonight.
Engineers want more brains.
In the press release, the GDL identified a protest for a warning step for which he had chosen the time off the transporter.
At the time allowed, GDL rates take the view of many people who return from the weekend on the train until the first working day.
We also think of people working during the day," said the committee meeting on Monday morning in a press release for the statement of the vote.
"Our first step should involve, above all, freight transport, less travelling," added the GDL.
The DB has not yet published an official response to the statement of votes.
It is not even clear how the protest will affect international rail connections, except with Czechs.
The committees require a five-percent increase in drivers and a two-hour reduction in working hours per week.
At present, the average number of drivers is moving from 36 thousand to 46 thousand euros (998 thousand to 1.27 million kroner) annually, depending on the years worked.
Drivers in DB work 39 hours a week.
DBs refuse to join the increase in wages when working time is reduced.
They stress that the assessment of drivers must be developed in the same way as in the other railway staff in which DB is not counted at the end of the working week.
It was dangerous for Krist's car to start burning.
Proto on Barum rally ended
What exactly happened?
It was about water.
The car was completely new, so I didn't even think something like this could happen.
Was it not a waste of time to make temporary repairs and continue in less time to the service where the machines would replace it?
If we were to go right there, yeah.
But we're still waiting for two more injuries, and it didn't happen.
He's got a high fever and a high risk that the car would start burning was big.
I can't afford it.
You've been running five speed tests in full time.
What did you think of them?
Very good.
I felt like a baby.
We were fast, so I didn't go over the wind.
Everything was caused by the fact that we've been pushing more than half a year to be at some level.
The race showed us this.
You broke him up so you could really think about victory.
I made myself and the car so we really had a win.
The work didn't come out.
On the other hand, the result that we could have thought about was missing.
But it's Barumka.
I'm sorry, the technician said no.
You weren't the only one of the guys who left the war on the first time.
They've also come out of it with foreign favorites Breen, Abbring or Lappi.
Did it surprise you that so many favorites have left?
Yes.
Especially for the monsters, it was a damage because the race ended earlier.
He's been moving on the corner for a long time, and Jaromír Tarabus, whom you're going to drive.
He just paid for leaving the track and picked up about two minutes' missing.
How did you feel about his performance?
It's a shame, because he could repeat a degree of victory.
Well, he used to eat the first time.
But Mira also confirmed that we had a good car.
It's very fast.
Just a year ago, you announced the end of your career, although you appeared at the start of Barum rally.
Can you feel good about driving again to make a regular participant in the race race?
I'm sure not at this point.
Loni said Barumka was my last race, and I didn't get it anyway.
I decided I'd eat her again.
It was my late ninety-nine start, and if it's a chance again in a year, I'm probably going to go.
But I don't think about anything else.
A lot of people have been touched by the tragedy just because of you.
Did you enjoy it?
To a certain extent, we started just because of him.
A lot of people, unknown or unknown, keep asking if I eat.
I wanted to make them happy.
What's waiting for you for Barumce?
The team continues.
Next week, we'll go to Wischkov, where Robert Adolf will run.
I hope the car didn't hurt much here.
Besides, he wants to hire Fabi Honza Sykora on this race.
Miro and I are waiting for a two-way European race in Switzerland and in Corsica.
That's what we're gonna have to do next year.
Can you point something out?
No, nothing's decided.
When the Corsic race belonged to the mystery of the world, you reached your peak in the series.
Don't you want to try another road again?
Don't worry.
The oral agreement with an employee may be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not have a doctor's certificate of incapacity that serves as proof to the organisation that you cannot perform your duties for health reasons.
You didn't recognize the employees anymore.
The latter came to the agreement that the dates will be stated as permissible, but only oral.
Although the labour law does not assume the obligation to make written confirmation of the employee's consent with a cut-off permit, in practice this procedure has proved.
If it comes only to the oral agreement, you have no confirmation agreement.
Later, there may be a certain agreement with freezing allowed, as in your case, deterioration and incompatibility in the work considered to be a long-term unexplained absence, and therefore the reason for the immediate abolition of the labour ratio under § 53 of the Labour Code.
For the case of a court dispute, you have no evidence to prove it.
Work with you but has not been cancelled under § 53, you only have the dates indicated in the accounting list as an unencumbered absence.
The unaccompanied absence in the accounting list has no effect as § 53 (e.g. the inability to take a substantial unemployment insurance), although it is therefore difficult to find a new employment.
We recommend that you visit your doctor again and let you confirm in writing that you have actually arrived at the level due to which you have been incapacitated (no such thing as "unschopenk", it is only about the doctor's evidence).
When looking for a new job, you can present the above evidence and explain the situation.
In practice, it is appropriate not to assess whether a written medical certificate of disability has been issued by both the employer's notice and the applicant's request for written consent for breast-feeding.
You're dealing with such complexities.
Tony Stewart's accident on his way home
The return on track ended with Tony Stewart's only half-way bus ride at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
In 172 C.E., Stewart found himself in the field after he had been hit by a real pneumatic, and the race ended for him.
Stewart brought the destroyed car to the garage, didn't show up to the reporters and left.
The head of his team, Chad Johnston, said that the car number 14 is broken, but he will now focus on the race in Richmond, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
"I would like to have a better performance and a better conclusion," said Johnston.
We'll go to Richmond, and we'll hope we'll get more there.
Stewart found out about the first time in the Sunday night competition on his bicycle with Kyle Busche, which required the correct side of his car.
"To this day we have put hope in a good ending," said Johnston, adding, "it just didn't work out."
Shortly after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded and the team was down and ready to leave.
After his car crashed and died by another driver at the race in New York, Stewart left three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend and had to win either the race in Atlanta or the following race in Richmond to take place in the table.
He returned to the race during a tragic accident investigation that killed twenty-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who took Stewart during the race.
The authorities said that the investigation of the causes of accidents would take at least two weeks.
So far, it has not been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
A three-year-old champion was waiting for a hot boost before the race.
Stewart started on 12th, he started on 10th and then he even started on 4th.
Then, at the beginning of the 122nd car, Busch's car is no.
18 got out of control, got out of second arrest, and got to Stewart, where both cars were sent to the quake.
Stewart went on, but he got to the 21st place.
Prague has chosen a new taxi manager, making 12.3 million
Prague has completed the selection procedure for the new tax administration.
For 103 parking stations, it's worth 12.3 million kroner per year.
In the same area, the taxi driver has chosen 150 thousand kroner each year, at the same time.
He informed the working Luke Manhart (TOP 09).
In the past, the city was used as a rescue when choosing administrators.
And then the winner won the rent for a passenger amount of 1000 kroner per year.
She's right, but she's changed.
At the same time, it decides higher bids.
"The year from the conclusion of the original contracts and the start of the selection arrangements has shown that the new system of rentals is far more useful and more just for Prague," he says.
The most expensive bottle is On Perštín
The highest price has been offered by interested people on the streets of Perstín.
It's gonna pay 2.1 million dollars a year.
About 1.5 million new managers paid for places before the General House or in Václav's premises.
The new rules for rentals were adopted in the autumn of 2012 and the initial rental contract was announced in the spring of the year.
The election took place in four waves and a new manager found 29 seats.
We've had to clean the studio this year.
We've already let her go, which led to the practically second fish around the chat.
Then we found Savo.
Incredible push!
Our studio in the shelter always has plenty of beautiful voyeur water.
And it wasn't a girl who was done with the skills, and her grandfather was doing it by herself.
It's been a long time.
She was just like three rounds, and she was quite curious, like everything else on the cat, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until the summer.
When we started the season, of course we broke the water.
When she stayed there for a few months, she deserved it.
It just seemed to us that the water wasn't coming any further.
We were wondering if something didn't happen there.
In the place where the pump was passing, it was possible for a few drops to get there, the board didn't even get there, so it was opened with a cup of tea.
Our inspection confirmed that the cycle was moving.
Otherwise there was nothing in the water, and we lighted it down.
So we let her go again and cleaned up.
Of course, we've improved improvised tension around the tube.
We've seen strange things in the dark.
On the ground was a decorated package with some bones.
At least that's what it looked like.
And what's next.
Now it looks like a giant mouse.
In the cave, in the places where the ghosts are, the ancestors' nests were the rest of the fish!
And it's tough!
Our conclusion is also positive.
Someone would have said that grandpa had a chat for a while.
And it wouldn't be that far from the truth.
The walls and floor are just a breathless sand, just the ceiling is subsidized.
They're mostly on board.
And the car.
And the bathroom on the beach.
The door was opened mostly by large measures as someone walked there in one corner.
A couple of already mentioned paths.
Without a net, they usually fly in there, and the nest is on the back.
It's too much to name the muscles.
Grandpa wanted it to fly, and that's it.
Now the air didn't help.
He's got the whole cover.
So we cleaned up the whole deal.
Especially the fish on the beach was alive!
We also pulled out the things that were around: the porcelain, the helicopter, and so on.
Our chat in the distance has been welcomed by a colloquial disinfectant.
We were wondering who was able to get us these useless remains?
The closest cat lives two miles from here.
It's hard for us to celebrate.
Grandpa attacked a neighbor who's not completely fine.
If he didn't give us those nonsensees by the way, would he?
It's practically all year long, stupid ideas, that's what he has.
We also decided to monitor and control the test regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, but only on the floor and sleep before they're finished tests, but it's been good.
Tahat water from the forest students is nothing I'd like to do for a while.
One day we heard a horrible horrible blow on our fans.
Mom looked out of the balcony and saw a long, strong black hat on the floor next to the verandy.
She jumped a rope over her and put a gun on her ass.
Mom sold it to her because she thought Réza's winning a drop-out ring from the bathroom.
At once, though, the hat was partially stuck into the club and partially moved.
The balconies have been hit.
Reza got hysterical suction.
We ran down.
The rope, long over a meter and thick like a bee, was about to form a huge hole, and Réza protected her in it.
It wasn't clear if she wanted to save the gun or if she wanted to take it alone, but it wasn't worth it.
When the wolf saw violence in the form of our entire family, she probably said, "Let's have it when we're so hungry, and it's elegantly wrapped up in the mud."
We've been flying for her.
It's like a blizzard jump for the studio.
It's just by the way, we've noticed on her face the next floating package.
According to the smell of fish.
She wasn't there earlier!
Our new security around the wheel was a little bit dry.
And that's what we've been locked up over the day.
That he would...
We went out there, and we put each other there for a walk.
We haven't waited a long time.
For the student, it's a shame.
First, a flat head with yellow moons appeared on the roof.
Then she got out of the test all the time.
She got around her chest and started getting inside.
An employee who was taken out of the office was arrested, bought a notebook company and sold it
After his release, the convicted employee bought it to the computer company and then sold it.
The money he earned was still there before the police were arrested.
During a short period of time, the man bought in twelve cases a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"Notebooks after taking over took him to Olomauce, where he sold himself to the base," said the top Zümper Police Commissioner Rostislav Brückner.
The motive of the riots was the city of employees for release and also the profit of money.
"When I heard it, he claimed that he used money on credit payments," said Brückner.
The police also found out that the suspect was a pathological player who was repeatedly treated with psychiatrists.
Money could also be spent in high-powered devices or in video terminals.
"The fact is, we haven't found any money," said the Commissioner.
The prosecutor who has been convicted of theft is now in danger of staying in prison for a year to five years.
The police have not yet explained whether they are threatening to punish also the bazaars that bought the notebooks at the price and continue to sell them.
"It is true that they have taken over the whole new goods, which is at least suspected," said the Commissioner.
However, none of the owner of the base was yet accused.
Come on, another piece of shit, you're gonna do it or I'm enjoying We Run Prague.
This year, our editors have made a few changes.
This was the biggest change in the path that led to the flood, instead of leading back to the Blue Laser.
I was glad to be out with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I decided to live it a little longer on the other side.
With the whole team, we decided to treat our readers personally at the station where we took photos together and filmed the video.
To give my view on the other hand to perfection, I took on the role of a personal leader.
Together with a friend of Kácjo, we sat quietly at the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes before the start.
We greeted friends who took us to the fast-track sector.
It didn't take much time.
A couple of slots to play, start sports tests, rest and start!
The spring break, but instead of a quick start, it was followed by digging into the start-up glass.
After five minutes, we'll get to the front, stop measuring, and we'll blow up in ten hours.
We fly with a yellow band of runners who run their first race like Káča.
Meanwhile, all the fresh, slightly swirling sun on the surface gives a look at the Wisherrad almost to the gleaming clouds.
The pulsating mass moving across the coast seems to be running all over Prague.
On the border between the University and the National Theatre, it is traditional to show who has the power.
A light coat on the Palac's place encourages many runners to slow down or move to the foot.
Just before I move to the Divadelna, I see the police attack, and immediately after him, the Vícek Paullista is an incredible storm to the target.
I hear the wonderful excitement of the other runners.
I'm moving to the edge, I'm pushing him up, he's trying to cry with me, but before that, he's got his legs under my feet and our hands are going down.
The Divadel Street itself offers a chance for a short rest and breath.
There's a need for us to have places where I'm looking at the air.
The tour of the Manes Bridge shows Prague in all the beauty of the sunset.
I'm not breathing, and my legs aren't almost alone.
A moment of truth takes place for the first lighthouse.
On the way through the road Kătăa škobörk is about the barrier and presents a leap of blue.
I see if she doesn't need help, and I'm going to use a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about the pain.
It is known and we continue to go on the Kosí street, it is one of the most southest places to walk, in this phase of the race there is no such train, yet there is a need for good monitoring of the environment.
I still don't know that the idea of the southernmost place will get its true meaning later.
In Prague, we are surrounded by tourists and friends of other runners.
I'm trying to communicate with everyone who offers hands, and I'm doing it too, because ten connections with fans are like half of the energy elements.
The fact is, we're speeding up again, and if we're going to lose pretty much, it's starting to get moving.
We're running dozens of runners when I have someone especially tired, and I'm trying to wake him up with a few words: "Come on, man, you can do it!"
No one's going ahead of us for the last supper, we're hurrying.
We've been running for an hour and a quarter, we're adding, it's all right to wait.
Three kilometers to the target are going to hurt, but there's really a need to break up.
The sun has fallen slowly, and the final day of symbolic darkness ends the race.
The last break to the bridge, the circle, and it's just a line to the target.
The time we're running, I'm wondering where that girl is going?
"Come on, let's go in 30 hours, let's go!" I'm calling.
We'll try it, print it, and it's a goal here.
It's thirty-six seconds.
Well, what can be done?
The trainer's been down for 20 hours.
So seven minutes under the plan.
That's a great result.
I'm sure Káté's gonna have his feet lowered, and I'm gonna help her find a place to rest for a while.
It's on her to see the drill, but she's also happy with the well done performance.
I'll take her out of the area for a while.
Euphoria doesn't give us a sense of pressure in the past to the castle.
It's here to see that Kossi street wasn't the southernmost place.
It's still here for the purpose of flooding, which is under the pressure of about ten thousand runners trapped in the mud.
If anyone doesn't like the gift, it's no place for him.
And after a while I'm losing my head and wondering if you're looking forward to the last few years, what's going on here is what's going on.
From my own experience, I know that planning the race is no fun.
If tens of thousands of people are added to this, the rich program and the closure of the entire Prague centre for all transport is a huge challenge.
The annual change of track showed the runners many interesting places, but it also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The beautiful atmosphere scattered in the yellow lakes was transferred between the race and the race itself.
The organizers around the trail and the rear monsters raised it on every foot of the trail.
At the city’s historic centre of trouble, I must count with obstacles that cannot be removed, but the objective of the mass race in a place that is on the one hand protected by the wall and on the other, I do not consider the best solution.
If I tell you that the race ended with a moving goal, I appreciate it as well.
I had a little fear of the health of the participants, but it all worked well.
Write us to the discussion if you like the path and what you say about the situation in the target.
The majority of citizens in Bulgaria organize protests
Staff members of the prison services throughout Bulgaria participated in a national protest meeting before the Ministry of Justice in the capital city of Sofia.
They have repeated their requirement for the restoration of the original working conditions that have changed in recent times.
The list of requirements to be met with the interim minister of justice of Christ John is also higher.
Months were symbolicly protested against the new working time and demanded that they return to the original twenty-four-year shifts.
Although the Committees of Prison Observers and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree to inform the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR).
"The meeting is still going on," BNR led by the General Prison Service Directorate-General Rosen Zhelyazkov.
It is expected that members of the Federation of Committeeal Organizations of Workers will also join the Ministry of the Interior to protest employees.
Why can the universe have more dimensions and we can't see them
The physical bestsellers don't usually write, but Brian Green's from Columbia University was hit into black in 1999.
His book The Elegant Universe became the most accessible path to lying, as to the forest of problems that are facing a number of theoretical physics today - trying to combine two great functional but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantitative theory and the theory of general relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of the Elegant Universe is undoubtedly that in the case of a unified physical theory, it is not an empty story.
The physical basic problem between two key theories (as at this time our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) has been resolved and resolved in such a way that it is considered to be a transfer and a lie.
In addition, Greene recommended so much freshness and curiosity that he could not count on how much interest he had in his books.
In addition, he made his "misleading" from most of the books: the structure of the universe and the hidden reality.
Of course, not even the author would object if his book were to stop faster, but the fact is that after 15 years the Elegant universe still provides almost all the essential things that the informed era with the ambition of understanding the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the next few years, there will be only a few things alive in this area (the need for the LHC accelerator to finally eat on the "full flood"), and so it is a good time to get into Green with the violent opening doors of the world of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three space dimensions, of course, can sound travel, fantastic, strange or mystical.
Still, he's specific and very friendly.
To understand this, let's take a moment away from the universe as a whole to something more beautiful, in particular to a long and thin gardening trap.
Imagine that you are pulling the stomatic garden cap from one side of the canyon to the other and you are following the whole scenario from a half-lometre distance (such as the picture and the following page).
From this distance, you can easily record the length of a water-borne haze, but if you just don't suffer from bistruscism, you know the weight of the hazelnut.
In view of your great distance from the roof, you would think that the snowflake to live on the roof has only one size in which you can walk: the left-right side of the roof.
If someone asks you where the darkness was at the moment, answer it with one single indication: the distance of darkness from the left (or right) end of the tent.
So all we're saying is that from a half-mile distance, the length of the roof looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, he's got weight.
If we increase it all, we look at this second dimension - in the shape of a circle that is floating around.
In this increased view, it is obvious that the tide can actually move in two independent dimensions: in a well-known left-right size after the length of the tent, but also in a "size in/ against the direction of the movement of the hour gloves" and around the circle of the roof.
You start to understand that to determine the position of a small sailboat, you have to assign two numbers: how far from the end of the hake and where it is on the circle of the floating hake.
This reflects the fact that the roof surface is bi-dimensional (e.g. experts will point out that this chapter focuses purely on the false theory of the page.
Non-responsive aspects are provided in Chapters 12 and 13.).
The roof surface is bi-dimensional: one long-distance dimension is measured directly by a button, the dimension in the direction of the direction of the direction, marked by a curved button, is short and narrow.
The difference between these two dimensions is nevertheless clear.
The size of the side of the roof is long and easy to see.
The current size of the chain is short, "swift" and very famous.
In order to identify the existence of the circle dimension, we have to look closely at a much better solution.
The above example illustrates the importance of space dimensions.
That they're divided into two groups.
They can be big, bright, and therefore directly pale, or, on the other hand, small, dirty and very high-sighted.
Of course, in that case, we did not go straight ahead so that we could detect the "swinnut" dimension of the rising pressure of the tent.
You've had enough to take a look at it.
But if the hats were thin -- like hair or capillary -- we'd only see the dirty dimensions with great effort.
Kaluza sent his article to Einstein in 1919, in which he expressed a sobering thought that space geometry could have more than three dimensions known to us.
Kaluza's radical claim led to the fact that the additional dimension provides an elegant and reliable framework in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can lead to a single, unified concept structure.
Immediately, the question is, how this Kaluzian cave goes together with the obvious fact that we see just three dimensions of the space.
The answer Kaluza quietly predicted between the order and which he clearly expressed and clarified Swedish mathematics Oskar Klein in 1926 stands and falls in the belief that the space geometry of our universe can have both large and smooth dimensions.
This means that just as the dimensions of the length of the tent have our universes large, wide and easily visible three dimensions, the existence of which we realize every moment.
But the analogous with the circle of the garden can have the space and the additional dimensions, certainly swirled into the space so impregnated that the future remains hidden even before our most perfect experimental apparatus.
To get a clearer idea of the basis of Kaluz's excellent proposal, let's stay a little longer in the hall.
Imagine that we draw a black color at the front of the tent with a relatively thick series of circles.
The beams always look like a thin single-dimensional glass.
With the distance now, thanks to the rotation, we're still able to detect the smooth size of the snow, we're seeing the same motive from picture 2.
We can clearly see that the roof surface is bi-dimensional, with one size large and almost unlimited and with another short and round.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but apart from one small circle dimension, there are three large space dimensions, together with four space dimensions.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help us with our performance a little bit, let's look at the illustration on page 3; it shows two big dimensions and one small circle dimension.
In the picture, we're increasing our view of the geometry of the space just like we've increased the surface of the tent.
Each of the following levels represents a huge increase in the geometry of the space from the previous level.
Our universe may have an additional dimension (see them at the fourth level of enlargement), if they are dragged into a sufficiently small space; thus we explain that we have not observed them directly.
The square network usually highlights the known "great" dimension, while the circle is surrounded by new, small and smooth dimensions.
Just like the oranges in the hot-cut copper, these circles exist in every place of normal size - we only drew them to the particles in the square network because of the observation.
The background of picture 4 is often highlighted by the known structure of the space - the common world around us - in such common dimensions as meters, marked by the side of the small square in the square network.
In each picture, we focus on the small area of the previous picture; we increase it to become visible.
At first, there's nothing special about what we're seeing at some of the first level increases.
However, when we step on our path with the microscopic properties of the geometry of the space further - on the fourth level of increase in figure 3 - we see this new layer, in the shape of the circle of a smooth dimension, the same smile is even in a dense layer of copper.
Kaluza and Klein came to the conclusion that the additional cross size exists in each place in the direction of the great sizes as well as in each point of its length.
In the interest of the observation, we have drawn the circle dimension only in some regular points.
Picture 4 Kaluz and Klein's image of the microscopic structure of the space.
The comparison with the hat is obvious, perhaps we also note important differences.
First of all, the universe has three large, far-reaching space dimensions (of which we drew only two), which the roof has only one large size.
Even more important difference is the fact that we are now talking about space geometry of the universe itself, not just some object inside the universe, we need our host.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional spinal dimension is extremely miniaturous, recognize it is - just like the cross-section of a hat - much harder than to observe the apparent, large and wide dimensions.
If the additional dimension is small enough, it will be revealed in fact and beyond the strength of our most modern instruments to increase.
Most importantly, however, the additional dimension is not just a large circle within normal dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration wrongly indicates.
The circle dimension is a new dimension that exists in each of the three common exposed dimensions.
It's the size of the remaining three dimensions independent of the same as the sizes of the Shora-down, left-right and forward-back independent (and third) one another.
A small sailboat could move in all four dimensions, and in determining its position we would need four data, except three more common positions in the circle dimensions; if we count also time, then five data, in each case more than we would normally expect.
Did it bother you?
The book Elegant universe Brian Greene can be bought here on books.idnes.cz.
The price for the e-book is 149,- Kč.
To our surprise, then, we find that if we know that there are only three dimensions of the space, Kaluzov and Klein's view that there is no exception to the existence of additional twin dimensions if they are small enough.
The universe can have a calmer dimension than we can see with our own eyes.
How small should they be?
The latest technical equipment can identify the structures of a large billion billion meters.
We can barely take a closer look at the smaller pig's size.
In 1926, Klein combined the original Kaluzian idea with a few thoughts from the law of quantified mechanics.
Its calculations indicated that the additional circumference dimension could have a size of about one Planck's length, so the size was far beyond the ability of today's devices.
Since then physics has called for additional small space dimensions of Kaluzo-Klein's theory.
Wohnout Honza Homola recommends how to play on an electric guitar: Part 5.
The whole concept of "twenty" is based on a 12-tactic harmonic form that you can freely repeat.
Whoever digs in music theory finds her principle explained here in detail.
Jan Homola or Hommelka Tobolka (1976)
By learning a speaker and a sound guide whose facebook profile can be followed here, from maturity 20 years ago, lives as a chart.
He's a guitarist, Captain Wohnout, who's obviously not going to leave.
He's after his father, just like his brother Matthew, the leader of the Wohnouts.
Start training on one side.
"The rhythmic model is only for you, you can think of anything, it's enough to apply it to a harmonic model twelve," Honza recommends.
If you add another page, you can change the figure again.
It's enough to listen to and follow Honz what's going on with 12 harmony on both sides and how pretty it's starting to sound.
If you pick up the third page, you can cook with the melody some songs already.
When you finally add the fourth, attention to the change in the landing, warning Honza in the video.
Next, Honza will come back to the pentatonica and try to get her together with twelve.
So make her a nice flower.
As best as possible, you will read it in a conversation with Jan Homola at his first lesson in his school game on an electric guitar here.
Another head without waiting?
It's not for great glory, it recognises the Garden House.
We're reading the point and we're happy for him.
The first half we had more chance, the second home," prepared an attacker, who was now flocking from the corner.
You weren't nervous when he was playing, but you just gave her a huge piece of shit?
I didn't take it very seriously, even though on the second branch, where there's domestic fans, it's probably worse.
You fixed the penalty after half a year, but you've also got the money from the penalty in just a few minutes.
What happened?
We slept first, we were passive, got out of the hole and then the pentalate.
After her, you got up and the first half you were a better team with more chances.
Why did it change after the switch?
It's hard to say.
I agree with the fact that we've played well after the incarcated cave.
We said in the cabin that we wanted to keep the game pace after it, but we couldn't do it.
To tell the truth, I can't explain why.
But it's also true that the housekeepers said something to their game, they probably didn't have much peace with it.
You were the first to hit the counter at the top, while you should not have got a head at home yet.
Why is that so different?
I wouldn't say it's such a difference, it's more of a concern to us than we do to poppere.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad for us, Plzen, that's another category.
You've been waiting for four games at the head, don't you have any fear that this could be the same after the last run?
It's probably not, but we're glad we're glad we don't have to talk about waiting for the head.
Now we've added another one without waiting, but there's only three in six games, which is not yet on the big screen.
Iceland - a lion is hanging from miles of a distant crater.
Lava flying on the surface of the Holuhran area near the river Vatnajekulll, touches the underground tunnel from miles away from the crater.
He's under the ice, as well as part of the underground lava tunnel.
This reality is now the most disturbing of scientists...
The situation is still constant.
From yesterday's morning (31.8.
2014) continues to fly from the bush around the same number of fish.
However, contrary to the original estimates, the quantity is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
On the contrary, the previous Europeans of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50x larger.
However, scientists are afraid that the lava tunnel could be opened even in places under the ice.
If this were to happen, in addition to the same intensity as the present european forecast, it would mean huge floods, as in the Jökulsa River at Fjöllum, and in other rivers.
Around the european is to feel a strong smell of cheese, from the trunks the clouds of pairs and lungs.
It is decided not to agree on the euro for the tourism movement, as in the case of the Euro pean in Fimmvördühals in 2010.
This is much bigger and there is much more gas here," Vulcanologist Ármann Höskuldsson says.
However, the weather has improved significantly since yesterday, in early hours it was almost unsightly.
The feet after the song tower were filled with rain.
The scientists can continue their work.
For air transport, the orange level (second highest) for Bardarbung and yellow (third) for Askju is paid.
Heaven over Chebem belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
She's gone after her wings.
A flight day in Chebu.
At the Boeing Stearman PT-17 the plane was represented by Peggy Walentin's acrobattery, which flew out of the cabin to the city on the top of the double-line and also between the wings.
It's only directed at the power of the waves.
The airport day in Chebu was already running this year, and the organizers were able to prepare a number of interesting flight kits again.
The prime minister at the oldest Czech airport took not only the "flying horse" in giving German acrobatics Peggy Walentino, but also the legendary P-51 D Mustang or Beechcraft flight 18.
The one who drew attention to himself by means of his miraculous power.
Acrobat called Wingwalking has its origin in the United States.
After World War I, many former warplanes were trying to survive.
Only because of a large number of fatalities, he was banned.
Today, however, he slowly returns to the flight days program.
Peggy's coming out of the bathroom on the top floor after the start.
There's a variety of flowers there.
At the end of the exhibition, they are moved to the space between the wings of the plane where her show continues," said Luděk Matéjěček from the Chebsk Ultralight Club and the organizer of the flight day.
The pilot of the Boeing Starman 75 E is her husband, Friedrich.
If Peggy's release was the main cause of the program, then the next presentation of Mustang's movement was an adjoining triangle on the table.
The legendary trainer joined the Grippeny Army of the Czech Republic in a concentration (temporarily in numbers).
Such a composition could be seen by the flight fans in Czech for the first time.
Pilot Miroslav Sázavsky then presented all the breathing acrobats with the flight from 1945.
He was made for war, but he probably never participated in it.
He was registered in the military reserve.
Since 1963 he has moved into the civil sphere.
And like a race flight.
Today he's got his home hangar on the airport in Munich City.
At the same place, there is also another pearl of Chebs' flight day, two-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
He didn't go to the airport to look at the machine.
His detached velvet has gone far.
The award was awarded by Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in the colors of the French airport.
The small transport aircraft stopped behind the abandoned Turbolet and brought a part of the German delegation from Hofu to the airport day.
The German neighbors in Chebu presented themselves with rebuilt airplanes like 18T or triangular formations of Bücker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhy: Dramatic return to the camera!
My parents changed Lucie Borhy's care for those workers at least for the night.
Stress or nervousness - a blond moderator knows nothing of it.
Modernizing her TV news was just as good as she'd never stop with her for two months!
It's just two weeks ago, when the blondes ended in the sixteenth week of women living after their birth, the biggest stress.
Lucie, however, will not be shown regularly in the main reporting relationship TV Nova.
Regular return awaits her according to information Blesk.cz up to a month.
However, only her daughter Linda now needs more than a TV fan.
Lucie Borhy came back to the TV screen and it was a black trip.
Shows for a year in Prague?
Halla would sell herself, plan to break Jágr
It would be honorable to do something like that during the world's mystery.
But it depends on how the fight is going to take place," he said in Jihlava after the exhibition with the name of the Golden Fleet, in which the captivating Nagan team met again.
And the players who shared in the gold hack.
Players would like to have a good time, wouldn't they?
I'm sure.
It would soon be good to make a settlement with a golden generation during the mystery.
I think during the tournament you can find one two days when it's completely free and where you could get such an escape.
Let's say that to Gum (Jirí Šlégro) or Bado Šcherban (the director of the Jihlavic Party) who would take care of it...
Arena would sell herself.
What if you're playing New Jersey play-off?
So if I fly like this...
Play in the representation, but you don't want to.
Or did the Jihad meeting somehow change your decision?
The representations and exhibitions are two different things, and the performances are decisive.
One thing is that people there would like to see me, but performances are decisive, especially on the mystery of the world.
There should be players who have it, not because they have a good name.
My decision has never changed.
How did you actually enjoy the search for nagans?
It was just a great meeting with the players.
Man's relived history and lived a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for fans but also for us hockeys.
The most important thing was the honor of Ivan Hlink.
And it's good to remember the history of our hockey and that there's a generation that's really going away.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimír Róžíčka and Petr Čechmánek on the stairs.
You're still gonna get your first representative game?
He doesn't forget about that kind of thing.
It was against Calgary Flames and three young people: me, Robert Holík and Robert Rachel, we were in one three.
For all of this, it was the first representative start.
Well, if we were to dominate in some way, it wouldn't be said.
In Jihlwa for a long time, Dominik Hasek was arrested.
What did you say about his performance?
Hasan will never surprise me on the ice.
I wanted to bring it back to him with this criticism, but I can't (hasek criticised Jágra for reasons why he decided to end up in the representative).
And Hnilicka's got a great idea.
He was right there with me once in the night, and he was wild there.
And now he's got a famos.
First US and then the Netherlands, photoballists start qualifications
On Monday afternoon, a prominent guest gathered at the NH Hotel.
People could see the need for a mechanic, Petra Čecha from Chelsea, the representative trainer Paul Vrbu...
And over there, it's in a black box, it's Tomáš Rosic!
Agent Arsenal and the representative captain arrived at a meeting of about half the latter.
We're waiting for a beautiful match against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't be pleased?" he said when he was presenting before the press.
Czech Representative programme
Monday 1st September: start of the race, first training
Tuesday 2 September: Train opened for fans (18:30, Summer) Autogram (20:00)
Wednesday 3 September - USA (20:15, Summer)
Sunday 9 September Czech - Netherlands (20:45, Summer) end of season
The Russian and Polish fans can still support the Central Corps against the US (20:15).
The representation for them opened the afternoon train which begins at 6:30 A.M.
And after him, he'll be followed by autographs that Rosic and Chech won't miss.
Otherwise, this gathering of the national team will be more comfortable.
Which commends the Vrba trainer, who was directly involved in the number of joint actions on the fire.
Finally, we're going to make a deal with what we want to do.
Now we'll focus on the Netherlands.
It's good to have players together for eight days.
We'll have time to practice things that haven't been so long," Wrba, who officially leads the national team from winter.
The Czech football representation will take place at the entry into the new qualifying cycle.
The representative has three games behind him, all ready.
Norske and Finland have lost 2:2 and Rakouska has lost 1:2.
However, these results were still not important.
That's right now.
The Treaty with the Netherlands is currently in the process of establishing qualifications for the European Parliament in 2016.
Of course, Czech men would have helped if they could have a general against the United States.
The first half was to get to know each other.
Now there are important results.
We need to think about it so we can be successful," Wrba agreed.
The only player with three-year-old names having health problems is the attacker David Lafata.
He's got a fever.
If he hadn't managed to get in the middle of a fight against the United States, the Wrba trainer would have called another attacker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A woman in Britain describes how she, after a bad diagnosis for many years, thought she was going to die.
After she was diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of his adult life thinking that she was only a few years old.
In fact, it was about Charcot-Marie-Tooth Syndrome (CMT) - a group of ancestors who damage nerves outside the brain and the liver.
The CMT UK charity stated that poor diagnosis is a common problem among CMT people, because it is only very small in terms of weakness.
It is estimated that in the United Kingdom, around 23,000 people are suffering from CMT, which can show symptoms in the field of motorcycling such as muscle weakness, non-motor foot and boned fingers.
The condition can also cause discomfort or pain, which is treatable and progressive, which means that symptoms become worse over time.
When Rodgers was thirty, she thought she was suffering from Freidreich's Ataxia (FA) - a disease that has a very bad reputation.
She believed that before she celebrated the eighth birthday, she would be hanged on a stake, and she died before she was thirty.
My mother, who is now 51, says: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same things.
I fell down every day, and it took me a long time.
I've never been able to ride with other kids on bicycles or on a skiboard and I've been beaten up at school for walking and running."
When Rodger's train and after several operations to release her Achilles' boots and fix her walk, she used her doctor to leave the room and look at her documentation where she found out she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I followed, and so I didn't tell anyone, but when I came home, I looked for information about my disability in the library and wrote to the Association FA," she says.
When he answered me, I was in shock, I just panicked.
I thought, before it was my eighth, I'd end up in the car, and before I was five, I'd be dead, and I'd gradually lose all my abilities.
I was totally on my own and planned my funeral."
When she was seven, she realized that her ability to walk had not diminished as much as she anticipated, and she asked her surgeon about it.
He just stood up, grabbed her, and said: “Dear, I don’t think you have a disease here, otherwise you would be on the train.
I think it's going to be a much less dangerous life."
After several genetic tests, it was found to have CMT.
"When he explained to me what the CMT is, I thought I was a happy child," she said.
The CMT UK Charity Organisation initiated a month of information on CMT to warn of this disease.
In the Washington area: taxes are raised by the economy
The growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes too.
According to a new study published last week, the company's state and local tax office in the country has grown slightly over the past year, and the companies in Washington were not excluded.
The participants in Maryland and Virginia totaled $27.6 billion for the fiscal year 2013 to the national and local stocks, which is 3,8 % higher than $26,6 billion selected in 2012.
Tax burdens - both national and local - rose by 4,3 % to $671 billion compared to 3,9 % last year and increased by the third year after 2009 and 2010, when tax fell.
According to the study carried out by Ernst & Young and the Centre on State Taxation, the state tax increased faster by 4.3 % than the local authorities, by 3.9 %.
More than half of the tax revenue in the range is 56% of the income, and 36% of the income in Maryland is from the company.
Virginia, with 28 %, shows the minimum tax revenue from the undertaking.
According to researchers, the majority of tax revenue increases are due to an increase in the value of the assets of the companies concerned, resulting in an increase of 3,7 % in the three years following that increase in the coming years.
Although most profits come from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the same situation seems to be in Washington.
The companies in D.C., Maryland and Vrigini paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, representing an annual increase of 4.2% compared with 9.6 billion in 2012.
However, the apparent increase in the value of property is not so high as the State and local tax revenues in Maryland, where the tax on property represents less than five companies' taxes.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., the tax is the property of almost half the state and local tax.
"In Maryland, the company owns a lot of property, especially the tax base around D.C., government or non-profit organisation that does not pay taxes," Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation, explained.
So Maryland has to rely much more on income tax, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other countries.
The recent increase in tax revenues from the undertaking cannot be attributed only to the recovery of the real estate market.
According to the data, income from the business appears to be rising too.
Companies in this region have published the tax on the revenue of businesses of $2.3 billion, which increased from 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland selected one billion dollars on taxes from commercial companies, mostly in the region.
Despite the same approach, local tax burden on businesses does not increase rapidly in these three places.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the national average, at 4.3 %, while Maryland's growth was significantly higher, 4.9 %.
Only in Virginia, the average tax increase was 4.1 %.
Virginia has the lowest income tax of all three companies (of which all have the same tax), 6 %.
The market share in Maryland is 8.25 %, while the average D.C. remains relatively high, to 9,975 %.
A similar study conducted by the US Chamber of Commerce this year showed that Virginia has lower state and local taxes and a much more favourable tax climate than Maryland.
D.C. study was inappropriate.
And over this benefit, Virginia is under pressure to compete with the South.
North Carolina recently signed the law reducing trade taxes from 6.9% to 6%, as in Virginia, and the next year the tax falls to 5%.
In order to continue to meet the revenue targets in the coming year, the statutory rate of income tax could be reduced by 3 % in 2017.
According to a recent study, small businesses in Washington lead better and therefore pay higher State and local taxes.
The life tax paid by small businesses as a personal income tax - the cost-recovery structure of higher prices, according to which the majority of companies - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia grew by 20% to $2.4 billion last year, much faster than other taxes.
Researchers say that the trend and the overall increase in the animal health tax will probably continue next year, the total tax revenue from sales to the national and local governments will rise to 6.2 % in comparison with the same period during the first three quarter of 2014.
Washington, however, may remain behind because lowering State expenditure will choose its tax on the labour market.
What is unique to you: the head of Europe will be Tusk, Putinovo Novorusko and Lafato's legs
Is there a new state in Ukraine?
Putin called for a meeting on Novorusk.
Russian President Vladimír Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in southern Ukraine, where government units with a pro-russian uprising have been actively involved.
He also warned European companies that, after the current regime of anti-virus sanctions, it would be difficult to return to the Russian market.
Support that the West provides for the war of the Ukrainian army in eastern Ukraine, according to him, is opposed to democratic values.
The end of the conflict, according to him, depends on Kyev, so he cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis ends.
More sanctions for Russia?
Czechs had the right to disagree with the part
The European Commission, together with diplomats per week, has proposed a form of further approval of anti-terrorist sanctions, decided on the EU summit tonight.
Journalists were told by the former president of a meeting of the Member States of Herman Van Rompuy.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotkys, concrete proposals for the discharge of sanctions have already been prepared in the afternoon.
Tusk will be a new EU president.
Van Rompuye is rewarded in December
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected at the European Union summit to the head of the European Council, thus called the Union President, who is conducting the summits of the Member States.
Since December two and a half years, Herman Van Rompuye will be rewarded.
At the head of the European diploma, Catherine Ashton is awarded the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs by Federica Mogherini.
Italy, which will thus become the Vice-President of the future European Commission, still has to confirm the European Parliament.
The assisted death is in Czech reality, but it's not about it.
Help for chronic and long-term patients with a leave of life?
In Czech conditions where the laws do not permit euthanasia, it is illegal.
Despite the comments made by doctors who have spoken with the LN, it appears that they are listening to such requests.
ALS: The most difficult chapter of neurology, says a doctor on sclerosis

But if we don't try it, we won't find it," says Radim Mazanec, motorcycle neurologist.
There's a copy of the CIA, they needed a war, Huml wrote about the launch of the MH17.
The messenger for ČSSD Stanislav Huml is clear of who shot a Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
According to him, it is apparent that "the severe sanctions reported with regard to the shooting of a civilian aircraft with nearly 300 dead have resulted in the rationalisation of the Ukrainian army".
According to the lawyer, it's also known as the CIA manuscript.
Unfulfilled promises.
Closer to the elections and the parties are offering again and impossible
End of homeless people on the streets, parking for every family and shop over Prague.
This is repeated before any elections: the parties make promises impossible.
Also now, with the coming municipal elections, politics are being promoted by those who are more interested in voters.
Lidovky.cz server has chosen incomplete promises from the past and the present.

It was August 30, 1944, when the Czech independent Brigade moved to France.
Her manager, Alois Liška, systematically requested the addition of technical equipment and delivery to the front.
Finally, the British side withdrew and appointed this earthly unit as one of its forces in the construction of the port city of Dunkerque, which remained under the control of the German army.
SOUHRN: Plenty leads the league to the Persian "S", Liberec declared Baník

After two strokes, Sparta was remembered in her home tongue as a result of two Lafatian practices that defeated Jablonec.
The record victory in the anniversary was signed by Liberec, who shot Baník Ostrava 6:0.
62 thousand wildlings on volleyball?
Police say yes.
The introduction of MS volleyballists in Warsaw brought a wonderful record.
At the football stadium under the roof, there were 62 thousand spectators watching a cold victory over Serbia's home.
The revenue was then sold in 100 minutes.
How to survive the return from the permit?
Don't rush anywhere and go to sleep
The last days of holidays are before us.
It can be a lot of fun to get used to getting back from the sunbed or the chalupy at the usual working speed.
She can even experience depression.
Fortunately, there are certified types of ways to solve the changed situation: do not rush and even get quality sleep.
Family Joan Rivers: "We're holding our fingers"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was brought to the hospital in New York City, but her daughter has expressed today that she is not losing hope that a single ten-year-old comedy will be cured.
"Thank you for your greetings and support," said Melissa Rivers in today's statement.
We're holding her hands.
Her mother was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after her phone call to the rescue service, according to which she received a heart attack on the Yorkwell Endoscopy in Upper East Side, as the source was introduced.
Doctors carefully keep it under the influence of sedatives and under strict supervision until they are certain of its status, which remains “relevant”.
The reactions to themselves were long waiting, including ineffective online support from such individuals as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Realita is overwritten titles
That the media exceed reality with their titles, there's no news.
I know the headlines "sale" the news, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who don't have anything else to read.
And that's the fact that I've been very sad lately, the higher it's for a word of punishment.
This is particularly true of articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
It's quite common to say, "Israel attacked Gaza."
First of all, you will find that the Israeli "exact" has been a reaction to the rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, and that is often due to the time reported.
This will then appear the title "Both sides have failed properly".
Does the journalist realize that this procedure is directly involved in anti-Semitic situations that are growing throughout Europe (and not just there)?
It hasn't been thirty years since the end of World War II.
There's still people who've survived Shaw.
When I saw the video from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the tax pronounced the word "Jewish swine" and similar beliefs, I was shocked.
Is that what the world wants to end what didn't tell Hitler?
Are our journalists aware that after the Jews were assigned to liquidating Slovenia?
Ladies and gentlemen, please pay a little more attention to your work.
You're often marked for "watching the psy democracy."
That's how you defend her.
As long as he's here.
And also deny the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its citizens.
How would you like our government to be saved if one of our neighbors decided that the Czech people were breaking up and that the Czech Republic would disappear from the map of the world?
Maybe you should know another fact, too.
Nearly 20% of the Arab population live in the territory of the State of Israel.
And they're good there.
If you ask them why they don't go between theirs, they should go to Gaza, they'll answer you. Why would they do that?
In Israel, they have jobs, social security and spy health care (I have seen myself in my own eyes as in Hadass's private hospital, which is funded from Jewish sponsors from all over the world, often also from Arabs and are carefully cured there).
Hamas will attack his Arab brothers with his arrows.
The only real help for Gaza is to rescue Hamas and rescue him.
And not to turn away Israel from being in bondage.
Get information about Hamas' practices, his abuse of people as human victims.
Tell me that Hamas is intended to corrupt the state of Israel, at any price.
And at the price of the death of innocent Arab children.
Please inform me that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Please inform me that within nine years of the independence of Gaza, this area could be a source of humanitarian assistance from all over the world.
Even in Israel, which provides water and electricity there, which the Gazan administration does not pay, and even the supply of goods is now being cancelled.
Had Hamas not invested money in the construction of underground tunnels so that they could be defeated by suicide attackers on Israel’s territory, the building of homes, hospitals and schools would have been much better for his Arab brothers in Gaza.
Amazon buys $1.04 billion Twitch
AMAZON just confirmed the claim Information from Monday morning: Internet retailer - producer of videos and hundreds of other things - buys $1.04 billion ($990 million) video streaming service on Twitter.
The announcement caused no surprise because no one would expect Twitter to buy someone, but because it was expected that the buyer will be YouTube.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitche Googlu seemed to be one billion sure, and this connection seemed natural.
Twitch, which first founded Justin.tv three years ago, had been designed to become a popular video streaming service - live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who sent online transfers from her - the words Business Insider “Youtube for live transferred game”.
Twitche interface.
On YouTube are already popular videos “Let's play”, the kind where smart (most older) people give the mystery Science Theater processing game.
The fact is that YouTube comes across a lot, so the news that YouTube buysTwitch, no one gets a lot of money, was a student example of how the company is paying possible competition.
They wonder why the YouTube agreement didn't work out, although the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we have at present is CEO Twitche Emmeta Sheara's statement: "We have chosen Amazon because it believes in our company, has the same values and long-term vision and wants to help us meet it faster."
The next adventure is - honestly - the incredible success of Twitter.
For substances like me, who claim that sports prefers to follow, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about the games instead of real games just to watch.
One thing is to look around in three mornings a friend across the shoulder as the Resident Evil plays, and the other thing is to watch someone else get twenty points to his head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could just look at.
Another problem is that many of today's most popular heroes are from the players' perspectives, so looking at their records, without being able to control their own perspective, is quite a good recipe as to how to fix the puzzle.
I accept that the game type of speed run, in which Roger Bannisters will finish our electronic time game in record time, is fun.
But if anyone isn't the master of play or humor, his channel on Twitter will probably not be very interesting.
But what do I know about this sceptic?
Twitch has 55 million monthly visits and is fourth to the top of the internet service.
How exactly does Amazon use it?
It's hard to imagine that Twitter is moving to Amazon Instant Video as elegant as it might be able to connect YouTube.
Twitch has something she would like to attract every company: the mountains of young men who inserters want.
As President Twitche Shear, Amazon and Twitch said "believes in her future" and the media don't seem to be acting like, like, kissers.
The second fundamental lie of creativity.
Another Czech translation of the American Atheistic Logger Aaron Ra.
This time on the theme "The Holy Scriptures are the Word of God."
The original video has been submitted.
Another fundamental lie of creationism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers discuss a number of matters that are in conflict with their religion, they often ask us the question: Whom will you believe?
A divine word, or a human word?
It would be as if human research was completely useless compared to the authority they claim to have.
Only when they say "man", they talk about science.
And when they refer to the word of God, they refer to myths about God written by men.
If there really is intelligence with a creator with a purpose, then it is the one who created a fossil record that leaves the history of evolution, and it must be the one who designed the genetic pattern that suits it, and it must be the one who provided further lines of evidence that point exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion to the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
Looks like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of these things.
But people can tell stories, fabulating.
And they were people who wrote all those texts that pretend to be the word of God.
Every particular sacred teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as a saved man, not a god.
People who were "inspired" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or should have listened to the dictates of angels, but these texts were not written to anyone other than the mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, no angels and no gods at all.
If there really was one true god, it would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, over-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the whole universe.
If the existence of such a size ever wrote the book, there would be only one such book, the only holy scripture.
It would be known everywhere in the world, without precedents, parallels or alternatives in any language, because only human authors would not be able to measure it.
And people would not have to believe it carefully because it would be consistent, based on verifiable and true evidence, and would have revealed deep silence and wisdom far beyond all human boundaries.
She would always inspire every reader to share her faith.
If God had written it, we wouldn't have expected anything less.
Only what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of the only religion that leads to the ultimate truth, we have many different religions without common origin and all continue to be divided by more and more distinct denominations, searching for conflicting truths and in every way harming God’s guidance, regardless of the continuing dispersion and division in every direction.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospel, the Islamic Koran, the Baha'u'láhov Kitáb-i-Akdás, the Zarathustrovy Avesty, the Sikh Adi-Granth, the Mahabharátska Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the book of Urantia are all considered to be "an absolute truth" and "a revelation of the only true God" and the relevant believers each claim that these others are on their way.
The only logical explanation is that everyone is on a journey to a certain extent.
None of the above-mentioned books shall be regarded as of no benefit to others.
None of them have any proof of support and no historical confirmation.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at West Michigan University.
I'm not saying I've proven the Bible to be reliable and historically accurate.
Of course not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith as well as apologies (debts) because they contain inequality, absurdity and primitive ideas sometimes considered to be true that have already been overcome.
So they cannot claim to be evidence of divine wisdom.
Many of them pass the wild beast instead of silence, and many of them claim to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of the prophecy - with the fact that anyone can also contain a prophecy that was not fulfilled.
Early theologians admit that all sacred texts were written by human hands and are thus the subject of interpretation, ideas, and views of their primitive and often associated politically motivated authors, which explain many of the contradictions and differences in these books, especially those found in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it an insult, rather mutual comments.
We have to show again that we have two different authors here, whose work was kind of funny together during some editorial audit.
It's true that Genesis has more than one author and it's definitely not a clear witness!
Some experts now divide only four different sources for the Pentateuch, i.e. five books of the “Moses ” and Moses do not attribute authority to any of them, for he was probably not as described in the Bible.
The experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably Ezra) of several mutually unnecessary oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
The other documents were refiltered at the same time and all were signed by human authors.
The Bible is not as old as her religious beliefs.
Witnesses from the Dead Sea are the oldest archaeological finds known for their incomplete basis of all Western monotheistic beliefs, yet they are much younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Dridian cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began to be a Gnostic religion, followed by doctrines and doctrines and their completely different views on Jesus, which eventually combined in any compromise called orthodox.
The other Christian groups, such as Luciferians, were divided and disproved by other revisions of the Bible.
One of these administrations refers to the King of Ugarit, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers presented a fundamental threat to the youth of the Mosaic religion, the authors of the New Law decided to ridicule and Ba'al Zebula, "The Lord on the Mount" changed to the Belzebub "the Lord much".
So the Bible has been changed in a thorough and convincing way for both religious and political reasons.
The remaining part of what happened to the New Law was canonized in the 4th century B.C.E. in the series of commission decisions on snow in Nicaragua.
The four Gospels were accepted and the sixteen others were rejected by mere raising hands, as if the reality were given to accept or to abstain from voting.
The way the cannon developed depended on what was read about Sundays in these Christian centers.
What happened on the second week after the inauguration of the Jerusalem church?
What about the Roman Church at the same time?
And they gradually found out that they were close to the same Gospel accounts.
And so the nuclear canon grew out of the heart of the original church.
So the end has just accepted as a gospel any relevant stories that have intertwined with uneducated masses at that time.
However, they wisely collected more than ten books from the Bible, even though they referred to books that had been approved.
Among the rejected places, we will find letters both from the apostles and from the prophets.
Why should God’s Word refer to books that are only the words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be accepted if God was the real author of this complicated mechanism of history, similarity and sorrow?
Surely the Bible was written by people and by no means too clear, more so!
That's why it's so much of its historical and scientific content completely wrong, whatever it is from the beginning to the end.
We're talking about people who believe that hady and snakes can talk, believe in curses, blood sacrifices, ritual sacrifices, miraculous objects, fire literature, astrology, and five lives of magic.
They thought that if they use a blood clot, they'd cure him from leprosy.
We're talking about people who thought that the queens were overcrowded and the nethers were birds and the bears were fish and the pi is the whole number.
These people believed that when he showed the fatty blood of the dried samples, he was born with contaminated fats.
How could someone say this to someone who knows something about genetics?
The authors of this book certainly didn't know that.
If the Bible had been written for some higher existence, it would not have contained the mistakes it contains.
If she came out of the Peruvian really obsessed apartment and was thought to be a historical story, then she wouldn't have anything to do with what she's got.
As a moral leader, it is entirely rare because most of the original Hebrew writings were written by uneducated and greedy savages, who have oversaw or promoted cruelty against animals, incest, childhood, abuse of children, abuse of family members, abuse of children, violence of children, prostitution, murder, cannibalism, genocide and prejudices against race, nation, religion, sex and sexual orientation.
To defend their innocence by claiming to do the will of God.
But creatives still ignore all of this.
Some of their websites acknowledge that if there is any truth to argue with the Bible, then the reality must be ignored!
And why?
Because if the creatives did not have their favorite books, they wouldn't even have God.
In their world there is one and the other.
It's ironic that they reject God's "work" as "inviting creation instead of Creator".
But they themselves consider the word of man to be the word of God and the gods of themselves, and they even insist that the rendering of their “holy” books is something of divine destruction as such.
No version of their gods, but all versions of God.
The creative Christian thinks that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist and that the Bible could be wrong at the same time, for he cannot separate teachings from God.
So it is a kind of prayer where believers teach man a compilation, as if these books were God himself, because they think they are Jehovah’s Word.
Only God has never written or pronounced any of the letters of any religion.
All that people have accepted or rejected to their particular "unchanged word" of any god was designed, composed, composed, translated, interpreted, corrected, and often changed and passed by only imperfect humans.

Then he told the kids how he had to sit in school.
"We had to sit with our hands behind the back, it doesn't bother you anymore, you're free people," said the children of Zeman.
Then his wife handed the firstborn over as a gift to me.
President Miloš Zeman with a student in the first class of basic schools in the Länech.
Minister of School Marcel Chladek started a new school year in private sports school in Lithuania.
"This year I want to go further to Czech school with Czech sport," one of the reasons why the first school day went north of Czech.
The driving school mentioned him earlier at the hockey race in Lithuania.
"It was the first time, so I accepted an invitation to attend the beginning of the school year," the minister added.
Marcel Chládek (ČSSD) began a school year in private sports school in Lithuania.
In the first class of the year, 115 thousand firstborns were added.
Over 850 thousand children will go to basic schools and over 405,000 students will be trained in secondary schools, according to the Ministry of Education.

Apple iCloud obviously looked down on hackers, we got our photos of celebrite
Photo of the image with the unique file list
Meanwhile, an anonymous user on the 4chan server publishes naked and pornographic photos of American celebrates, warned the American server Mashable.com.
Apparently, he gained the wrong access to user accounts on the Applu servers, where access to users was played through automatic recording of iPhones and iPads images.
Apple hasn't been exposed to the problem yet.
Some celebrites reject photos as faked, but have already acknowledged several of the rights of the images concerned.
Among them are the poet Jennifer Lawrence from the title role Katniss in the series of the Hungarian Games or Mary Elizabeth Winsted, who played for example in Death Fall 4.0.
The goal of hacker is to use the acquired images and videos for decoration.
The arrests were obviously interesting American magazines, according to a report on the 4chan server, but hacker wants more money than the community.
According to The Next Web server, it's very likely that there's a weakness in iCloud's security.
On the GitHub server, the same tool appeared two days ago, which allowed access to user accounts through gross power, and then automatic feedback of attempts to sign up with different passwords.
This tool was apparently working, but Apple closed the safe hole after two days.
However, it is true that the potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to different accounts before the publication of this tool.
For preventive reasons, iCloud users should change their password associated with Apple ID.
The length of the password is important, not its complexity.
The length of at least 12 characters is appropriate.
The sole of our photos of celebrite is considered to be a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although company servers such as Apple, Google or Microsoft are safer than computers in domestic or smaller companies, the upload of sensitive photos in unsaved form is a risk.
If you want to store an explicit photo or any other sensitive content online, first encrypt files before upload.
It is also wise to set up automatic backup of the photo on the phone so that it can only be on Wi-Fi and after connecting to the offerer.
So you will have the opportunity to move "to safety" during sensitive photos, and in particular you will have a space to remove the missing images, so they will not take the space in the online place.
Tips on how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet, we offer HN and IHNED.cz readers in the form of electronic books from Michala Altaira Valáška in PDF format.
Smart way to save for high school scripts
In view of the fact that the price for high-school script for many students exceeds $1,000 per year, an emerging student of the second year came in a wise way to reduce costs.
He established a book-keeping system for senior officials with a nominal compensation offer to support their return.
"The book on bills, which usually amount to $180, I got ten per semester and a cigarette," says Schroeder, 19, who studies at the Convenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would be $430, he says.
Utratil 120.
According to the University Council, the average student is to lose more than $1,200 per year, but students have different opportunities to manage these expenses.
The preferred choice of students is to become online shops and creative solutions such as Schroeder.
At the outset, a teacher’s loan allows students to use a semester of the book and often with a very good discount than if they bought it.
Neebo Inc, conducting more than 250 bookshops in the area camps, says the book rental has doubled since 2011.
A survey in the sector shows that around a quarter of the books in university libraries were hired in the past half a year, says Vice-President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the learning texts are purchased according to the National Association of University Trades in University Bookshops.
There's 101 best ways to make it.
Buying online
The price of some new books can be on the Internet up to three times lower than in the university library.
The recommended price of the ninth edition of the book "Calculus" is Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostettler is about $290, but on the Internet it is possible to buy a new $239.99 in a retail shop specialized in a school.
Buy Used
If you are not aware of any other person's or needs and needs, the appropriate possibilities are used for learning texts.
On Chegg.com, "Calculus" is sold for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a high-ranking student at Brigham Young University, says that on Amazon.com he paid for the use of the “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business” 42 cents.
The new guy sold himself for $48.
University student Ingrid Bracey, leading University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, suggests that students in their students check whether older education is acceptable.
Sometimes there are no changes to work in seminars.
If so, they can sell the older edition at the price of the last version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, they are a favorite option for buying used books as well eBay Inc's Half.com.
Remuneration
It is also worth crediting teachers, if you do well with them, do not forget to return them and you do not need them even after the end of the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the cost for a new book.
For example, a student could borrow "Calculus" for about $220 a whole semester.
List the terms and conditions of the trade in which you borrow the book, including marking, excavating or using and damaging it.
Remember: If you do not return the book at any time, the purchase can be higher than the price of the new book.
E-mail
Another option is to take care of the standard e-book place.
Sometimes these books are usually purchased in the form of an electronic license valid for a certain period of time by distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg borrows "Calculus" for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, these most suitable offers can be found by students of literary courses, since many classes are now available for free download, while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, follow the trades.
Joe Gaul, 29, who is soon attending the Pepperdine Law School, recommends managing according to the ISBN because it promises to buy the right book.
Before you order a book over the Internet, you'll make sure it's really stocked, it's done by Gaul.
He was convinced of it on his own skin.
The book he bought was sold for four weeks, and he had to pay a full price for a book from the university library.
Bahno, same bahno.
And then they found in the stud tortoise of the gun at the end of the war.
These studies stand out of St. Jiří's church.
We discovered a hole around and we started to pull out the plane's nose - a rough meter and a half bahn and a broken letter.
As we drew closer to the summer day, we were struck on the head," said Radomil Novak.
We took her out, cleaned her up and found that it was a tricky German rifle used by SS units.
Well, it's definitely unusual.
According to my information, these guns were made until the end of the war.
And there were about three thousand of them," added Novák.
All wooden construction items were distributed in time, so it's useless.
Her body is still preserved - it keeps its shape.
How's the cold eye?
There's an explanation.
Maybe people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by SS units were there, probably because they were afraid they wouldn't be removed.
The fascists on the run wouldn't obviously do that.
You're asking guns in the woods," they think they're finding.
The gun was the only thing the students in the studio found from the ghost's nest.
"There may have been hand grenades, sometimes there were around a lot of people, so we missed the digging work, and we've certainly been confused about the chaos so there's no accident, but there's nothing else down there," approach Novák.
The analysis ends at the museum's depositary at the castle in the nearby Sleek Rudoltics.
Ukrainian General: I have not yet released from prison
Exclusive conversation Currently.cz with General Volodymyr Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from the occupation of the Russian separatists.
Kyev/Praha - "I'm sorry, I have to take it... call me from Donécka," he apologized about eight times during an exclusive conversation with Actual.cz Ukrainian General Volodymyr Ruban, or also the director of the Foreign Centre for the Liberation of War Entrepreneurs.
Colonel Volodyr Ruban in the television debate.
At any such interruption, it was not possible to ignore the names of people, their numbers or places where they are - or should be - that Ruban would have made clear to his opponent at the second end of the phone.
"It's going to be--go over there," he concluded one of the blank discussions with Donjck and joined us again.
Volodymyr Ruban is a general in the warehouse, some pilots and active participants of anti-government protests in Madanu.
Last night, when we agreed to talk, he was in Dong.
The release of Ukrainian soldiers from the occupation of the Russian separatists shall be made up of fourteen hours a day.
Currently.cz: You may know that on the side of the Persian separatists, the Czechs are also fighting.
Our counterscience estimates their number to thirty.
It can be much more.
Have you met a Czech employee at your meetings?
Volodymyr Ruban: I've already freed the Serbs, the Dagestance, the Chechens, one Sweden, the Georgians... but I'm not waiting yet.
But I know who to go back to Prague, if we were to attack your promised country and could release him.
Ukrainian army occupied by separatists
A.cz: What do you do to Czechs who join the Russian separatists and Ukrainian soldiers are busy?
They should understand that if the Czechs fight in the ranks of volunteers in Ukraine and separatists take them, they will be shot without mercy, just like any other stranger.
The separatists consider these men to be hireable, and they think they deserve nothing more than death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers take up a group of indigenous separatists - and between them they need Czechs - they put him on the grid and they deal with him as a warrior.
This guy's just gonna survive.
The Ukrainian side is also acting as a state in the war.
A.cz: How much have you been able to save Ukrainian employees?
If I understand it well, they'll change it.
Some sources say it's been over hundreds of men for a long time.
We've been counting on how many people we've helped.
But we just released them... they didn't save them before the war if they decided to continue in fear.
The rescuers are in the war for doctors, surgeons, but we're definitely not.
That's right.
And every day they get more and more.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, four or five.
And you don't always have to talk about exchange.
Sometimes it's enough to let people go and only a human request.
A.cz: It turns out that in a few months, you've gained a great authority and trust in the Persian separatists... as well as in the Ukrainian society.
How have you been able to build respect for both sides of the war?
A serious question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me a vision of "a crazy general with steel balls."
It doesn't bother me.
And maybe it's the foundation of our work.
As head of the Ukrainian Congregation of Officials, I've already received some authority from this authority.
I never miss, I don't give up and I always keep my word.
Whatever happens, I'm honest and I'm telling the truth.
Even when it's the Ukrainian government, or the Dutch or Luhanian, it's very unpleasant.
If they torture and kill people?
So I'm just telling them that they're suffering and killing.
And they're crimes.
I'm often at risk of life, even when I'm being replaced and busy... this job for me can mean the end... I don't have to go back.
A.cz: How much corrections and torture do you know about the employees?
... (long silence) The Ukrainians and the separatists are attracted to the torture of the prisoners at the hearings.
I'm sorry.
What about the repairs?
They're just playing on the bottom side.
I don't have any information about the fact that the Ukrainian army also corrects the employees.
Not even indications that the Ukrainian army will allow something like that.
We have an idea of the number of corrections, but I can't put numbers on and I don't want to.
A.cz: Tell me the characters and motives of the Russian separatists.
There are officials among them, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They're trying to be independent and perhaps democracy in the Danube or Luhansk - at least that's what they say.
They don't want to play any more games with Ukrainian oligarchs.
The separatists already have oligarchs with their teeth full of teeth and they are incorrigibly resistant to life and death.
As we say, they ate them up to the throat.
The same dreams and accusations of the people left the village and on Midian.
And now I have a little speculation: Russia supports the separatists and the West against the Ukrainian state.
One speculative considers the big one and the other the opposite is the small one.
Now, this world of mine, but it's hidden in itself by an incalculable dispute.
A.cz: How do you get one of the strongest leaders of the Russian separatists Igor Bezler?
Every time I cross the line of war fronts, I'm without weapons and I'm showing soldiers or armed men who have broken their hands.
And I always have both sides of these two walls or three feet on a man or an optical designer.
Those faces of people who measure up to me, every time I see good... and they can make their weapons hard.
Exhibitor, experienced Colonel with German and Ukrainian predecessors.
He is considered a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
He believes that Ukraine shouldn't exist.
And if so, it's just like a small government in a big Russian empire.
In any case, she continues to talk about it and Ukraine considers it to be some kind of misunderstanding.
Such a state should not even exist.
At the same time, he is an unwarranted enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: When we're talking about the characters - in a discussion show of Ukrainian television you marked your Prime Minister Arsenie Jacenuka as a weak, useless and helpless "leader", who would do the best if he left quickly.
I'll always get at least five times as much fear as I can.
Why, then, should I keep in mind that Jaceňuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is damaging our country?
A.cz: Do you think he has a share in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that Ukrainians of Jacenuka prefer "king."
And the queen is not in the eyes of the Ukrainians an animal from which he would be afraid or in respect of others and authority.
His behavior is directly copied by the queen's behavior.
Maybe it's a good economy, but as a prime minister, he has no right to cry in parliament, ask him, play with him his own interests, threaten that his position is a function... he has to run the country, repair it and in time of war and protect it.
When threatened, the country has no prime minister of wealth for the family, friends, rest for the emotional benefits.
He's the first of the ministers of Ukraine.
What about Jacenus?
She's acting like a puberty girl.
Yeah, he's tired, but he's also weak, because he's never strong... he's not fighting for Ukraine, he's still in trouble.
That's why he should leave.
As before, it's better for Ukraine.
Why the Galaxies could not save the markets
Three Sylvester Stallones returned from the US $90 million budget to less than $30 million and Sin City: Jenska, for which I would have killed only 12 million dollars from the $70 million budget.
Film Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz spent only $14.6 million on the first weekend, as well as films for children like how to raise the kid 2 were for a kay.
According to an article of the film critic Robbie Collina on Telegraph, children's films are about their own quality.
Collin marked the year 2014 as the "lower" year of children's films and how to raise Drake 2 called the only "functional" extension.
When it comes to films set up in a little older target group, the problem seems to be not necessarily in the quality of the film itself.
In July, the Entertainment Weekly servers of CinemaScore and Metacritic compared their average evaluation of the annual film premiums sent at least 2,000 cinemas between the day of the war and 20 July 2013 and this year.
The results taken into account by viewers and film critics indicate that the annual film level is similar to that of London's hits.
According to some commentators, there can be a change in wine in the access of wild animals and higher popularity of Internet servers such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, currently working on Disney's work of the books of the jungle, the Hollywood Reporter website said: "I think time changes."
We have to let this happen and don't try to be ashamed of what's happened.
In contrast to the current Hollywood cash market crisis, Netflix has gained $1.2 billion through Internet services, which is almost twice as much as $837 million in London.
In recent years, director Steven Spielberg has criticized the fact that they rely too much on the rights of comics, and has warned Hollywood's "crowding".
In the light of the current decline, some commentators declare that there can be something on his catastrophic scale.
With the introduction of possible large cash markets in 2015 including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimón and the Yursk world, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
The producer X-Men Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in markets as a simple "cyclical". For Hollywood Reporter said: "The next summer will be the year of the largest cash markets in history and no one will take care of sales."
KLDR again threatened Soul, fired another short flight rocket
North Korea fired another short flight rocket into the sea, announced Soul.
A specific rocket test was carried out shortly after the completion of the joint military maneuvers of the United States and South Korea, which Pchjongjang considers to be a preparation for invasion.
The province of Čagang lies in the northwestern part of KDLR in the border with China.
According to the DPA agency, the South Korean Ministry of Defence indicated that the shootings were fired from the northwestern part of KLDR and flew to a distance of 200 kilometers.
North Korea apparently first fired a rocket from the province of Čagang, introduced the South Korean media with a call to the army circle.
In the province, there is a underground firefight for a Scud-type rocket.
It's another of the series of similar trials carried out by the isolated North Korean regime in the last weeks.
In North Korea this year, a very large number of rocket and semiconductor tests were performed.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
During the weekend, protests against NATO summit protesters were held in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the center of Newport to take part in NATO.
And on Sunday about 150 people came to Cardiff's workshop for a meeting that was described as anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclough observed the situation during the weekend and spoke to protestors who had arrived from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers had to be airborne from Blue Mountains
Two young tourists were picked up by the airport and transported to safety after spending the night in Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
Sixteen-year-old girls and eight-year-old men went to Govets Leap's tour in Blackheath on Sunday.
When they didn't come home, the neighbors called the police about eight o'clock in the evening.
She was sent by the police, including the local police, and the rescue team, and a couple of hours of night were located near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl broke her knee, and the husband fell down, and then he fell to his head.
The police stayed with them during the night, and they were picked up in the morning.
In a stabilized state, the Sanitary was transferred to the Blue Mountain Hospital.
Olomouc brought from Opavia only point, the prize was on the foot of Vasíček
Just 23-year-old forvard could decide, but he failed in two biggest chances.
After the bullet, she shot almost three minutes before the end, instead of in the net, but ended up at the bank of Opawy Joseph Quéton.
I had it on my feet, so I have to give it a chance.
"I'm mad at myself," he said, "and I'm drunk.
"If I had to give it up under the vibe, I'd have a little bit of a seat," he said.
The defense Sigmy did not allow it very much, except for Mikul's 11 minutes ride, which, however, covered the corner of Reichl.
Then they started to push Hanáci, but they didn't allow fire from far away in the shelter block.
We compared fifteen minutes, then we took the initiative.
The second time we were better, we had more games and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But the chance that your chance has not changed, and so it ended 0:0," said coach Hanák Leoš Kalvod.
The story is also about the absence of a group where, in addition to two injured persons, Peter Vavřík, with a triangular shooter, Petre Švečík, who are staying in Sigmy from Sigmy, was also discussed.
This did not make them different from their previous policies.
The supervisors deserve absoluteity.
Sigma made photoballs, but we didn't let her do anything at one standard," said the coach of Slezan's Petr Baranek.
There was a lot of dignity, aggression and war.
Remiza is probably deserved, the point is a good reward for us," he added.
Sigma reached the limit of four points, which means the third place.
Nothing that could calm Joseph Lébra's head of the club, which after the accident had been told by Znojm, would have put his million-dollar investment into a relatively different performances in other stocks.
"We were aware of Mr. Lebra's warning, so it can't be about the boys wanting to fight," looked Kalvoda and added, "I believe it's coming, and when it's gone, it's going to fall to him.
But after the first trip, I'll shoot him right away so he can shoot his balls at other games," Kalvoda said.
Al Pacino took Benátky twice.
The Film Festival otherwise survives the crisis
After a huge surprise over the impressive Birdman film, whose director Alejandro González Ináarrit once organized among the serious candidates at the Golden Lava, the following days showed the impression that he was interested in the 71th anniversary festival in Benáták.
Whether the number of seats in the largest room has increased to fourteen, or because the criticisms have been followed by Birdman, but for the surprises, less attractive pictures like a document on genocide in Indonesia in the 1960s By looking at silence and other films with a social theme from the 99 houses after the Iranian Pods, there was a short stay in the cinema.
Chests of comics
Even the red copper before the festival palace has not yet been exposed to such taxes as in the past, and it is evident that it has been a problem to find a place in the hotel for the last time.
The crisis in Italy is talking more than any other, and it is not surprising that it has reached such a respected institution as Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Unfortunately, the crisis does not result in a lack of personality, however, especially in relation to films.
While younger fans traveled by autographs of the comics of Michael Shannona and Andrew Garfield, who successfully played dramatic roles in 99 houses, the visit of legendary priest Al-Pacin was the main event for all generations without distinction.
He set up here in two movies right now.
In the story of the appearance of a contest that was presented outside the competition that confronted Oscar Barry Levison, according to Roman Philip Roth, has a 14-year-old Pacino role that is closer to him: a priest at the top of glory who suffers from depression at the end of his career and personal life.
But to see him on the second day as a subsidized railway owner from a foreign town in Manglehorn film surrounding David Gordon Green was a truly unforgettable experience.
Volpi's fire for the best heeric performance should not have left him - but does the artist of Pacin's format still need a price?
It may be the greatest satisfaction of the public to him, and especially of Italy, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino is proud of the country from which his relatives come.
Body for Italy
Recently, the Italian film is doing very well in Benátka this year.
The black souls who ruled Francesco Munzi became behind Birdman's first photo of the long-recorded statue.
The calabrian mafia has been taken into account by the family relationship between clans that fight for power and money, and the director has been able to follow all the suggestions for good film: a quality scenario, a camera, music and herce.
He also took possession of the sleepy psychothriller Cold heart that he fought against Severio Costanzo and Albo Rohwacher in the role of a woman who lost her own child in a tragic accident.
On the other hand, the French competition films did not expect the warm reception, nor did 3 hearts, both of which are based on the traditional model of consumer films, which are based on the popularity of the heretical representatives.
But finally, two really real films, and then Birdman and Black souls, aren't at the first half of the festival so small.
And perhaps the festival photos have all the depressive objects, a new picture of Peter Bogdanovich named She's Funny That Way, a funny comedy mentioned in the Benatkas except the competition and the style of American cheerleaders in the '40s, she was able to invite the wearer for more than one day.
Police arrested four pervitin manufacturers in Prague, drugs in Poland
"In recent days, three men 42, 42 and 37 years of age and fifty-five-year-old women who produced and sold pervitin drugs in Prague 9" reported police spokesman Jan Rössler.
First on Tuesday, 12 July, the unit of supplies in the Ciclářska Street caught a 12-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who was in the group as a buyer of medicines in Poland and a dosage.
The next day, the detectives were detained on the basis of the previous agreement of the representative of another member of the group, a seven-year-old man.
The last of the four police officers arrived in the mid-morning hours of 20th August in the area of the Malašic fuel," the speaker wrote.
A third woman received drugs to transport drugs from Poland
The main organizer had a wide field of skills.
He produced pervitin in a part of the summer area, in a garden house in Horomérírica, in the Konovo street and in other places in Prague, provided various aid and chemicals needed for his production and ensured the transport of drugs with pseudoefedrin from the Republic of Poland.
He took the next drug, divided it into plastic bags, and then sold pervitin.
With the transfer of drugs from Poland or the sale of drugs, he was helped by a woman who was not depressed for five decades.
For this, she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third drug produced," added Rössler.
Criminals have also carried out a number of domestic inspections on the basis of the order of the judges, where they have provided drugs, industrial chemicals, digital weights, platinum chains, injection syringes, hats and other aids and articles which, according to the expert, can be considered as complete preparation for the production of methamphetamine.
Dealer has been sentenced seven times since 1995
"Then the police found out from the available records that since 1995, the main organizer has been sentenced to seven times as a result of his own criminal activity, the woman has not been sentenced to trial," the police spokesman added.
In 2006, the last detained was sentenced to sexual abuse, and a seven-year-old auto mechanic who was released was sentenced nine times since 2009.
And it was a serious crime for him.
The investigator accused three men and women of breaking the criminal act of illicit production and other possession of opium and psychotropic substances and of being threatened by ten years of imprisonment.
Finally, three persons were asked to investigate the State representative and to propose an action to be taken by the judge at the end of the trial," said the speaker.
The fourth defendant, a seven-year-old recidist, ended up free.
His position and role in this case were not as fundamental as that of the other accused.
Police are still working with this man.
Ferrari offers wooden and carbon chips.
Ferrari offers very interesting things in the context of his other products for a lot of "interested" prices.
As a good example, you can use hand-made chess with a board game of 42 x 42 cm.
If you like it, prepare more than 40,000 Kč.
The exact price makes 43 405 Kč.
The customer gets the fruit of wood black and red laminated figures placed in a wooden box covered with carbon fibers.
It's probably not surprising to anyone that instead of a classic race, players have a picture of a riding horse.
If the checks do not give you enough value, the Ferrari 500 F2 model is also available (of course manually) at 1:1,8.
The price of this game makes 318 305 Kč.
The destruction of gymnasiums and high school doesn't make sense.
Česko has a small number of people generally educated and statistics also show that gymnasiums have good use.
The beginning of the school year is here.
In schools in the last fourteen days, great preparations were being made.
Most of the routine concerns, such as the transfer of the flowers from the summer station back to the class and the drawings.
They're going to have a little bigger fruit.
A few days before the start of the season, they collect furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature into the library.
The four-year-old gymnasium in Horíčia has not come to the lobby and is opening up and renewing its work.
Not on a public platform, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the inability of the depositors.
They had to wait for whether the existing schools would be confirmed by being transferred to the MSMT school register.
"The French Socialists should hide and order France," said the key link Francoise Holland
Walls calls for a strongly broken left to "show her support" to the combated socialist president, whose new division did not meet with the consent of most French.
The President deserves general respect, deserves loyalty, deserves our support.
"Our duty is to stay on his side," he said and calmed down.
As a peaceful gesture, the President of the Government has maintained that his government will not fail to mislead the controversial French thirty-year-old working week, despite the generous income from Emmanuel Macrona, a new finance minister who at the beginning of the week proposed that the rules be set free.
On Saturday, the Netherlands asked socialists to remain "sustained" with the government.
Christiane Taubirov, a minister of justice, made a mark on his initiative when she appeared at a meeting of rebel Socialist MPs, where the Socialist side criticized her for “the loss of belief in the future by France.”
Marine Le Penov, an extremely conservative law, laughed at persistent internal conflicts between socialists when she declared that she did not predict that the new Walls government would last longer than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is a liar and Prince Manuel Walls too. They were forced to set up a new government when the past did not last until the end of the year.
"And the new will not continue until the end of the winter or winter," said Le Penov to his guests.
She reiterated her call for Parliament's release and said she was convinced that the party could win early elections and that it was ready to run the country.
The French ruling party suffered in the maritime municipal elections of pollution and in May the extreme conservative right was successful in the elections to the European Parliament.
According to a survey of public opinion in the week Journal du Dimanche, 76% of French people believe that the Socialist party is at risk that it will be divided into several rival groups even before the end of the Dutch working period in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the University of Sciences Po, warned that French people will soon be suffering if the new socialist government is unable to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"It is a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that the situation is changing," he warned.
Otherwise, things could get worse.
Hazard and street art Praha no longer restricts the election
The amendments to the relevant statements should be prepared and approved until the new leadership of the main city.
The streets of Prague will not disappear before the municipal elections, and the city will not limit street art.
It won't even be allowed to marry dogs.
The Prague will not arrive at the October elections to prepare and approve the amendment of the relevant statements.
"The decision to change should also not make the current leadership of the city that ends within a few weeks," said Councilman Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
In recent weeks, several workshops, such as Prague 5 and 7.
But Herny doesn't disappear, the gambling announcement will not be changed yet.
It's the task of the new city administration after the elections.
Now we wouldn't even get it technically, for example, for the length of the reminder and the like," Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current representative, to be approved by the amendment of the statement, will be held on 11 September.
The referendum on the broad ban of Hazard is held on the day of municipal elections in Prague 1 and Prague 8.
At the present time, you will be required to order a hairdresser, for example in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
For the same reasons, the report will not be changed even in the case of street art, so-called busing.
In particular, Praha 1, who has already sent the Magistrate of a site proposal, which would like to expand the current list of prohibited places.
The singers also don't want Praha 5 around Angel.
A report regulating the marriage of dogs in the city lasts a few months, and is not yet completed.
The location of Heren and the problem of busing solves the city's statements.
It can be issued or modified only by the representative of the main city.
The councils only have a voice of advice, they can't make a statement by themselves.
Last week gave victory to the advocates of the Scottish independence to reach the hand
The Scottish independence campaign was in danger of making this mistake when little by little she placed on the billboards all over Scotland the question of whether Scotti wants to be rich.
Only to the hearts of Scottish voters will you not be able to appeal to their money, nor will you gain their respect when you start threatening them.
The moral of the New Law is still alive in Scotland, although only a few Scots still go to church today.
The Scots have a far greater tendency to remove the changers from the temple than to let them dictate how to vote.
The head of Scottish nationalists Alex Salmond knew this well, and therefore in the television discussion he repeatedly asked his opponent, Unionist Darling, if he was willing to respect "the sovereign will of the Scottish people", if the Scottish voters voted for independence and began to support a single currency for Scotland and for England.
It was Darling's gift to love the Scottish civil society and London's financials, and he fell into this trap.
Of course Darling doesn't support the orders of Scottish voters.
However, this debate on what will be held by Scotland has been largely neutralized.
What really motivates the Scottish Volcano is the fervor, the employment opportunities and the defence of public health, which are free of charge.
Darling supported the London banker in exchange and also called for the idea that he would not protest against privatization of health.
As Samand said, "he went to bed with the conservators."
This is a very dangerous position for every Scottish policy.
Every Scottish volunteer knows that Scottish businessmen are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who never spoke to the voters in Scotland, but to the "boss" association, to the Confederal of the British Industry.
It becomes clear that Cameroon's refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmon was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like an obsessive housewife.
Scots would respect him if he came to the debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
Cameron could at least say that Scotland could be "a successful independent country".
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, causing him almost physical pain.
What he says is clear: Scots don't have to jump and have to accept what they are.
The next year is 10 months.
Pessimistic start of school according to Milosche Urbana
Illustration to tell a story Next year
Dear Urban First Year
The end was the best of holidays, the last week that was never going anywhere, and we only had lunch and dinner with my grandmother in the summer, quiet before the storm, calm before the stress.
A new dress when it was possible to get out of Tuzex, bottles from East Germany.
The reading of the rapid steps, already falling, the climbing around the hill of the Empire to the back of the Vale, some to the tennis court, was no longer a vista, the sun cooled behind and the shoulder, the paps were thrown to the loose.
The evening of moderate nervousness, still empty mode, sleeps up to half a week, gets worse, minutes before I wake up from a couple of minutes in two hours, then get up in half seven in the morning.
He's coming tomorrow.
Most of the time, however, it's getting worse in the summer before school.
Adding to the bright light on the plate and becoming like a plastic stand in a glass bag, there's this school, ZDŠ A.
The West with a heavy pink shirt, and before it, the old face also has a few new faces, the guys are more distant, the girls are more hairy.
They're funny here, they're avoiding, they're just as interesting as they're keeping their jobs wrong and they're here fast.
And these grown-up girls who came up with a hug now laughs at something hysterically, maybe something changed in their life over their empty space while I have everything in my old age.
And there's a new prime minister, some nerves and other entertainment, why are they even here?
Because they have to teach the military.
So inside, the cold humidity of the floor and the light patch of the disinfection, the excavated student with the mope, still lamented the same thing as the first to borrow the key from the thumbs where they are allowed to leave the classrooms and which are still so small.
For the bottle.
The ice cream stays in mind, now it's gone, it's pretty spread, but it's gonna be worse in a week.
It's just that it's just that it's getting sick and it's starting to get a headache.
The title that we'll still learn from mathematics, the devil games for people I don't belong to, and I'll never be.
Again, the three and four, the youngest five, hide before the test, fall into the lab, and best sublimate, be there, just exist as a name in the classroom, and still eat stories about nice girls and beautiful buildings, the antennas in the universe where no one disagrees with, does not humiliate anyone, and does not look at anyone.
The next year is ten months.
And it's the first day, just like years ago.
The birth of her daughter was allowed to die.
She's threatened with extraterrestrial punishment - Novinky.cz
The first birth took place in March 2012 at a public toilet at the railway station in Jihlava.
Without any foreign help, she was born a girl who, after hitting the pumpkin, hid under the trunk and took her to the railway driver, where she was placed in a series of several decades from the train.
She was born on her way to school.
It came to me a little earlier.
I was on my way to school.
I had to go to the bathroom in the bus, and I was born there.
She was born alive. She looked at me.
I broke my hips to the school," she wrote regretfully and pointed out that she was pregnant before school.
"The next day she returned to the place, the child's body was put in a bag and carried, the body was taken out of the bag, wrapped in a black igalit pit and hid and left under the roof of her grandmother's house in Havlíčka's boat," they complain that it was not quite obvious when it came to the death of the newborn.
It could be in ten minutes, but even a few hours after birth, breathing when hiding the baby or when put under the bag, bleeding or bleeding from an unsubstantiated pumpkin.
A similar scenario was repeated next year on fire.
A woman near the time of birth was found from the spring to the 12th of April, when the child was found lying under the bed of a fisherman in Havlíčkobrodsk, she also had a secret birth.
This time in the bathroom in the basement in the family home.
Before she checked whether she was born alive, without shooting, and she had a doll that was surrounded around the church, she put the child in a few plastic bags, including the needle bag, and left it in the bathroom.
In the afternoons, he and his partner took him to the fishing business.
Finally, she remained a friend.
The father was a true friend who was not aware of the difficulties of the partners.
And for that reason, they are not before the court, only because he was accused of a violation of the anti-fraud law.
It was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like that he's not respected as a partner.
He was manipulating the baby against my request.
I know my solution wasn't right, but it came to me right now as a human," she did not hide the disappointment that a certain man had in his relationship and feared him.
During her speech, a young woman spoke fairly.
The tears of her eyes reached the point where she spoke about the relationship with her parents, who left after she reached adulthood.
She didn't want to kill her first.
"He goes after me every 14 days to visit, they do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she cried.
I didn't take a lesson because I didn't want children, I seemed young.
I wanted to give him a baby box, but I don't know what happened that I didn't do.
I can't explain it to you," answered the judge's question.
She refused, however, to go along with the thought and the intention of killing the newborn.
The second child, according to her claim, was born dead.
She didn't stop drinking alcohol in her pregnancy.
But I've limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
And I've mixed smoking," she said.
Although she was pregnant in both cases, she insisted on repeated questions that she had health problems that she was pregnant.
And that's what friends do.
The main appeal will be continued in the building court on Tuesday in court hearings.
In the middle of the day, the judgment could have already been passed.
A woman is threatened with a prison sentence of up to 18 years, possibly with a third exception.

Prodemocratic activists in Hong Kong the day after the vote are brought by the Chinese authorities
A group of people who were loyal to Beijing, who had a Chinese train, was nearby.
The Standing Commission of the National Human Congress agreed on Sunday that only two out of three candidates would participate in the elections in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first receive support from the appointing committee, which will likely be composed of faithful Beijing members.
As a result of this decision, opposition democracy is almost impossible to obtain on election papers and to allow pro-democratic activists to renew promises and protect Hong Kong's financial centre of protest against the "Central occupation".
In Hong Kong, political reform is a major cause of tension, and Chinese leaders fear that the demand for democracy will be extended to other cities.
After Beijing published in June a detailed report on China's official law in Hong Kong, democratic activists organized an informal referendum on elections in the special official forum, and hundreds of thousands of people entered and occupied the city square.
The press conference at which Prime Minister Li organizes the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese Association Office in Hong Kong.
During the day, several press conferences were also to be held by the Vice-President of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission of Zhang Ronghsun and the Deputy Director of the State Council of the Office for Hong Kong and Macau Feng Wei.
The students reported that the afternoon meeting was held in front of Hong Kong government offices.
By the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain has never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kyev to start negotiations with eastern Ukraine on "state sovereignty"
According to Russian newspapers, Russian President Vladimir Putin, on Sunday, asked the Ukrainian government to stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately start the "state sovereignty" movement.
His spokesman Dmitry Peskov later explained that Putin did not mean that the regions of eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be revised so that the Russian-speaking region would have the right to protect its rights and interests.
Putin's challenge to the Ukrainian government to deal with the pro-russian uprisings as they are equal, is consistent with the apparent strategy that leads to the outbreak of the disturbances five months ago: Help the separatists to occupy the territory and grant the Ukrainian government the new declared New Russia in fact to be able to connect to Russia instead of the West.
In the discussion for the first state television channel Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions, which had to regain the eastern regions of Donécka and Luhansk, which ruled in March and in depth separatist after Moscow announced on 18 March the Crimean peninsula belonging to Ukraine.
The Kremlin and separatist recently occupied territories have been marked as "New Russia" or "New Russia", a term referring to the glorious days of the Russian Empire.
The Russian press agency Itar-Tass published Putin's words that “the prison is an illusion” by everyone who believes there is a peaceful conduct because Ukrainian politicians have launched a campaign before parliamentarian elections on October 26th, while government units attack civil society in the areas of separatists.
"In the interests of people living in these areas, we need to start a meaningful conversation, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organization of society and the state sovereignty of southern Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said that Putinov's invasion of state sovereignty was thought to be in the context of broader autonomy, which, with the leadership of Kyeva, has been a few months and should reduce the concerns of Russian-speaking areas from the threat of cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov indicated that the necessary autonomy could only be granted to the eastern region by the Ukrainian government.
It is not a matter of crossing between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The extension of the language Kremlin, which was supposed to correct the "inaccurate interpretation" of the Putin notes, highlighted Russia's approach to resolving the rise of separatists in the east, which is different from the openness of Crimea, where most of the two million people are divided into ethnic Russia.
Moscow would have much more difficulty in annotating Donæck and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million citizens are not Russians and public opinion surveys, which were still under way prior to the conflict, have shown widespread support for residency in Ukraine.
The autonomy of Russian diplomats in international forums to allow the regional government in Ukraine to determine its own trade agreements and international relations, and in particular to give Kremlin effective control over the territories that would link the Russian flag with the Krypney.
The Black Sea Pole, annektowed five months ago, is the seat of the main Russian sea fleet, the sea-trading territory and historical coastal resorts.
The areas between the Russian Rostov and Krym are also medium down, stocked and lightweight, which produce important components for the Russian army.
The Ukrainian President, Peter Prorošenko, during his opening speech on 7 June, proposed that Ukrainian lawmakers, after new elections, consider changes in the constitution that would give different regions more control over their financial and linguistic status.
This view of autonomy, however, differs significantly from the view of Kremlin and separatists.
Putin's last challenge to make Kyev treat separatists as equals after the next attack by the rebels last week after the Russian units and tanks of the former calm area of the Azov Sea were crossed in eastern Ukraine.
The Russian separatist forces have taken control of Novoazovsk so that Ukrainian security authorities are afraid that one of the objectives of the strategic coastal territories is to reach Crimea.
This has intensified the enormous civil and military effort to rebuild Mariupol, a port of 500 000 citizens with metallurgy combinations, which lies between Novoazovsk and the barrier of entry to the Crimean Peninsula.
On Saturday, the Presidents of the European Union met in Brussels on Saturday and called for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for the last 23 years.
"We are approaching a point from which there is no return," Prorošenko warned.
In Ukraine there are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of other tanks.
The EU summit has not taken any definitive steps - leaders call for further sanctions against Russia in the event of a more specific scale of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andrej Lysenko, speaking of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council on Saturday to reporters in Kiev, said Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovakia after two weeks of Russian-backed vehicles and 1,000 military units crossed the Danube to support the wounded separatists.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers reported to have been involved in the Russian invasion in Ilovakia was replaced on Sunday by the 10 Russian officers employed week ago in the country of Ukraine, he said on Sunday Lysenko.
There are also Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko.
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disappointment over hackers who probably stole his intimate photos of Gabi Greco and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after the biggest scandal with the hacked photo of the celebrity was released on the Internet series of explicit photos by Jennifer Lawrence.
Hacker claims he has sixteen photos with our star Hungary Games Lawrence and other stars, including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, singer Rihanny, Ariany Grande and Lee Michel and heretic Kirsten Dunstow.
Thanks to the exception of iCloud, personal photos of Australian heretics Teresa Palmer, Emily Brownings, Yvonne Strahowski and Melbourn's heretics have also been received publicly.
There's 101 celebrate on the list.
Edlsten, who asked for a hand from Greece last month, said to the Confidential magazine: “It’s ridiculous."
All private correspondence and all private images should remain private.
It's a shame that personal information can be stolen and spread to the public.
Greece, which is now in New York, reported online news reports that hacking is “unsatisfied” and those who have become its target “are vulnerable”.
It's because hacker got thirty photos of Palmer with former friend Scott Speedman, including two photos that are on top of the pool without a break.
Palmer's effect, for example, in the movie Love and honor where he was her predecessor, Liam Hemsworth.
The Palmer, the star of the Chuck Strahovski TV series and the hero of the Sucker Punch Browning yesterday did not comment on stolen photos.
The representative of the Lawrence TMZ said: "It's a clear violation of privacy."
Herec Seth Rogen hacker on his Twitter criticised: "To publish photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as to sell stolen goods."
From a legal point of view, publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
The Football Sigmys have made Lebra, and no prizes.
Olomouc - Hromy and the blocs that the co-founder Sigmy Josef Lébr sat on his underprivileged last week, are, it seems, past.
The only point to be brought from Opavia is to bring it to the end.
The discovery and the fighting of the club's boss had only a little bit improved.
The money to pay for it could come to the club soon.
"I'm leaving another game as I talked about last week, but I'm much more optimistic," claimed Lebr, although Sigma didn't win, her players convinced her performance improved.
The fight and the puzzle we played most of the second time was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
In this case, I'm able to forgive that he doesn't win.
If we've played this since the beginning of the season, I'm sure we haven't won yet," Lebr thinks.
Sigma stopped home pressure in Opava, then the game got better, and in the second half it was better.
After Calvin's victory, the believers went to hell, but they didn't get their chances for gambling, so they couldn't win.
The result of the network is not according to our idea.
For complete peace we missed but only one changed chance," said Lebra, who but does not think that the change in the access of the footballers only made his appearance.
There must have been more aspects there.
Be on my side, on the trainer's side, or fans," said Lebr.
The pressure must be calculated by Sigma
Players didn't want to comment on the events from last week.
I'm trying to get these things away completely.
I've tried not to admit it," wrote young banker Michael Reichl.
Then, without comment, he left a question on Lébrova's statement from last week's attacker Václav Vasžiček, who has not changed the biggest opportunity of Sigmy in the Saturday game.
But after all, he just talked a little bit about the pressure.
We're still under pressure.
Everybody wants to get us out of here.
Today we have shown that if we fight and run everyone after shit, that's how it goes," he said.
Warnings took hold of the heart
Even Mr. Leoš Kalvoda did not point out that the preparation for the event was not the easiest view of the atmosphere in Olomouc during the past week.
It was hard enough.
But I think the boys realized it, and today it was seen that Mr. Lebra's warning took them to the heart.
Even though it wasn't before that they didn't want to fight and take it away," said the oomous coach.
It was like today's first fifteen minutes.
It's been a while before we compared ourselves to the firm, and they realized what the other league is.
That it's not just about football, but mainly about that fight," Kalvoda said.
There's no hope that Sigme's been working since the beginning in the next game.
"I'd love to believe it," he added.
