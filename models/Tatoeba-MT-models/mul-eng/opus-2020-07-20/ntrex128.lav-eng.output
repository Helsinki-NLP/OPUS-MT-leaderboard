Members of the General Assembly (AM) are stressed by the possibility of "be able to hold the doors as doors"
The members of the House of Commons have been concerned about the proposal to change their name to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament — Member of the Velsa Parliament).
Its purpose is to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
In all political spheres, AM is concerned that this can make them an object of ridicule.
One of the Leiborist Party's A.M. explained that their group is worried about "the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Velas: "twp" means "right", but "pwp" means "ko".
The Party Plaid AM indicated that none of the group "was satisfied" and recommended alternatives.
The representative of the Whole Conservative Party recognises that his group is ready to consider a change of name, but adds that "MWP" is very similar to "Muppet", which means "warm".
In this context, it must be taken into account that the English word "w" is spoken like the Jorkiri dialect "u".
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently developing for the purpose of amending the draft legislation, was informed: "The final decision on which terms will be used to mark the members of the Assembly is, of course, to be taken by the members of the Assembly themselves."
The German Government (Government of Wales) Act of 2017 granted the Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation of the proposals and received broad support for the change in the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Speaking on behalf of the AM, the Commission promoted the Welsh Parliament Member (WMP), but the MWP received the largest support in public consultation.
Of course, AM offers alternative options, but the fight against agreement can cause headaches to the Assembly's army Elina Jones (Elin Jones), which will probably present a legislative draft for changes in the next few weeks.
The draft legislation on changes will also include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including legislation on the structure of the AM Dissemination and Committees System.
AM final vote on how they will be called will be taken when the legislative acts have been discussed.
Macedonians will vote in the referendum on the change in national name
The voters vote on Sunday whether their national name will be changed to the Republic of Montenegro.
The people's vote was organised to resolve the long-term dispute with the neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia for decades.
Athens has long argued that the name of the Nordic neighbour has an impact on its territory and has been opposed several times to Macedonia's request to be accepted by the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov (Gjorge Ivanov), one of the lobbyists on the change of name, announced that he would ignore the vote.
However, the rapporteur's supporters, including Prime Minister Zoranu Zajev (Zoran Zaev), argue that the change of name is simply a matter to be taken into account in order to establish the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's god's call calls to question the existence of Harlem's churches.
"As told by the old people I talked to, every star was at the bar and the goddess," said Mr. Adams.
"No more one now, no more."
He admits that the removal of the bar is understandable.
"People today socialize in other ways," he said.
"There's hardly any room in the living room that people visit regularly."
Speaking even to the gods, he is concerned that the money he receives by selling the property will end faster than expected the leaders, "and sooner or later they will be back at the start".
For God’s sake, he added that it is possible to be replaced with the buildings of many peoples with the properties of their homes in which people who do not help the remaining shrines are found.
"Most of the people who will buy the property of these buildings will be white," he explained, "and until that time, when these gods will be hidden at all times, there is little hope that most of the people who will acquire the properties of these houses will become members of these threats."
Both gods formed a white circle — the Metropolis (Metropolitan) community in 1870 — ten years before Harlem became a black metropolis — and St. Martina.
The original white-mechanists friendship of the building was destroyed by the fall of the 20th century.
The building enjoyed a close relationship with God.
St. Martin's Godship took his blessing during John Howard Johnson (John Howard Johnson). In 125th Street, in the main shopping street in Harlem, he led a working retailer boy who had refused to accept a job or give them a promotion.
In 1939, Ugunsgray seriously damaged the building, but since Father Johnson’s friends planned to restore it, they ordered a call.
His compliments to David Johnson (David Johnson), his father's son and successor to St. Martin's friend, the game called the game "for the innocent people's calls".
The expert, who played this call game in July, used the other words: "Culture Award" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert Tiffany Ng (Tiffany Ng) from Michigan University added that it was the first known game in the world that was played by the black musician Dionisio A. Linds (Dionisio A. Lind) who was transferred to the largest known game in the Rivershad church 18 years ago.
Mr Merrivezere (Merriweather) said that St. Martin's friend did not replace him.
The events of the last few months around St. Mary’s God reflected the relationship of the assembled architects and builders, some of whom had been in the work of time but others — the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the Council of Friends, formed by temporary leaders, referred in writing to the diocese with fears that the diocese "will attempt to pay the costs" to the Council, although the Council has not been involved in the agreement of the disseminating architects and builders.
Some members of the company complained about the lack of transparency in the activities of the diocese.
Haizivs vaccinated 13-year-olds at the fishing site
Hayiv, a 13-year-old son, who was born after the bears, attacked him on the sixth day of the bear season, reports the news.
An attack took place just before 7 a.m., near the town of Beacon's Beach, in the town of Encinita.
Chad Hammels (Chad Hammel) informed KSWB-TV Sandjego that he and his friends had been down for about half an hour in the morning when he heard that the son was calling for help, and then the group rushed to him to help the child get out of the water.
Hammels explained that at first he had thought that it was just a feeling of nocturnal nightmare, but then he realized that the son cried "I'm telling you!
I'm sorry!"
All of his key bones were exposed," said Hammels, who immediately noticed it when it reached the baby.
"I'm crying for everyone to know the water: "The water is empty!" Hammels added.
The son of air transport was transferred to the Children’s Hospital in Rady, Sandjego, where his condition was recognised as critical.
The endangered species is unknown.
Lary Giles, captain of the rescue team, told freely that a few weeks earlier in this area, it was recognized that it was not a dangerous species.
Jails added that the upurim was traumatized to the upper part of the rupture.
For the purpose of the investigation, the staff for 48 hours closed access to Pontobiča (Ponto Beach) in Casablad, to Swami (Swami's) Encinitas (Encinitas) city.
Jails indicated that there are more than 135 species of sharks in this area, but most are not considered to be dangerous humans.
Sansbury's plan to enter the United Kingdom beauty market
"Sainsbury's" goes to the "Boots", "Superdrug" and "Debenhams" attack with a universally-class beauty shopping product for rowing and trained sellers.
As part of the significant contribution made by the United Kingdom to the large retail market, which continues to grow, despite the decline in fashion goods and household items, in 11 trading countries, larger retail markets will be tested and, if all of them are successful in the next year, more such goods will be available.
In the accounting sector, funds are invested when large companies are looking for opportunities to use flowers that were previously open to televisions, microwaves and household goods.
"Sainsbury's" reported that it would double its offer in the area of beauty purchase to up to 3000 products, including brands such as "Revlon", "Essie", "Tweezerman" and, for the first time, "Dr. PawPaw".
The existing lines from "L'Oreal", "Maybelline" and "Burt's Bees" will also receive more places with brand zones, such as "Boots" in business.
The factory also re-enters its "Boutique" decorative cosmetic line, in which most of the products will be friendly to the vans, which is increasingly demanded by younger buyers in years.
In addition, the bulk of the butter trader Fragrance Shop will try the concession in two "Sainsbury's" shops, which were first opened in the previous week in Croydon, London, but the second will be opened in Seliou (Selly Oak) Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and switching to small purchases of food every day in local shops means that large companies need to invest more to convince people to visit them.
"Sainsbury's" Executive Director Mike Koups (Mike Coupe) said that the trading venues of goods will become even more similar to the universal business because the trade chain is trying to fight the discounts "Aldi" and "Lidl", offering a larger range of services, but without food.
"Sainsbury's" has set up the shopping places of "Argos" in several hundred shops and has opened several "Habits" since purchased both chains two years ago, which, as is claimed, has improved goods' properties and made the purchase more productive.
The previous attempt to improve its sections of beauty and pharmaceuticals ended with the result.
Sansbury's joint venture with Boots was tried at the beginning of 2000, but the Union won after the conflict, how to share income from the wholesale business of the whole product.
The new strategy will be developed after Sansbury's sold its 281 large pharmaceutical business to the owner of the chain "Celesio", "Lloyds Pharmacy" for 125 million coins.
In accordance with this plan, Lloyds will complement the range with a wide range of exclusive skin feeding products, including Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hiks (Paul Mills-Hicks), the businessman director of Sainsbury's, said: "In order to improve the customer's thinking environment, we have transformed our beauty products into a golden ring of appearance and the effect it has on them.
We have also invested funds in particularly trained colleges, who will always be ready to give advice.
The range of our brands is designed to meet all needs, but an attractive environment to the point where we are now enthralled on the road to beauty, a goal that leads to the introductions of previous purchases."
Peter John's "nominee's full" after Hollyia Viloubia gave up 11 million thefts
The "Dragon Dan" star Peter Jones (Peter Jones) "has changed his nose" after Holly Willoughby, director of TV broadcasts, rejected from 11 million coins with his lifestyle mark to focus all attention on his new contracts with "Marks and Spencer" and "ITV"
Viloubia has no time to assign their home fee and accessories to "Truly".
After the business was compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow brand "Goop".
"This Morning" was 37 years old, using Instagram to announce her prom.
Hollyia Viloubia has remembered the star "Dragons den" in the spirit of Peter Jones, for the last time came out of his profit-making business – to focus all attention on his new big contracts with "Marks & Spencer" and "ITV".
The information sources claim that Jones was "innocent" when a TV gold girl broke up during a meeting on Tuesday in his business empire residence in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new contracts, which are worth up to 1.5 million dollars, meant that she no longer had time to pay for her home fees and accessories label "Truly".
The company was compared to the Gvinnetas Platrova brand Goop, and, according to the house, it will twice increase the wealth of Viloubia, which, as a reader, achieves 11 million pounds.
When Viloubia (37) used Instagram to announce that the name "Truly", Jones was excommunicated from Britain on one of his holiday homes.
As a source of information: "Truly" was itself the main priority of Holly's priorities.
It had to be his long - term future, for which he would be assigned in the next decade.
Her decision to expose all the non-preparations involved.
No one could tell what happened the other day: everything was so close to the start.
In the centre of Marlova there is a warehouse full of ready-made goods for sale."
Experts believe that "This Morning" managers, which is one of the most financially profitable stars, can pay millions of dollars to the company, as very much money has been invested in various products — from carpets and candles, to clothing and goods at home, and will further delay placing them on the market.
And that can mean the long-term end of friendship.
The three children’s mother, Viloubia, and her husband, Dan Baldwin (Dan Baldwin), have maintained a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Viloubia "Truly" was established with Kepu in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as President in March.
Both shared holidays, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in the company of Boldvina TV producers.
Viloubia has to become a brand M&S messenger and replaces Entu Macpartlin (Ant McPartlin) as an ITV "I'm A Celebrity".
John's close source said last night, "We don't want to comment on his business transactions!"
A serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He was aware of the criticism received from the company about a comment that some might recognize as "the president unapproachable", and that he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why is the president so much to refuse?
Tramps said in his dream "known dictator" voice.
"I didn't give up on anything!"
He pointed out that Kim had shown interest in meeting again once again after Tramps recognized his initial visit to Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
However, negotiations on denuclearization have stopped.
More than three months after June, one of the major North Korean diplomats, Ri Yong Ho (Ri Yong Ho), informed world leaders in the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see the US "response" response" to the initial arms struggle in North Korea.
Instead, he pointed out that the US continued sanctions aimed at maintaining justice.
Tramps were much more optimistic in his speech.
"We have a great relationship with North Korea," he said.
"We were ready to fight with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have these great relationships."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kimu have resulted in positive results — stopping rocket testing tests, helping to free hostages and the rest of the American soldiers returning home.
And he defended his unusual approach in relation to Kim.
"There's just an impression of the President, but instead of being out there 10,000 people trying to get into this densely populated area, we have 200, look, here," Tramps said, pointing to the effort right in front of him.
Cunami and earthquake in Indonesia set up an island to kill hundreds of people
Following the earthquake in Lomboka, for example, non-governmental organisations were told that they did not need assistance.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombo has been moved, the situation of the national disaster has not been explained, but it is necessary to propose foreign aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have very clearly thanked them for not asking for international assistance, so it is a known problem," said Mrs. Sumbunga (Sumbun).
Although "Save the Children" collects groups to move to Pal, it is still not clear whether foreign workers can work there.
Mr Sutopo, representative of the National Disaster Agency, explained that the Indonesian officials valued the situation of Pala to see if the international agencies could make their contributions.
Given that earthquakes are taking place regularly in Indonesia, the country remains extremely vulnerable to natural disasters.
Although the Aceh (Aceh) has been established in condoms, these are rarely encountered along other shores.
Likely, the people’s calamity also affected the fact that Palu did not heed the warning of tsunamis, even though the warning was in force.
Even the best time for moving between many islands in Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters add to the burden of logistics.
The ship’s hospital, which was located in Lombo to treat earthquakes, is now going to Pal, but it will take at least three days to reach the new foothills.
President Joko Vidodo (Joko Vidodo) of Indonesia has made improvements in the complex infrastructure of Indonesia as a central point of the campaign, and he has allocated large amounts to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has led to Mr Joko's administration and his next year is expected to be re-elected.
In addition, Mr Joko has to fight a long-term problem, which results in the division of Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims have adopted one of the conservative forms of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were taken out of their homes as Christians and Muslims fought on the streets using swords, clubs, clubs, and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool player Daniel's Starijs with pride restores balance against Chelsea
Daniel's Starridge (Daniel Sturridge) saved Liverpool from the loss of Chelsea in its premier, bearing the words in the 89th minute of the sixth day at St.ford Bridge in London.
The Starridge received a game from Jerdana Šakiri (Xherdan Shaqiri), about 25 metres (30 yards) from the gates of Chelsea when his team lost by 1:0.
He moved a bomb a little by the side of himself and then played a bomb next door to the room.
In this attempt, a bomb flew over the field, reaching the top of the network’s top good noise.
At the end of the bombing, the head of Kepa Arrizabalaga (Kepa Arrizabalaga) was crossed into the river and was placed on the network.
"I've just tried to get their position to be at the bomb, and players like Shaq (Shaq) always play as far ahead as possible, so I'll just try to get myself as long as possible," Starridge explained LiverpoolFC.com.
"I've seen Kante (Kante) approaching, squeezing the bomb, and, far from thinking, power."
Chelsea was headed by 1:0 after 25 minutes after the words of the golden star Eden Azards (Eden Hazard).
The Blues attacker played a bomb back to Mateo Kovačić (Mateo Kovacic), before moving to the middle of the village and at the maximum speed of the town of Liverpool.
Kovači quickly played and received a bomb back in the middle of the village.
Then he made a beautiful bridge between the players by allowing Azardam to enter the area.
Azards exceeded the speed of protection and finished the combination with the left leg of the next room on the network of Liverpool, along with Elison Becker (Alison Becker).
"Leverpool" in the team of the Champions League on Wednesday at 15.00 "Stadio San Paolo" Naples (Italy) will fight with "Napoli".
The "Chelsea" with "Video" UEFA will be held in London on Thursday at 15.00 a.m.
The number of Indonesian tsunamis reaching 832 people
The number of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia has reached 832 people, as reported by the National Disaster Agency on Sunday.
It has been reported that many people have been exposed to the roofs of buildings after 7.5 magnitudes of large earthquakes, which visited the country on Friday and caused up to 20 feet (~6.0 m) high, informing the conference of the Agency’s representative Sutopo Purvo Nugroho (Suptopo Purwo Nugroho).
More than 380,000 people lived in the city’s town covered the ruins of broken buildings.
Police suspected a woman's rape in custody of 32-year-old men
The investigation was initiated after the women's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old bull with three-year-olds was found at 7.55 in the Grayson Mews Street, and he suspected that he had been arrested by 32 - year - olds.
The police have called on people in this family who have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brians O'Hagan (Brian O'Hagan) reported: "The investigation has just begun, but I want to call on everyone who was around John's street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious.
I also invite each, especially the cab drivers, who may have set something in their car video recorders' materials, to contact us, as they may have important information for our search."
The police representative confirmed that the woman whose body had been found was a local residents of Birkenheda, and she was found in her possession.
This afternoon, friends who think they know women have gone to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and as the police were informed, they were working with Upur's closest relatives to informing them.
The cab driver living in Greisonmjüz tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one could enter or take it.
He could not say a word when he learned what had happened.
People will be informed that the hours will pass before they will be allowed to return.
It was heard that a policeman told a man that all suspicion was a crime scene.
In the crime scene, women appeared in the camp.
She continues to say, "It's so funny!"
Two afternoons in the corridor, there were two police cars, and another one was placed right outside.
Several police officers were stationed inside the cordon and controlled the homes of multiple citizens.
All who have information are requested to use DM @MerPolCC by 30 September to call 101 or contact "Crimestopers anonymously" by phone 0800 555 111 named 247.
Cromvela's status in Parliament becomes the latest "recording of history" scandal
Its rejection would be justified in view of the activities similar to that of Taliban, which resulted in numerous memories of the culture and religion of England.
However, Mr Crick's proposal by Cromwell's company was marked by "study" and "study to try to re-write stories".
John Goldsmiths (John Goldsmith), president of the Cromvela Society, said: "In view of the ongoing debate on the removal of the status quo, it was inevitable that the goal would also be to become Oliver Kromvela's figure outside the city of Westminster.
Cromwell himself did not wish to do it, nor did he perform the celebration during the civil war of England.
It is possible that the wrong Cromvel will be defeated by his predecessor, who lived centuries ago because of the actions of Thomas.
Sera William Hemo Sorneikroff (Sir William Hamo Thornycroft) is a 19th-century painting of Cromvela and is part of a history of a person who, as many think, still deserves to be praised.
Goldsmith (Goldsmith) reported on Sunday Telegraph: "Many Cromwells, possibly more than today at the end of the 19th century, considered Parliament's defence against external pressure, of course, was monarchy.
The next historical debate on whether this is really a full-fledged presentation of the subject.
Clearly, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has determined the future of our nation, and Cromvel as such is a well-known personality that represents one of the long-term dividends.
What she has achieved, being the guardian of the Lord, is worth burning and remembering."
Cúca-slapkava until death of farmers in China
According to the information available on the local media, in the pig market in southern China, a farmer was attacked and killed.
The man — mentioned only by his name Juan (Yuan) — was found dead with a cross-sectioned artery, all in one blood on the dog market in the province of Lupanshui Guidjo (Guizhou), reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The vaccine is prepared for pigs to inject vaccines on 30 May 2005 in pigs in the province of Xining, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China
It is reported that he, along with his brother, was taken out of the nearby June Province to sell 15 pigs on the market on the third day.
The next morning, her brother discovered men who had died and found that the dog’s dog door was open.
He told me that there was a big pig's father with blood on his mouth.
According to the Court of Justice, the medical investigation confirmed that the heavy web site (~249 kg) had collapsed the farmer.
"My brother's legs were bloody and dirty," said the brother — her only name is Vu (Wu), the article "Guyang Evening News".
The security camera material showed how he entered the market on Thursday about 4.40 p.m. to clean his dog.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Joanna was neither hers nor hers.
The market manager informed "Evening News" that the website was closed to prevent its attacks on others while the police collected evidence at the scene.
According to information, Yuan's family and market management will discuss the compensation for his death.
Although such cases are rare, we know about other swine attacks.
In 2016 the dog attacked the woman and the men at her farm in Masachussets as a result of the man’s serious injuries.
More than 10 years ago, 650 pigs (~295 kg) had heavy pigs in Velsa had farmed on the tractor until the animal stopped his wife.
After a farmer in Oregon visited his pig, which farmer in Manitoba explained to CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but blood clots can act as "guns of pistols".
"It's just a routine.
They like to smoke, they're very scientific... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to show them enough respect," he said.
The conclusion of Orkana Roses in the broad and strong case in the southern United States
As predicted, Orcán Roza will be weakened by going beyond the coldest waters to the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days, Rosa will bring rivers of greenhouse gases to the north of Mexico and the southern United States.
Five afternoons (through the North American era) Rosa’s wind bridge reached 143 km/h (85 winter hours) corresponding to category 1 Orcan, and its point was 620 km (385 winter) south of Punta Eigenia (Ponta Eugenia) in Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move to the north on Sunday.
As soon as over the Pacific, a low pressure stick, moving toward the east, is moving toward the east coast of the United States. Roza, with tropical wind power approaching the side of the Lejascalifornia (Baja California), begins early in the morning, the depths of the migrating mass from the troupe line to the north toward the southern United States.
In the early part of the day, Rose will bring up to 10 hills (~25.4 cm).
Then the tropical humidity, in combination with the nearby low-pressure area, will create a large, powerful gas zone in South America in the near future.
1–4 columns (~2,6–10,2 cm) will cause dangerous currents, double currents and possibly land degradation in the tank.
The deep core of the troupe is caused by the greenhouse gas, which will reach 2-3 columns per hour (~5,1 to 7.6 cm), particularly in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
In the south-west part, especially in the main part of Arizona, the cases are expected to reach up to 24 inches (~5,2 to 10,1 cm).
The rapid deterioration of the situation is possible as a result of the proliferation of tropical gases.
It is very unlikely that you will go to the toilet because of the threat of tropical gas.
Strong cases can turn canons into fast waves, but the fire will bring local brazms of wind and wind.
The low pressure shall be applied as soon as the local power lines of the South California Coast line have been brought back.
It is possible that the gas can be transmitted to the side of the column (~1.3 cm) together and can cause small double flow and slide paths.
It will be the first gas in the region in the dark season.
A number of isolated tropical greenhouse gases will begin approaching Arizona on Sunday and around Monday before taking over the wider area after Monday and on Tuesday.
Strong cases will be distributed on Tuesday in the four districts (DR Colorado, DA Juta, NA Arizona and DR New Mexico) and will last all Wednesday.
In October there may be intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, as the Arctic temperature will decline, but the trophies are still quite hot.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature in small distances.
This is an example of a dramatic difference in temperature on Sunday in the central part of the United States.
The difference between the temperature in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and Senluis and Demon (Des Moines), Aio, is almost 20 degrees.
In the next few days, we will try to create and spread a long summer heat.
It is expected that in much of the Central and Eastern parts of the United States, the beginning of October will be warm, reaching 80 degrees and more degrees (through Farenheit; ~27 degrees after Celsia) in large areas from the south-east to the north-east.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees (by Farenheit; ~27 degrees after Celsia), which would exceed about 10 degrees average.
Our long-term weather forecasts show that in the first half of October, temperatures in the eastern part of the United States will exceed the average.
More than 20 million people watched a hearing in British Kaveno case
More than 20 million people watched television on Thursday in six television channels with caution, as High Court candidate Brets Kaveno (Bret Kavanugh) and Christine Blasey Ford (Christine Blasey Ford), accused Kaveno of sexual harassment, which, as a woman claims, took place in the 1980s.
As long as political differences continued, radio companies continued to stop regular transmission to report on the latest Friday events: the agreement of Senator Jeff Fleika (Jeff Flake) that the FBI will investigate the charges for weeks.
Forda informed the Senate's Justice Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Kaveno had buried her dream and tried to remove her dress during the middle school ball.
Kevin openly testified that he was fully convinced that he had not done so.
According to Nielsen's report on Friday, 20.4 million people observed it.
The companies CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC recorded the average interest of viewers.
Data on other radio organisations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which demonstrated them, were not available immediately.
And "Nielsen" is often a problem, including people in the office.
To get a better presentation, this number of viewers corresponds to the number of the closing games or the number of observers at the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators have actively supported Kaveno's appointment, was the largest number of viewers, an average of 5.69 million all day long listening, reported "Nielsen".
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS attracted 3.1 million, NBC – 2.94 million, MSNBC – 2.89 million, but CNN – 2.52 million, reported "Nielsen".
The interest remained great after the hearing.
Fleix was the central figure of the drama on Friday.
After the announcement was published by the Republican team that he was voting for the appointment of Kaveno, the senator mentioned CNN and CBS camera Friday morning when he, who had been led by a call from the opposition, tried to arrive at the hearing of the Justice Committee with a lift.
Suddenly, CNN stood for a few minutes in front of his eyes as a bear.
"I'm standing here right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that "you have power while so many women are powerless."
Fleks explained that his team had made a statement, and he was informed before the elevator door closed that he still had something to say during the committee hearing.
The cable networks and radio organisations were directly reflected several hours later when the Committee of Justice was preparing to vote on the opening of Kaveno's vote in the Senate.
However, Fleeks claimed that he would only do so if he knew that the FBI would consider the complaints made against the candidates, which had been asked by the Democrats' minority in the next week.
Fly took part in discussions with his friend Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After the negotiations with the Council and several other senators, Fleeks made his decision.
The choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not vote for Kaveno's approval without an investigation.
President Tramps has commissioned the FBI to investigate the charges against Kaveno (Kavanaugh).
British Prime Minister Meja accuses critically in political games in terms of Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa Meja interviewed people who criticized her plans to leave the European Union, accused of "political games" with the future of Britain and national interests.
British Prime Minister Teresa Meja is attending the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, in addition to the interview with his first page of paper, Minister of Foreign Affairs Boris Johnson continues to attack his Brexit Plan on the future relations of the UK with the European Union, its so-called Czech Plan, stressing that the proposal for the United Kingdom and the EU to use one another's tariffs is "full absurd".
Face Simsa's disappearance: the police arrested Diteon Simpson, who suspected LSU player's hijacking

The 20-year-old Diteon Simpson (Dyteon Simpson) was arrested and arrested as accused of the second degree of fraud, informing the Baton Rouge police officer.
Amates are posted on a video showing Simsa's confrontation with Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the beating.
The CBS girl company WAFB reports that the police found Brilliant in the crime scene and found Simpson's blood on them.
After Simpson's investigation, the police informed him that he was aware of Aida's arrest.
As reported by a lawyer, he was awarded $350,000 in large security funds.
The Committee of the Medical Experts of the Eastern Baton Rouge Parish of the East Baton Rouge is in the process of writing a temporary closure, which states that death caused these head injuries.
The Department thanked the operational group for the search for refugees from the state of Louisiana police, the State police lab, the South University police and the population of the area for the investigation of the result of the arrest.

"That's what people always worry about," said Beids.
Vulcan pulls profits across Mexico
The feathers that travel from the Pokatepetla volcano have reached the southern tip of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans that it should not be close to the volcano within 24 hours after the activity was observed in the crater and 183 gas and wind emissions were recorded.
The Centre has observed multiple seizures and seizures.
Social networks have shown that motor vehicles in the Mexico area, such as Hochimilko (Xochimilco), are equipped with a plan of profits.
The geophysicians have noted 45 July (72 km) to the south-east of the city’s present volcano activation, and since 7.1 strong earthquakes, the central part of Mexico has been affected in 2017.
Vulcan, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police conflict with Catalan separatists before the election year
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on the sixth day after an independent protest against the public order police and when thousands joined in protest demonstrations to mark the first year since the Catholic polarisation vote on separation.
A group of masked supporters, who were interrupted by the public order police, surrounded them with ovals and stripped of the powdery color, forming dark powders in the streets that would normally be full of tourists.
Disagreements are now also taking place later, and police were using force to prevent the beatings.
Several hours of independence support groups, scanning: "Don't forget and don't join!", were involved in a confrontation with the unity-supporting protesters, who lamented: "Love our Spain!"
According to local newspapers, fourteen people were given medical help because of the severe trauma they experienced during the protests.
A year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid recognized as illegal but which caused Catholics, the idea of independence in the affected region remained high.
The voters expressed their conviction that independence, although the activities of the voters were low and that the vote against separation was the biggest.
According to a Catholic official, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to stop voting at electoral points throughout the region and caused terrible injuries.
The independent support groups were set up on Friday night to prevent demonstration of State police support.
The demonstration took place, but the protesters were forced to choose another route.
Narkiss Teremez (Narcis Termes), 68 - year - old electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, admits that he no longer believes that Catholicism will gain independence.
"Last year we lived one of our best times.
I saw how my parents ’ eyes filled with tears of joy as they were allowed to vote, but now everything has stopped," he said.
Although the last year's regional elections, which support the independence of Catalonia, have been overcome with a small but significant surplus, these parties have fought to maintain their progress this year, since many of the most prominent leaders have either emigrated or have been arrested and waited for a trial for their role in organizing a referendum and its subsequent declaration of independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic Hoans Puigs (Joan Puig), who filmed on the phone for the support of the police, said that the conflict had caused both sides to become involved in politics.
"The crisis is getting bigger," he said.
On Saturday, one of nine Catholic leaders, Uriel Žunkeraz (Oriol Junqueras), who has been in detention for the past year, announced that he will be candidate for the European Parliament's election next year.
"Candidacy of Europe's elections is the best way to reduce the regression and repression that the Government of Spain has brought against us," he said.
London: men arrested after entering the car building
Three men (33, 34 and 39 years old) were arrested after the car was repeatedly bullied against the London building.
The incident took place in the Balinagard Crescent (Ballynagard Crescent) on Thursday about 19.30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings (Bob Blemmings) informed that the walls were damaged and also the building itself.
At the same time, it may have been possible that the machine was fired from the washing machine.
Menga triciens allows "Livingston" with 1-0 to win "Rangers"
Dollija Mengas (Dolly Menga) first won "Livingston"
The supported "Livingston" stressed "Rangers", bringing Stephen Gerard's second loss in 18 games called "Ibrox" club manager.
Dollija Menga's move proved decisive because the Gerija Holt (Gary Holt) team compared the situation to "Hibernian".
Jérard's team has not won the guests in this season, and tomorrow they will have to meet the Leader "Hearts", from which they will remain eight points.
Earlier on the fourth day of the European Union, Rangers took the wine "Rapid".
As soon as Livingston's series, no losses were doubled to six games, and the main coach Holts hasn't felt the voice of the cause since last month replaced Kenya Miller (Kenny Miller).
"Livingston" is not an option against white guests
The Holta team with its direct game, which in a variety of ways made Rangers difficult, had to find in charge long before they got the words.
Scott Robinson (Scott Robinson) was released, but his attempt to stand before the name, then Alana Lithgov (Alan Lithgow) was unsuccessful after the attempt to break the Kreig Halket (Craig Halkett) wall with a head over the phone line was unsuccessful.
The farmers allowed Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they would be able to host guests in the scheduled locations.
And that's exactly the way it was for decisive words.
"Rangers" was allowed to free, and "Livingston" used corridors, Declan Gallagher (Declan Gallagher) and Robinsons combined to provide the opportunity for Menga, who sat and acquired words from the middle of the area.
At this stage, Rangers managed a bomb, but the protection of the guests was undisclosed and no one was particularly disturbed by Liam Kelly.
This continued on the second half, although Alfredo Morelos (Alfredo Morelos) said to Kelly to save the words.
Skota Pitman's attempt to stop the activities of the "Rangers" guardian Alana McGregor, and Litgov is replaced by the long words in the "Livingston" combination.
Livingston continued to show the central bombings, but two calls to appeal to the court — after the Halketa battle for a bomb with replacer Glenn Midlton (Glenn Middleton) and for playing hand — were rejected.
"Fenomenal" "Livingston" performance — Analysis
Scottish BBC Alsdairs Lamont (Alasdair Lamont) in "Tony Macaroni"
Fenominal "Livingston" performance and result.
Each of them was great, continuing to overcome hope by continuing to improve the gift.
Their style and personality have not changed in practice since their return to the upper echelon, but Holts has gained great fame for how he has joined the team since his arrival.
He had so much money.
Captain Halket (Halkett) was a giant, holding the initially organized protection, while Menga made it possible for Connor Goldson (Connor Goldson) and Joe Warals (Joe Worrall) to keep the trend.
But Rangers is missing.
Despite how well they had been under the influence of Gerard, they were far from the standards.
Their last bomb was cold — only once they entered the farm area — and in fact it is an invitation to return to "Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdoganu is waiting for shared feelings
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany went to Berlin for breakfast, there was a lot of yellow and blue sky.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO-led populations.
They have differences of opinion on various issues, including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Hell to open a new giant museum.
The city has the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
The police, for reasons of security, blocked 25,000 people’s efforts, not allowing them to stand in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters went away to see their president.
Seven protestors against Erdogan — a large part of them were angry — also made known his attitude when he decided to take the decision of both the Erdogan political party and the German government to take him to himself.
The mutual protests of both sides reflect the contradictions created by visitors, some of whom the German Turks consider to be vans, while others destroy as autocrats.
Road traffic accident in Deptford: The driver dies in traffic with a car
In a car crash in London, a bus driver was injured.
The event took place at the Bestwood Street crossing with Evelyn Street, on the road with intense traffic in Deptford (Deptford), in the south-east of the city, about 10.15 BST.
The car driver stopped and helped the doctors, but the man died at the scene.
The accident took place several months after another train driver died in the streets of Čailders (Children Street), about half of the day’s traffic jam.
The police officer of the capital announced that the police are working with the identification of a man and informing his neighbors.
In the event site, roads are closed and buses are turned off, but car drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin prison: six employees injured during an accident
The Prison Office reports that six prison staff were injured in a severe prison in the male regime.
The incident occurred at the "HMP Long Lartin" prison in Vorchestershire about 09.30 BST on Sunday and will continue.
In order to prevent irregularities involving eight prisoners and restricted to one branch, the staff of the Special Service "Tornado" were involved
On the occasion of the event, the staff were treated with light eye trauma.
The representative of the Prison Service reported: "In order to solve the incident in the HMP Long Lartin prison, a trained staff was involved in particular.
Six staff members were provided medical assistance because of trauma.
We will not disagree with violence in our prisons and clearly say that those responsible will be sent to the police and perhaps spend more time after the rest."
The HMP Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the victim was in the hospital after the victim was attacked.
And in October last year, officials responsible for the control of dumping were sent to prison to resolve serious incidents in which staff had been attacked by billions of bombs.
Orcáns Rosa Fênicas, Lasvegasi and Soltlexitija with sudden floods (probably benefit from the situation in areas affected by drought)
The arson from tropical depression is rare, but it is likely to occur about the beginning of the next week when Orcán Rose will move across the south of the desert, creating a sudden flow.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of sudden floods in the eastern part of Arizona, the southern and eastern part of Nevada, the southern part of California and the southern part of the southern part of the country, including Fénicus, Flagstaf, Lasvegas and Soltleksitis.
It is expected that the next day, Rosa will go directly to Phoenix to discuss the matter after tomorrow.
The National Meteorological Service in Fenikisa Twitter reported that since 1950, only "ten tropic cycles have maintained tropical wind or depression status in a radius of 200 miles (320 km) from Fenix!
Katrina (1967) was a 40-mile ocean (65 km) from the AZ border."
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Center are forecasting 2-4 columns (~5.08–10.2 cm) of light gas, reaching up to 6 columns (15.24 cm).
Other south-easterly areas, including the central part of the Klins Mountains and the Great Basin, may receive 1-2 columns (~2.54-5.08 cm) and reach up to 4 columns (~10.2 cm) in individual locations.
Those who are not exposed to the risk of sudden floods can become known as Rose’s case because the region has been visited by drought.
Although the possibility of abstinence is very serious, part of the news may well be good, because the south is currently suffering from dryness.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, slightly more than 40 percent of Arizona's suffering from at least extreme dryness, which is the second highest category, reported weather.com.
For the first time, the Orcana Roza route to Lejascalifornia (Baja California) in Mexico, where it will reach the shore.
Rose still has Orcan power from the morning with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles (137 km) per hour, is about 385 miles (~620 km) south of Punta Eugenia (Punta Eugenia) in Mexico and moves north with a speed of 12 miles (19 km).
The wind encounters the coolest waters of the Pacific Ocean and is therefore growing.
It is therefore expected that a tropical hurricane will reach the coast of Mexico on Monday or from morning.
In the case of gas, Mexico may be powerful by creating a significant risk of flooding.
"It is expected that the gas will reach 3-6 inches (7.62-15.24 cm) from the interior of Lakesalifornia in the south-east of the Sonora, to break, possibly reaching 10 inches (25.4 cm)," reported weather.com.
Rose will move north, across Mexico as a tropical wind and then reach the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then go across Arizona and go south to the South after Tuesday evening.
"The main threat expected from Rosa or her remains is very strong in the gas in Lejascalifornia, in the northern part of Sonora and in the southern United States," the National Orcan Centre reported.
It is expected that these cases will cause life-threatening sudden floods and double floods, and earthquakes in mountain areas.

Tramps claims that Kaveno is a victim of the party of the Democrats "pangs and ghosts"
"The vote of Judge Kaveno is a vote to reject the harsh and violent tactics of the Democratic Party," Tramps announced at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Tramps stressed that Kaveno was suffering from the "pangs and ghosts" of the Democrat Party throughout his appointment process.
Kevin witnessed before the Congress, where he strongly and emotionally rejected any accusations of sexual abuse by Christine Blasey Ford, a Christian youth several decades ago.
Forda also witnessed during the hearing of her accusations.
On Saturday, the president announced that "Americans have now experienced" Kaveno's "excessiveness, capacity and courage".
"The vote on the approval of Judge Kaveno is a vote to approve one of our most educated lawyers of our time with spousal history in connection with the service of the people," he announced to the supporters' efforts in West Virginia.
The appointment of President Kaveno referred to the environment with regard to the importance of the Republican activity of inter-sessional elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
I did not apply, but I did," he said.
"That's why I'm going to go everywhere fighting for great candidates."
Tramps argues that the Democrats have taken up the mission "to protest and oppose".
It is expected that the first of the important procedural votes will take place in the Senate on the appointment of Kaveno no later than Friday, the CNN informed the senior assistant of the governing party of the Republican Party.
Seventy people were killed in the earthquake in Indonesia, and it is clear that the number of birds increased
On Saturday, at least 384 people were killed, many were simply slaughtered when giant wolves raced against the shores after a powerful earthquake and tsunami visited the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia.
On Friday at the festival, hundreds of people in the city of Palu had gone to the holy pool, where up to six meters (18 feet) of high walls were lifted up against the cliffs in the bushes, where many fell down to death and buried all that was found on their way.
Cunami is caused by a 7.5-balancing earthquake.
"When a tsunami hit the night, people were still working on the beach and did not run away immediately, and they became victims," reported Sutopo Purvo Nugroho (Suptopo Purwo Nugroho) in free Jakarta, representative of the Indian disaster relief agency.
"Cunami didn't come up alone, it brought cars, balloons and buildings, it loved everything that was found on the ground," Nugoro said, adding that the tsunamis, before crossing the coast, were crossing the sea at 800 km/h (497 mph).
"Many people took bread to save, and they survived," he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers of Palu.
The photos taken at the airport of the disaster agency show many destroyed houses and shops, deformed and destroyed walls, and water-contained museums.
The next day, the coastal city continued to be rocked on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
In a report by the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency BPT, it was pointed out that the energy spent on the five-day mass earthquake exceeded 200 times during World War II on Hiroshima’s nuclear power.
The city’s location line, at the end of the coastal line, may have strengthened the famous size.
The Nugroho positions were described as "wide" and were reported to have destroyed thousands of homes, hospitals, shops and hotels.
He said that some of the birds found bodies scattered beneath the walls of the damaged building, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho notes that the number and positions of the birds could be larger than the coastal line 300 km (190 km) north of Palu, in the territory of Dongala (Dongala) located near the earthquake epicenter.
"Communications were completely confused, no information was received from Dongala," Nugroho reported.
More than 300,000 people live there," said Sarkanais Cross, adding that its staff and volunteers are being given to affected regions.
"It's already a tragedy, but everything could be even worse," the organisation reported.
On the sixth day, the Agency was widely criticized for not informing that the tsunamis had visited Pal, although officials claimed that the waves had entered during the warning.
The video distributed on social networks is heard that the man at the top of the building is calling people on the street below that he is approaching tsunamis.
In a few minutes, the water wall is heading toward the shore, clearing the buildings and cars.
The News Agency "Reuters" could not immediately verify whether the material is true.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious lack of electricity that had shut down the Communication Palu by making it difficult for officials to coordinate rescue.
The staff reported that the army had begun to send cargo cars with help from Jakarta and other cities, but the refugees still need food and other first needs items.
The city airport has been opened only for aid measures and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo (Joko Vidodo) evacuation centres Palu planned to visit on Sunday.
In Indonesia, the number of pigs is greater than 800.
It's very bad.
Mr Doseba (Dosoba) said that the World Vision staff who had successfully reached the city of Palu from Dongala (Dongala) and now had a fire in the office's apartment and had taken a long stand on the road.
"They told us that they saw a lot of buildings that were damaged," he explained.
It's very bad.
Even when the aid groups were committed to organizing assistance for victims of the disaster, some complained that foreign aid workers had not been allowed to go to Palu with great experience.
In accordance with the legislation of Indonesia, the financing, resources and staff of overseas organisations may only come into existence if the postal area is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"There is still a disaster at the provincial level," said the representative of the Indonesian Sarkana Cross, Aulija Ariani (Aulia Ariani).
"When the government announces, "Well, it's a national disaster," we can accept international assistance, but this status has not yet been determined."
When Palu arrived the second night after the earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members still remained undiscovered, hoping that their love would become a miracle that would make life easier during the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a small child was released.
On Sunday, the rescuer released the woman who had been forced under the roof for two days near her mother’s bed.
Gendon Subbandon (Gendon Subbandon), the trainer of the Indonesian National Coalition Team, was preparing two of the unsuspecting Asian games that took place this month earlier in Indonesia.
The other guests in Roa Roa Roa hotel, including Mr Mandagi (Mandagi), were their farmers.
"As an experienced nurse," he said, "I'm learning emotions."
Mr. Gendona recalled that after sharing information on the collapse of the Roa Roa Roa hotel in the parallel team, he had been sending whatsApp to Palu's participants who participated in the platmal festival for hours.
However, the result of his report was only one flag, not two blue marks.
"I think it means that the reports did not reach the addressee," he said.

Kanje Vests: reperis changes its name to Je
Reperis Kanje Vests changes his name to Ye (Je).
Noting the change on Twitter on the sixth day, he wrote: "It was a creature who had previously known as Kanji Vesta."
41 - year - old Vests has been called Je for some time and used the name "Ye" as his eight album, published in June.
This change takes place before she shows up on this "Saturday Night Live," where, as expected, he will play his new album "Yandhi".
These authors tell us that he is replacing singer Arinu Grandi, who stopped work on "emotional causes".
The garment has been told that it is not only a short summary of his current professional word, but it is also a religious matter.
"I believe that "Yes" is the word most commonly used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "Tu", the West explained earlier this year by discussing his album name with the radio director Big Boy (Big Boi).
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
At first there was Kanje, which means "only one, followed it "Ye", which is sold for our good and bad, for our feelings, for everything.
The album is more about what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who has changed his words.
Sean Combs, who has been known both as Puff Daddy and P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would give priority to the words Love (Love) and Brother Love (Love's Brother).
JAY-Z, who had previously worked with the Vesto, both there and not used the signs of thought and great virtues.
The elected President of Mexico pledges not to use military force against civilians
The elected President of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, promised never to use military force against civilians during the coming 50th anniversary of the bloody return to students.
Lopess Obradors promised on Saturday "Tlatetelco Plaza" to "never use the army to oppress the people of Mexico."
A peaceful demonstration of the military unit was held on 2 October 1968, killing even 300 people during the war when students were forced to move across Latin America.
Lopess Obradors has tried to support new Mexicans in years, each month offering grants to students and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of access to education lead young criminals into gangs.
The US should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this area, a clear investor and an artificial intelligence practical Kai Fu Lee (Kai-Fu Lee) who has worked on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after various U.S. government bodies had made announcements on artificial intelligence, although the US overall lacks a strategy for artificial intelligence.
Just last year China started its plan: its goal is to become the main country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Two-fold artificial intellectual research budgets will be a good start, given that all other countries are so far away from the United States, and are expected to be the next heart attack in the field of artificial intelligence," Lí said.
In an interview with the CNBC this week, Lili said that twice the funding could increase the possibility that the next achievement in the field of artificial intelligence would take place in the United States.
The book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" ("Artificial intellectual property: China, Silikona Street and the new world order") was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the Executive Director of the "Sinovation Ventures" who has invested funds in one of China's most important art intellectual companies "Face+".
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon (Kärnegi-Melona) University worked to create an artistic intellectual system that would review the best "Othello" (Revers ) player in America, but later he was a "Micro Research" manager and "Google" president of the Chinese branch.
In recognition of the previous technological competencies organised by the US government, such as "Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge" and the questionnaire when it will be prepared in the future to identify people with ideas about the future".
"Scientists in the United States often have to work very hard to get government grants," Lí says.
"It's not China's leading scientists anymore, but big companies," he explained.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have earned university dividends in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
It adds that changes in immigration policy could also help the US to improve its achievements in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think the green cards should automatically be given to people with the degrees of philosophy in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese Council published its next generation's artificial intellectual development plan.
It was explained that the National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions, such as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations, to the US researchers, but the academic work quality in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defence Department established a single joint artistic intelligence centre, which is intended to combine partners from industry and academic circles, and the Baltics informed him of the establishment of a special committee on artistic intelligence issues.
And this month, DARPA (AV Ministry of Defence's Central Research and Development Organisation) announced a large contribution of $2 billion in the initiative called "AI Next".
On the other hand, the National Science Fund is currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intellectual research.
As long as the legislation of the United States which was to establish the National Security Commission in the field of artificial intelligence has not been working for several months.
Macedonians in the referendum on change in national name
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted in the referendum on whether to change the name of the country to the "Northern Macedonian Republic" by taking a step that would prevent the ten years of negotiations with Greece that had blocked Macedonia's requests to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, underlines that its northern neighbour's name is a claim to its territory and is committed to the adoption of Macedonia to NATO and the EU.
The two Governments concluded an agreement in June, based on the proposed new name, but the nationalists in the opposition claim that the changes included the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority of Macedonia.
President George Ivanovs (Gjorge Ivanov) said that in the non-vote referendum, and the campaign called for the rejection has raised concerns as to whether the electoral activity will achieve at least 50%, which is necessary for the referendum to be recognised as valid.
The question is raised in the referendum: "You are about NATO and the EU's participation in the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoranu Zajev (Zoran Zaev), claim that it is a price worth paying off the road to Macedonia, one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, becoming an organisation, such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come to vote on the future of the country, on Macedonia's young people, so that they can live free, within the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Jorgjievska (Olivera Georgievska) in Skopje.
Although this is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have announced that they will take account of the outcome of the vote that will become decisive.
To change the name, there will be a need for a 2/3 majority in Parliament.
The National Election Commission informed that no violations were reported until 1 p.m. on one afternoon.
However, the activity was only 16 per cent compared with 34 per cent of the previous parliamentary elections, with 66 per cent voting for registered voters.
"I am going to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Josie Tanevskis (Gjose Tanevski), a voter in Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zorans Zajevs, his wife Zorika (Zorica) and his son Duško (Dushko) in the Macedonian referendum on the change in the name of the country which will open the way to NATO and the European Union, donated to Strucica (Strumica) Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardakovs (Vladimir Kavardarkov) prepared a small view and painted clothes with beds that had been worn by those in the referendum.
"We are about NATO and the EU, but we want to stand with our head raised, not through the door of service," Kavadarkovs said.
"We are a small country, but we have the truth.
If they do not want us to adopt as Macedonia, we can turn to others, for example China or Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zajevs argues that NATO participation will start the necessary investments in Macedonia, with more than 20 per cent unemployment.
"I believe that most will vote for because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zajevs said after voting.
He said that the result "yes" "will confirm our future."
In the previous morning's debate published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, 30–43% of voters will be involved in the referendum — less than the necessary activity.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telema TV found that 57 per cent of the voters were scheduled to participate in the Sunday vote.
70 percent of them responded that they were voting.
For the referendum to be effective, the electoral activity must be 50 per cent and another vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious threat to the Western-oriented government that came into force in May last year.
View: Manchestras "City" Serhio Agvero (Sergio Aguero) is sailing through the whole "Brighton" protection to get the words
Serhio Agvero and Rahīm Sterlings (Raheem Sterling) provided "Brighton" protection to allow Manchester "City" on Saturday at the "Etihad" stadium in Manchester, England to win with 2:0.
Agvero showed that his reputation for winning was very easy in 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a game in the middle of the village at the beginning of the combination.
He broke out between three Brighton defenses, and he was in the open field.
Then Agvero threw four green crests.
He carried a bomb to one protection, then in the summer he was able to cross several more Brighton fields.
Then he played the game on the left when he reached Sterling.
The English center gunman used his first shot to play back Agvero, who looked like a good football suit to reach the "Brigton" guard Metjū Rayenu (Mathew Ryan) by pulling the bomb on the right side of the network.
"Agvero struggles with foot problems," "City" manager Peps Gardiola (Pep Guardiola) told reporters.
"We discussed with him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were happy that he got his words at that time.
But it was Sterlings, who provided the original advantage of Sky Blues at the Premier League.
The doors were reached at 29 minutes.
Agvero received a deep bomb in Brighton field in that game.
He sent a bomb with a beautiful wall along the Leroy Sane.
Several steps were taken until Sterling was forced to deliver a bomb to the next cell.
The "Sky Blues" centre shooter easily invented a bomb on the network just before crossing the border.

Schercers wants to solve the Rockies problem
Since the Nationals did not participate in the closing games, there was no reason to resume.
But Schercers (Scherzer) who is always ready to compete because on Sunday you will use the option against the Colorado "Rockies", but only if "Rockies" will be the current exclusion games. And "Rockies" in the National League of West is run with one game against Los Angeles "Dodgers".
"Rockies" has published at least a white card with Friday evening with 5:2 winning "Nationals", but has not yet won its first title in divide.
"Although we play the same game, at least we will be able to explain, knowing that the lighthouse here, in Denmark, with effort and other teams, is likely to be the most dangerous thing I'm dealing with this year.
And why would I not feel guilty then?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will begin the game on Sunday, but as a letter, it is ready to allow the Shercer to make a match.
The Sherry, to which it will begin at the beginning of the 34th, held a quarter of a session on the outside of the "bullpen" section, and on Sunday during the usual rest of the year in the year.
The "Washington" lab is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strands 220 2/3 in this season.
Tramps are hand-held in West Virginia
The president reminded the environment of the situation in which his elected High Court candidate, Bret Kaveno, spoke at the same time about the importance of the electoral activity of the Republican voters' elections.
"In November everything we've done is threatened.
Five weeks to one of our most important elections.
It's really very, very serious — I'm not a candidate, but I'm a candidate, and that's why I'm fighting for great candidates," he said.
Tramps continued: "You see this ridiculous, ridiculous radical group of democracies that is taking place right now.
And they have committed to regain power by using all possible means to achieve the goal. You see evil, evil action.
They have the same skills they will have to overcome in order to gain power and control, that is why they want power and control, and we won't give them that."
Democrats, he said, have taken the mission "to protest and oppose".
"And you've seen it yourself in the last four days," he stressed, the so-called democracies of "neighbours, evils, innuendo and injustice."
He was named on behalf of the Senator of the Democratic Party of the Senate Committee of Justice, Diana Feinstein (Dianne Feinstein), to whom the viewers responded with loud applause.
"You remember her answer?
Have you misreaded the document?
Hmm, what are you talking about?
No, hmm, go on — it was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Liberal Party is no longer ready for diversity.
It is ineffective against the open
It was no wonder that "Momentum" activists in my local party wanted me to submit to the censorship.
Finally, I am the last member of the parliament of the Liberal Party to date, who was informed that he did not want to — that is all because we do not hide our views.
My fellow Members in Parliament, Joan Ryan (John Ryan), were similarly angry because she was committed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for not joining Jeremy Corbin (Jeremy Corbyn).
The importance of economic responsibility policy, national security, Europeans – ironically, but these were issues that Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
The announcement on the Liberian meeting in the eastern part of Nottingema says on Friday that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the meetings that took place during the election of eight of my local parliamentarians were exactly that.
Unfortunately, at many meetings today, the atmosphere is different and promises of a "better, safer" policy have been forgotten since then, if ever so.
It has become increasingly clear that the Liberal Party does not want to tolerate different views, and any opinion is assessed depending on whether it is acceptable to the governing party.
It began soon after Jeremy became leader: colleagues whom I thought our political views were the same began to expect that I would justify 180 degrees and accept views that I would never have agreed on in other cases — whether it is national security or the single EU market.
When I speak publicly — and, in fact, it is not important to say what I say — I follow a study on the use of social networks, calling for a ban on candidateing the next elections, by renouncing central policy, saying that I have no place in the Liberal Party.
And that's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I have benefited more than part of my colleague, because the comments against me are usually political.
I admired the professionalism and commitment of my colleagues, who daily encounter sexists and find out about the horrors, but I never tried to avoid them.
One of the most satisfying aspects of this political era is how normal it has become.
In the past week, Jeremy Corbin announced that the Leiborist Party must maintain a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an organization that is ready for diversity of views, and with every expression of distrust or change of election rules, the party will be cut off.
In the last two years, I've often been given advice by not reading on the steps, thinking about what I was talking about, and then I'll be "all right".
But that's not why I choose to be involved in politics.
Since I joined the Liberians for 32 years back as a student, in response to the rejection of the Techer government, which my integrated school class had deliberately led to the collapse, I have been committed to fighting for better public services for those who are most in need, both as a member of the local council and as a minister of the government.
I have never hidden my political views, nor the previous elections.
No one in the East of Nottingem had any reason to doubt my position on political matters and in areas where I would not agree with the existing government.
To those who made the proposal on Friday, I can only say that at the time that the country is committed to moving to Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand this desire to spend my time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Liberian Party.
But in essence, the only thing I want to report is not the idea of Nottingem's "Momentum", but to its voters, whether they are liberarians: I am pleased that I can serve you, and I promise that no threat to candidates or reminders that no one in politics is unreplaceable will stop me from doing what I think is best for all of you.

"Ayr" 38 - 17 "Melrose": "Ayr" reaches the top row table
The last two attempts are likely to achieve a certain degree of success, but there is no doubt that "Ayr" has won a triumph in this exciting Scottish champion's game today.
Now they're at the top of the table, the only undisputed team of ten.
In the end, it was their great protection, as well as the much better use of the output that led the farmers, and Peter Murchie's coach is all the reasons for being satisfied.
"We've checked all our games and we're still not connected, so I have to admit," he said.
"Melrose" Robin Kristijs (Robyn Christie): "All honor "Ayr," they used their performance better than we do."
Grant Anderson (Grand Anderson) attempted 14 minutes, which was carried out by Freizier Climo (Frazier Climo), to "Ayr", but the yellow card to Captain Roriam Hüh (Rory Hughes), where the game was awarded "Warriors", changed the numbers "Melrose", and Jason Begotts (Jason Baggot) covered an unrealised bomb.
The climate increased the control of "Ayr" with punishment, right at the end of the second half, he gained points, then realized a solo attempt, until the "Ayr" stopped at 17-5.
However, the Melrose season began with a good game, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was realized by Begots, reduced the delay to 5 points.
Then there was a long pause because Ruys Nots (Rourdh Knott) won a severe trauma and was brought to the ground from the village, but when the game started "Ayr" quickly turned to the front when Staford McDowell (Stafford McDowell) made an attempt to realize the climate.
Captain Blairs Mcferson (Blair Macpherson) of "Ayr" then received a yellow card, and already, after intense pressure, "Melrose" used a lead player — with a Bruse Colvine (Bruce Colvine) attempt that was not realized.
However, the farmers agreed, and when Struans Hačinson (Struan Hutchinson) received a yellow card for crossing the climate without a bomb, from the prison corridor, Mcferson made a point of "Ayr" in the backyard.
The climate came to an end, just as before, almost from the very beginning after Kails Rouvs (Kyle Rowe) turned David Ármstrong (David Armstrong) into the field and sent the flag player Gregor Henry in the fifth attempt.
Still Game star, it seems, plans a new career in the restaurant business
The Comedy series "Still Game" star Fords Kirnans (Ford Kieran), seems to be planning to engage in a guest business because they discovered that he was named the director of a licensed restaurant.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis (Jack Jarvis) in the popular BBC show where he forms and participates with his former partners in the comedy of Greg Hemphilu (Greg Hemphil).
Duet has announced that the next ninth season will be the last of this season, and Kirnan has apparently planned his life after Kreiglanga (Craigglang).
According to official information, he is Director of the "Affiorn Limited".
Actier refused to comment on the story, even though the source of the Scottish Sun indicated that Kirnan planned to participate in the "extreme restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us!": Bolivia hopes that justice will open the way to the Kluso ocean
The mariners are on their way to the shores of the fleet.
The public buildings are covered by ocean blue flags.
Fleet base ships from Lake Titicaca, to Amazon, are set up with a vessel: "We have the right to the sea.
Their recovery is our duty."
The memory of Chile in the 19th - century bloody conflict on lost coastal lines of resources is still alive, just as it has been a long time since being sailed back in the Pacific.
These expectations are likely to be the highest for several decades, as Bolivia is waiting for the International Court of Justice for a five-year review on 1 October.
"Bolivia is developing, its spirit is united and peaceful and, of course, looks forward to the outcome," announced Bolivia's diplomat Roberto Kalzadilla (Roberto Calzadilla).
Many of the Bolivists of the International Court of Justice will be held in large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will take a good decision on the requirement of Bolivia that, after several decades, with the suspension of negotiations, Chile has the duty to discuss the sovereign exits to the sea for Bolivia.
Bolivia's local charismatic President Evo Morales (Evo Morales), who is waiting for a controversial fight for conversion next year, is also very interested in the morning judgment.
"We are near to recover the Cluso Ocean," he felt at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the Court’s judgment for the good of Bolivia is unlikely, and even if it is accepted, there are no major changes to be expected.
The founding UN body in the Netherlands is not authorized to grant the territory of Chile and its representatives have said that there will be no possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice is passed no more than six months after its final examination shows that the case was "not complicated", explained the international legislative expert Paza Zarate (Paz Zárate) from Chile.
And for the last four years, Bolivia's case has not gone forward, but, rather, has been delayed.
"The question of access to the sea has been raised by the existing administration of Bolivia," Zarate said.
Moralesa's military retourage has made the rest of the good wish, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate once and for all, but after this it will be very difficult to hold the debate.
The two countries have not changed their consignments since 1962.
The representative of Bolivia, Mr Håga, to whom President Eduardo Rodriguez Velze (Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze) did not agree that the court’s decision had been adopted very quickly.
The first day of Bolivia will bring "the opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and the opportunity "to add point 139 years to the long conflicts from which both parties will get," he said.
Kalzadilla also denied that Morales — another of the most popular presidents in Latin America — used maritime problems as political obstacles.
"Bolivia will never deny its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to explore what must be done to overcome the past."
North Korea will withdraw from nuclear weapons only when it can be trusted
Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Jong Ho (Ri Yong Ho), said that his people would never eliminate their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
He spoke on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises expressed at the meeting of the two national leaders in Singapore.
His comments appeared during the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (Mike Pompeo) who appears to be ready to resume diplomatic measures on the road for the non-nuclear-weapon-free, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kimu Čenun.
It is claimed that it is "fathasian" to expect the US to continue to impose sanctions and refusal to declare the end of the Korean war, ever allowing North Korea to pass on its way.
Vashington is careful with regard to the declaration of consent before Phenjan will take significant measures of defence.
Mr. Kims, both US President Donalds Tramps, wants to take a second look.
However, many are skeptical about whether Phenjan really wants to refuse the arms that the country certainly considers to be the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenyan next month to prepare for the next Kima trip with Tramp.
Paris fashions this is known with the latest massive headphone line on your nearest High Street
If you want to increase your cedar collection or completely block the sun, then you are in the right place.
The designers Valentino and Tom Browne (Thom Browne) introduced viewers with a row of absurdity, large on the head hairy object in the 2019 spring/hour season collection, which shined on a certain style background of the Paris fashion week.
This summer, these designers have been exaggerating, and they have sent their mindful achievements to demonstrate fashion.
Valentino’s most excellent gift was a color of yellowish capure made of a color-like flat-plated hair that covered the head.
In the middle of the massive axles, they were made to keep your head warm.
Tom Brauns also showed a deaf mask — just before Helovin.
Many of the colorful masks were painted, and they were soon attached to Hannibal Lecter, not to the high fashion.
One of the formations reminded me of breathing disorders, with pipes and glasses, while the other joined in the colding talk.
And if you want to go on with massive fashion, then it's time for real time.
Style viewers think that a large hill is possible on the way to your nearest High Street.
The large size caps immediately became popular after the "La Bomba" – the two-footed salmon caps (~60 cm) appeared to have spread all, from Rianna to Emily Ratajovski (Emily Rattakowski).
The very ineffective status of the crevice as an object of culture on all social networks leads to another great contribution to honey — the salt flow of sand, almost as large as the model in the fur coat, which carries it.
The sum of the oil refinery, processed with refinery bars and equipped with white leather gloves, took a special place in the 2019 spring / summer season collection of the Paris Fashion Week.
The festivalist Luke Armitage (Luke Armitage) explained: "It is expected that large caps and flats will show central trade routes in the next summer, as the designer has left so much impact that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for large-scale accessories."
John Edwards: Language knowledge is important to citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools are excellent educational institutions, and this has been maintained in 2018 when the results of the exams have been made, which are further enhanced by individual and collective achievements in sports, art and other public activities.
The aim of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) is to ensure the best level for their farmers and their parents in Scotland.
Independent schools have set the goal of preparing their crops for further and higher education, their chosen career and their life as citizens of the world.
As the education sector, which can develop and introduce special school programmes, we see that today’s languages are still popular and desirable in our schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to people in the language he understands, it keeps him in his consciousness.
If you speak in his native language, it stays in his heart."
This is a reassuring reminder that we cannot simply rely on English when we want to build relationships and gain confidence from other countries.
In view of the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are available at the top of the league table with the highest number of courses in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who were learning neighboring languages came to the top mark A.
In Scotland, the report of the Independent Schools Council of 74 schools shows that 72 per cent of students received the highest in Chinese A, and 72 per cent also received German, 69 per cent, and 63 per cent of Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed in the future for children and young people.
Now languages as the subject of choice, independent school programmes are valued as high as science, technology, engineering and mathematics groups.
In 2014, the Commission for Employment and Skills of the United Kingdom found that 17 per cent of employers were unable to complete their holidays because of their lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills become more and more obligatory to prepare young ones for their future careers.
In order to increase the potential for work that will require language knowledge, these skills are important in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen career, by learning a foreign language, they will enjoy the real benefits of such long - term skills in the future.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically improve the competitiveness of several languages.
According to YouGov’s 2013 survey, involving more than 4,000 adults in Britain, 75 percent did not understand the language of the country enough to hold negotiations, but 15 percent were the only French language in which two-digit people spoke the same number.
That is why it is important for today’s children to learn investment languages.
More languages, especially the skills of developing countries, will give children a better opportunity to work hard.
Schools in Scotland vary in language.
Some schools will focus more on today’s languages, while others will learn other languages, such as Chinese and Japanese, which are considered the most important for Britain’s future, according to plans by 2020.
Regardless of what your child will be interested in, independent schools will always be able to choose from a number of languages, and teachers will be experts in the field concerned.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a language environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills needed to achieve success in the future.
Today, in the global business environment, language is still vital to the future of a country, so this fact must be reflected in education.
In fact, today's languages would be regarded as "International Communication Skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer young Scotia this choice, diversity and excellence.
It must be done (It must be done).
John Edwards is Director of the Scots Council of Independent Schools
Lebron's debut "Lakers" on Sunday Sandjego
The fans are finally waiting for the time when Lebrona's first game will take place in Los Angeles "Lakers".
"Lakers" coach Lúks Volton (Luke Walton) has announced that James is playing on Sunday the first season's discovering game against the Denver "Nuggets" Sandjego.
Still, he has to decide exactly how many minutes he will play.
"There will be more than one, but less than 48," Voltons informed "Lakers" on the official website.
"Lakers" reporter Mike Trudell (Maiks Trudels) wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
Following the practice that began this week, James asked about his plans for the sixth season series of games for Lakers.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need the first season games to prepare," he said.
The time of the event of the tramp in West Virginia, canal YouTube
President Donalds Tramps is currently launching a series of artists in Villing, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trampla’s planned games next week, including stopping at friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on his election for the discharge of the seat in the Supreme Court has been suspended, the aim of Trampa is to obtain support from the expected interim elections, as it is at the risk that the Republicans will lose control at Congress after the vote in November.
Who today will be the friend of Trampa in West Virginia, and how can you view it online?
Trampa artist in Villing, West Virginia is scheduled for seven evenings, following the ET today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch online via YouTube on the West Coast.
It is believed that Tramps is talking about hearing this week in the case of the High Court candidate Brita Kaveno, who has been involved in gender crimes, and is expected to vote in Senate to withdraw approval for the week while the FBI is conducting an investigation.
However, the main objective of this initiative is to help improve the situation of the Republicans awaiting the elections in November.
President Trampa's campaign thus shows that the task of the next five students in the coming week is "to activate volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority of them in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress for his work is so important that the president will visit as much as possible because we are starting a campaign season," said the representative of the trampa campaign who refused to reveal his name, "Reuters".
This evening, planned by Wesbanco Arena, will be a possible attraction for supporters from "Ohaijo and Pennsylvania, and will reflect them in Pittsburgh's media," writes West Virginia Metro News.
On the second day of the last month, Tramps will visit West Virginia, the country where he won more than 40 per cent in 2016.
Tramps is trying to help the Senator of West Virginia candidate Patrick Morrisey, who remains in line with the conclusions.
"It is not a good sign to Morise that the president has to come in to help improve his results in the interview," said Simon Haeder, professor of political science at the University of West Virginia.
Raider Kuuss 2018: The US has demonstrated its commitment to fight to keep a great hope for Sunday's games
After three sessions "one word" on Wednesday's game "foursome" was possible exactly what was needed for this Raider village.
Sports lovers like to talk about successful conflicts, and they really believe it, especially in sports such as this.
So, on what side is he now successful?
"They were in charge of six points, but now with four, because I think it means in itself that the success is going to affect us," said Jordan Spieth (Jordan Spieth) in his hopes.
Europe, of course, is an advantage because it is under the rule of 4 points, but still 12 will be played.
The power explained that the Americans believe that the wind blows into their mouths and they have cause for optimism, of course, also in the person of Spita and Justin Thomas (Justin Thomas) who played with each other all day, and each of them can be beautiful with three points from four.
Power has been destroyed from the first site to the medicine, and is an example of the winner.
The winning call became more and more loud when his round continued, a decisive step was taken in the middle of four times to achieve the same number of lines when he and Thomas were back on two lines after two.
His silence in the face of his conquest 15 was perceived with a similar call, of which he was convinced that the American team had not yet been expelled.
"You really have to do deep things, and you have to be worried about your weight," said the officer.
This is all that's left for these players.
18 minutes to be successful.
The only players who have had more points in the last two days than the Spits and Thomas are French Molinari and Tommy Fletwood, who will no doubt be included in the history of this Raider village.
Europe’s dividends, but the most attractive couple remain at four points and are unable to hurt.
Molivuds was the only couple who went out on the sixth day of the week without magic, but they also avoided the witches on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and on the last Friday morning.
This is how and how their energy flows into this exciting effort and again proves that they are players that have to be overcome on Sunday, and Flitvud and Molinari will be the most popular players that can guarantee the potential victory of Europe when the sun goes through Le Golf National.
At the same time, both sides of the dispute.
However, the discussions about the European triumph were preliminary.
Babba Watson (Bubba Watson) and Web Simpson (Webb Simpson) were soon finished with the morning "fourballs" in the form of Sergio Garcia, who played with Alex Noren (Alex Noren).
The bogies and two doubles in front of nine brought Spanish and Swedish cheeses, and they were not even close enough to learn from them.
But no one will help you to end it today.
The games "fourball" and "foursome" are so exciting to watch close due to the interaction, to watch what advice they offer, and what not, and how the strategy can change the situation dramatically.
Europe has so far played better as a team, and before the last few days, it has been in a long run, but this competition in the form of a foursome showed that the US team is committed to fighting what many, especially the Stateside, have doubted.
The last day of the European edition of the Raider Box is 10-6
The European race of Raider Kauss will begin in the last day in a pleasant run after the "fourball" and "foursome" competition ends with 10-6 against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesko Molinari (France Molinari) were led by two victories over the heavy working Tager Woods (Tiger Woods), which increased the number of "Le Golf National" to four.
Tomas Bjorna (Thomas Bjorn) European team to maintain the trophies lost two years ago over the inaccurate American team in the morning's "fourballs" race, and the result of the series was 3-1.
The U.S. was more energetic than the "foursomes" in terms of defeating two masses, but it was unable to eliminate the deficit.
Jim Farika (Jim Furyk) team needs 8 points on Sunday 12 single games to keep the trophies.
Flytvud is the first European prime minister who has received four points in line with Molinari, chosen for Molliwood ("Mollywood") after the end of a seasonal week, only two times in the history of the Raider Castle, who has acquired four points in the first four games.
In the form of the "fourballs" by Patrick Reed, they then led to the excitement of the Vulcan and American youth of Bryson Dechambeau, with even more impressive results 5&4.
Vudss, who won two games on Saturdays, showed a great game at times, but he has lost 19 of the 29 pieces in the "fourballs" and "foursomes" formats, plus seven by order.
Justin Rouss (Justin Rose) rested in the morning before the games "fourballs", returned to partner Henrik Stanson (Henrik Stenson) "foursomes", to connect with 2&1 Dustin Johnson) and Brooks Kepka (Brooks Koepka) who takes the first and second place on the world ranking.
Europe was not able to achieve its full success, although in the southern part of Paris it was pleasant and easy to reach.
The winning winner of the three most prestigious golf competitions, Jordan Spits and Justin Thomas, established the two points on Saturday.
They printed 2&1 against the Spanish Johns Ram (John Rahm) and Ian Polter (Ian Poulter) "fourballs" and returned later to connect Polter and Rory McIllroy with 4&3 "foursomes" after the first two matches were lost.
Only two times in Raider's history, the team has played 4 points of weakness in single games, but as owners, Farika (Furyk) team only has an undissolved result to keep the trophies.
After two days in the second place, it appears that Sunday's anti-war attack will be a problem.
North Korea reported that in "no" case, it would not be alone without confidence
On Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions would deepen its distrust of the United States, and in such a situation, North Korea would not withdraw unilaterally from its nuclear weapons.
Ri Jongs Ho (Ri Yong Ho) informed the annual General Assembly of the world's organizations that in the past year, North Korea has been empowered to "significantly good wishes", such as the cessation of nuclear and rocket tests, the detonating of the weapons's weapons and the promise never to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see an appropriate US response," he said.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our country's security, and under such circumstances we will never defend the first."
Although Ri reiterated the well-known North Korean translations of the "progressive" approach to denuclearization, according to which Korea will be reimbursed for step-by-step steps, his statement left an impression because it did not automatically reject the unilateral denuclearization as Phenjan had done before.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kima Čenuna and Donalda Trampa at the first office of the US President and North Korean leadership meeting in Singapore on 12 June, when Kims agreed to work to achieve the "Korean side denuclearization" while Tramps promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has tried to officially end the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States has announced that Phennan must first withdraw from its nuclear weapons.
Vashington has also not responded to the call to ease the serious international sanctions applicable to North Korea.
"AV claims that the "nuclearization must be first" and increases the level of pressure created by sanctions to achieve the goals of power, even by opposing the "declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
"The idea that sanctions could force us on the way is empty fantasies that people don't know about us.
The problem is, however, that continuing sanctions only deepens our distrust."
He did not speak of the intentions of the second Kima meeting with Tramp, which the US leader had specifically mentioned in the United Nations talk this week.
In his speech, the Minister specifically mentioned three times the Kima meeting with South Korean leader Munu Jae-in during the last five months and added: "If South Korea, not the United States, would not be able to denuclearize the Korean side in that direction."
However, Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year's when he announced in the UN General Assembly that the decision of North Korea's rockets on the U.S. continent was inevitable after Mr. Tramps called Kim on the suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Tramps, who had threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for her courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but stressed that there is still much work to be done, and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Tramps announced that he had not planned a specific time, stressing that "it is not important whether it will take two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia stress the need for the UN Security Council to repay Phenjan for what he has done.
However, the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (Mike Pompeo) said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue with energy, without error, until a final and convincing denuclearization is achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced sanctions since 2006, trying to achieve the exclusion of the financing of the Phenyan nuclear and ballistic weapons programmes.
Pompeo met Ri outside the sessions of the UN General Assembly and was then informed that he would visit Phenyan again in the coming month to prepare for another visit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was not successful.
He came from Phenjana in July, saying that progress has been made, but in a few hours, North Korea has accused him of "gangster's noble requirements".
In this month, the North Korean meeting with Munu was committed to decommissioning a gun polygon and also a nuclear complex, if the US is to take "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim had informed him that "the appropriate measures, which North Korea wants to see, are security guarantees that Tramps promised in Singapore and steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard University students will learn the subject of how to get enough rest
The new subject of education at Harvard University this year has resulted in students crying more, and this is an attempt to turn against the increasingly popular culture of brutalism, which includes the complete study of caffeine through the night.
One provider found that students of the world’s best universities often do not even have a basic knowledge of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, as well as Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the subject of education that he considers to be the first subject of this kind of education in the United States.
The initiative to create a new subject of teaching was created after he became aware of the impact of his lack of sleep on learning.
"At the end a girl approached me and asked, "Why is it telling me this only now when I'm at the last stage?"
She discovered that no one had ever explained to her how important it is to sleep — which surprised me, he told the Telegraph.
This year's first subject of education provides students with basic information on how good sleep income contributes to achievement in education and sport and improves overall well-being.
Paul Bareira (Paul Barreira), professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the Executive Director of Health Services of the University, informed that the university decided to introduce a course after learning that students suffer from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hourly training process includes an interactive series of tasks.
One of the parts is a picture of a common door where students click on coffee bags, dishes, sports bags and books to learn about the effect of caffeine and light and how the supply affects the lack of sleep and how important the cooling routine is.
In the other part, students are informed about the risk of heart failure, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then a student's city map with interactive icons invites participants to consider their daily routine.
"We know it will not change the behavior of students right away.
But we believe they have the right to know. Just as you have the right to know how smoking cigarettes will affect your health," added Professor Čeisler.
He said that a culture that thrives with the ability to learn all night was still in existence and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that the lack of sleep became an increasingly serious problem.
He explained that there must be enough quality sleep for students to be "studently armed" to fight stress, tension and fear, and even to prevent weight gain, as lack of sleep prevents the brain from turning into a test mode, making it permanently out.
Reimonds So (Raymond So), a 19-year-old California student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Čeisler to develop a subject of study after he attended one of the professor's lectures last year, in the first course of Harvard.
He said that the subject of education had opened his eyes and urged him to get a course available to all the students.
He hopes that the next step will be a request for students who receive postgraduate education to obtain a similar programme before they go to competition.
Professor Čeisler recommends students to set up a modulator not only at the time they wake up, but also when they are going to sleep, as well as to keep people in mind how the "green light" damages the screens of electronic devices and LED lamps, as they can trigger daily rhythms, making it difficult to sleep.
"Livingston" 1 - 0 "Rangers": Menga's names cover Gerard's men
"Rangers" visited another funny game guests when Dollia Mengas (Dolly Menga) visited Steven Gerard (Steven Gerrard's command against "Livingston" was issued.
The "Ibrox" team hoped to win the first win in the race since February 4:1 triumfa "St Johnstone", but the Gerija Holt (Gary Holt) team won his second defeat in 18 games since he became a club manager, and his team is 8 points away from the Scottish champion leader "Hearts".
Menga started a bomb seven minutes before the end of the half-life, and the lack of Rangers' input was never considered after attempting to balance the result.
"Rangers" runs to sixth place, while "Livingston" moves to the third, and in the case of a name difference, only "Hibernian".
And Rangers may have another problem, as Judge Kalum Spence (Calum Spence) needed medical help because of the trauma of the head, which was apparently caused by the next end of the subject.
Gerard made eight changes in his team, which quickly left behind the wall of "Ayr", reaching the "Betfred" corner end.
Holts, on the other hand, used the same "Livingston" 11 players who took the Hearts one point last week, and he would be happy to see his well-directed team push opponents in each episode.
It may have been that Rangers managed a bomb more often, but Livingston better used what he was doing.
They had to get the words two minutes after the start of the Menga first game, sent Scott Pittman to Alana McGregor (Allan McGregor), but the center player started his great opportunity.
Then the Keaghan Jacobs released Captain Craig Halket, but his partner in the protection of Alan Litgovs (Alan Lithgov) was able to draw a bomb only for long behind a stand.
The Rangers took control, but the impression was that the last third was expected to be played, not believed it would happen.
Alfredo Morelos (Alfredo Morelos) no doubt felt that he had to make a sentence in 15 minutes after he had spoken with Steven Lawless, but Justice Stevens Thompson (Steven Thomson) rejected the Colombian call.
The Rangers did only two steps for the first half, but the former Ibrox guard Liam Kelliju (Liam Kelly) was particularly concerned, not the Lassana Coulibaly, not the complete end of the attack by Ovi Edgaria (Ovie Ejaria).
Although Livingston's 34 minutes may have changed the time of the game, no one can deny that they had already won it for their efforts.
"Rangers" was no longer the final combination of Jacob's planner.
Scott Erfilds (Scott Arfield) did not respond when Declans Gallagher created a bomb for Scott Robinson, which maintained balance and chose the simple end of Meng.
Gerard's break with Rayna Kent (Ryan Kent), and it almost immediately affected the game, as Sunday sent the bomb Morelos, but the impressive Kelly from his line to block the year immediately.
But Livingston continued to let the guests play as they liked, Litgova and Halket on one side of the street after another.
The Holta team would have been able to continue running in the final phase, but McGregors played well while setting up Jacobabs before Litgovs took a lead in the storm.
"Rangers" replacer Glens Midlton (Glenn Middleton) later asked for another sentence, after he had agreed with Jacobs, but Tomson's request was again ignored.
Almanahs: Generator of Geiger
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanah: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today... one day in Germany, Johannes Wilhelms "Hans" Geigers, who grew up as a physicist.
Geigers developed methods for defining and measuring radioactivity as a result, finally, was a device known as Geiger's calculator.
The scientist who took his place and kept Geiger in a pop culture, such as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, where the main role was played by externally undisputed war-type scientists Rodgers and Deils Evanss:
The man said, "What, by the way, is this?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger calculator used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you build these atoms, you can hear how atoms work, which are released because of this mineral's radioactivity."
Evans says, "That's really a bird!"
"Hans" Geigers died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the creature named in his name continues to live.
New anti-cancer vaccine can be taught to "see" the immune system in bad cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells and kill them.
Vaccine therapy teaches the immune system to identify harmful cells
Using this method, the patient is obtained from immunosuppressive cells that are transformed into the laboratory.
Then they will be able to "see" the protein that is characteristic of many harmful crops and will be injected back into the body.
The test vaccine shows multi-sound results in patients with different types of malignant tumours.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine, who taught the immune system to identify harmful cells, experienced that her ovarian cancer had spread for more than 18 months.
The method is to obtain from the patient's immune system cells, transform them into a laboratory to enable them to "increase" several plants with a specific HER2 and then inject these cells back into the body.
U.S. National Cancer Institute (US National Cancer Institute) in Bethesda, Maryland Professor Jay Berzovskis (Jay Berzofsky) reported: "Our results show that we have a very multi-threaded vaccine."
HER2 "encourages the growth of several kinds of harmful crops," including breast, ovarian, lung, and kidney cancer, explained Professor Berzowski.
A similar approach when a patient receives immunosuppression cells that "probably" have been affected by harmful tumour cells in the case of one type of leukaemia.
Kanje Vests after a visit to SNL, a persecuted MAGA in Cyprus, attacked Trampa critics.
It won't end well
Kanje Vests was graduated from the "Saturday Night Live" study during this year following an inconsistencies in which he celebrated US President Donald Tramp and announced that he would be candidate for the 2020 presidential election.
At the end of the day of the third song, named Ghost Town, during which he played the "Make America Great" harps, he began to sing loud phrases about democracy and reiterated his support for Trappa.
"So many times when I spoke to white people, they asked, "How can you like Tramps? He's a racist!"
Well, if I'd called for racism, then I'd already known America," he said.
"Saturday Night Live" began with a tradition with Metu Demon (Matt Damon) in the main role in which Hollywood star gave a witness to the British Kaveno (Brett Kavanaugh) in the Senate Justice Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault.
Although it was not translated, the material was introduced by Chris Rock on social networks.
It is not clear whether Roks was trying to get rid of the Vespasian.
And Vest was still complaining to the onlookers that he had been held responsible for his head injury.
"They laughed at me in the backseat!
They said, "They're not out there with their hats on their heads!"
They made me laugh!
And they also said I lost contact with reality," said West, according to the Washington Examiner.
The vest continued: "Gribat to see what happens when the connection to reality is lost?" and promised to take "your Supermen's move," because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love!"
Variety reported that her commentators had at least two strokes, but the members of this team had looked confused, and at least one person told the press issue: "The study had a complete schedule."
The train was last invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande (Ariana Grande), who had died a few days earlier by a friend of Max Miller (Mac Miller).
The garment was mixed with a song (I Love it) that he performed in the costume of the champagne bottle.
The news was supported by the conservative group leader TPUSA, Candance Tenere (Candace Turner), who wrote on Twitter: "One of the most powerful people: PATEICOS, DO NOT WOMEN!"
But on the website of this conversation leader Karen Hunter (Karen Hunter) wrote that West was just "what he is, and that's wonderful."
"But I will choose not to hire a person (to buy his music or clothing, or to support his "mouse"), which, as I think, supports and contends with ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we," she added.
Earlier on this site, Twitter reported that he had changed his name, saying that he has now become "a being that used to be known as Kanji Vest".
He is not the first artist to change his name, and he acts like Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another writer of Snoop Dog earlier was Snoop Lion, and of course, the legendary music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, but then to a "view artist who was previously known as Prince".
Indicted in an attempt to commit suicide in the restaurant of Belfast
At 45 years of age, a man has been accused of attempted rape after he was arrested on Friday in the restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The police reported that the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
It is expected that the accused will be brought before the Court of Justice of Belfast in the morning.
The prosecution will be examined by the Public Prosecution Service.
Kits Herrington's star "Trone Games" turned against toxicity
Kitt Herrington is known as the dental surgeon John Snovs HBO in the unfortunate middle-time fantasy series "Trone Games".
However, 31 years of age, an actor has turned against a brutal currency stereotype, saying that such personnel often make young children think they should be strong enough to be respected.
In conversation with "The Sunday Times Culture", Kits explained that he was "will face a problem", and asked the question of how to end up with toxicity in #MeToo.
Kitt, who recently appreciated his "Tron Games" partner, Rose Leslie (Rose Leslie), also 31 years old, recognizes that this problem is important to him.
"I can't think right now about what mistakes we've made with men," he said.
"What do we new men learn about this problem when they grow up, taking into account the current problem?"
Another believes that television with its very male subjects may be partly responsible for the increase in male toxicity.
He continued, "What is born, but what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that make young children feel that they need to be treated as men?
I believe this is one of the most important questions of our time: How can we change it?
'Cause with young men, there's obviously a problem.'
In the interview, he also recognized that he would not participate in any "Trons Games" on the follow-up or adventure, after the series was finished next summer, stressing that "we have stopped fighting fields and horses".
Starting with November, Kitts plays the main part of the renewed Sama Shepard "True West", which is the story of the film producer and his brother's winner.
Actier recently admitted that he considered his visit with his wife, Rose, to be the best thing that happened to him as a result of the "Tron Games".
"I met my wife in this house, because it in itself provided for my current family and my life from that moment to time," he said.
Rosa Emmy won the series of fantasy games in the second person of John Snova's favorite Games.
In June 2018, the family of Lesli was born in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% growth in new cases
China reported that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased rapidly by 14%.
Healthcare officials report that more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were the result of sexual harassment, which showed changes.
Traditionally, HIV was spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of blood infection.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has decreased almost to zero, and health officials were informed at the conference in June Province of China.
However, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS has increased to 100,000.
HIV transmission is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalized in 1997, but it is said that the discrimination of LGBT people is often compounded.
In the light of national conservative values, studies show that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men end up with women.
Many of the cases of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases are not sufficiently protected by the result of these relationships.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised general access to HIV medicines as part of measures to address the problem.
Maxina Votersa prohibits the employee to mislead the data of the Republican senators, but against "hazardous lies" and "apocalyptic theories"
On Saturday, the U.S. Chamber of Representatives of Maxine Voters (Maxine Waters) denied claims that her staff member had published the personal information of three U.S. senators on the pages of Wikipedia lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations were spread by the media and the Internet.
"Meli, honey and even more harmless honey," said Voters on his blog.
The information is reported to include the address and telephone numbers of the address and address of the U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee (Mike Lee) and Orrin Hečam (Orrin Hatch) from Jutas.
The information was displayed online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Congress, during the hearing of British Kaveno's sexual misconduct in the Senate group.
The Flood occurred some time after the three senators had arrived in Kaveno.
Conservative, Internet sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the source of the entries was connected to the Voter's office and revealed information about Voter's staff, informed Hills.
"This unfounded claim is absolutely false and totally wrong!" said Voters.
"My staff member whose identity, personal information and security are compromised because of this false and unfair claim is not in any way responsible for the misinformation.
This unfounded claim is absolutely false and totally wrong!"
The Voter's statement soon prompted criticism online, including the criticism of our White Press Secretary Ari Fleischer (Ari Fleischer).
"This is a cold ban," Fleishers wrote.
"This leads to the conclusion that her temperatures do not correspond to the members of the Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, that person should not be bitter.
He must not be a soldier.
He must not speak of the motives of the accused.
He must be peaceful and peaceful."
The task of Flesher was to compare Voter's reaction to the democratic crisis of Judge Kaveno, who was accused of too harsh reactions during the fourth day's hearing.
Omárs Navarro (Omar Navarro), a Republican candidate who is candidate for the loss of Voters' choice of colors, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"It's great if it's true," he wrote.
Votersa reported that her office had warned the responsible officials and law enforcement bodies of these false claims.
"We will ensure that the guilty will be revealed," she continued, "and that they will be recognized as legally responsible for all their work that is destructive and dangerous to any of my staff."
"John English 3" review – Rovan Atkinson's semi-synthetic film parade
There has been an attempt to seek association with Brexit in every new film with British flag, and this seems to apply also to what has occurred, the French comedy of Johnia English (Johnny English), which started with "Johnia England" in 2003 and the bird's return in 2011 with "Johnis English returns".
Is it ironic that the way we appear to be innocent, is there a new chance of export for our fate?
In any case, the uncompromising John Anglim with the blind eyes and the unusual movement of the eye has the right to create a hole after the second relivence — his name is more than any other indication that he is a broad spectrum commission person who has been developed in areas where consumers do not speak English.
He, of course, is a foolish secret agent, who, despite his infamous objections to the burning humiliation, is a little Kluzo, a little Mr. Bín, and a sweet girl who plays one of the events of the "Chariots of Fire" in the London Olympic opening ceremony of 2012.
He is also based on a traveler and an international, undisputed character that Atkinson once imagined now in the forgotten Barclaycard TV ads where he left chaos on his way.
There are at least one or two beautiful moments in the recent experience of Jonia English.
I liked the place where John Anglis goes to the helicopter for a half hour in the armchair, and the propellant's men are at a glance looking at his horse.
Akinson’s ability to visualize the comical effect is visible, but humor is quite weak and deceptive, especially because "serious" cinema brands such as "007" and "Inadequate Mission" use comedy itself with confidence, as one of the ingredients.
Humor makes an impression that it has been assigned to children rather than adults, and I think that Johnny England's absurd letters aren't as creative and objective as the Atkinson meme film tricks in Bina do.
As is usually the case, it is based on the fact that Britain has gone into serious chaos.
Kiberhaker has entered the UK super-secreted press network, revealing the identity of all British agents in this area as an undesirable active agent — sorry for the role of little Kevin Eldon (Kevin Eldon).
This is the last salmon for the prime minister, the pomposa and the hardy person who has already lost completely the political population: Emma Tomsone does what he can, with Tereza Meia in part, but the scenario does not have much to work with.
Her consultants in the field of search inform her that, since all the active pressures have already occurred in the open, she will have to call someone already retired.
And this man is young John Anglis, who is now working as a teacher in a small building institution, and teaches us how to work for a blind agent (a couple of fun jockeys), because England offers to acquire a printing profession on the very basis of it.
The English is returned to the Vaithol emergency meeting and is joined by his former many wounded assistant Bo, who is also currently playing Ben Miller (Ben Miller).
For now, there is a man who is spoken of by the water commander, a pleasant person who becomes important only at the end of the film — a role in which Vicki Pepperdine (Vicki Pepperdine) is not fully used.
And she has come back from Betmen with Robin's great mistake of serving in His Highness' secret service and met Olga Kirilenko (Olga Kurylenko) a beautiful faithful woman, Ophelia Bulletova.
As long as Prime Ministers are dangerously caught up with the charismatic technology billionaire, bad Jason Volta, pictured by Jake Lacy, and he claims that he is able to solve the problems of British computers.
England and Bo start their wild tastes: masked as officers, they hire a small French restaurant; they make a secret of entering the Volta luxury garden; and England causes absolute chaos by trying to use virtual realities on the head to meet the interior of the Volta building.
All possible endings are done, but as attractive and attractive as the film is, there are many children’s television elements.
A lot of measuring elements.
Like other John's English films, I can't imagine if the British film industry could not give Rovan Atkinson a role that would make full use of his talent?
The Liberian Party prohibits plans for Brits to work four days a week, but will pay for five days
Jeremy Corbin (Jeremy Corbyn) Leiborist Party is preparing to discuss a radical plan by which the British will work for four days a week, but the salary will be five.
It is reported that the party wishes that the managers of companies, with the help of the artificial intellectual revolution, be given to the workers, to open them another day.
In that case, employees will be able to enjoy three days of a week’s rest while receiving the same large wage as before.
The authors say that the idea will "response" the party's agenda in the economy and plans to change the economy for the good workers.
After four working weeks, the Trade Union Congress has been supported by the Trade Union Congress, which considers it an opportunity for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
One of the senior representatives of the Liberal Party informed "The Sunday Times": "It is expected that changes in politics will be reported by the end of this year.
"It will not happen one day, but four days' work week is an idea that is consistent with the party's objective to balance the economy for the good workers, as well as the overall strategy of the party in the industry."
The Liberal Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party has already introduced a series of four-day working weeks in the general election campaign in 2017.
However, the liberarian Party as such does not currently support this debt.
The representative of the Liberal Party reported: "The four-day working week is not part of the party's policy, and the party does not consider it."
Ms. John McDonnell used the Liberian conference last week to give his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr Macdonela explained that he was committed to withdrawing power from the "directors' mass" and public service companies "experts".
The Prime Minister of Athens also plans to ensure that existing medium-sized shareholders in water companies will not be able to recover all their packages, as the Liberian government could implement the "record" due to the alleged injustice.
He also approved plans to include companies in the management of the company and to establish an exclusive own-initiative Special Rights Fund (Ownership Fund) in order to allocate 10% of private-sector company capital to employees who would receive up to 500 credits each year on a twelve-year basis.
Lindsijs Grems and John Kenedijs answer "60 Minutes", or FIB research in Kaveno case could change their views
The investigation of the charge against Judge Bret Kaveno (Brett Kavanaugh) by the FBI has stopped the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raises the question whether the Bureau's findings could allow a Republican senator to withdraw his support.
At the interview, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelly (Scott Pelley) asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could find something that would make them change their minds.
Kenedius left a more open impression than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," answered Kennedy.
"I said, pointing to the hearing procedure, I said I spoke to Judge Kaveno.
I called him after it happened when the charge became known, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was competent, direct and incomprehensible."
However, Grema's vote is obviously in stone.
"I have made a decision about Brit Kaveno, and there will be a need for a grave charge," he said.
"Dr. Forda, I don't know what happened, but I know, look what: Bret deliberately denied it," said Grems, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of her names could confirm it.
The event is 36 years old.
I don't think there are any changes to be expected."
What is the world’s citizens’ festival, and has it helped to reduce poverty?
This Saturday will be held in New York City by the World's Citizens' Festival, an annual musical event involving an impressive number of stars, with the same impressive mission: to reduce poverty in the world.
This is the seventh year of the festival, the World Citizens' Festival will visit tens of thousands of people who will take part in the Central Park in the Great Wall not only to enjoy the advantages such as Janet Jackson, Reperes Cardi B (Cardi B) and Shawn Mendes (Shawn Mendes), but also to increase understanding of the real goal of the event, which will be the final end of poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a measure created by the Global Poverty Project, which aims to eradicate poverty by bringing more and more people actively to fight poverty.
In order to receive free tickets to this measure (if it was not intended to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform a variety of tasks or "work", such as voluntary work, e-mail to a world leader, telephone calls or other important activities to promote understanding of poverty eradication.
But how successful has the Global Citizen movement been, which is still 12 years old to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of crediting with free concerts a good way to convince people to do it, or is there just another case of "clicking" when people seem to be able to really influence what they're doing by signing an online petition or sending a Twitter report?
The Global Citizen Movement claims that since 2011, it has registered more than 19 million "operation" from its supporters in an effort to achieve different objectives.
It informs that these activities have helped world leaders to report commitments and policies equivalent to US$ 37 billion, which will affect more than 2.25 billion lives by the year 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group referred to 390 commitments and notifications arising from its activities for which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group concludes that the resources thus far have affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the major commitments include "The Power of Nutrition" — a partnership of investors and implementing partners in the United Kingdom, which has committed to "help children grow up fully", looking at Rwanda with $35 million in order to help end the country's inadequate food after receiving more than 4700 Twitter reports from the world's citizens.
"With the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, other national governments and citizens of the world as you support, we can leave an invaluable food in the history of social injustice," said Trisia Ulmena (Tracey Ulman) at the London concert in April 2018.
The Group also said that after more than 5000 measures were launched, calling on the United Kingdom Government to provide mothers and children with better nutrition, the Government announced the granting of funding to the Power of Nutrition project, which will provide food for 5 million women and children.
Answering one of the most frequently asked questions on your website, "What makes you think we can end the ultimate poverty?"
"Global Citizen" commented: "It will be a long and long way in which we will fall short and suffer failure.
However, just as the great civil rights and anti-partite movements have achieved them before us, we will succeed as we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson (Janet Jackson), the Weekend, Shoons Mendes (Shawn Mendes), Cardi B, Janella Monée (Janelle Monae) are some of the artists who will take part in this year's event in New York, headed by Deborah-Lee Förnes (Debora-Lee Furness) and Hugh Jackson (Hugh Jackman).
The US could use military fleets for "blockage" to stop Russian energy exports – the Interior Minister
"In case of need" Washington can use its military fleet to prevent Russian energy entry into the market, including in the Middle East, as US Interior Minister Rainens Zinke (Ryan Zinke), as it is called "Washington Examiner".
Zinke claimed that Russia’s activities in Syria — especially in areas where it operates under the legal call of the government — are the subject of a new energy market study.
"In my opinion, the reason why it is located in the Middle East is that it wants to supply energy just as it does in Eastern Europe — in the southern part of Europe," he said.
And, according to the staff, there are ways and means to solve it.
"The United States, through its war fleet, can prepare for the opening of the seas and, if necessary, block them so that Russia cannot put its energy on the market," he said.
Zinke turned to the public who had come to visit the action taken by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization called itself "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared the approach of Washington to the solution to the situation in Russia and Iran, indicating that they are actually equal.
"The economic potential of Iran and Russia is more or less fuel use and replacement," he said, while referring to Russia as a country whose economy is mainly dependent only on fossil fuels.
Further claims are that the trampa administration contributes to the export of frozen natural gas to Europe, thus replacing Russia — a number of lower options for consumers in Europe.
For this reason, the officials of the tramp administration and also US President Donalds Tramps tried to convince Germany to emerge from the "unappropriated" North Stream 2 gas management project that would make Berlin "dependable" from Moscow in the name of Trampa.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that 11 billion US dollars worth of North Stream 2 gas manager, which doubles the current gas power to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin believes that the Washington fierce opposition project is simply based on economic reasons and is a poor example of competition.
"In my opinion, we agree that energy cannot be a means of producing pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," said Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novaks after a September meeting in Moscow with US Minister of Energy Riko Perija.
The US has expressed its negative attitude towards Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The German leading industry organisation — the German Industrial Federation (BDI) — has called on the US to refrain from joining the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I would feel a big problem if the third country were to enter our energy reserve," said Mr. Deter Kempfs, head of the German Chancellor Angel Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Vorena will seriously consider her candidate for the president's 2020 election
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Vorena announced that a serious consideration would be given to candidates for the president's office after the mid-term elections.
During the meeting of the Board in Holio, Massachusetts, Vorena confirmed that the president's election was being considered.
"There is a real time for women in Washington who are "salabos" imperfect government, which also means women-presidents," her words are reflected in The Hill magazine.
"After 6 November, I will carefully consider my candidate's election to the president of the United States."
During the House's meeting, Vorena referred to President Donald Tramp, claiming that he was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
"What Donald Tramps is doing with our democracy to my heart, to my heart," she said.
Vorena has openly criticized Tramp and her selected High Court candidate, Bret Kaveno.
On Thursday's Twitter report Vorena said: "Of course, the FBI's investigation is necessary before the elections."
However, on the fourth day in the published debate, the majority of Vorenas' supporters did not consider that they should apply for the 2020 election.
According to the Boston Globe policy study centre/paper, fifty-eight percent of the "possible" electors of the University of Sufokas claimed that the senator should not apply for a election.
Thirty-two percent supported this decision.
The findings revealed that more aid had been obtained by former Governor Devals Patrick, with 38 per cent of candidates and 48 per cent against.
With regard to the possible candidate election of 2020, the words of the High profile of the Democratic Party as former Vice-President Joe Baidens and Vermont Senator Bénijs Sanderss will appear.
The news agency "Associated Press" informed Baidens that he had agreed to make an official decision by January.
Sarah Pelinna another Treka Pelina PTSS Donalda Trampa
Treks Peilins (26) spent the year in Iraq after the arrest in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son goes through, which he goes through after his return, I can refer to other families that are affected by PTSS and some of the doses of vulnerability that our soldiers return with," she said to the audience at Donalda Trampa, near Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Pailina called her arrest "a obvious problem that everyone faces" and said about their son and other war veterans that "they are returning a little differently, they are returning tired, they have come back to think about whether they are respected for what their fellow soldiers and pilots have done, as well as for all the other military personnel in this country."
According to the representative of the Department of Police of Vasilis, Dana Beneta was arrested on the first day in Vasili, Alaska, and charged with violence in the family with regard to women and the possession of weapons in the state of need.
18 states, Colombia's area of challenge for new asylum policy
Eightty states and the Colombia area support the legal challenge of new US policies that challenge victims who flee from temptation or violence in the family.
The representatives of these 18 states and the Colombia area presented a brief statement to the judge in Washington on Friday to support a asylum seeker who will face the obstacles created by that policy, reports the NBC News.
The full name of the petitioner, Grace v. Session, which was launched by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, was not revealed.
She claimed that her partner "and the son of her gang member" abused her, but US officials rejected her request after asylum on July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
The lawyers who supported Gresus described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, many of which come from US asylum seekers, such as countries where the problem is widespread in the family of temptation and violence.
The new US asylum policy changed the 2014 decision of the Imigrant Appeal Board, which allowed existing immigrants who fled from violence in the family to apply for asylum.
On Friday, the Colombian prosecutor General Karl Racín announced that the new policy " ignores national, federal and international laws introduced by decodes".
"The Federal Law provides that all requests for asylum are examined in accordance with the facts and circumstances of the request, and such a breach violates this principle," said the Court's brief statement.
In addition, a lawyer stated in his statement that a policy that allows immigrants to enter the country would damage the US economy, as these immigrants would probably become entrepreneurs and "insurance the necessary labour force".
In June, General Prosecutor Jeff Seshons (Jeff Sessions) addressed immigration judges with a request no longer to grant asylum to victims who fled from violence in the family and gangs.
"The openness is available to people who have lost their family because of persecution or fear associated with their race, religion, nationality, belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," said Sesson in his statement on politics on 11 June.
It has never been designed to solve all the problems, even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Experimental rescue efforts Palu, double the number of survivors in the search process
The situation in the survivors continued to worsen.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old Ríza Kusuma, at the center of the city of Palu's evacuation.
"In a few minutes, the medical assistance service will introduce new victims.
The water is weak."
The people were seen returning home to their destroyed homes and overcrowding in water, trying to save everything that was available.
Seventy people were injured, and seven patients who had suffered from 7.5 severe earthquakes were overloaded.
Some of the injured, including the Dwi Haris (Dwi Haris), who had been shot in the neck and shoulders, were asleep outside the Palu army hospital, where patients were cared for outside because of a powerful aftercrepitation.
His eyes were filled with tears, remembering how a powerful earthquake began to strike the number of hotels in the fifth state where he found himself with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
Apparently, I was stuck in the walls," the news agency "Associated Press" said Haris, remembering that his family had entered the city for the sake of the chaos.
"My dear wife is called after help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of attempted arrests using propaganda ads
A week after the official Chinese newspaper came to the audience with four pages of advertising, every day stressing the mutual benefits of the US and China trade, the US messenger in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread the propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Tramps referred to the annex paid to China Daily in the newspaper Des Moines Register, accusing China of attempting to enter the United States Congress on 6 November, but China refused to do so.
Trampa’s complaint that Beijing was trying to involve the US election marked what US officials told the Reuters agency that it was a new step in the growing Washington campaign to pressure China.
While it is entirely normal for foreign governments to place advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a growing trade war, resulting in a number of tariffs being applied to imports of each other.
In the beginning of the trade war, Chinese repressive tariffs were directed against exporters in countries such as the Aio, which supported the Republican Party of Trampa, said Chinese and US experts.
Terius Branstads, a Ambassador of the United States in China and former former governor of Iio, who is a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Pekina has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstads wrote his opinion on Sunday's issue "Des Moines Register", claiming that China "now doubles this arrest by putting advertising ads in our own free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses its best speech freedom and free-of-charge press tradition for America by introducing a paid advertising "Des Moines Register," Branstads wrote.
"In contrast, here in the ordinary Beijing news, there will be a limited number of opinions, and you will not see such a wide range of real reflections that the Chinese people can have in relation to the disturbing economic trajectory in China, given that media are here under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He pointed out that "one of the most influential Chinese magazines refused to publish" his article, but he did not mention what magazine it was.
Analytics warn about Republicans who refresh female voters from midterm elections involving the Kaveno scandal
Since many leading Republicans support and protect the High Court candidate Bret Kaveno (Bret Kavanaugh), against which several allegations of sexual violence have been made, analysts have warned that the choice of the expected midpoint will have a negative effect, especially on women.
The emotions associated with it have been extremely high, and most Republicans are already ready to vote.
Such things cannot be recalled, "In the sixth day "The Hill" wrote to Professor of Science at the University of Siracús Maksvela's School of Political Science, Grant Reehers (Grant Reeher).
The short doubt is that Senator Jeff Fleika (Jeff Flake) (R-Arizona)'s recent incentive to conduct the FIB investigation will be a very great reason to attract the hungry voters.
"You won't forget what happened last night. She won't forget it tomorrow or November," she said, according to the newspaper "Washington, D.C." on Friday, Karine Jean-Pierre said: "MiveOn" was a progressive move by the senior councillor and the representative of the state.
On Friday morning, the protestors of the Senate, in front of the "Novembers!", when the Republicans, in charge of the Committee of Justice, chose to continue with the opening of Kaveno's candidate for the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Fordas (Dr. Christine Blasey Ford), reported "Mic".
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high," the news portal told independent political analyst Styū Rotenbergs (Stu Rothenberg).
"People say it's already high, it's justice.
However, this could be even higher, especially among the most controversial voters living in the city and the latest voters (aged 18 to 29 years old), who often do not vote even if the president does not like."
Even prior to Forda's public testimony in which she had made allegations of sexual violence by the High Court's candidate, it was not possible to analyse the potential failure if the Republicans continued to pursue this candidate.
"This Republican party has become a exciting mess," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Committee of the Republican Republic, at the beginning of last week's NBC News.
"It is not just about the Committee's vote or the final vote, or whether Kaveno will be judged, it is also about how the Republicans have dealt with this situation and how they have stood against it," said Gajs Sesil (Guy Cecil) — US Priority Director, who is leading this group that helps to choose democracy.
However, it seems that the Americans have little sharing in what they believe in fordas and Kaveno's beliefs, little more than trying to believe in the last.
The new "YouGov" survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believe in Forda's testimony, while 35 percent claim that they believe in Kaveno's testimony.
In addition, 38 per cent claimed that Kaveno may have been wrong about his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
The Guardian newspaper reported that the FBI is currently conducting an investigation on Forda's allegations and on at least one other complainant, Debor Ramirez (Debrah Ramirez).
Last week, Forda was a witness to the Senate Court of Justice that Kaveno committed a sexual assault on her in secret at the age of 17.
Ramireze claims that during his studies at Jeilla in 1980, the Supreme Court’s senior candidate has shown him his generality.
Global web developer plans to start a new Internet to download Google and Facebook
Tim Bärners-Lī (Tim Berners-Lee), the founder of the global network, starts a project that could compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project "Inrupt" of the legend of technology is a company based on the first-code platform "Solid" opened on Bärnersa-Li.
"Solid" allows users to choose where to store their data and what people to access for information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Börnerss-Lī said that Inrupt's hidden intention is "to rule over the world".
"We have to do this now," he said about the new company.
"It's a historic moment."
The user uses "Solid" technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or PTD.
It can include contact lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available simultaneously in one view.
The personal online database is unique because only the user determines what and what type of information can be accessed.
The company is referred to as "personal powers using data".
According to John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide the company with resources, processes and appropriate skills to make solid available to everyone.
The company is currently operating in Bärners-Lī, Brass, the safety platform for IBM, some of the external manufacturers agreed to work on the project, and a voluntary co-coder community.
This week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Börners-Lī said that he and his team did not talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make complete changes, one night completely covering all their business models.
"We don't ask for his permission."
The Platform "Media" in Bärners-Lý, published on Saturday, said that "Inrupt" "the mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network based on Solid".
In 1994, Bérners-Lí transformed the Internet by creating a Global Network Consortium at the Masaçúsets Institute of Technology.
In recent months, children's lives have been affected by their views on the neutrality of the network.
Even after the "Inrupt" launch, children's-Lî will remain the Global Network Consortium, the Global Network Foundation and the founder and director of the Open Data Institute.
"I'm really optimistic about this new site," said Bürners-Lī.
Bernard Vens (Bernard Vann): Note of Victoria’s cross given to World War I during World War I
For 100 years in his hometown, an event has been observed when the only English Orthodox soldier received Victoria’s cross during World War I as a warrior.
This award was received on 29 September 1918 in connection with the attack on Bellengles and Lehaukorta.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a rapist, so he also did not know of the British highest military award.
On the sixth day in a row in Northamptonshire, his two small pieces of memory were revealed to him.
One of her grandchildren Michael Vans (Michael Vann) said that it was "symbolic" that such stone was discovered 100 years after his parents had received a significant award.
According to the newspaper "London Gazette" on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Vence led his battalion across Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very severe fire of migraine and large magabal and loggers created by the great fires."
Later, he stepped onto the shooting line and led the line safely forward before the introduction of the large-scale zone, where he won three groups.
On October 4, 1918 — just over a few months before the end of the war — the Germans were executed by Lieutenant Vén.
Michael Venus (72) said that his father's action was "something I could never do, and that is also a very humble act".
He and his brother, Dr. James Venu (Dr. James Vann), also died as an enemy of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vence claimed that his feelings were "thanked by participating in this debt", and noted that "the value of the true currency shows the support of many people".
MMA fans waited all night for "Bellator 206", but instead waited for Cúcinju Pepa
Imagine that you walked up all night to see "Bellator 206", but at the end of this main event you are tired.
In Sanhos there were 13 battles, including six of the main cards, which were transpired online all night during channel 5 of the United Kingdom.
At 6.00 a.m., when Gegards Musasi (Gegard Mousasi) and Rory MacDonalds were preparing to stand up against each other, observers in the United Kingdom were not pleased to switch transpiring to the Pepus.
Some were really confused when all night long until early in the morning they were still awake waiting for the battle.
A fan on Twitter described a change of transmission to the children's multiple film as "inflicable something".
"The government has determined that the content of this type is not acceptable after 6.00 p.m., so there has been a switch to the children's programme," explained the transfer exchange, Dave Schwartz, the senior vice-president on marketing and communication issues.
"Church Pepa," "yes."
The president of the company "Bellator" Scott Kokers (Scott Cooker) said that he was working on schedules so that further viewers in the United Kingdom could see these transfers.
"When we think about re-examination, I think, we can do something to solve it," Kokers said.
"But the clock is there six in the morning on Sunday, and we will not be able to solve this problem until Sunday after our time and tomorrow after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, a lot of texts were displayed after the transfer was closed, and they were not positive.
We tried to avoid it because we thought it was a technical mistake.
But that wasn't it, the government controlled it.
I can assure you that there will be no such problem next time.
We're going to have five wars, not six (as it has been so far). We're trying to convince fans, but we're going to make a percentage.
This is an impossible situation."
"Desert Island Discs": Tom's Share Not Good Enough for Her Sexuality · Global Voices
The Olympics, Tom Daley (Tom Daley), claimed that he had grown up to feel inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old man did not realize that "not everyone is like me" until he started visiting high school.
At the first Radio 4 "Desert Island Discs", led by Lorraine Laverne (Lauren Laverne), he said he started talking about homosexual rights to give others "the truth".
He also said that becoming a parent was more likely to attract him to winning the Olympics.
The permanent director of the long-term programme, Kirsty Young, has been given for several months due to the illness.
As a result of being released from Lavernes' first programme, Delijs said that growing to feel "more worthless" than others, because "the society has not accepted that it can be liked both girls and children".
He said, "To this day, I still feel that I am not as good as others, or that I am different, has been the main engine that has given me strength and endurance to achieve success."
He said that you wanted to prove that there is "something" so that I don't let people guess when they finally know about her sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medal winner has become a high-level LGBT campaign leader and has used his appearance in the Australian Games for the Year's Threat, calling for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that we decided to talk to the society because it was lucky that they could live openly and without difficulties, and they wanted to give the truth to others.
The third world champion said that in a man's suicide, the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who was hit by a "unprepared" in 2013 by Dustin Lance Black.
In the past year, 20 - year - old Oscar’s prize prizes have been prized, claiming that the age difference has never been a barrier.
"When you've gone through so much" (her first Olympic games were 14 years old, and her father died three years later), it's hard to find someone at your age who would have experienced similar headaches and seizures.
Paris became the father of Robert Rays Blacks-Delijs (Robert Ray Black-Daley), and Delijs claimed that his "all perspectives" have changed.
"Before the year, everything that was important to me was the acquisition of gold medals," he said.
"You know what? Life is more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son Robert has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
He said that his father did not want to accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he had been born with was whether they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics where he wanted to find the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that she won't be found in the first row anymore," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dying I finally realized that he was not capable," he said.
In the following year, Deilis participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – entering homes in front of the Olympics. There was no better feeling about it," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of music — Heather Small's "Proud" performed with him on his way to the Olympics and still earned the zosa.
The "Desert Island Discs" program is held on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11.15 p.m. after the British summer.
From the form of Michaelson's reserve line on the sixth day of Raider's career
The American Phils Mikelson (Phil Mickelson) will set up a record on Sunday playing his 47. Raider's box game, but he will need to change his strategy to avoid an impossible event.
Michaelson, who has already attended every 12 years in the two-year course, sat on the six days of the reserved row for four bombs and two skippers.
Instead of finding a center of activity as often as it was in relation to the US commanders, the fifth winner divided his day, acting both as a supporter and participating in his game with the hope of improving what he is going to learn.
As the 48-year-old golfer has never been the most precise player in his career, he is not the most suitable candidate for the fight against Le Golf National in an uneven area where he is regularly being punished by the wrong side.
And, if the game itself isn't boring enough, Michaelson's nineth birthday match will be fought with the winner of the Frankesco Molinari, who has joined the forces of young Tommy Fleetwood (Tommy Fleetwood) to win all four games this week.
If the Americans who are left with four points starting with 12 single-game matches were successfully led, Michaelson could show a decisive role.
Furik, without a word, expressed confidence in his teammate.
"He fully recognized his role today, pushed me across the wall, applied his hand to me and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Furik.
"He's very confident about himself.
He's an excellent athlete who gave so much to these teams earlier and also this week.
I don't think I've ever seen her play in two games.
I imagined more, but everything was threatened as it was, and we would count it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mikelson will record Nika Faldo (Nick Faldo) with the most played eyes on the anniversary of the Raider Castle.
This could mark the end of the race race race of Raider, which has never really met its individual record heights.
Michaelson has won 18 winnings, has won 20 losses and seven undisputed games, although Furic has also claimed that his presence gave the team knowledge of the benefits of non-material nature.
"He's a nice, warm and intelligent person, he likes to get excited about people, and he's a great teammate," he explained.
"I think the most recent players were also pleased to walk around this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives more than just the game."
President Thomas Bjorn (Thomas Bjorn) of the European Elections Board knows that a significant recovery can be achieved soon
President Thomas Bjorn of the European Elections, from experience, knows that in the course of a major uprising, in fighting for the Raider race in the last days, it can be easy to turn into an unpleasant situation.
Danis argued in the 1997 game in Valderram, where the opposing team, whose captain was Son Baljesteros (Seven Ballesteros), won five points over the Americans, but only now came to the end line with a very small point of excess, namely, killing 141⁄2-131/2.
"You will continue to remind yourself that we have been significantly led by Valderram; we have been led by Brooklyn where we lost, and Valderram, where we have won but with little weight," said Bjorns (in the picture), looking at the 2018 release team's victory with 5-3 both Friday and evening, facing with 10-6 golf field "Le Golf National.
So the story will show to both me and every member of its team that nothing is over.
Tomorrow you'll get it all back.
Go to the field and show your best performance!
This will not end until the points obtained on the screen are visible.
Our goal is to get this trophie and concentrate on it as well.
I have always said that I concentrated on 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well what is happening to us on the other hand -- the world's top players."
Easy enough about what his players showed in the golf field, Bjorns said: "I've never been around for a year.
Tomorrow is waiting for new challenges.
The sun is intended for individual games, and it's quite another thing.
It's great when it's all right, you have a partner with you, but individual games are fully tested your golfer skills.
This message must be delivered to your players, i.e. to give them back everything in the next day.
Now you leave your partner, and he must also be given his best gift."
Unlike the Bjorn enemy team, Captain Jim Furik will see that his players show their best performance directly in individual non-partner games. The exception is only Jordan Spieth (Jordan Spieth) and Justin Thomas (Justin Thomas), who acquired three points from four.
At the same time, Furik has won both of these important last days tournaments — both as part of the winning team in Brooklyn and later as a result of the European team's achievement of a significant success that is later known in the golf world as "Miracle at Medinah".
"Atceros per word," he said, responding to the fact that Bens Krenšo (Ben Crenshaw), commander of the 1999 team, joined his players in the war of the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to get to the quick show that you lived in Brooklyn, where you lived in Medin.
When such an impulse is drawn in one direction, it causes great pressure on the games in the middle.
We have created our composition and we have met boys in a way that we would be right. We'll try to make some noise tomorrow."
Tomass had the task of trying to lead the counter-attack, and he had introduced Rory McIlroy to the main game and Europeans Paul Casey, Justin Rouss (Justin Rose), John Rome (John Rahm), Tommy Fleetwood (Tommy Fleetwood) and Ian Poulter (Ian Poulter) in the first part of the list.
"I've met boys in this sequence because, I think, it's best in the course of the tournament," Bjorns said with regard to the selected players.
Resuspended on the new German carpentry in operation
The latest frigate in Germany had to be delivered in 2014, thus replacing the age-old Korean wartime caricatures, but it will not occur until the next year due to the system of error and increasing costs, it reported local media.
The transfer of the main ship to the Rhineland-Pfalz class of Baden-Virtemberg Freghasses was now suspended until the first half of 2019, reported in the newspaper "Die Zeit", referring to military representatives.
The ship had to join the Caraflot in 2014, but the unfavourable after-supply problems affected the wheels of the ambitious project.
The four Bádenes-Virtembergas class ships, which were ordered by the Caraflot in 2007, will replace the old Bramens class frigates.
It is expected that it will be equipped with a powerful large-scale, range of anti-aircraft rockets and some subtle technologies such as reducing the detection of radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other essential properties include longer storage periods — new frigates must be available for up to two years from the ports where they are registered.
However, continuous delay means that the latest technology cascades, which would allow Germany to demonstrate its powers in the overseas countries, will be old by the time it comes into operation, notes "Die Zeit".
The failure of the F125 Fregate in the past year was seen in all the headlines when the German Caraflot officially refused to transfer the ships into operation and sent them back to the building of the ship "Blohm & Voss" in Hamburg.
This was the first time the karaflote was returned to the ship's builder after the ship's delivery.
It was little known for such reasons, but the German media mentioned several significant "programme and equipment defects" that would make the belts invalid if used in the battle mission.
The lack of programming was a particularly important factor, since the Baden-Virtemberg class ships operate around 120 large crews, only half of the staff of the old Bramen class.
It was also shown that the ship is too heavy to reduce its performance and restrict its ability to make improvements in the future.
It is considered that 7000 tonnes of heavy ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy as similar ships used by Germany during the Second World War.
At the same time, the costs of the entire project (including the training of the staff) have also become a major problem.
It is said that its costs have reached EUR 3.1 billion in the original EUR 2.2 billion place.
The problems related to the new fleets will become particularly important, taking into account recent warnings that the German maritime forces will be reduced.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels (Hans-Peter Bartels), the chairman of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the car fleet is truly "beautiful of the ship".
The operator claimed that in time this problem had been substantially resolved, as old ships were removed from operation but were not delivered in a new location.
He regretted that none of the frigates in Baden-Virtemberg's class had joined the caraflot.
"National Trust" listened to the life of a blind couple.
A new study carried out in a Scottish high-level property is aimed at discovering the use of sharks in the food search process.
It is expected that the findings will introduce new clarifications on the behaviour of these unique pilots and will help them in future protection measures.
Scotia National Trust scientists in the Inverveves gardens of Westeros will study pundusiksiks, pigmasiksiks, as well as bronchos and waterbucks.
In the main areas, special recorders will be set up to monitor sexual activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand detectors.
The sound experts will analyse all records to determine the frequency and frequency of sound waves and the types of action taken.
A biotopes card and a report will then be drawn up to create a detailed image of the image reflecting the behavior of the sexes.
NTS Natural Protection Council Rob Dewar (Rob Dewar) hopes that the results of which biotopes are the most important and how each species uses them will be found.
This information will help to identify the benefits of biotopes management such as the creation of forests and how to best keep forests and other related species.
During the last century, the sex groups in Scotland and the United Kingdom have been severely affected.
These countries are at risk of construction and development work that affects the loss of the sexes of shelter and shelter.
Wind generators and lighting may also pose a risk, such as mushrooms and some building materials, as well as cat attacks.
Actually, the sexes aren't cold.
However, because of the effects of their coldness, their ears are more useful than their eyes during the famine.
They use a complex method of determining the location of the support-finding location to find the holes and obstacles in their flight route.
NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, will seriously address the gender problem.
The organisation has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, audits of sexual secrecy, and sometimes even rescue works.
The organisation has even set up in Scotland the first and the only reserve of Threave in Dhamfris and Galove, where eight of the species in Scotland meet.
Special Manager David Thompson (David Thompson) claims that this area is ideally suitable for sex offenders.
"Here's a great place for the sexes," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and generally suitable biotopes.
But there are still many things we don't know about sex, so the work we do here and other things will help us better understand what they need to survive."
He points out that it is important to verify that, prior to the maintenance of property, it is important to check whether there are non-mixtures in the place concerned, as it may be possible that one mother’s secretage is killed up to 400 mothers and their babies, thus possibly destroying all local populations.
Sexual predators are protected animals and must not kill, torture, disturb or destroy their secrets.
The Scottish Bat Conservation Trust employee Elizabeth Ferrela (Elizabeth Ferrell) has called on the company to help.
She said, "We still have much to learn about the sexes, and for many species we just don't know how to dress them."
Ronaldo hates the prosecution by ordering lawyers to file a German newspaper in court
Cristiano Ronaldo (Cristiano Ronaldo) has ordered against his inaugural charges as "white news", claiming that people "will draw attention to themselves", using his name.
Her lawyers are ordered to submit to the court a German news journal "Der Spiegel", which published these statements.
The origins of Portugal and Turin "Juventus" are accused of exhuming American Kathryn Majorg (Kathryn Mayorga) in a Lasvegas hotel number in 2009.
It is claimed that he paid the woman $375,000 in order to hear about the incident, she sent "Der Spiegel" on Friday.
A few hours after this statement was made, Ronalda, 33, with Instagram’s online video interface, came to her 142 million followers, calling this information "almost news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they claimed today is false news," the 5th winner of the "Ballon d'Or" award in the camera.
"They want to become famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous for my word, it's part of my work.
I am a happy person, and everything is good," laughing at the added player.
According to the information provided by the Reuters, Ronaldu lawyers are preparing to submit to the court newspaper "Der Spiegel" for the allegations they have called "inadmissible information in the field of suspects in the field of privacy".
Advocate Christian Scherttz said that the player will ask for compensation for "moral damage to the extent that corresponds to the severity of the offence which may be one of the most serious violations of person's rights in recent years".
This incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino "sue" class in Las Vegas.
According to documents submitted by the judge in the province of Nevada, it is reported that after the night club, Ronald and Majorga went back to the player's hotel number, where he eventually beat the woman.
Majorga claims that after that incident, Ronald's criticism was on the way and said there was "99 per cent "good boy" but the criticism of this "one percent".
In accordance with the information provided by the document, Ronald acknowledged that he had had sex before, but this occurred after the mutual agreement.
Majorga also claims to have taken photos of the trauma she received at the hospital, but later she agreed to an outside court agreement because she felt "stupid" and worried about "public degradation".
A 34-year-old woman claims that she no longer wants to agree with the terms of this agreement, as the incident has left a lasting trauma.
At the time of the above claims, Ronaldo was moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but this evening he moved 100 million euros to the Italian capital "Juventus".
Brexit: The loss of the United Kingdom 'of all time' authors
"The United Kingdom "will regret it all the time" if it will lose its world leader's position in the production of cars after Brexit," said business secretary Greg Clarks.
His "distorted" fact that the company Toyota UK has announced "BBC" is that, if Britain comes out of the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production in the Burnaston industry in Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clarka.
The Japanese author said that the delay on the borders of Breksita could be put to work without agreement without agreement.
The Burnaston industry, which produces "Auris" and "Avenis" models, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the other Member States of the European Union.
"I think, when Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March, production in our industry will be stopped," said the Director of Toyota in Burnstone, Marvin Cooke.
Other United Kingdom authors, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have been concerned about leaving the EU without a contract and how cross-border trade will operate.
For example, BMW claims that after Brexit per month, it will close its mini factory in Oxford.
According to the authors, the main concerns are the dangerous supply chain if no agreement has been reached after Brexita.
The Toyota production line operates according to the principle of "exploration" where cars manufactured by order are required every 37 minutes from both the United Kingdom and EU suppliers.
If the United Kingdom comes out of the EU without agreement on 29 March, there may be obstacles that could lead to some delays and shortcomings.
According to the company, "Toyota" would not be able to keep more than one day’s valuable inventory in its Derbyshire industry, so it would be possible to stop production.
Mr Clarka said that the "Chequers" plan developed by Teresa Meas (Theresa May) for future relations with the EU is "precisely calculated to avoid such border checks".
"We need an agreement. We want to get the best deal that would allow, as I say, not only to benefit at the present time, but also to use this opportunity," he said "BBC" in Radio 4 programme "Today".
"The proof of it is not only from "Toyota", but also from other producers that we must be fully able to pursue a very successful supply chain strategy."
Toyota was unable to state how long production could be stopped, but warned that long-term increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the industry and eventually threaten jobs.
Peter Tsuvalaris (Peter Tsouvallaris) who has been working in Burnstone for 24 years and is working in the union industry as the coordinator of the union, said that his men feel even greater confusion: "From experience I can say that as soon as a man dies, it does not return."
The representative of the government said: "We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trampa meeting with Rozenstein can be resumed, report to the White House
Donalda Trampa's important meeting with the Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rozenstein (Rod Rosenstein) can be "exceeded for another week" because of the battle with the High Court's candidate for the post of judge, Brit Kaveno, he reported to the White House on Sunday.
Rozenšteins observes the involvement of Special Adviser Robert Miller (Robert Mueller), who is investigating Russia's election, the link between the resources used by Trampa and Russia, as well as the possible non-compliance with the law of the President.
For months, it has been wondered whether Tramps will leave the Attorney General’s Office and will thus threaten Miller’s independence.
At the beginning of this month, "New York Times" reported that Rosenstein had discussed the signing of negotiations with Tramp and the possibility of setting up a president with Amendment 25.
Rozenstein denied this information.
But on the last morning, he went to the White House, where he spoke about his departure.
This place was announced on Thursday in front of Tramp, which was currently at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Tramps said that "better" did not leave Rosenstein, but then the meeting was suspended to avoid confrontation with the Senate hearing of the Committee of Courts, where both Kaveno and one of the women accused of sexual misconduct — Dr. Kristine Blasia Forda.
On Friday, Tramps told the FIB to conduct a week's investigation in connection with the Kaveno's allegations, continuing to postpone the Senate's vote.
Trampa Press Secretary Sarah Sanders (Sarah Sanders) visited Fox News Sunday.
Looking forward to Rozenstein, she replied: "The date of the meeting has not yet been laid down, it may be this week or another week, taking into account all the cases that are taking place at the Supreme Court.
But we will see it, and I always want to inform the press about the new ones."
Some reporters dispute this claim: Sandersa has not done our press release in White since 10 September.
The leader of Chris Wallace asked why.
Sandersa said that the lack of free money was not linked with the negative attitude of the television reporter "failures" though she added, "I don't believe they're famous bears."
He then proposed direct contact between Tramp as a result of increasing the interest of the press.
"The president took more questions and answers than any president before her," she said, and without further information, she said, "We have been interested in the number."
Sandersa said that the briefings will still be, but, "if the press is able to ask the President of the United States questions without delay, this is certainly better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it a lot, and you see we've done it a lot over the last few weeks, and it's going to happen at the press station when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Tramps shall regularly answer questions by issuing from the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences visited by important persons.
Individual press conferences are rarely held.
Perhaps the president demonstrated this reason this week in New York, using the rapporteur's efforts to express uncontrollable and short-term doubts.
Letter from the Minister of Health to EU staff of Scotland NHS on threats related to Brexit
The Ministry of Health has written down EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) to express gratitude and to choose resistance after Brexit.
Jeana Freeman (Jeane Freeman) MSP sent letters less than six months before the start of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the costs of applying for permanent status to EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Frimena wrote: "During the world negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU continued on an appearance that led to the expected decisions in this autumn.
However, the Government of the United Kingdom is also preparing for a possible scenario if no agreement has been reached.
I know this is a very unpleasant time for you.
I would therefore once again like to stress how much I appreciate the involvement of any employee regardless of their nationality.
Members from both the EU and outside it provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health care service and benefit our patients and communities.
Scotland is certainly your home, and we really want to stay here."
An emergency operation is performed after the trauma of the head for Abercrombie
Christian Abercrombie was held in the state of Tennessee for the protection of Christian Abercrombie (Christion Abercrombie) after the trauma he had received in his sixth game, which resulted in a 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodores, reported by the sports reporter Max Organ (Mike Organ).
The state team chief trainer Rods Rīds (Rod Reed) told reporters that the trauma had taken place shortly before the end of the day.
"He came to the side line and said, "I'm sorry," said Ryd.
As Abercrombies found on the side lines, trainers and medical personnel gave him oxygen, he leaned on the ground and bought them further for further research.
A member of the state of Tennessee told Nešvila, a reporter at "WSMV" in Tennessee that Abercrombie was involved in Vanderbiltas University's medical center.
Haris adds that in the meantime, "no information about the type of trauma/massity" and the state team in Tennessee is trying to understand the extent to which this trauma has occurred.
Abercrombie, the Red Cracker, is in its first season after the Ilonian replacement of the Tennis State Command.
Before the 6th day of the game, he had played five blocks in total, 18 in this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher State fee by purchasing property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be eligible for a higher State fee by purchasing property in the United Kingdom and the additional equipment obtained will be used to assist the homeless in accordance with the new "Tory" plan.
This step will neutralise Corbin's efforts to attract new voters.
An increased national tax will apply to persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The national case provides that up to 120 million trucks can be loaded per year for aid to homeless persons.
A higher national tax will apply to foreign buyers by purchasing property in the United Kingdom and by transferring the additional equipment obtained for the supply of non-residents, which will today be notified by Teresa Meja.
This step is considered to be an attempt to neutralize the efforts of Jeremy Corbin (Jeremy Corbyn) to attract new voters with promises to provide housing at the most cost and to address the most sustainable part of society.
The increased national tax will apply to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, in addition to the money received to open up government efforts to tackle the problem of homeless people.
The aid included in the current national fee, including the application of a higher level fee two years ago for the purchase and purchase of another premises, could be three per cent.
The country's case provides that such steps can be complemented by its budget up to 120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the newly built properties of London are purchased by non-residents, thus making prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to go to their homes.
Many of the national territories in possession, especially in the capital, have become "spocco cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy was introduced only a few weeks after Boris Johnson (Boris Johnson) called for a reduction in the national tax so that more new people could be allowed to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high non-expendable property prices on land, but not using it, and urged Ms. Mejas to reject quotas for affordable homes in terms of prices, in order to address the problem of British households.
Mr Corbin has proposed a number of attractive domestic reforms, including a reform on rent control and removal from home without reason.
He also wants to give the councils greater powers to build new houses.
Mrs Mejas said: "Last year I said that I would use my prime minister's position to restore the dream of Britain — that is, every new generation must have a better quality of life.
And that means setting up our house-to-house market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and set up their lives.
However, it is not right that houses can be purchased at the same time as foreign companies and persons who do not live in the United Kingdom, which are working hard for the British people.
For many, the dream of their home has become too far, and the problem of homeless people is still current."
Jack Ross: "My biggest goal is to run "Scottland"
"Sunderland" leader Jack Ross claims that his biggest goal is to become a "Scottland" leader at some point.
Scott, 42, has faced the challenge of renewing the Northeast Club, which now takes the third place in the first lie with three points above.
He moved to "Stadium of Light" after St Mirren's introduction back in Scotland's premier past season.
"As a player I wanted to play my country.
I got a B box, and that was all, "Sportsound" in Scotland for "Sportsound" said Ross.
"But I grew up, together with my father looking at "Scotland" games in Hampden Park, and it has always invited me to come back.
However, such an opportunity would only be shown if I was successful in running the club."
The leader of the "Sunderland" club is Dick Advocate (Dick Advocate), David Moyes (David Moyes), Sam Allardis (Sam Allardice), Martin O'Neill (Martin O'Neill), Roy Kins (Roy Keane), Guss Poiet (Gus Poyt) and Paulo Di Canio (Paul Di Canio).
The former "Alloa Athletic" president claimed that he did not feel discouraged following such a large club-recognised leaders at the end of the offer made by Barnslia and Ipswiča.
"My achievements will be assessed at this time on whether I can return to this club in a preliminary manner.
Because of the structure of this club and the opportunity it no doubt becomes premier," he said.
"It will not be easy to go back to the top of the club, but, most likely, I will think that I will be here for success only when this task is carried out."
Ross is only three years old in his career, working as Deputy Director in Dumbarton for a 15-month period in the "Hearts" trainer.
After that, he helped the Alloa club recover from the breach to the third level and in the same season helped St. Mirren get the title of the champion.
Ross claims that he feels much more comfortable at the time of his player's career than at the club "Clyde", "Hartlepool", "Falkirk", "St Mirren" and "Hamilton Academic".
"These may have been real cross-cells," he recalls, taking responsibility for "Alloa."
"I really believed that leadership was my real call – much more suitable than playing.
They listened to me because I had good results, I was able to live from it and to enjoy certain heights as well.
However, playing can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel it because of the stress and pressure associated with the work, but management is my career.
I've always wanted to run, and now I'm doing it. It seems I'm in the right place, I'm not feeling so good all my life."
You can listen to the full "Sportsound" interview on Saturday, 30 September, from 12.00 a.m. to 1 p.m. after the British summer.
The summary makes it clear that the most appropriate time to enjoy the dishes is at 7:30 p.m. on Saturday evening.
The summer’s heat wave has allowed Britain’s less popular circles to meet, but it has increased pressure on restaurants chains.
The data collected revealed that in July the volume of beef and veal sales increased by 2.7 per cent but decreased by 4.8 per cent in restaurants.
Peter Martin, who represented the business consultation agency CGA, who collected data, said: "The continuous solar time and the participation in the long run of England at the end of the world war meant that in July there was a similar trend as in June, the profit of the circle had increased by 2.8 percent, while the restaurant had experienced a fall.
Restaurants whose sales decreased by 1.8 per cent in June were even worse in July.
The situation in the wine cellars and bars was more favorable because they lived in a much larger area than in restaurants.
Even food-based circles are forced from the sun, but not as dramatic as those of restaurants.
It seemed that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
The production of wines in Crogos and barges increased by 6.6 per cent in the month, while the supply of food decreased by 3 per cent."
RSM's satisfied and loving analyst Paul Newman (Paul Newman) said: "These results continue to show a remarkable trend at the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of broad social or sport measures are major factors determining turnover outside the home market.
It is no surprise that the Group of Restaurants continues to fight, although the sales crisis of 4.8 per cent, compared with the period in question last year, will be particularly painful to the pressure of additional unliquidated costs.
With regard to food suppliers in the air and in the hot weather, it was not possible to have access to it at the most inappropriate time, and the time will show whether the temperature that we normally live in August will provide such a very necessary shelter."
The overall increase in sales in circles and restaurants, including in new companies, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a decrease in the sales volume of brands.
"Coffer Peach Tracker", which is the United Kingdom's sales supervisor, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyzes the data of 47 operating groups with a total turnover of over 9 billion stars, and this is a sectoral criterion.
Every fifth child has a blind social media account it hides from their parents
It was discovered that every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a blind social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
The survey, involving 20,000 high school students, revealed a false increase in the Instagram page.
These reports have raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" account to show the parents.
Each fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, produces social media accounts that they hide from adults.
In the survey involving 20,000 high school students, it was found that the number of false profiles increased rapidly on Instagram’s photo collection site.
These reports have raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "clean main" account to show parents and also private accounts.
A 13 - year - old woman’s mother discovered a teenager who was trying to seduce her.
In a study conducted by the Digital Avarenes UK and the Independent School Managers Conference (HMC), it was found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, and only half of them acknowledged that they had private accounts.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan said: "There are fears that so many teenagers form online profiles where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elida Doila will be "voice" in Scotland's Vieglatlactic government
At the annual joint meeting of the Governing Council of Elida Doila (Eilih Doyle), the Scotia Vieglatläticas was elected as Director of the Executive Board.
Doila is Scotland's most popular rooms and clinics easily, and President Ian Beattie described this step as a great opportunity for those who are leading sports to use their extensive experience at international level over the last ten years.
"Eilidas are given great respect throughout Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world's Lightweight Community, and we are convinced that Scotland will gain enormously much by joining them in their government," said Beatijs.
Doila said: "I would like to work as a "swift voice" and hope that I can really get involved and help move this kind of sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, thus, in general, obtained four Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular BBC Pandist, unable to follow the transition of an essential cut.
He wrote on Twitter: "This day, a month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only time would show up and how much longer I would stay.
It was a horrible job, but I was completely brought back, taught to run again, and today I can do business training!
Thank you for moving words!"
Tables are included in breast milk smoke advertising that compares mothers to cows
The raw milk tobacco production company has been prepared for shared views online with advertising in which breastfeeding mothers are compared to breastfeeding.
In order to mark the release of the so-called "first-class breast cancer in the world" in circulation, the consumer technology company "Elvie" sends out a label advertising to demonstrate the freedom that breast-feeding mothers give with breast-feeding.
Four real mother gave her a hand with a walled dog in a corner of a song, with the words echoing around: "Yes, I listened to myself, but you didn't see any ass" and "if you hadn't noticed, they weren't twins, they are my heart."
And they shall say in the vision, Smite, cast, cast, cast, cast, cast into hell; the prophets shall be cast into the fire of hell.
However, the advertising published on the company’s Facebook page has been called wide-ranging online.
77 000 times, and hundreds of times, a commented video has been received by shared viewers, and many claim that it is the result of the "screams" of the milk industry.
"The very wrong decision to use big product advertising.
Just like us, they have to become hard and hungry to produce milk, but their babies are taken a few days after their birth," one wrote.
"Elvie" breast milk smoke in undiscovered women who are breast-feeding (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment states: "I understand that this is traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise breast milk to mothers who can keep their babies?"
The view was also expressed: "The advertising producers didn't know what to do."
Others protected the advertising, and a woman admitted that, in her opinion, the music was “sudden. ”
"I think it's an excellent idea.
I'd buy it if I was still breast-feeding.
I'd be as good as a pig's.
The advertising is a little tricky, but I understand its idea.
This is a great product," he wrote.
Another comment states: "There is a taste of advertising, a thought for mothers who take off milk (in the workplace or in the toilets) and feel like "goose".
It is not a advertising that glorifys or condemns the milk industry."
At the end of the advertising group, the women find that they were all involved with uncanny smoke that was placed in their pockets.
The campaign’s concept is based on the observation that many women who turn off milk claim to feel like cattle.
But the Elvie Pump is completely sound, it doesn't have a guide and a pipe, and it's unbelievably included in a wheelchair intended for thirsty women, allowing them to move freely, keep small and even participate in activities outside the house.
Anna Balarina (Ana Balarin) "Mother" partner and creative director, commented: "Elvie Pump" is such a revolutionary product that it has won a courageous and provocative release on the market.
We wanted to draw parallels between the women who take off milk and milk cows, while demonstrating in a clear and understandable way the sense of freedom that will bring the new smoke."
It's not the first time the Elvie pump has started at the center of attention.
During the week of the London Fashion, two children's mother showed up at Martha Jakubovskas (Marta Jakubowski) on the street using this product.
Seventy migrant children's clubs moved to a remote town near the Texas border
The number of children detained from migrants has increased rapidly, although the border is cross-border every month, with relatively as many people as before, and in some cases it has been achieved by the slave rhetoric and policy of the Trampa administration, which has made it difficult for children to be expelled from sponsors.
The majority of sponsors have, in general, also been immigrants without documents, fearing that, openly ordered to take the child, it will jeopardize their ability to remain in the country.
The risk increased in June when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other members of their households would have to be allowed to remove fingerprints, and these data would also be transmitted to other immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the senior officer for the enforcement of immigration and customs laws, announced before the Congress that the agency had arrested ten persons who had applied for sponsors for minors.
Later, the Agency confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested persons were not convicted before.
"Nearly 80 percent of the people who are either sponsors or sponsors are illegally fed here, and most of these people are criminals.
That is why we continue to follow such people," said Mr Albensa.
According to the asylum staff, while trying to look at children’s cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules that require some of them to enter the court within a month of detention, not after 60 days of the previous standard.
Many will use the videoconferencing call option rather than come personally to defend their legal status before the immigration judge.
Persons considered inappropriate for the acquisition of exemption will be expeditious.
As children are kept in custody longer, the greater the chance that they will become vulnerable or vulnerable to violent attacks or refugee attempts is reported in accordance with the information and the evidence provided by the asylum staff that has been obtained from the system in the last few months.
Lawyers claimed that these concerns would increase in larger objects, such as Tornillo, where it notes that the child is suffering, are more often overlooked because of its prevalence.
They add that moving children to a nearby city without having enough time for emotional preparation or allowing them to leave friends could lead to problems that many have already faced.
Syria forces the US, France and Turkey's "occupants' army" immediately carry out their military
At the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valids al-Moualem (Walid al-Moualam) also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, even though the war in the country had taken place for eight years.
Moualem, who also fulfilled the duties of the Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign forces are illegal in Syria, arguing against the fight against terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must be removed without delay and without any conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moulalem said that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people and millions have been forced to leave their homes since the 2011 earthquake, "the war against terrorism is almost over".
He announced that Damascus would continue to "fight in the holy war until all the Syrian territories will be cleared up", both from both terrorist groups and from "the presence of any foreign military".
The United States of America has set up around 2000 soldiers in Syria, mainly training and consulting both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs, who are the opponents of President Bashar Al Asada.
France has sent more than 1,000 men to this war - torn country.
With regard to the refugee issue, Mualems announced that the conditions had been great for them to return, and condemned the "severe Western countries" for the "irradiated spread of fear" because the refugees did not want to return.
"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"These people are policying what should be the only humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive State aid until the end of the war between Asad and the opposition is concluded.
UN diplomats explain that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish buffer zone in Idlib (Idlib) has created an opportunity to strengthen political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented Russia's support for a large-scale invasion of the Syrian territory of three million people.
However, Moualems stressed that the agreement "and certain deadlines", and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the Jews, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda group "Jabhat al Nusrah", which "will be destroyed".
The UN envoy Stefans de Mistura (Stuffan de Mistura) hopes to contact the new committees, which will include government and opposition representatives, the first meetings to develop the Syrian constitution for the post-war period and to pave the way for elections.
The Moulalem set out conditions for the participation of the Syrian State in the Committee, stressing that the working group would be limited to "reviewing the existing Constitution" and warned of interference.
Why Tramps will be selected for the second time
From this point of view, Mr Trampa will be re-elected for 2020 only if, on the other hand, it is possible that many liberal observers, immunities and scandals will not presuppose the point to his presidency.
And in that case, "this will be the most dramatic final of the presidency all the time!"
Today, there is no evidence of a resting-place for observers.
Since 2014, the rankings in the CNN's most useful aircraft have doubled by reaching 1.05 million viewers, while MSNBC has almost tripled by 1.6 million viewers.
Fox News is the most popular show of 2.4 million viewers, compared to 1.7 million years ago, informs Nielsen company, while MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" (Reichel Medovas show) is located at the highest level of cable television rating with 3.5 million main news viewers in the evening.
"There's a fire that attracts many people because it's something that we don't understand," explained Neil Baer (Neal Baer), the ABC drama "Designed Survivor". This drama tells about the secretary of the Cabinet, who becomes the president after the attack is destroyed by the Capitol.
Nellai Skovelai (Nell Scovell), comedy writers-veterans and "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club" is their theory.
She remembers a trip with a taximeter in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The manager told her that she was voting for Mr. Trampa.
She wanted to know why.
"He said, 'Because he loves me,' told Miss Skowela.
Haos is, to a certain extent, misleading.
Of course, unlike all other TV shows, news from Washington could determine what will happen with the decision of Rou vs. Vedus, whether the immigrant families will be united and the global economic situation.
Ignorance is a mistake that only the most self-evident observers can afford.
And yet, it is more than just an informed citizen when it is time to look at the six expert groups to discuss how Bob Woodwards (Bob Woodward) has used anonymous sources of information for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort (Paul Manafort) 15 thousand dollars worth of bomber-type jackets from fast colors and skin ("the price of which causes high-speed", said "Washington Post" and what role the Stormian Daniels (Stormy Daniels) will play for Mr. Trampa, that is to say, anatomic detail description.
For example, I will never understand Super Mario as before.
"A part of what he does that makes this effect of reality is that he gives you information every day," Brents Montgomery (Brent Montgomery), executive director "Wellhouse Entertainment" and this present "Pawn Stars" creator explained about Trampa's changing command and daily performances (the wine with N.F.L., Kima Čenuna).

He was unable to retire, not even when British Caveno (Brett Kavanaugh) had to appear before the Senate Justice Committee and his future in the Supreme Court of Justice.
"I remember the time when we formed all these tapes and when people claimed that they were "the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleisa told me.
"I think it's nothing, but it turns out they had justice."

Externally benefit from the most powerful interparliamentary elections in the pre-election campaigns
It is no wonder that the 17th Congress election area in Pennsylvania is going to receive money, thanks to the conversion of the Congress area, resulting in two remaining Members fighting one place.
This newly modified Pittsburgh nominee area is linked to the Democratic representative of Konor Lembu (Conor Lamb), who won his place in the future of his special election last year in another area.
Lembs will fight with another current Member, the Republican Keith Rothfus (Keith Rothfus), who is now represented by the former section 12 of Pennsylvania, which is largely covered by the new section 17.
After the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old areas were not constitutionally divided into good republics, the maps were recast.
In the new 17th section, competition has created a conflict between the main financial groups of the parties: the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign Committee.
Lembs became known in Pennsylvania when the election of the widely observed March in the 18th Congress was won by a little overcrowded.
The Republicans have been in this area for more than 10 years, and President Donald Tramps has won 20 points in this area.
Political experts provide for a small surplus to the Democrats.
The United States considered Salvador's punishment for China's support, but then thought
The diplomats recognize that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing without much pressure from the Washington side.
Mr. Trampa had a friendly meeting with Panamas President Juan Carlos Varel (Juan Carlos Varela), and he stayed in the hotel in Panama until the partners left the post office of the Trampa organisation management team.
The Department of State officials decided to withdraw the United States diplomatic missions from the Republic of Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama, on the basis of the "new decision not to recognize Taiwan anymore", the representative of the Department of State Héter Nauret (Haather Nauert) indicated in a notice earlier this month.
However, it was considered to refer only to Salvador, which received about 140 million large amounts from the United States in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which would include the reduction of financial assistance and the reduction of targeted visas, would be painful to the Central American country where the level of unemployment and unemployment has reached the highest level.
During the internal meetings, the North American and Central American officials left a high-level conference focusing on security and economic well-being and following a similar meeting last year, which was recognized as an attempt to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
In mid-September, the State's senior officials expressed their appreciation that they wanted the conference to be held, in effect, completely ending their sentences against Salvador.
The diplomats informed that Vice-President Mike Pens (Mika Pence) had now decided to participate in the planned conference in mid-October in order to show how serious the administration is underpinning the meeting.
And three American envoys returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new and serious reports or sentences from the Washington side.
Our White Representative, speaking on behalf of Mr Bolton, did not wish to provide more information on the debates that three American officials, including two diplomats, agreed to discuss in internal negotiations if their anonymousness was maintained.
Their story proved to the administration that an external analyst, who also spoke on the condition that his anonymity would be maintained.
Study of history
The second stone garden could be the Special Prosecutor's report by Robert Miller (Robert Mueller) that Mr Trampa may have stopped justice, which has very much evidence in society.
It is claimed that Mr Millera will also investigate whether the Trampa campaign has secretly cooperated with Russia in its attack on our wishes.
If there is a second party to the Congress, Tramp will be responsible for this structure and possibly also for the jury of its members right now that he is already going to meet with the voters.
There is a lot of "bet" and I do not claim that the trampa crash is inevitable or that it will happen with its fellows in Europe.
There are choices that will have to be made for all of us on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, and these will show the length of the fight.
In 1938 the German authorities were ready to take action against Hitler if the West opposed him and supported the Czech Republic in Munich.
We enjoy the prospect of avoiding a life - threatening spirit that lasts for years.
History is moving around such points of reference, and the uninterrupted march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans now have to contend with several such points of reference.
What will we begin if Mr. Trampa will resign General Prosecutor Rod Rozenstein (Rod Rosenstein) — a man who controls Mr. Miller's investigation license?
It has been difficult for Rosenstein since it was reported that he proposed a secret to enter into negotiations with the President and was aware of his inadmissibility to the task.
Mr Rozenstein argues that the story of "The Times" is not accurate.
"How do we answer if the requested FBI investigation about Brit Kaveno will not be complete or fair, or if he will be approved by the Supreme Court of Justice for his infamous testimony and possible allegations of sexual assault?
And what is the most important thing, will we vote for the Congress, which will be called the Tramp on responsibility, inter alia?
If we don't keep all these checks, democracy will enter the north.
But I believe that we will do everything by referring to what we have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Hebrew Czech who sent the same Nazi regime to Auschwitz, once lying in my missionary home.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later sent me to a Saturday guest on the table with a swastika.
How can I not be optimistic about our future if I have such a heritage?"
Norman Eisen (Norman Eisen), the oldest scientific co-founder in Brookings Institute, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics, President of Washington and author of "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House".
The "Rangers" star Grems Dorans (Graham Dorrans) felt optimistic about the fight against wine "Rapid"
On the fourth day, Rangers will take on his own Wine "Rapid", knowing that victory over the Austrians after an impressive undisputed game in Spain with "Villarreal" earlier this month will allow them to take a stable position to qualify from the Group of the European League G.
The road trauma did not allow Grem Doransam to start participating in the season games until the undissolved result with 2:2 with "Villarrreal", but he believes that "Rangers" can use this result as a tramplin to achieve more.
"We can be happy about that because "Villarreal" is a good team," said 31-year-old footballist.
"We have to play to believe that we are able to make good progress, and we gain this point.
We may have been able to reach them at the end, but in general there is no good result.
They may have been better in the first half, but we found in the second half, and we were better team.
And on Thursday there will be another important night in Europe.
We hope that we will get three points, but it will not be easy to play because they have achieved good results in the previous game, but I am confident that with the help of our supporters we will be able to continue fighting and get good results.
The past year, with all my troubles and changes in the club itself, it was certainly difficult, but now new news is being heard that would be good.
The team is great, and the boys enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope that we will be able to continue the fight, leave the past season behind the walls and succeed."
Women are unable to sleep because they are worried about their pensions
Although the interviewees knew clearly what kind of care they wanted to receive, few were able to discuss the matter with family members.
About half of the people’s national research indicated that they did not talk to a married friend about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent responded that they had talked to their children about it.
"People want to take care of their family members, but nothing does to talk about it," says Holly Snaider (Holly Snyder), Vice-President of the State Life Insurance Agency.
Here's what you should start with.
Talk to a married friend and your children. You cannot prepare your family so that you will need care if you do not make your wishes known for a good time before.
Work with your consultant and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these options may be an important factor in determining costs.
Join your financial consultant. Your consultant can also help you to think about how to cover these costs.
Your ability to provide long-term care funding may include traditional long-term care insurance policies, hybrid insurance policies with a sum of money to cover these costs or also insurance using your property — the main thing for you to have money.
Develop your legal documents. Avoid legal battles even before they start.
Talk to qualified people about health issues so that you can be a reliable person who will monitor your health and ensure that experts act in accordance with your wishes if you do not force them to express themselves.
Consider, too, the possibility of granting financial authority.
Choose reliable individuals for financial decisions on your behalf who will be prepared to pay your bills if you do not force them to do so on your own.
And don't forget the seemingly detailed details! Imagine that one of your parents is being taken to a hospital to get help.
Will you start to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please indicate these facts in a written plan so that you will not be affected by this situation.
"And talk not only about finances, but also about who's a doctor," said Martina.
"What is the medicine used for?
What are you gonna do about the dog?
Prepare to develop such a plan."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to government information, a strong earthquake and tsunami, which visited the city of Palu, Indonesia on Friday, has killed at least 384 people. It is expected that the number of children will increase.
As a result of the broadcast, the rescuers have not been able to obtain any information from the area of Dongala (Dongala) located in the north of Palu and is close to 7.5 magnets in a strong earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people in Palu were evacuated after natural disasters.
See the basic information about Palu and Dongal, located on the island of Sulawesi:
The palace is the capital of Central Sulawesi (Central Sulawesi) and is located on the edge of the coast of the island of Sulawesi. It is estimated that 379,800 people lived there in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Dongal is a region that extends about 300 km (180 km) along the north-east coast of the island of Sulawesi.
It is estimated that 299,200 people were living in the province’s administrative region in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture is the basis for the Central Sulawesi Province economy, particularly in the coastal region of the Dongal region.
There is also an important role for oil production in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morovali (Moroulia), on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
As reported by the Indonesian Disaster Prevention Agency, Palu and Dongal have suffered several times from tsunamis over the last 100 years.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of buildings were excavated in Dongal.
Cunami also gased over the eastern part of the Danube in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is essentially active in the Pacific Ocean fire that regularly produces earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A violent earthquake in the north-east of the city of Acehas (Aceh) caused tsunamis in 14 countries on 26 December to kill 226,000 people across the Indian Ocean, of which more than half were found in the Aegean.
2005: a strong series of earthquakes visited the eastern coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Seventy men went into the wilderness of the country of the Gadarenes.
2006: 6.8 magnitudes of earthquakes caused by Java, Indonesia's most inhabited islands in the south, causing tsunamis that hit the southern coast, thus killing nearly 700 people.
2009: 7.6 magnets are strong enough to rise from the city of Paddan (Pandang) — the capital of the capital of the West Sumaras Province.
More than 1100 people were killed in the battle.
2010: 7.5 strong underground magnets visited one of the islands of Mentavai (Mentawai) near the coast of Sumtara, causing up to 10 meters high tsunami waves that sent ten prisoners and killed about 300 people.
2016: The earthquake near the ground visited the area of Piddie Jaya in the Aegean, creating positions and panic, as it reminded itself of the destruction that it brought with it the earthquakes and tsunamis that took place in 2004.
This time there were no tsunamis, but more than 100 people were killed.
2018: strong earthquakes visited the Indonesian island of tourism Lombok (Lombok), killing more than 500 people, mainly north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and in time hundreds of tourists were forced to return home.
The oldest son of Sara Pelinna was arrested on charges of violence in the family
Treks Peilins (Track Palin), the oldest son of Aláska governor and vice-president, was arrested because he was charged with shooting.
According to a report published by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, 29-year-old Peilins, who lives in Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested with suspicion of domestic violence and arrest.
According to a police report, when a news site tried to call the police to report how she was accused of committing crimes, she received her phone call.
He has been detained by Mat-Su in the pre-trial detention authority and has a high security amount of $500 for him, reports the CTU.
He stood before the court on the sixth day, where the question of whether to recognize himself as a criminal was declared to be "not guilty".
The party has been charged with three Class A offences for which he can be prosecuted for a long term prison sentence and $250,000 for a large fine.
He has also been accused of a B-class violation, which can be won by a long-term prison sentence and a US$ 2000 fine.
This is not the first time the charges against Pelin have been raised in criminal cases.
In December 2017 he was accused of an attack on his father, Todam Pelin.
His mother, Sarah Peillin, called the police and reported an attack.
This case is currently being examined by the Aláskas Veteran Court.
In 2016 he accused him of domestic violence, a report on the cessation of violence in the family and the use of arms in the context of this incident.
His friend claims he's got it in his face.
In 2016 the Veteran groups criticized Sarah Pelinna for her son’s violent behaviour with post-traumatic stress syndrome, returning from the service in Iraq.
Earthquakes created by tsunamis in Indonesia: killed by hundreds of people
At least 384 people have been injured after five days on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia.
7.5 strong earthquakes have caused tsunamis and have set out thousands of homes.
The electricity and communication networks have been set up and the number of children is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake took place near the central part of Sulawesi, on the south-east of Jakarta, capital of Indonesia.
Social networks broadcast videos that are visible at a time of conflict.
Seventy people were hanging on the beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors want to request a hearing of a rare death sentence for a person who was suspected there of a terrorist act in New York City
The federal prosecutors want to demand execution of the death penalty of Saijfullo Saifovam (Sayfulllo Saipov), which is held in suspicion of a terrorist act in New York City when eight people were killed. This is a rare form of punishment that has not been committed in the state of federal crimes since 1953.
As noted, 30-year-old Saipovs used "Home Depot" cars to launch an attack on the speed of the West Side Highway in Lejas Manhattan (Lower Manhattan) on his way.
In order to justify the execution of the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov's "intention" killed eight victims and "indemnity" caused serious harm, as stated in the statement of intention to request the death penalty submitted in the New York District Court.
According to a court document, both of these charges could be heard by the death penalty.
Within weeks of the attack, a large federal jury adopted a complaint on Saipova's claim for responsibility in 22 charges involving eight accusations of fraud for the purposes of excavation, which were usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as a complaint against the injury and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack needed "a significant planning and a previous intention", explained the prosecutor, saying that the attack by Saipova was "extraordinary, harmless and inhuman".
"Saifullo Habibuljevičs Saipovs (Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov) injured, injured and suffered the loss of families and friends: Diego Enrike Angelini (Diego Enrique Angelini), Nikolas Klivs (Nicholas Cleves), Anna-Lorija Decadta (Ann-Laure Decadt), Darens Dreks (Darren Drake), Ariels Elihs (Ariel Erlij), Ernst Feruchi (Hernan Ferruchi), Ernest Diego Mendoza (Hernan Diego Mendoza) and Alejandro Damjans Pannocco (Alejan Damian Pannucci)," wrote about the notion.
Five of the Upurs were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the prosecutors of the South-South New York District Court filed a complaint in a case in which a death sentence may be pronounced.
The accused Kalid Barnes (Khalid Barnes) was convicted of two drug suppliers, but he was sentenced to eternal imprisonment in late 2009.
Návessod was last executed in New York’s federal case in 1953, in July 1953, and Etele Rozenberg (Julus and Ethel Rosenberg) — a married couple who was sentenced to death after being accused of being involved in an attack on the Council in the good war in the Union two years before.
On 19 June 1953, the death penalty for Rozenberg was executed in an electric furnace.
According to court documents, during days and months, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not regret the attack.
As reported by the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the complaint, Saipov told the officials that he had taken the initiative to take the attack after watching the ISIS video on his phone.
The police informed him that he had also requested permission to issue an ISIS card in his court.
He has rejected 22 charges.
David Patton (David Patton), one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that he is "very, of course not satisfied" with the decision of the prosecution.
"We believe that the intention to request the death penalty is not to accept the recognition of the death penalty in exchange of the death penalty against eternal imprisonment without the right to release will only prolong the trauma created in the case for all parties involved," Patons explained.
The Saipov defence team has previously called on prosecutors not to request the death penalty.
The Conservative MEP announced that the management of the Brexit negotiations should be entrusted to NAIDŽELAM FARAZAM
During the protest, Najžals Faráž urged the Conservative Conference today to "mobilise the Army of the People".
The former leader of the British Independent Party announced that politicians should be aware of the urgency of the Eurosceptics when one of the members of the Council of Teresa proposed that negotiations with the EU should be entrusted to him.
The Conservative Officer Peter Bones (Peter Bone) announced on March in Birmingham that the United Kingdom had already appeared if Mr. Brazza was Minister Brexit.
However, the challenge that would have to be met by Mrs Mejas, trying to link his opposing party, was demonstrated by conservatives who supported the stay of the EU and joined a single protest in the city against Brexit.
The Prime Minister will fight to maintain his commitment to the future relationship between Britain and the European Union (Chequer's compromise) and to hear attacks from those who want to leave the EU, those who want to remain the EU, and also from the EU itself.
The public assumed that she would attempt to reach agreement with Brussels despite the negative reaction and let Eurosceptics and liborators choose between her offer and "haosu".
Mr Bouna "Leave Means Leave" announced that he wanted to destroy the Measuring Plan at Solihall (Solihull).
He suggested that Pharaoh make public and trust him with Brussels.
"If he had been at the show, we would already have gone out," Bouns said.
Member of Parliament from Velingboro (Wellingborough) added: "I will support Brexit, but we must reject the Measuring Plan!"
On the basis of his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight to be servants!
We want to adopt our laws in our country!"
Mr Bouna ignored the assumption that the public opinion might have changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that Britain has changed its mind and wants to remain in the EU is absolutely inconceivable."
Brexit's supporter Andrea Jenkins (Andrea Jenkys) also participated in March, and the reporters said: "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequer's plan is not popular, the opposition does not vote for it, it is not popular for our party and our supporters, who really does all the work and we like.
Please answer the Chequers and begin to listen."
In the case of May, she added: "The Prime Minister remains in his place when they fulfill their promises."
Mr Farage said that politicians in the past should be forced to refrain from complying with the decision adopted in the 2016 referendum.
"Now this is a question of trust between us, people, and our policies," he said.
"They're trying to transfer Brexit, and we're here today to tell them we're not going to do it."
In his letter, he adds: "I want you to let our politicians, who are planning to transfer Brexit, feel pressure.
"We will call on the citizens of this country who have allowed us to win the war on Brexit, and we will never be saved until we are independent, self-governing, peaceful United Kingdom."
As soon as the Palestinians crossed the city center of Birmingham, two hours ago a long morning took place.
Unknown activists welcomed Conservatives against the Breksita banners after a group meeting this week.
The representative of the parties of the parties, Lords Adonis, welcomed the Conservatives on the security issues they had encountered with the application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who claim us to be able to maintain the IT system order and all their technology for Canada and still, at the border, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute farce.
There is no such thing as successful Brexit," he added.
Vorena is planning to ask the US President for a careful thought
Senator Elizabeth Vorena says that she "consideredly" her candidate for the president's election after November's elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Masačouset democracy spoke of its future in the city of Westmassachset.
Vorena, who often criticizes President Donald Tramp, participates in the re-election in November and in a candidate against the Republican Geofu Dílu, who was Vice-President of the 2016 Masaçúsetas campaign.
It is speculative that she will be the main candidate in 2020.
The sixth afternoon of Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the electors, using the city’s morning from the post of Tramps.
A visitor asked her if she was planning to apply for presidential election.
Vorena replied that there is a real time for "there are women in Washington who are "salabos" imperfect government, which also means women-presidents."
With regard to the removal of Simsa from LSU basketball
The Baton Rouge police in Los Angeles reported on Saturday that on the basis of the suspect, the arrested person was arrested on Friday in the case of Viida Simsa, a LSU basketball player.
The batonry police officer announced that at 11.00 a.m. Daieons Simpson, 20 years old, had been arrested.
The next day, they transmitted the video to the audience, inviting them to help with the video in the presence of a man.
Sims (20) was shot and killed near the University of Southern students on Friday morning.
"One Sims was hit in the head as a result of a sudden fall," police officer Mérfijs J. Pauls said to the press on Saturday, during 247 Sports.
Four years of protecting his friend and Simpson's got him.
Simpson asked, and he realized that he was in the crash site, with the gun, and he realized that he had married Aide Sims.
Simpson was arrested without opposition, and he's in the East Baton Rødžja district police station.
On 6 June 6th, which took up the Baton dross, Sims played 32 games with 10 in the last season and played on average 17.4 minutes, acquiring 5.6 points and playing 2.9 outstanding bombs.
Russia Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton comes to the world champion's title after the command allows him to defeat Sebastian Fate
From the time Valteri Botas qualified on Saturday before Louis Hamilton became clear that the work of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the competitions.
From the start, Botas entered well and almost left Hamilton in the desert, defending his place on the first two trips and invited Fetel to attack his teammate.
Fatel first went into the shop and left Hamilton to be with the others, and it was most likely to be decided.
Mercedes's pilot was completed shortly thereafter and returned from Fetela, but Hamilton continued to lead after a comparison of the forces that saw Ferrari's driver leaving the inside freely, risking to stay behind the doublemanetra to protect the third pillar.
Max Verstapens started from the back row and at the end of the first circle was seven on his 21st birthday.
After that, he was in charge of a large part of the conversation because he focused on the clothes to get to the finish and kill Kim Raikonen on the fourth floor.
Finally, in about 44 C.E., he entered a cave, but he was unable to increase speed in the remaining eight circles because Raikonen remained fourth.
This is a hard day because Valteri was doing wonderful work all week long and was a real gentleman.
The team has done an extremely important job to get one of two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
On Saturday, President Donald Tramps congratulated Senator Diana Feinstein on his refusal to disclose a letter from the Christian Blassia Forda, in which he accuses the High Court candidate Brit Kaveno of sexual harassment.
Speaking in the spring of West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Forda's testimony to the Senate's legal commission, but commented that what happened to the Senate's evidence that people are "bad, insensitive and uncertain."
"The man who can happen and something beautiful that is already happening in the last days in the Senate, when there's a ghost when he sees sad, bad, insensitive and untrustworthy people," he said.
"When the press releases and misinformation and then they say, "Oh, no, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Atceries?
Diana Fenstein, did you misread the information?
Remember her answer to the question... or did you mislead the document? "Well, what did I do?"
But no.
I didn't do it."
All right, wait a minute.
Did we do it... No, we didn't," he added, in the senator's intonation.
In July a letter was sent to Finland explaining in detail what Forda was accused of, and the content of the letter was published in early September, but Finland refused to do so in her office.
"I don't hide Dr. Forda's accusations, I "unexploited" her story, "Fenstein told the commission, reports "The Hill."
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I did."
But she did not like the president, who commented on the situation on Saturday evening: "I would tell you that it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it's the worst part of the body language I've ever seen."
The President suggested that democracy be used for its own benefit by the High Court candidate who was accused of sexual abuse by three women.
"They are targeted to regain power through any means."
Whether they see evil, incompatibility, they are concerned about what they are suffering, which they must destroy in order to gain power and control," said the president, "Mediaite".
Elite League: "Dundee Stars" 5:3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Dvier entered two words "Giants" in a good game against "Dundee"
"Dunkee Stars" played about the loss of Friday Elite's league against "Belfast Giants" winning six days' answers in the game with 5:3 Dundee.
"Giant" gained a lot of weight when he won the words of Patrick Dvier and Francis Bevillier.
Michael Sullivan and Jordan Kovniy, under the leadership of the housekeepers, re-established the Giants.
The French Buhards compared the result to Dundee before two words received by Lukas Lundvalda Nilsen provided the team's victory.
It was the third loss of Elite League in this season for the boys of Adam Kife who won Dundee with 2 against 1.
It was the fourth team meeting in this season, where Giant won the previous three games.
The couple discovered the results of the game in the fourth minute, 3:35 getting the game from Kendala Makfaula, David Ruterford helping Boviljer double the result four minutes later.

The couple confirmed that "Giants" will be led to the first issue when he won his second words in this evening's game for the first period.
The housekeepers regrouped and Buhards again achieved a comparative result with the power-made games at 27:37 minutes.
Kovnij and Charles Korkoran have joined forces to help Nilsen launch Dundee for the first time during the second part of this game, and he has also been convinced that he won the last time to remove his team until defeat.
"Giant" who lost four of the five games, the next game will be called Friday at home with "Milton Keynes".
Air traffic controller dies by allowing hundreds of people in the airport to escape during a quake
Some air traffic controllers in Indonesia are excited about the vans after he made his own attempt to get off the ground with hundreds of passengers safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have died after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing tsunamis.
In the territory, there will continue to be plenty of grain and many will be scattered in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues saving his life, however, 21-year-old Antonius Ganaván Aggs refused to move his place of work to Mutaria Sis Al Jufri Airport in the airport control tower that was badly injured.
He remained in his position to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, then located on the train, was safely in the air.
After that, he withdrew from the traffic controller, thinking that it could break up.
Later, he died in the hospital.
The Indonesian Air Navigation Representative, Johannes Siritt, said that his decision could save hundreds of lives, reports the Australian ABC.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpan, Kalimantan to get him to the largest hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived at Pal.
"We're really upset to hear it," he adds.
In the meantime, the national authorities are concerned that the number of deaths could reach a thousand, the national disaster prevention agency claims that access to Dongalas, Siggi and Butgao (Butung) is limited.
"It seems that the beauty will grow because many more people's beds are under the roofs, as well as many cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, representative of the agency.
Flowers reaching a height of six feet [6 m] were exposed to Palu, where the Mass will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft continue to provide assistance and the necessary goods.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old new mother, Sky News, said: "In a few minutes a fast medical service will introduce new prisoners.
The water is scarce.
Small shops are overrun."
Jans Gelfands, leader of the International Sarkas Cross in Indonesia, CNN said: "The Indonesian Sarkanais Cross is quick to help the survivors, but we do not know what we will find there.
"That's already a tragedy, but it can still hurt."
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Pal and said to the national military agent: "I ask you to work day and night to perform all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia has already been devastated this year by earthquakes in Lombo, where more than 550 people are killed.
Air Niugini now says that one of the people is lost after the plane crash
The airline carried out a flight during which the aircraft was landed in the Gulf of Micronesia and now claims that one of the people was missing, although it had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the floating aircraft.
Air Niugini announced the press release on Saturday afternoon when they could not answer as one of the passengers — men.
The company announced that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find missing men.
The company immediately did not respond to requests for more detailed information on passengers, such as his age and nationality.
The local residents of the ship helped to save other passengers and crew after the aircraft crashed into the water by trying to escape to the island of Chuuk.
The officials said that seven people had been hospitalized on Friday.
The company reported that six people remained in the hospital until Saturday, and all of them are in a stable condition.
There is still no clear reason for the accident and the sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Marine fleet report that the aircraft has been placed in the cargo shortly after departure from the train.
Some airmen thought that the plane was turning off.
American passenger Bill Jensens said the plane was very low.
"It was really good," said Janes.
Jens says that he and other passengers were able to get out of the floating plane using emergency exits because the water was only to the center.
He said that the rats cried in panic and cried, as well as that he had a slight headache.
Seafarers working near the U.S. fleet to improve the ship’s crew also helped in rescue operations by means of an on-going ship to deliver people on the coast before the aircraft crashed some 30 metres (100 feet) below water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that in the last two decades of PNG registered airlines 111 people have been nominated, no one has been connected to Air Niugini.
Psychoanalyst commentator explains what happened at night when a woman was burned alive
On the sixth day, the complaint gave evidence repeatedly in the case under review where the man is accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rovlets of the Department of Psychoanalysis of the U.S. Department of Justice testified within hours as a witness to an expert on intelligence analysis.
He showed the victims how he used the phone information to gather together how 29 - year - old Quinton Telis and 19 - year - old Jessica Chambers were doing at night when he died.
Rovlet said that he received the location data from several telephones showing that Telis was with Chambers on the night of his death, arguing his previous testimony, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was located at Chambers when he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police took off Sanford.
On the sixth day, Sanford’s court ruled that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked if Telis told the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was "good because my car was in Nešvil."
Another complaint was that Telis said that he knew Chambers only about two weeks after his death.
The phone records show that they only know each other for weeks.
Rovlet said that shortly after the death of Chambers, Telis deleted from Chambers the information, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped him out of his life," said Heil.
It is expected that the defence will give its concluding arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he hoped that the trial would be handed over to the condemned later that very day.

Back to Black?!
In New York, the plant has proposed a release after receiving a "risistic" message
In New York, a lawyer filed a divorce in a court of discrimination after he had received the wrong message from his mother who claimed that the plant "is still in black."
It shall be prohibited to be found by comparing the law of the court to "pressure".
Lindsia Plasko-Flaksmana, the mother of two children, expressed her distasteful attitude by acknowledging that the new child carer, Jisele Mauris, was blackmailed when she began her first day of work in 2016.
"In NEVER, ATKAL MELNAIS," Plasko-Flaksmana wrote to her husband in a brief letter.
However, she sent the message to her husband, not to Mauritius, but to Maurizio twice.
Reluctant to his inaction, the "samulsus" Plasco-Flaksman's resignation to Mauritius, stating that his former afro-American student did a bad job and that he had been waiting for the Philippines, referring to New York Post.
Maurizio paid for her one day’s work and sent her home with Uber.
Mauritius has now appealed to the court, asking for compensation for a leave and wants to receive $350 a day within six months of working with a secure residence, which he originally requested, in addition to without a contract of employment.
"I want to show them that such things aren't doing," she said on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
After all, they have been accused of breaking up the Mauritian employment, claiming that it was a wise decision because they feared that they would not be able to trust him after his trial.
"My wife sent her what she didn't intend to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not found," Joel Plasko, a man, said "Post."
"Well, would you trust your children to someone against whom you stood up, even if it was just because of a mistake?
- All the nipples?
But think about it."
The court's sitting compared to "pressure", Plasko said that his wife had been born a little two months ago and was very "in a very difficult situation".
"Are you really going against something like this?
It is not an acceptable action," the investment banker added.
As long as there is justice, public opinion is quickly passed over social networks by rejecting them for their behaviour and logic.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of the Paddington book were worried that readers could not associate with the speaker
The Bonda girl Karen Jenkele, who was born shortly before the book was approved, said about the letter: "It's hard for you to "sit in some holes", which read the book for the first time before it was released.
It is very surprising now to know what we know about the great achievements of Paddington."
Sad to say, her father, who worked for an operator BBC before he learned to write books to children about a small rotary plate, was optimistic that his work would be rejected. She added that the publication of the book was "salden acid" after Father was released forever last year.
Speaking of Paddington, whom she calls "a very important member of the family", her father's ears were cheered up about his possible success.
"He was deaf, deaf man and not great," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was just as if you had a child who does something: you were beautiful even if you didn't do it yourself.
I think he looked at Paddington's achievements in a similar way.
Although it was her creation and her image fruit, she always gave all the benefits to Paddington's own."
I had to get out of my dead daughter's phone.
After her pregnancy, her daughter was rushed to the hospital of Nices, Louis Pasteur, 2, where doctors repeatedly fought for her life.
"Ned called regularly and said that it was very bad and expected her not to survive," Edna-Laperuza said.
"Then I received a call from Neda, saying that her death was nearing two minutes and I had to get out of her.
And so did I.
I said, "Well, I love you very much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine that the doctor gave her to maintain her heart rate gradually stopped and left her body.
She would have died sooner and it was all over now.
I had to sit down and wait, knowing this was happening.
I couldn't laugh or cry because I'll be in a situation where there's family and people around.
I needed a lot of power to rule."
Finally, after losing a girl in a terrible accident, Edna-Laperuza crashed into the plane along with other passengers who had no idea who she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I shake my head on the floor and the tears went away all the time.
It's hard to explain, but right in the flight, I felt deep feelings against Ned.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
A pregnant woman hangs a card on her shoulder to prevent suicide
Two women who have committed suicide have done so to help others not to lose their lives.
Charon Davis and Kelly Hamfrey strengthen the cards at the Welsh tower with inspiring messages and telephone numbers so that people can call and receive support.
He was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, but his suicide occurred when he was 18 years old.
"I don't want a parent to live up to what I have every day," she said.
David, who lives in Lithuania for 45 years, says that his son was a heavy burden on an addiction.
"Everyone knows her after smile.
Everyone always said that his smile was "lighted" always and everywhere."
But he refused to work before he fell asleep because he was "very, very dark."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found him after Tyler had committed suicide.
He said, "I'm constantly worried about the consequences."
The driver created the cards, "to let me know that there are people with whom you can turn and talk, even if it's a friend.
You don't have to sit in the classroom, you have to talk."
For some years after his mother’s death, Hamphrey, who had been a close friend of David, lost Mark, his 15 - year - old brother.
"He didn't say that he was right or was depressed or anything else was right," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that her attitude had changed.
He reached his lowest point on Christmas morning, when the children opened the gifts he did not have any contact with them or anything like."
His death was a great tragedy for children, but they have to end up saying, "It affects the whole family.
It's our choice.
But we all have to keep fighting."

The future of Britta Kaveno in the air of war because the FBI is starting to investigate
"I think if we could really get what he is asking for — time and amount in limited research — we could achieve little consensus," Fleeks announced last Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the commission "parts" between the closed partitions.
Why do Kaveno and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their stay is only corruption.
The election will take place after five weeks, on 6 November — if the Republicans are expected to go bad, then their efforts will be extremely weak to choose the highest court man from among them.
George V. Bush calls on senators, urging them to support Kaveno, who worked in the White House during Busa and thanking him for his wife, Eshli, who was the personal secretary of President Busa.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
A vote will take place in Senate, where 51 seats now belong to the Republicans, but 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kaveno can obtain at least 50 votes in Senate, which would allow Mike Pensam, Vice-President, to vote in favour of and approve him in the Supreme Court.
Kima's leadership has "reduced" number of North Korean political asylum seekers
The number of political asylum seekers in North Korea has decreased since Kim Jong came back seven years ago, said South Korea's legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Ministry of Association of South Korea, said there were 1127 political asylum seekers last year compared to 2011 when it was 2706.
The park said that the stricter border controls between North Korea and China and the high human contraband rates are the main factors.
Pyongyang's public comments have not been submitted.
Most political asylum seekers from North Korea are offered the citizenship of South Korea at the end.
Seoul says that over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them are passed through China, which has the highest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarization Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
Seekers of Chinese political asylum are considered illegal immigrants and deport them on a press basis.
The relations between North Korea and South Korea, which continue to be a technical war, have improved significantly over the last few months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries were called on Pyongyang to discuss the delayed decolonization talks.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between US Presidents Donaldu Tramp and Kima Jongunu Singapore, when, in large trains, they agreed to cooperate to release the Korean side from nuclear weapons.
But on the sixth day, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho won US sanctions since these negotiations, there has been no progress.
"If there is no confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our country's security, and under these circumstances we will never defend the first one at first," Ri said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York."
Ms. Pelosi calls Brit Kaveno "historical" and claims he is not fit for work in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the court, Nensija Pelosi, called the High Court candidate Bret Kaveno "historical" and claimed that he was not fit for work in the Supreme Court because of his temperature.
Pelosi commented on the interview on Saturday "Texas Tribune Festival" in Austria, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had taken this way, they would call her "historical," Pelosi said about his reaction to the four-day testimony to the Senate Justice Commission.
Kaveno’s emotional objection to the sexual harassment of Dr. Christine Blaise Forda when they were both teenagers.
In his opening argument, Kaveno was very emotionally, sometimes crying and smiling, talking about his family and school years.
He, in particular, condemned the democracies in the Commission, calling against him a complaint against "the destruction of the rich and harmonised character" organized by liberals, who are proud that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that he felt that Kaveno's testimony was a reason that he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed that he had a bilateral attitude to Democrats.
"I think he is disqualifying himself with such allegations and his attitude towards Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi protested when she asked if she would try to question Kaveno if she approved it and if the Democrats were to get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say so — if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he is not applicable to the office not only in the Supreme Court but also to work in the current court," Pelosi said.
Kaveno, now, is a judge at the Court of Appeal of the Washington District.
Pelosi added that as a democracy, he was concerned about the possibility of Kaveno taking decisions against "Affordable Care Act" or Roe v. Meids, because they consider him a conservative judge.
In his approval negotiations, Kaveno asked whether he would reject the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"There is no time for a historical and double person to work in court, but I would expect from us that we are happy to say, 'Is that not wonderful?' said Pelosi.
But women must remain in their own hands.
It's a detonation, months, and years, and it's all said "some evils," but she's not allowed it all out of her mind.
"We're mad when we're tired," said Mrs. Steinmas to me after 45 years.
"I don't think it's something that doesn't happen to you?"
She continued, "Sometimes I was greatly helped by a woman who was herself the leader of a company who said that she was also nervous when she was breathing, but created a technique — when she became tired and began to cry, her person who had spoken with her said: "You may think I am ashamed because I am deaf.
I'm tired."
And then she kept going.
And I think it's great."
Asphalt as dust discharges are only partially recognized, as they are understood for their own reasons.
One of my deepest memories is of the past work that was said to be of men, when I once wept because of the inexhaustible scent of my mother - in - law, a permanent manager (wife), of whom I was always a little afraid, who threw me into the back of a wheelchair.
"Never let them see that ring!" she said to me.
"They don't know you're going to tell me.
They think you're okay, and they're just happy that you're done "sucking under your skin."
Patriot Shrēder, then a Congress of Democrats from Colorado, worked with Gerija Hartu at his campaign presidential office.
In 1987, when Harts, who was engaged in extraditable relations, called the "cooked-up" ships, and came out of the elections, Shrēder, was deeply moved, he said that there was no reason why he could not apply to the office of the President.
"It wasn't a carefully thought decision," she said, laughing 30 years later.
"The election was already seven other candidates and the last they wanted to find another one.
It was the one who called it "Snegbelts and Seven Wounds."
She later joined the campaign, retired from the fund-raising campaign, and promised that she would not participate in the election unless 2 million US dollars were collected.
It was lost.
She discovered that many of her supporters, who offered $1,000 to the men’s ranks, gave her only $250.
"Do they think I've got a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she was not going to start a formal campaign, she was very emotional — grateful to the people who supported her — to the system that made it very difficult to get money and not to speak to the voters, and she was excited about sexism, in which she was "inspired".
"You think I have a nervous breakdown," Shrédere recalled how the press responded to him.
"You think Klenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking what they would write on my jacket.
"She's a rave."
Why the U.S.-China Trade War Can Be Welcome to Beijing
The main allegations of the beginning of the US-China trade war are hidden, and until the war is over, differences between countries can be favourable in the long term, experts argue.
US President Donald Tramps issued the first warning at the beginning of this year, covering the main Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant auction took place this week at new rates affecting the unit's $200 billion (150 billion) value, immediately covering half of the goods exported from China from the US.
Pekina also responds to "slips" every time, the latest is five to ten percent of the price of $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has announced that it is committed to responding to one another by the US, and it is doubtful that, in the near future, the world's second largest economy could be reduced.
In order to break away from Washington, certain requirements should be met, but public obedience to the US would be too offensive to China's President Xi Sji Dji Yingpin.
However, experts say that if Pekina plays its turn correctly, the US trade pressure can have a positive impact in China over the long term, reducing the interdependence between the two economies of the two countries.
"The fact that a political decision was quickly taken either in Washington or in Beijing could create uncontrollable economic conditions in any country that are really more dangerous than did previous observers," said researcher Abigail Greisa, "New American Security" focusing on Asia.
Syria is "gatava" for the return of refugees, the Foreign Minister said.
Syria claims to be ready for the return of refugees and calls for assistance in restoring countries where more than seven years of war has been fought.
Speaking at the United Nations Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Almualem said that conditions in the country would improve.
"The situation on the ground today is much more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists in their normal state.
There are all conditions for refugees to return voluntarily to a country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their well-being.
The UN believes that since the beginning of the war in 2011, the countries have suffered a fall of 5.5 million Syrians.
More than six million people still live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
The Germans said that the Syrian regime would take assistance in the restoration of the country.
But he stressed that the State would not accept the aid or aid from countries that helped to sustain the poor.
European golf course is essential to the victory of the Raider race in Paris
The European golf course was won at the 2018 Raider race race, and the US was surprised to read with a result of 16.5:10.5 "Le Golf National" outside Paris, France.
The United States has already lost six times in Europe and has not won the Raider Cup since 1993.
Europe recovered the gap when Thomas Bjorna, head of the team, won 14.5 points that were needed to review the U.S. election.
U.S. star Phil Michaelson, who had a hard time going through all the tournaments, drew his T-shirts into the water at par 3 16 am.
The Italian golfer Molinari has played in a series of stages, becoming one of the four players who have ever won 5-0-0 results since 1979, when the tournament is played in an existing format.
American Jordans Spetch with 5 to 4 casually lost the European team, following a rating, at the bottom of the current player Torbjorn Olisenam from Denmark.
World's best player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 against 1 Ian Polter from England, for which this was probably the last Raider hole.
The eight-year-old veteran of Raider's veter, Spanish Serhio Garcia, has become the best player ever from Europe with 25.5 career points.
"I can't read, but today I can't control tears."
This was a hard year.
I am grateful to Tom from the heart that he threw me out, and that happened to me.
I'm very, very happy that we've recovered the bag.
This is the team's profit and I am glad that I can help," said Garcia, emotionally after the European election.
He goes on to give his people John Ramam, who won the US golf legend Tager Vudsu on Sunday with 2 against 1 single games.
"It's the smile I'd feel when I beat Tager Vuds, I'm going to follow this player's expectations," said 23-year-old Rome.
Vudss lost all his four swords in France and now he has a career record with 13-21-3 Raider.
The statistics do not tell any of the best players who have won the 14 high-level golf tournaments for the second after Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team won every week to find their expenses, except Patrick Ryde, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf all tournaments.
U.S. President James Furic, after his team's inconsolable performance, said: "I'm beautiful with boys, they're fighting.
Now was the time when we were able to create a small pressure on the European team.
We fought.
All honor to Tomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of her players called a very good game.
We will restructure, I will work with the US PGA and the U.S. Raider Castle Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm happy to be his captain.
You need to put your hats on.
We won."

According to the FWC, a reduction in concentration was reported in Pinele, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier.
The swirling of the peacocks will increase from about 130 north-southern to the coastal line of the South.
