From my point of view, the literature programme was formed by the women of balsako age on the basis of their interests.
From the Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Daniel and Volcano.
They've written balsaco's best-age notes, of course.
And the psychology and suffering of Tolstoe and Turgeneva are not so interesting for adolescents.
I'm under a lot of interest in heroes' psychology.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Matras Promtex Micropocket Prestige 105x195.
Micropacket Prestige model: Comfortability and natural composition.
The matras have different strengths: the medium-distance surface is formed by a lacticated cococoholic and natural latex, moderately soft – a natural latex plate.
A 1000-metre-quare-block is quickly adapted to the surface of the hot body by warning of the effect of "walnu" or "damage".
Among the merit of the model, learning materials should be given.
The latex, perforated for air pollution, is perfectly ventilated in a natural way, like the cocoons.
As a result, a healthy microclimate is maintained.
The expanded guarantee period is also extended to the matras.
The period of official guarantee from the manufacturer is 5 years longer than the period of operation of the matrix.

Germany: Fourth seizure of corona virus inexhaustible
The fourth vaccination will take place in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany is not final but will continue with new force.
Despite the active booster campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of coronavirus vaccines are likely to be insufficient for full protection.
This convinced the Director of the Association of Doctors of the Common Practice of Ulrich Wigeldt.
On Saturday, 11 December, Die Welt reports.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will take place in the summer, at the latest," the expert believes.
In addition, Wigeldt hopes that the fourth vaccine from the crown virus can be carried out “in conjunction with the vaccine from the flu”.
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination can help to combat the spread of the new Omicron crown virus.
The new version is especially dangerous.
Yes, the probability of Omicron re-injury three times higher than Delta or Beta.
This is reflected in the results of the preliminary study carried out in the UAR.
Accordingly, BioNTech / Pfizer producers plan to provide Omikron-adapted vaccine by March 2022.
The companies stress that two doses of vaccines do not provide sufficient protection against infection by the new version of Omicron.
The study BioNTech and Pfizer showed that at two doses of vaccine, the effectiveness of the vaccine was significantly lower than that of “neutralizing potential” over 25 times.
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against micronutrition," the BioNTech and Pfizer stressed.
A third dose is therefore needed.
Experts insist on speeding up vaccination rates in the country.
For example, the President of the German Society for Disease Infectious Bernd Salzberger is calling for a reduction in the interval between the second and third indents.
Moreover, as Zaltzberger believes, rapid vaccination has an impact on the spread of both delta-virus and coronavirus micro-variant.
“Israel’s experience is very convincing,” the expert stressed.
Wobler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special spring of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
It (as well as the Kalikana Vib series) is different from the many other killers, which were created with regard to the use of frozen fish, not only for the catch of prey.
These explosions are greater than those of nearby analogues, a separate weight, which is certainly a positive impact on the new uses of these interesting assumptions.
Another recognized feature is the top of the vertical and horizontal surface of the solid and adjacent plastics, which creates additional vibrations at vertical and horizontal angles.
As a winter kill in the Bet-A-Vib field, there is evidence of enough aggressive game.
Often the most popular is the simple monotonous animation, which is the movement of the lifter up and down almost without a break.
When planning to avoid vertical axles, it is not very great that it is convenient to catch in a restricted area that is contaminated by groundwater vegetation, corals and other obstacles that can be overcome.
In addition, a small decline is currently under way in the catch of a winter and a large lake, especially in the middle of the winter when precise and aggressive perceptions are required.
At the end of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib is gradually developed and returned to the original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is also used successfully for the winter of the fruit stand.
You can choose from two modifications: with or without your pen (NS-NanoSound) or SL-Silent.
It has also been noted that Bet-A-Vib is able to break a passive stick that does not even respond to the player.
The distance and accuracy of the Bet-A-Vib is demonstrated in the catch.
The obelisk is understood and uncognizable, well combined with light and flat snouts even with large diameters.
For hunters, a hunter, a turtle or an asymptomous, other than an average current and a "step", sometimes with a "circling" on the ground.
If you're hunting in the occupied areas, you can change the front triangle to a double, which will reduce the likelihood of seizures.
Among its Bet-A-Vib class is one of the most stable at work and, as a result, one of the most vulnerable.
Similarly, it can be used both in small and in large areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36.

In Libya, about 7,000 Russian employees were reported
In Libya there are over 7,000 employees of the private military company (FIC) Wagner.
On 12 December, the President of the High Council of the Republic of the Haled al-Mishri made this statement.
"There are now more than 7,000 employees in Libya "Vagner".
They also have planes.
They're also growing trawls in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 reactive aircraft at the Gardabiya airport (also used as a civil airport in Sirte), " - a statement by Anadol.
Haled al-Mishri also indicated that Russian tenants are “testing to capture” the central part of Libya, extending from Chad to the Mediterranean, after “bringing their own people to power” in the Central African Republic.
Keep the presence
According to a publisher of the edition, Moscow sought the country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "located to Libya".
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using the airport and port in Sirte, as well as the airport in Jufre, is noted in the agency's publication.
The Russian authorities officially deny that the Vagner CCC is being supported by Cremland.
Where the Loners Can Be Still
According to the agency, Wagner is likely to operate in nine African countries - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides the military training of local forces, the personal protection of leaders and the protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, the Wagner subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licences for the use of useful and natural resources, as well as for the provision of arms, technology and military services in those countries,” the article states.
According to the media, "wagners" were fighting in Donbasse, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the CAR.
This group does not mean either the force agencies or the jury register, but its fighters do not exist in the formal lists of persons.
The company is subject to US sanctions.
Remember, earlier in the 27 EU countries had approved resistance to Wagner.
This decision is expected to be adopted by the Council of the European Union on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme Government Council of Libya de facto is the second House of Parliament with advisory functions with the Muslim domains in it, TASS writes.
This body has repeatedly called for a single day of vote on the election of parliamentarians and heads of State from 24 December as a minimum at February 2022.
“The elections will last less than two weeks, and they will be severely reduced in time,” notes the material.
On this basis, the High Electoral Commission of Libya has postponed the deadline for the final list of candidates, transmitted by Sky News Arabia.
Foreign policy with Russian eyes
38 per cent of Russians see the country's foreign policy more successful than failure, 29 per cent believe that they are overcome by failure.
"The leaders of success - "Syria protected, restored peace there," "The North River-2," "All the world was afraid of that cruel weapon", "Crime we're sorry".
The main failures - the conflict with Ukraine, the confrontation with the West, the isolation of peace - are discussed in the study of the Fund.
The Government of Dubai has completely abandoned the accounting industry, and all of the officials have become digital.
The Government of Dubai reported a complete rejection of accounting and digital technology.
All public services will also be provided exclusively by electronic means.
This is reported by the WAM Emirat Information Agency.
"Today has marked the beginning of a new phase of digitalization of all aspects of life in Dubai - we have completed the transition to the totally free government," said the successor prince of the emirite, President of the Dubaye Executive Council, Sheikh Hamdan Ben Muhammad Ben Rashid Al-Mattoum.
Now the internal and external documentation board in all locations of Dubai will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation has affected everything without exception from the industry: health, HCC, police, municipal bodies, courts and so on. Many commercial structures have also joined the Government's initiative.
The transition to the electronic government and the digitalization of the database began in Dubai since 2018.
At the same time, as the authorities had estimated, 336 million letters of deposit were stored, consisting of 14 million hours of human labour and $353.8 million in cash equivalent.
Earlier, Mr. Moskov Sergei Sobyanin stated that electronic services were available to citizens for 2 days a year.

Production and export of Turkish cars fell below 2020
Turkey's production and export of cars has declined rapidly in November on the basis of oil pollution.
As a result, industry indicators over the course of 11 months have been lower in the past year, Bloomberg reports, referring to data from the Association of Turkish Car Manufacturers.
According to the association, in November, 115 thousand vehicles were fired from the stations, which were 20 per cent less than a year earlier.
A total of 75.9 thousand machines were exported to exports, with more than 25 per cent coming from the previous year.
And if the Turkish car sector had demonstrated a positive dynamic over the past year in the first 10 months of the year, the output of the car had already been 0.3 per cent lower than last year.
As a result of this fall, the Turkish lira course was severely reduced, which in November amounted to 29 per cent of the dollar.
This has led to a fall in economic activity in all industries.
More than 500 SMEs received credit payments delay in 2021
The first Deputy Prime Minister, Alihan Smailov, told of the situation in granting benefits for small and medium-sized enterprises, transmitting the MIA ' s “Casinform” corrigendum.
“According to the information provided by the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the regulation and development of the financial market, in the current year pursuant to the Head of State's mandate of 1 April 2021, the President of the Agency adopted Order No. 127 of 9 April 2021, “To approve the arrangement for the granting of a period of payment for small and medium-sized enterprises”, he wrote in his reply to a delegation request.
He recalled that the provision of a loan payment schedule provided for banks and organizations carrying out microfinance activities, the payment schedules for loans issued before 1 April 2021 by IRB entities, including IPs, for the period from 1 April to 30 June 2021.
The deadline was 30 to 90 days after the MSMB sub-item was selected.
Another period of payment may be specified in the statement of the borrower.
In the period of retirement for the borrower, the claim-finding work was suspended, the notification of the payment of the deferred debt, and the receipt of the creditor of the commissions and other payments,” he noted.
In 2021, the second-level bank received applications for a discount on the loan of 603 SME subsidised entities, from which 553 SMEs received an amount of 9.7 billion tonnes.
In the IMF, applications were made for a derogation of 131 SME entities, of which 95 entities were granted a total of 105.8 million tonnes," concluded A. Smailov.
Plummonologist Purisev suggested that people with poor immunity could easily pass the Omicron strain.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity could carry it easier than those with strong immune response.
Plummonologist Sergey Purisev explained why the strain of the crown virus "Omicron" could be dangerous.
The reason should be sought under the condition of the virus.
Scientists believe that Omicron was born into the body of an infected HIV or a suffering immunodeficiency.
That's why he didn't meet any resistance to immunity when he was mutated.
As a result, he is more aggressive.
Because there was no immune response, he was very quick.
We see, there's these chips, chips, maybe more than there, their antibodies didn't come out during mutations, comments pulmonologist Sergey Purusev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity could carry Omicron easier than those with a strong immune response.
It turns out that the strong response of the body to something, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the organism can kill itself.
This is the case with pneumococcal infections when young people are 30 years of age and older than those who are 60 years of age.
The immune response of a young man is completely inadequate: wherever it was possible to threaten the finger, he will be beaten like a bullet by the arrows, and Sergey Prussiav concluded.
The doctor also recalled that there are dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them are pneumonia.
It's easy to burn. It's bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successful and fast, the second is often only symptoms - all hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will begin the intoxication of the organism is temperature, weakness, helplessness.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, headache, cough.
Left or right, mental pain can also testify to the developing problem.
By the end of the year, in Russia, a growing generation may be vaccinated from 12 to 18 years.

Immunologists have given rise to hypothetical causes of death
The authors studied the fatty tissue left from the bariatric surgery and found that the fat cells known as hypotheses could be infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells in the fat bag were also affected by macrophages, showing a strong burning reaction.
Scientists have also studied the fatty tissue of patients who have died from cocade and have discovered parts of the corona virus in the liver that are present in various organs.
It is well known that HIV and influenza viruses can be placed in a heavy bag using it as a reservoir in an attempt to avoid immune response.
Probably even SARS-CoV-2.
Biologists reported on reasons for dementia
The biological science candidate Semen Gološeikin called for dementia and told of how it was prevention in Radio Sputnik.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is a gradual loss of cognitive functions, and with the time of work, even in a marked situation.
Voloshekin noted that dementia is most often caused by neurodegenerative disorders, headaches, some infections, metabolic disorders and certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of disease development.
These include hypertonia, diabetes, increased cholesterol, vomiting, depression and alcoholism.
At the conductive level, the role of factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity is possible," he said.
Dementation is also affected by harmful practices, such as smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders, and a life-threatening way of life.
Among the first signs, the expert noted the forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and reduce the level of abstract thinking.
"There is a debate that loss of hearing may be an early occurrence of Alzheimer's disease, as well as one of the risk factors of its occurrence," he added.
In order to prevent the outbreak of WHO disease, it is recommended to maintain the necessary level of physiology, to train cognitive skills and skills that require memory and logic.

Egypt has returned about 30,000 illegally exported from the country of artifacts
In the last 10 years, the Government of Cairo has been able to return to the family of some 30,000 artifacts that have been illegally exported from the country by way of contravention.
This was reported on Saturday, 11 December, by Al-Hayat, the Chief Inspector General of the Department of Returns of the Ministry of Tourism and the Ancients of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Guaad.
Since 2011, 29,300 artifacts have been returned to the Egyptian State.
This year alone, 5300 memories of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered in the Bible Museum in Washington, D.C.," he said.
Abdel Gauad explained that all of the artifacts exported were recorded in the archives.
The Department's staff are now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists "follow all-world auctions and online sales" through foreign and Egyptian websites and social networks.
The Chief Inspector said that cultural values were restored when they returned and then presented in museums.
According to him, one of the artifacts returned was discovered in Belgium by an ancient skeleton of man, which is now part of the exhibition of the Egyptian National Museum of Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities called on Interpol to help find a auction in London's Pharaoh Tutanhamon.
Christie's auction house was held on 4 July, where the bus was sold at over 3,000 years of age for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This led to a lack of satisfaction from Egypt.
The Egyptian party also claims that art was illegally exported from the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamon, depicted as the sun god of Amon, was kept in a private collection and did not appear on the market since 1985.
How the relic fell in Europe is unknown.
In recent years Egypt has been actively repatriated from the country in various times of memories of the past.
According to the authorities, 95 per cent of the age of slavery is the result of the archaeological search for black buyers.
"The Russian Tatars aren't taken into account" - and that's right, just like the Russian Tatars (22,000) - is a single people (near to the Turks).
If you want to buy, only 42 thousand people — so many fathers (individuals) live in Crimea (see footnote).
The Roman Tatars are a distinct people, and the people's name is in two words!
Only the Turkish language group unites them.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to personal mobile devices of staff
Credit Suisse requires its staff to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, says the Financial Times.
The fact that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not provide its staff with corporate communications devices, rather than offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or a smartphone with a telecommunications operator.
Under the existing rules, the bank may review information on corporate devices issued by its staff, as they are used to deal with business issues with colleagues or clients.
The Bank is entitled to check the mobile devices in extreme cases, for example, if the staff member has used it to conduct a meeting with a client who has not been approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many staff members have moved into a remote mode of work, the Bank wishes to extend this rule to all the devices used to address labour issues.
According to the paper, the bank’s management has set a deadline for staff members to be informed of a new rule.
Officially, there is no information on the new requirement in the Credit Suisse.

Part 4
The last year of her life, Sergey Esena, 1925, was productive in creation, but more difficult for the earthly being of the poet and his "he".
He's already out of any literature associations, he's been dealing with imagination, he's on his own, but he's known, he's been bitten by critical times, even bad, but the reader's ready to put it on his hands.
More than 60 stiflings were written each year, many of which are the current workshops, completed by the “Persidy Motivations” cycle, written by Anna Sneigina, published 8 books, collection “Russia Soviet”.
The main success was that at the end of June 25, Gossidad concluded a treaty with Esseni to issue its compositions in the 3rd century.
None of the modern Sergeus Alexander's poets had such honor, he was the first!
Moreover, it had earned very good money, and under the treaty, Hungary had 1,000 rubles per month for 20 months (the business director, for example, received 300 rubs per month, engineer - 200).
The funds in that year were needed as never before.
Essen was married to the grandson of Liva Tolstoe Tolstoy, to have a family home, to have Sisters Katu and Sasha as well as to his mother.
The way of life would have been to enjoy it, but it would have been most appreciated in the dark tones if the treasure from the Black Man (written in November 1925 and already published after Esena's death):
My friend, my friend,
I'm very sick.
I don't know where that pain came from.
Is the wind real?
Over the free and open fields,
As I grew up in September,
It's an alcoholic.
Many observers have noted that Essen is very tired, looks bad, apparently sick.
It's getting worse. Nervous disorders are getting worse.
And the reason probably isn't just in alcoholism...
In addition, if such a diagnosis is an alcoholic, Sergey Aleksandrovic, someone who has been, there are no reliable documents left.
As related to May 1923, when Essenin, a fourth woman, was diagnosed by Aisedora Duncan, Americans, in a hospital in Paris with Professor Peter Hannushkin (again two years later, already in Moscow).
And here's the testimony of the poet, the scandals on this island, the police's overcrowded by ten memories.
Since the beginning of the 20th century, a terrible poet’s novel with a green snake has developed.
By the end of 1923, Essenin had recently moved to a friend of the patriarch Ivan Starceva.
Surprisingly, though, Essena never had her home in Moscow, or Peter, when she was in a very poor neighborhood, in a guesthouse, or in a brandy.
Older people remember:
"He only went to sleep, and in most cases he was drunk.
Once, coming back at four o'clock in the morning, Essenin fell into a train station...
I fell, I cut my face and grabbed it.
When he came in a little bit, he began to scream constantly, waving all his simple blood..."
Yes, even after the war on Europe and the United States (at the time it was a dry law, but Duncan had adopted a similar spirit reserve) admitted:
"I didn't see anything in there, except the cats and the street...
I've stopped remembering...
Well, and drunk, of course...
And I drank because the shower burned."

Matras Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Economic 100x195
Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Economy – the current implementation of the budget model in the premium class line.
The base of the matrix is a block of independent dual tube Duet.
Within a large hole, a softer hole of small size is inserted.
This allows equal distribution of load on matras.
On both sides of the matras is supplemented with an artificial latex.
It's a natural flat, but it's more flat and less expensive.
The depth and complexity of the material increase the comfort effect of the matrix.
The artificial latex is hypoallane, it doesn't involve moisture and dust.
Matras will have a great deal of money with a big difference in weight (about 30 kilograms).
Because of the "instinctive" noise, there's no wave effect here when a light partner jumps on the side of the heavy.
A nice, soft-to-skin bottle from a practical jockey, Sense, is a symphony wound.
Natural tissue is not affected by static electricity.
This model of matrix may be produced in a rounded variant (wacuum roll-pack).

The father will take care of his young daughter.
And he loves it, as he wrote to Lermont, "extraordinary love."
Why did the girl pay for the exam when she didn't lose it yet?
Why didn't he tell the girls it wasn't school?
Well, she's gonna have trouble.
So what?
I'm sorry.

MID Poland believes that Belarus is using migrants as "arms" against the EU
MID Poland believes that Belarus is using migrants as "arms"
The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland, Paul Yablonski, expressed the view that President Alexander Lucasenko of Belarus used refugees as "arms" against the European Union and intended to return to that "operation" next year.
The relevant application of the MDG agreement was made in the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to the Jablonian, the sanctions against Belarus were temporarily “resisted by Lukaschenko”, but it is “responsively seeking new ways”.
The Polish official is also convinced that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons “in many parts of the world”.
According to the kp.ru website, the former European Union introduced the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It was composed of 17 natural persons and 11 organizations.
In Europe, there was a willingness to continue to expand restrictive measures against the Republic, "if the situation in the country does not improve".
Minsk responded by placing a food embargo on a wide list of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions on Belarus.

After his example, Prince William, who started the award ceremony at The Earthshot Price, was accompanied by a green barhatic pike that was not consistent with the Royal Variety's royal dress code, and then selected a more classic option for the event in support of the Royal Variety benefit fund.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend was for Lionel the Messiah.
The footballist came to pick up the seventh Golden Sword in the Dolce & Gabbana Barhatta.
His sons were dressed in the same suit.
AliExpress has already noted the growing demand for barghat male pears in Russia.
According to the service analysis conducted in the Gozat.Ru, they were purchased in 1.4 times more.
The most popular hot barbedbeds with a plate and a sealed silhouette, the main colors are dark and dark, cloudy, dark blue and, finally, black.
The average price of these models is between 3 and 6 thousand rubs, and men prefer to buy exclusively peaches - sets of barghat costumes they choose.
You can buy them not only in online ritelers.
The budget options are in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the segment of the luxury skiing from the bar in this season, almost all brands - and Brioni, and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.

The fashion expert Lamoda Ilya Wahoškin warns that in the case of a barhatic pike, it is not his model or fashion, but its convenience.
"Barghat demands a night's light, so that's the ideal thing if you've gathered for dinner or a funeral," explains Wahoškin.
Another important criterion that allows for the option of a barhathed peach is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a barhoat piazza, first of all, must have a well-pronged girlfriend with enough, - the authors of the Telegram Canal on the male fashion "Brammel" - the owners of the barhaat piazza are usually the ones who buy tickets.
They are simply invited to dedicated world activities where the dress code is always indicated.
Elia Wahoškin proposes to combine a peach from the bar with the same nuts: classic blokes with arrowheads, single-toned rubies, shell gloves, kittens with knobs, knobs.
Too simple and everyday things will look inappropriate.
The fashion experts from Brammel's Corps are convinced that there will be an inappropriate appearance in the barhatic pier of a number of corporate employees, and here is a "director of those who perform this event, yes" to him.
If the employee's rank is lower and his goal is to move more into the company's complex or to buy financial bonuses, then the best bargot will not be expected.
This guide is exactly what the phrase "not by St. Luke's hat" means, as the editors of the Telegram Canal believe, about the male fashion.
It's a lot of feelings from the voice.
It's a natural temperature, it's so intense.

Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the University of China of Hong Kong have thus concluded that South China Morning Post (SCMP).

Ukraine's Head of Mission accused the FRG of blocking NATO arms supply in Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, Alexei Reznikov, accused the Government of former FRG Chancellor Angel Merkel of blocking the acquisition by Kiev of lethal weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times of 12 December, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany had imposed a ban on the purchase of Ukrainian anti-aircraft systems and vineyards for the destruction of non-pilots.
It is noted, however, that Berlin later reduced its position on wines, recognizing them as immortal weapons.
According to the Minister for Defence, Kiev intends to acquire the above-mentioned weapons under bilateral agreements with the allies.
In particular, it concerns the United States, Great Britain, Lithuania and France.
In the meantime, FT notes that the position of the new German Government under the leadership of Mr. Olaf Scholtz ' s Chancellor on the authorisation of arms delivery in Ukraine remains unclear.

According to him, the former FRG leadership had justified its refusal to provide arms for the risk of the development of a conflict in Donbass, despite the “occupation of Russia” in part of the Ukrainian territory.
The same "illegal" position, a certain diplomat, Germany will remain at the new Chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelenski stated that Kiev was looking forward to Berlin's assistance in the construction of the sea fleet.
In Ukraine, Germany "will be a technical partner in Ukraine," the president added.
It was also noted that, last year, the president of the Green Party, FRG Robert Habeck, visited the Republic, where he made a statement on the sale of defence weapons to Kiev.

Discovery ways of returning stolen money through the Internet
There are several ways to return money stolen from online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were disclosed by experts on information security in the CDR.
In order to reduce the risk of major losses when the bank card falls into the hands of criminals, it is recommended to keep the main funds on the card or bank account that are not used in online shopping.
The amount of savings may be reimbursed to the reserve account and determined as necessary.
Experts also recommend that a separate network card be placed.
If money has been stolen at purchases in stores that do not use 3D Secure protection technology, a return procedure may be initiated.
“In the framework of the rules laid down by payment systems, on unauthorized transactions without using 3D Secure, responsibility is placed on the participant in an account box that does not use this service,” the representative of Promwizbank explained.
An expert from the international payer, E Compey Arthur Zaremba, stressed that the buyer had the right to make a statement to the bank against the mining operation not later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the offender has used a map of online resources that does not require bilateral authorization, the transaction can be cancelled and the money can be returned.
It is noted that, in some cases, Internet stores themselves return client funds if the order has not been sent to the delivery.
On 19 November, a member of the Public Chamber, Director of the League of the Internet, Ekaterina Mizulina, reported that only 11 thousand cases of fraud had occurred in 2021: from the sale of separate documents to the purchase of personal data.
In her statement, an effective solution to the current situation could be the establishment of a single window for complaints to online offenders.
Scholtz came to Poland to discuss "Northern Stream-2" and EU legislation
The newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholtz arrived in Warsaw for negotiations on the crisis with migrants at the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the development of Russian troops at the Ukraine border, and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline "Northern river-2".
Although Scholtz expressed his desire to maintain a good relationship between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unambiguous expectations.
The Prime Minister of Poland, Mateus Moravia, stated that he would call on Scholtz to speak against the North River-2, which is intended to deliver Russian gas to Germany in the context of Ukraine.
According to Moravia, Russia can use a gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
Germany, in turn, supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to escape from Belarus.
Berlin stated that it would help Warsaw and Brussels resolve this crisis.
The Polish judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for the dispute.
The European Court of Justice condemned Poland, stating that the judicial reforms carried out by the legal party "Right and justice" violate EU law.
Poland refused to pay taxes and its Supreme Court decided that national legislation had priority over EU rules.
Despite the demands of Poland and the United States, the new Government of Germany has not made public commitments to halt North River-2 in the event of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
American officials told members of the Congress that they had reached an understanding with Germany of the stop-of-gas treatment when Russia entered Ukraine, a senior officer of the United States Congress reported on Tuesday.
The German officials did not confirm these communications, but Scholtz in the middle warned of the consequences if Russia violated Ukraine's borders, and this position was confirmed by the representatives of the Great Semmerka on Wednesday.

The next money in the wall of the church will pay $20,000.
Santechnik, who found money in a church wall in Texas, U.S.A., will pay a prize.
This is reported in the press release of the Crime Stoppers of Houston.

A surgeon, a doctor of medical science, a Russian scientist, Anatoly Altstein, in the absence of Ura.ru, has broken down the full protection scheme against coronary infection.
He said that this could be achieved by introducing injections and administration of nasal vaccines.
Immunoglobulin A is widely used for international use. This does not occur when the vaccine is injected.
Immunoglobulins A protect the fluid eye, so the virus cannot penetrate the organism.
And in the post-vaccination we have more of an immunoglobulin G (antiboline).
And if you take both vaccines, you get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G, but there's still no solution for double vaccination," he told the doctor.
The chief profilatologist Urfo, doctor of medical science Sergei Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of the use of nasal vaccination in conjunction with the injection is to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help to ensure that, in this case, the protection of the body is likely to be maximum.
Former Minister of Health of the Negrorod area, David Melik Guyenov, stated that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic would lead to the spread of a new coronary infection among children.
He said that this picture was observed in other countries where the regular wave of pandemics had occurred earlier.

Mass protests against vaccines are not being stopped in Europe
More than a thousand demonstrators went out on the streets in the Austrian capital of Vienna.
They expressed a lack of satisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to do vaccination from a mandatory cadette.
As of February of the year, people with disabilities will have to pay a fine of EUR 3600.
Spain, repatriated by the health authorities, carried out a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some kept in the hands of crying with the title "This is a fake pandemic," "I won't be vaccinated."
A major protest against health passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, code-certificate is required for access to bars, restaurants, sports halls, the home of the elderly and night entertainment establishments.
The decision to introduce health passports to several regions of the country was based on an increase in the number of cases of coronary infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand Manifestants protested the abuse of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The operation began peacefully, but then grew up in a relationship with guards.

WHO has already discovered "micron" in six decades
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the new strain of the micron virus has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new stamp may have disastrous consequences.
The volume of tobacco was reported in WHO communication.
According to the organization on 9 December, 63 countries had already been identified in all six WHO regions.
This is because it has become active since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the high rates of the spread of the new version of the coronavirus.
WHO experts are afraid that a new stamp on preliminary data could be spread to the extent of the "delta" stamp, the same Indian version of the coronavirus that now leads in all countries completely without exception.
Earlier, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhan Gebreus, stated that micro-smokers could have a significant impact on the pathogen of coral virus.
Similar conclusions were reached in Britain.
The experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that in the coming months, the micron will be exposed to delt.
The number of patients in Britain alone is about 1 million, with an official “micron” currently suffering from several hundred people in the Kingdom, and an estimated 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the microns, and more than 2,000 people will be taken to the hospital every day.
The British health system will not be able to deal with.
The situation is complicated that, according to recent studies, the effectiveness of vaccines from Pfizer-BioNtech against the micron is 32 times lower than other types of disease.
The reaction to the "Microne" of the Russian "Sputnik V" is still unknown - this will become understandable in the next few weeks.
The center of the name Gamalai was just beginning to test the Russian vaccine on the micron.

$135 billion in applications - Hi-Tech
In 2021, the costs of users in the applications increased worldwide by 25 per cent and by 8 per cent.
The world's most popular video services were performed.
Most users jumped the CapCut video editor and spent most of their time on YouTube.
The number of applications being loaded and the cost of users has increased significantly since January to November 2021.
The number of loads increased by 8 per cent, reaching 140 billion. The cost of users in the annexes increased significantly: 25 per cent, to recorded $135 billion.
This data was published by the analytical company App Annie, which presented a report on the market of mobile applications in 2021.
In 2021, the world economy came out of the lockdown and the post-repatriation began.
"Do you see this "return to the physical" growth of the application economy? Nothing," the authors of the report say.
India has become a leader of dropouts: about 20 per cent of all shipments are available.
The United States (9 per cent) and Brazil (8 per cent).
IOS users, as before, spent more than Android users: 65 per cent of all costs were incurred in the applications.
Among the applications was the first one on the 2021 jumps by video editor CapCut.
It includes two Indian applications: MX TakaTak videos and the Meesho online marketing application.
There is also a Telegram in the 10th load.
In general, when judging the number of jumps, there are two popular VPN services between users (both with VPN Master and NightOfl VPN) and services related to the creation and transmission of video (other than CapCut and MX TakaTak with 10 others include two such services - Moj and SnackVideo).
"Most users have spent themselves in online transmission and transmission applications," the authors of the report noted.
This leads to YouTube, which includes TikTok video servers, Disney+ and HBO Max video servers, as well as the Piccoma mango Japanese sign service.
The first of the monthly active users is Telegram, Instagram, Zoom and TikTok, closing the Microsoft Office mobile version.
In Russia, the number of loads per year was a shopping-application of AliExpress.

The most successful industries that have helped people to be closer to both virtual and personal," commented the results of the report of the Marketing Division Director App Annie Lexi Sidou.
In 2021, the mobile game sector had reached $90 billion by the leadership of the jumps, with causal and hypercurricular games that had no or almost no content, and the video format was minimal.
In the 3rd most popular game in the world came Count Masters, Project Makeover and Bridge Race.
In Russia, the game is headed by DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going Balls and Phone Case DIY.
Earlier, App Annie presented its 2022 forecast.
Among the main trends of the following year, the company's analysis referred to the growth of TikTok users to 1.5 billion, the increase in the population of the Z-generation of financial applications, such as the applications for Robinwood investors, as well as the further increase in the popularity of the metabolic games.

The Russians warned of a new pattern of moustaches
Criminals have started looking for new ways to hide in video messages.
That's what the News says with reference to experts.
According to the director of the product company Ividon Zaura Abbotalimov, the main risk associated with the dissemination of video communications is diphthenics.
In this case, the flyers have created a fake video on the basis of actual records of the victim's participation.
Thanks to this, neuroscientists are able to properly reproducing the characteristics of someone else’s behavior.
The Abbotalims added that using diphthenics, criminals could call a known victim on the video screen or play a role with a copy of the person to be sent for execution.
"These loans can only lead to buliming, as the underprivileged criminal can put people in poor, dangerous or compromising psychopathic scenarios," said the expert.
The leading system engineer Varonis Alexander Vetcol noted in turn that psychological people more trust others when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks when it comes to video technology.

The doctor Paulova told me about "migrating the day out" at the workers
Several factors can lead to loss of self-consciousness in the outputs
The reason for the loss of self-consciousness after work was often “migrating the day of departure”, said a well-known doctor, a medical scientist, an senior professor at the University of Fundamental Medicine of IGH, the director of the Hospital of the Systemal Medicine of Zukrahra Paulov in his telegram channel.
In her words, it is particularly common for workers to experience physical pain, confusion, and weakness.
In addition to the week of pregnancy, Paulova noted that there are many objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to change conditions.
Our lives are changing in a way that is original.
"Sim for a long time, we've been sleeping on the couch, almost eating more, and drinking less," the doctor argued.
Because of the transfer and lack of water, gravity and dispersion."
The additional role plays a late stage.
Yes, if you get up three hours later, you'll have a reaction called a jetilla.

UAR scientists have stated the low effectiveness of Pfizer vaccinated anti-micron vaccines.
In UAR, Pfizer vaccinated low-efficiency vaccine against "micron"
The scientists of the South African Republic studied and reported the low effectiveness of Pfizer vaccination against the micronucleus virus infection.
According to estimates, it (the micron neutralization level) corresponds to (the root) effectiveness of the vaccine in 22.5 per cent against symptoms, and therefore... the ability to protect the vaccine from infection is doubted - a study published on MedRxiv portal.
In this regard, experts have explained that the preparation can be saved from a serious illness.
Previously in London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was predicted that the micro-stem coronavirus could cause new pandemics in Britain with more frequent hospitalizations than last year.
How many hidden sugars in the ordinary products?
Sugar is not the best source of nutrients.
His rash may lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as to heart disease and oncological diseases.
Users should be taken into account that, in an unknown word, the product may be indicated by a hidden sugar ingredient, similar calories, composition and glycaemic index.
A few dozens of names may be displayed on the label, in fact, marked by sugar.
One of the most widely distributed and frequently met names is glucose and fructose.
There may also be other dried sugars such as desserts (cooked sugar), lemons (fruit sugar), melancholy (black path), acid syrup, etc.
These are all simple hydrocarbons that are related to mono- and disacharides, and they may be not only in condimentary products but also in catapulse, in the doctoral column, bread, etc.
The most effective way to reduce the consumption of sugar is to use targeted and unprocessed products as well as to pay attention to the label and to many different names of sugar.
The variety of sugars varies according to taste, but whatever the ingredient in the product is called syrup or nitrate, processed or unprocessed, raw or white, it remains the sugar.
The exact quantity of sugar should not be taken into account just as it is necessary to take into account not only the quantity of sugar specified by the packaging manufacturer, but also that the fruit, fruit, etc. contains a certain quantity of sugar.
Thus, the total number of sharks can be significantly higher than that indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholtz: Gas Loses the importance of the FRG 25 years ago
The new FRG Chancellor Olaf Scholtz stated that the import of gas was of no importance to Germany, as the country continued to move towards decarbonisation of the economy.
Germany, he said, planned to give up gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate neutral country.
"It will take 25 years for the world to play a different role in the transport of gas to the FRG and Europe," said the Chancellor.
Scholtz noted that Germany is still committed to transporting Russian natural gas and in the future, as this resource is now important for energy transfer.
He recalled that Germany and the United States had made a statement in which support was provided by Berlin for the energy transformation of Ukraine.
Former head of the IMD of Germany, Annalene Berbok, stated that the process of certification of the "Northern River - 2" gas flow continued.
According to the Minister, in the context of the coalition negotiations and discussions of the Coalition Treaty, it was stated that energy projects should be applied to European energy law.
The diplomat also indicated that the trajectory was still “not in conformity with the requirements” of the EU.

Hackers violated Twitter account Prime Minister India Narendry Modi.
Criminals have been able to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India had recognized the battle with legal means of payment and that the country had already purchased cryptovaluate.

The Prime Minister said that on Twitter they quickly responded to access to the account.
The Indian Prime Minister's side had already fallen in 2020 and had called for donations to the fund with the help of cryptovaluate.
At the New Caledonia referendum, the majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as two previous ones.
According to the first partial results announced on 12 December, on Sunday, most New Caledonians voted in favour of the referendum against the independence of their territory.
At this level, participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to the preliminary results published by the local authorities, "for" the independence of New Caledonia from France was 3.51 per cent (2,755), while 96.49 per cent (75,762) voted against.
Javka represented 43.90 per cent, with more than 80,000 inhabitants in New Caledonia participating in the elections.
As France-Presse commented on these interim results, “the outcome of these elections did not leave room for doubt”, as independent parties called for voters not to participate in the vote.
As a referendum initiative, they objected to its holding on 12 December, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago would involve a thorough and "true" pre-election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation opened the way to the third victory of the French New Caledonia parties following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018 56.7 per cent of the population voted against independence, from 53.3% in 2020.
As separatists have said, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and oppose them in the UN.
As reported on Wednesday, 12 December, in the Elisha Court, French President Emmanuel Macron was to address the outcome of this referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia ' s independence has been very alive in recent weeks by the French presidential campaign.
Several candidates in the presidential capacity were encouraged to remain in France, as it was “the last region of the presence of the European Union in the Pacific”.
"New Caledonia must be bound to remain French," repeated Eric Zemour several times.
The same statement was made by the Republicans of Valerie Pères, who finally published a column in Le Figaro, inviting the Caledonians to remain in France.
On the other hand, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take the position "because it was not his responsibility".
Nevertheless, the president added, "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Kastex, on his side, expressed his strong desire to select the Chaldeans as the choice of France.

WSJ readers discussed the article on relations between Russia and the United States
The Wall Street Journal was criticised by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of Russia and the United States.
The author expressed concern that the West Bank would bring Ukraine to the victim of Russia.
In his article he convinced readers of the danger posed by Moscow and allowed a number of disturbing remarks to be made to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In the end, Hartwell called on the Western countries to "get out of the single front against Russia".
The WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the position of an American professor.
“In this article there is a lot of false information,” says the RIA News of one of the readers.
"Europe is not ours to lose it," and Ukraine is not our country.
The United States dollars and NATO allies will never enter a nuclear war with Russia for Ukraine," another noted.
Peaches can also be applied in the area of loss.
The Dearboo Peach & Hibiscus Brightening Hydrogel Eye Patch is a high-tech polymer, which ensures high susceptibility and transfer of high-concentrated natural vegetation.
The transfer of nutrients to the skin of the hydrogel minimizes the compound loss of moisture and prevents the essension to penetrate the deep layer of the skin.

The desirator material is a high quality acrylic white-coloured paint that ensures a light bulb balance and a good light pass.
The shape of the ceiling: a square, in the form of a lyophane with a geometrical drawing, decorated with transparent points that give the embedded light a beautiful effect of "star measurement" and flow.
The IP43 level of protection allows the use of a light bulb in certain areas.
The set consists of the replaced LED module with lens power 72 Wt, which corresponds to 520 Wt.
Also, the DU pulse, which is used to produce a plutonium change in the colour temperature of 3000-6000K, changes in brightness, changes in temperature/white/cold/night light.

Magnitude 5.2 earthquake occurred in the Curial Islands area
Magnitude 5.2 has occurred with the island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the earthquake epicenter was 231.8 km north-east of the city of North Kurilsk.
The eye lies at a depth of 92,5 km.
Former seismologists had fixed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake in Peru during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing new generation-based reactive drivers
A new Ukrainian-Turkey plant is starting to create reactive non-aircraft aircraft (BPLA) of the type ANKA.
On 11 December, the Deputy Chief Adviser of the Ukrainian President, Aleksey Arestovic, was informed.
That's how they can act against air objects, against other air carriers.
Even against the pilot's plane.
There will be Ukrainian engines and other Turkish aircraft: corpus and so on," he quotes Dialogue.ua.
Commenting on the main characteristics of ANKA equipment, Arestovic said that it was active rather than empty BPLAs.
He said that it was a new generation of homeless people after Bayraktar who exceeded it “by all characteristics”.
The first BPLA party should be produced by a firm at the end of the following year, Arestovic concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of a non-pilot was carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The opening of the Ukrainian General headquarters has been secreted by data on the use of Bayraktar and Javelin rockets during the military operations of the combined forces in Donbass.
On 6 December, President Vladimir Zelenski of Ukraine reported that the construction of a modern military facility had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine is intended to use drones.
On 29 September, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian missions concluded an agreement on construction in the Kiev Centre for staff training and testing and service of Turkish BPLA Bayraktar.
The Press Office of the Ukrainian Leader called this memorandum “a major real step forward”.
Two lions fled from the container at the airport
At the Singapore airport, Changi fled the lion.
The Streets Times reports on this.
Two hunters were able to choose from a container with a family of lions coming on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were imported to Singapore and where they were sent.
One of the runaways stood on the edge of the container.
The animals were unable to leave it because of a series of protective networks.
The opposition ended after arrival at the airport of the Mandai Wildlife Group, which was known to all Singapore zoos.
They traveled on foot with tractors and planned to transport them to the quarantine facility.
Previously, it was reported that in Ponnoppen, the capital of Cambodia, Levi had fled from the village and had gone to the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast came home voluntarily, and the people were not hurt.
Specialists warned of the risk of cancer due to vitamin B9
Studies show that vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
The publication Daily Express warned of this.
Experts believe that there is strong evidence that people who do not experience a lack of follicular acid are less likely to suffer from some types of cancer, in particular, colorective.
However, the increase in the required dose is conducive to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor of the University of Alabama in Birmingham, Dietologist Bet Kitchen advised to monitor the amount of follicles consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per dose.
The risk of cancer shall be increased only if it is substantially avoided in the larger or smaller part.
Chitchin recommends not to take vitamin B9 in tablets without the doctor's recommendation, to monitor the dose and to avoid milk and other foods containing follicle acid.
A former food consultant, Rachel Fein, called a follicle acid that slows the aging.
Since she, among other things, is a avocado, Fein recommended that men have this fruit 50 years later.
In Britain, up to April, about 75,000 people die from micronutrition.
British scientists estimate that the spread of corona virus micronutrition in the next five months in England may kill up to 75,000 people unless the limits of the winter are exceeded.
The Guardian reported on this with reference to the study of experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), which TASS transmits.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the emergency advisory group at the British Cabinet, by April 2022, at least 25,000 emergency exits are in the country, and some 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
In addition, more than 2 000 infected people will be admitted every day to the hospital.
"The serious measures to combat coral virus may be necessary to prevent the overload of the National Health Service, if the microns appear more vulnerable than the alternative to delinquency, and current vaccines cannot eliminate infection," said the mathematician Rosanna Barnard of LSHTM.
The United Kingdom Health Agency previously reported that if the rate of microbial spread remains at the current level, approximately 1 million cases of infection will be detected in the country by the end of the year.
By mid-December, the mic could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At present, in Britain, there have been 1898 cases of carcinoma infection, of which 633 have been identified for the last decades.
At the same time, on 9 December, the head of British Minzrah Sadid Javid indicated that the figure could already reach 10,000.
She wanted to write some wise comments, but she read here before:
"The shock resulting from the incredible suffering of an unhappy animal and its work in second place."

A World of Surviving Growth to Fourth
Construction is over this year, and the orders for the next year are all recorded worldwide, despite the call for a reduction of carbon dioxide and climate change.
In the World Register of Ships, the number of docks was 1200 - more than in the past year.
In the fight against the effects of climate change on greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people with a wish and money on a floating weight of $50 million will not be reduced, says the Guardian.
However, they are becoming more and more numerous.
This year, 25 per cent of the ships were ordered more than in the past.
Brokers say this was not 20 years ago.
The first reason is that many who can afford to hunt are afraid of injuries on their own ship and prefer to hide from the pandemic.
The second reason is also related to corona virus.
If all these people went to the office and met with business partners personally, most of them now work far away, and negotiations are under way.
Broker Will Cristy told the newspaper that the Versatiles are accepting orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that the contractors are willing to pay more, only if they were ready for a year or two earlier.
"People just want freedom, and the rich can afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize the conduct of the rich and call it a decadent.
The rich, say sociologists, do not want to understand that in the time of the loss of space travel, the lives of horses or flights on their own planes are a shock to society because elites do not want to share responsibility for climate change with all the rest of mankind.
The economists call on Governments to act and propose that new taxes and rules be introduced for the super-rich, although they understand that this will be very difficult to implement when money is available.
On the other hand, the number of super-heats, but also their characteristics, is impressive.
Of the 1200 vessels, 27 have a length of more than 100 metres.
The Norwegian billionaire Recke runs a long REV Ocean 183 meters long.
After the water falls, it will be the biggest storm in the world.
There is a "lunna base" and a underwater boat intended for the study of the marine deeps.
In existing super-heaths, it was common for helicopters, cinematators under open sky, and some of them, for example, to fight McGregor, a platform for unity.The professor of economic anthropology at the American University of Indiana, Richard Wilk, says that compared to the total number of greenhouse gas elections, the carbon trace produced by super-rich, is insignificant.
But it is symbolic if it is taken into account that more than 2,000 people are multibillionaires in the world.
This is just another example of the abuse of a very small group of people.
Scientists have discovered that the emissions of billions of times more than the average population of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tonne of CO2 per year, the largest pollution of the Roman Abramovic planet is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases falling in the atmosphere in 2018.
At that time, two thirds of the emission track were mounted on his Eclipse train, a distance of 162.5 metres.
Even if the owner is not on board, the team continues to destroy the planet.
The owner may call the captain and order him to take a boat, for example, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean.
The superiors do not express the feelings of others when they, like the richest Australian woman Gina Rainhard, are complaining about the fact that there is no place for their giant courts to speak.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build a marina for ships more than 30 feet [50 m].
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol leading to bone marrow development
American scientists have determined how much alcohol per week increases the risk of cancer.
This is what is written in the Daily Express edition.
Specialists have concluded that the use of four and more drinks per week is linked to the increased risk of technological development.
In this context, the likelihood of disease developing is increased by the increase in the amount of alcohol used.
Moreover, men who drink moderately are at higher risk of developing lung cancer than women.
The precise reason for the development of such anecology cannot be determined by scientists, noting that certain factors lead to a loss to the body of the process.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, and more specifically all lovers of dogs are convinced that these creations are very intelligent.
But they don't even remember how many fourths of the world's population are actually developing.
Over the years, biologists have experimented with various experiments to find out how the animal’s brain develops.
Although the vocabulary of dogs is not as extensive as human, a new study shows that dogs can respond consistently to 89 words or phrases.
The work of scientists was published in Sciencealert.
Dogs can't play in chess or create verses that don't mean anything in politics, economics and art, but they often get rid of their owners.
The representatives of some communities, the experts believe, have shown better results in understanding the words of the human language, but statistics for accurate conclusions are still insufficient.
Yes, some species are traditionally thought to be genetics, for example, labs.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dogs are capable of thinking logically and that children are not allowed to be trained for two years.

In Ukraine, preparations were made for the US and Russia trade
The United States and Russia will "trad to trade" for Ukraine's entry into NATO, said an analysis by Alexander Kochetkov in his article for the edition of "Glavred".
In his view, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue negotiations on the United States guarantee that Ukraine will not enter the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Baiden on the right to “enter where appropriate”.
If you are offered something that is unacceptable, then, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not be able to trade, just send the offerer.
As for Ukraine, trade is on the rise," an analyst wrote.
He added that Russia plans not to attack Ukraine but to engage in dialogue with Kiev.
“Preparation is carried out in secret, quickly and quickly, and without waiting until the group finds out and spreads opposition forces,” he noted.
China stimulates the development of rail transport industry
China's leading technologies drew attention to companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the China International Railway Transport Exhibition and Equipment Production in 2021, which was held in the city of Zhujou Province of Hunang/Central China.
The main technologies developed by CRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. enable travel to automatically detect and diagnose technical irregularities, noted the representative of Hou Zhaovén.
High-speed travel on the China-Los railway line, which was introduced at the beginning of this month, has already been provided with technologies that will ensure the reliability and efficiency of the movement.
In the past six months China has significantly increased the export of rail vehicles and many Asian and European countries have become witness to China's speed.
In May of this year, with the production line of CRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd produced the first two-wheeled electric bicycles intended for exports to Europe.
With a maximum working speed of 200 kilometres, these trips will be on the rail route of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the pilot operation of the metro mission developed by an improved company for Turkey began.
The trip will be on the route of the Metropolitan, which connects Istanbul Airport to the city airport.
The move on this line will be opened in the following year.
This will be the fastest route in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometres per hour.
"The Chinese railway equipment industry is one of the highest level of innovation and the most powerful international innovation competitiveness industry," said Fen Yaosyan, head of the Chinese Trade and Investment Department of the Committee for the Promotion of International Trade/KSRMT/.
"This industry is the main competitive advantage of China's production of high-class equipment on the world market," said Fen Yaosyan.
After more than 60 years of forced work, several independent studies and development, China has established a high-speed rail equipment system with full support and large-scale production activities.
According to Fen Yaoşan, the country has taken the first place at the level of rail electricity and on the exploitation of high-speed and urban railways.
Biologists listed the early signs of dementia
The candidate for biological science, Semen Gološeikin, in the discussion with Radio Sputnik, listed early signs of dementia.
According to him, the signs of future dementia could be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive violations, such as inability to concentrate, plan, reduce the level of abstract thinking.
The discussion is currently under discussion that loss of hearing may be an early occurrence of Alzheimer's disease, as well as one of the risk factors of its occurrence, said the specialist.
Voloshekin stressed that dementia may be a cause of neurodegenerative disorders, headaches, some infections, metabolic disorders, certain vitamins deficiency.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the brain are the most common causes of this syndrome.
Biologists have noted that doctors today do not know how to treat dementia effectively.
It is therefore necessary to take time to prevent it.
He said that reducing the risk of dementia development would help to study foreign languages and the active community.
WHO also recommends to maintain a moderate level of physical load, to regularly train cognitive skills through games and hobbys that require intensive memory and thinking logic
"There are recommendations for the application of various BADs, but their effectiveness and usefulness are still being discussed in the scientific community," Gološeikin said.
“The World Health Organization recommends the maintenance of a moderate level of physical load, regular training of cognitive skills and skills with the help of games and hobbys that require intensive memory and logic,” Gološeikin said.
The former dementia research organization in Great Britain stated that disease is becoming more common at the age of 40.
The doctors called the early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.
The first alarming sign can be seen as a result of the patient's difficulty in identifying objects.
Another sign of developing weakness was called aphasia, a condition where a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
The neurologist needed to send Saakashvili to foreign treatment
Former Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili, in need of psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation abroad, announced to neurologist Otar Toid, who is a doctor's consultant created by the Georgian Ombudsman.
His [Sakhvili] neurological status is leading to his disease.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, nature change," said the specialist, noting that this does not go beyond the normative framework and that the ex-President now needs to be sent to special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neurorehabilitation and psychological rehabilitation, which we have not found in Georgia," said Toida, requiring Saakashvili to be treated at a special agency that is not in Georgia.
On the evening of 7 December, Saakashvili began to seek medical assistance after his prison staff had punished him with disciplinary punishment.
Georgian policy was quickly able to abolish punishment and restore itself to former rights.

In Spain, protests against COVID passports have taken place.
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests against the compulsory COVID-19 vaccination certificate have been carried out by the Europa Press Agency.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants was about 3,000.
In Barcelona, the COVID passport has become compulsory for access to bars, restaurants, sports halls, the homes of the elderly and night entertainment establishments.
Many Manifestants came to action without a mask.
They accused the state of tatalitarism and called for respect for the election of citizens.
In Valencia, the vaccine passport is also required for admission to entertainment establishments and a total of more than 50 people are in attendance.
The protestors in the city declared the medical dictatorship and called the vaccination an experiment.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronary infection have been detected in Spain, and over 88,000 patients have died.

Hot ground: Chinese becoming mountain goats
The Olympics should attract millions of people and help create international corridors in the country
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports activities, which will enable the gathering of President-in-Office of the United States of America 1 trillion of June, but also contribute to the economic development of the remaining remaining provinces.
The Taivu mountain resort in Zjanzjak, located near the northern Olympic Games, is becoming increasingly popular among Chinese people.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, seeding is done: the workers are cut down by trees.
There are more than 700 mountain resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to accept international warming.
In many regions of China, there are snow problems, including in Xanzjak.
The main goal for a long-term perspective is to provide a comfortable and interesting rest in Chinese resorts so that all the news will become permanent.
But it's a long way to go.
The Board of Directors of the Igre Justin Downs said that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese lying industry has changed to ignorance.
More and more Chinese people are being sent every year by winter.
Fiona, a sono-in-law from Beijing, one of them.
Despite major changes, it is believed that it will take many years to create a mountain culture here.
Many corridors are located in agricultural and mountain areas.
These regions still need to develop actively and create the infrastructure needed for recovery.
The 70-year-old Gao Macong lives in Cunley, just away from the northern Olympic Games.
He notes that in recent years there has been a bombing of winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, Beijing, in Cunley, had a fast - moving train, and no local residents were suffering without work.
The country is opening up more and more shops selling clothing and skimming for winter sports.
The tops of the pool are open with the flowers of the national kitchen.
In Taiwan there is even a test station at COVID-19.
China is trying to create a thriving sport industry, its sportsmen must be leaders of major international events, and the courses and equipment to reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world can face extreme poverty because of the pandemic, said WHO
More than 500 million people in the world can be put in extreme poverty due to the pandemic, which has slowed mankind's progress in universal access to health services, have been made available to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
With regard to the noted International Day of 12 December, WHO and WB had published two complementary reports.
They found that the pandemic had led to problems in providing health care, causing excessive stress in health systems.
In this regard, the first 10 years had reduced the immunization population, increased the mortality of tuberculosis and malaria.
WHO and WB stressed that the pandemic had caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, which made it more difficult for people to pay for treatment”.
More than 500 million people are affected by the situation “in extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services from their karman”.
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterrich stated that the pandemic had put more than 100 million people in poverty, more than four billion people in virtually no social support.

Reuters: The Taiwan Minister turned off the transfer of the "Democratic Summits" at the request of the White House
The statement by Taiwanese Minister of Digital Technology Audrey Tan at the panel discussion during the United States-based "Democratic Summit" was translated into non-video mode, which is shown on YouTube.
The Reuters agency, referring to sources, claims that the painting was excluded at the request of the White House.
According to their report, the map in which Taiwan was assigned a separate colour from the CNR, which is considered to be the island of its territory.
The map, which was shown by Mrs. Tan, was drawn up by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and organized the countries of the world to ensure civil rights.
Taiwan has been assigned to it green as "free" and the CD, CDR, Laos and Vietnam is beautiful as "closed".
After the Minister showed the map, a picture from her side was replaced with a note that the participants ' views were “not necessarily expressing the position of the Government of the United States”.
The CD was not invited to the Democratic Summit.
Reuters notes that the map presented by the Taiwanese Minister could be contrary to the policy of "one China", which is supported by Washington.
One of the sources of the agency stated that, following the demonstration of the map, the National Security Council was angry with the Department of State, accusing him of showing Taiwan to a separate country.
The Washington Summit on Democracy was held from 9 to 10 December with representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the Nobel Prize for Peace, during the “novel day” summit, editor-in-chief Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be spent on charity.
Earlier today, the Under-Secretary-General of the Soviet Union, RF Yuri Averianov, stated that the summit had not been “an anti-rossian and anti-Citizen duty”.

The media of Russia, Sergei Reibkov, in the "Immediate" interview, assessed the prospects of relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that a long way of interaction had led to bitter conclusions, and the problems between the two countries had not begun yesterday.
There is only one negative predictability, and here, in part, some of the prospects for improvement of relationships are completely unpredictable.
This is a sad result of the long journey that we have been through with the current administration, with the Tromp and with Obama.
The problems didn't start yesterday," said the diplomat.
According to Rhabkova, the problems associated with the desire of the United States to impose a multitude of approaches on Russia.
The MDGs added that they would not risk giving optimistic forecasts of the prospects for improvement of relations and would not expect changes in Washington ' s position.

Former head of the Russian media, Sergey Lavrov, at a meeting with US Secretary Anthony Blinken, said that Moscow was ready to resume dialogue with the United States.
The virus has warned of the risk of infection with the nasal medicinal product from COVID outside the hospital
The COVID-19 nasal vaccine may cause allergy and require medical help, so the first items should not be organized in airports and commercial centres.
TASS reported that it was the viruslogist, member of the RAN Correspondent, biotechnology, microbiology and virus at the University of Novosibir State Sergey Netesov.
Organise vaccination sites at airports and commercial centres more easily, but I would do so only at first in medical institutions.
The fact that there is the likelihood of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is small, but it is desirable that a person then sit with a doctor's office.
The doctor has a special set of anti-allergic preparations that operate literally in two minutes, which is sometimes very necessary," Netesov said.
In the view of the virus, it is possible to think about vaccination in commercial centres when experience in the use of the product is gained.
He also stressed that it was important for the nasal vaccine to fall into the lower eye of the nose.
In addition, there is the likelihood that the vaccine will not reach a destination if the cause of the nose is excavated after pressing.

Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries that imposed anti-virus sanctions
The Secretary-General of President RF Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible imposition of anti-virus sanctions in the case of continuing “aggressive actions” against Ukraine, including due to the alleged “intrusion” on the territory of the country.
"Any restriction to impose upon Russia and not to experience suffering on its own is impossible," said the official representative of Kremlin in the Russian TV show.

WHO provisionally considers the micron is less dangerous than the Delta.
The World Health Organization (WHO) feels that the micron is less dangerous than the delta-stam coronavirus.
However, there are data on the reduction of the effectiveness of vaccines in patients with a new COVID-19.
According to information dated 9 December, Micron was registered in 63 countries.
“Probition data and a significantly altered anti-hypertensive profile of the microns have led to a reduction in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and the transfer of the variant.
The preliminary findings from the U.S.A. suggest that it (the "weight of disease") may be less severe than that of the "delite", as stated in the Technical Communication of WHO.
The organization notes that until all recorded cases of micronutrition in the EU are mild or non-sympathetic.
However, the new stamp, according to preliminary data, is distributed faster.
In Russia, two cases of micro-smoker infection have been recorded.
They were "formerly immunized," said the Gamalai Center.

Four scenarios were named in Ukraine for the Green
The ex-deputate of the Supreme Council, Vadim Deniseenko, listed four developments for President Vladima Zelen in 2022.
In his view, the Head of State may remain without the support of the West and may also go to the Donbass compromises.
On Wednesday, 12 December, Denisenko told the press about this.
The first option, which Deniseenko called the ideal storm, is that Ukraine will cease to support key Western countries by reaching agreements on a future country without its participation.
Such developments will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev can face in 2023.
" Parallelly, there is a reduction in the price of key goods that we traditionally export " domestic protests and opposition to the GFG key authorities (financial-industrial groups. - Red.), the ex-Parliamentary added.
According to Deniseenko, another scenario for the development of the situation is “war against all”.
This forecast is based on high global concern, with the Ukrainian authorities facing a number of challenges.
As a result of this provision, Ukraine's leadership can go to the Donbass compromises that may result in domestic opposition.
At the end of the summer, the situation, according to the former Nardepa, was reduced by 50 to 55 per cent.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian policy is the opposition to the Green Group and the President, which is likely to capture control over the violent block and the implementation of “populistic initiatives”.
During such a crisis, Zelenski ' s "reforming authority" began to add Deniseenko.
Another script is the conversion of the Green to the "Father of the Nation".
This could lead to an event that would be a great shock to society.
"The event must be large enough to call on foreign partners and increase Ukraine's support," Deniseenko said.
Such a situation could be the result of a natural disaster, a technological disaster or an act of aggression by Russia, an ex-deputation.
At the same time, the Russian side has not once rejected any “attacks” in Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States had increased military activity at the Russian borders.
Earlier, on 11 November, the survey of the Working Group on Social Affairs showed that the Ukrainian President's rating fell to a record of 19.3 per cent.
This is the lowest indicator since the election of its Head of State.
Analyticals were predicting the situation in which, in the case of the next elections of the President of Ukraine, 21.8% of the vote would be cast, while the former President of the country, Peter Poroshenko, was 14.5 per cent.
In addition, only 19.3 per cent of the president ' s alleged support was expressed.

In Kinogo, which is also available for research, an animation newspaper entitled Encanto, can be seen, but, in video quality, it is the so-called screen (reduced into a pirate copy of the film) film.
Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, is available from the "Univer. 10 years later" TNT TV series (entered into the "Gazprom-media").

Estonian scientists will look for life in Venezuela
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research agencies and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venezuela to look for signs of life in the atmosphere, reported on the "Actual Camera".
The goal of the five-year mission is to assess the adaptability of Venezuela's clouds, and then look for life there.
For the project, the scientists proposed instruments for the measurement of acidity and oxygen content in the area of Venezuela.
So far it has been assumed that the Venus cloud, which is close to the Earth, is too oxygen, so that life could exist there, but it is likely that Venus was the planetary type.
During the third mission, there must be a test with Venus.
Let's assume that if we find life there, the main question is whether it looks earthly or different.
If so, it is evident that earth’s life has not begun on earth.
If it is different, it may be more likely that life was born on Earth," told the Estonian team leader of the Venus Life Finder project, Michael Paussalu.

Meta-censorship changes in Russian business
The topic of the metallics became popular this year when Mark Cuckerberg announced that he would turn Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event was an important signal: the biggest game confirmed the development of a new form of digital interaction between people.
This means that businesses in Russia, as well as in the world, will invest in the creation of their own metals and their subsequent monetaryization.
Methavics should be considered as continuing objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend in creating remote interactions under pandemic conditions is that people are free from communication and restrictions.
On the other hand, this is the result of the business effort to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models under them.
Thirdly, they are a logical continuation of the trend in the numbering of assets when any rights, valuable books, art production and even money are transferred to digital format.

British economists could not predict 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to predict 2022 because he felt that such attempts would be reversed.
He wrote an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be filled with uncertainty and that any trend may change the course.
The most important factor remains the pandemic, and secondly, inflation is believed to be.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know whether to increase the price of goods in time or not.
As the specialist pointed out, it was clear to the pandemic that "the world of the everlasting generosity of central banks has already lived" and that it is soon to return to the relationship where inflation rates will be adjusted with the expected pace of GDP growth.
O'Neill noted that, on the basis of the pandemic, the continuation of the excessive economic policy may, some experts think, lead to a new inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to productivity growth, as well as the increase in poverty and climate change, O'Nil summarized.
The former head of the Global Investment Open-up Study Division, Mikhail Shuligin, reported that positive expectations for the 2022 dollar course remained, with the potential for growth being reduced.
Among the risks to the course of the Shuligin dollar, he called the FRS monetary and credit policy, the price dynamic of oil and the threat to the background of the crown virus pandemic.

The Russians gave car dealers around 4.5% of GDP to countries
By the end of the 10 months of 2021, the growth had cost the purchase of new 2 trolls of 784 billion rubles, which showed 28 per cent more than in the same period last year than in the Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale, the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the State on the support of citizens and the economy during the crown virus pandemic.
At the meeting of the heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this would represent more than 4.5 per cent of the country ' s gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
The Russian market is headed by the Korean brand Kia.

In addition, sales in the Korean brands have not increased significantly: according to the statistics of the Committee of Autoproducers of the European Business Association in Russia, Kia has achieved 9.4 per cent more in the same period than in the previous year.
Hyundai is almost 12%.
Three sales leaders in the Japanese Toyota currency are closing up to 10 months of growth of 275.5 billion rubles, which is 14 per cent more than a year earlier.
According to the Japanese Mercedes-Benz, a figure of 266.1 billion rubles (+75 per cent) were also sold in Germany (37 per cent) and an average car price (about 28 per cent, up to 8.2 million rubles).
" Mercedes-Benz observes at the same time a good increase in sales and medium-sized prices - more than BMW - from here to here and a greater increase in financial efficiency - has been explained by the Napi Director Tatian Arabia.
As the sales increased, phantastical indicators demonstrated Chinese brands, and significantly increased financial efficiency this year."
The Russian Lada on income growth dynamics shows average (up to 28 per cent) figures, and the growth rate was 10 months more than 229.4 billion rubles.

WAZ and at least 10 months of growth spent 12 billion rubles against 12.4 billion rubles a year ago.

Prices for their production and other car manufacturers are regularly re-registered.
In addition to the failure of the car to contribute to Russia's car market, there will be an increase in the amount of money market in Russia, as well as an increase in the number of car failures, as well as the desire of the Autoconquerors to recover past losses, experts believe.
In terms of car deficit, I believe that many motorists have even been able to transfer part of the cost to the consumer of previous periods, which they could not invest in car prices earlier,
Speaking of the VTB Capital, Vladimir Bespalov says.
I believe that in financial terms auto producers are now feeling very good, supporting high margin sales."
The specific indicator of this is the pace of growth in car prices observed during 2021, and the price of new cars is increasing faster, and the expert explains.
In the long term, the market will grow in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly through inflation and the complexity of the construction of the machinery itself, Bespalov predicts.
There will be limited opportunities to increase prices with increasing opportunities.
In the financial statement, Russian authors continue to grow and in the future year, even if the cost of cars is slowed down, auto producers can gain their income by volume, notes an independent consultant on the Automotive of Sergei Burgazliev.
In view of the increased demand and insufficient proposal, the car manufacturer is now seeking the highest profit from each vehicle sold, he notes that Burgazliv.
The increase in the production of machinery is not expected at least in the near future, while in Russia, food is still uncertain about the future of citizens.
On the basis of the situation on the market, the car was a harmless investment facility, a year after the car was sold, even with a distance, the expert is now able to sell at a cost of a certain value.
Byeden said that the United States military had been transferred to Ukraine in the event of Russia's invasion
The U.S. leadership has never considered sending American soldiers to Ukraine in the case of "intrusion" of Russia.
This statement was made by President Joe Bayden of the United States.
"There have never been such plans," said the head of the White House, answering the question of whether the United States had rejected such an idea.
Byden noted that in the event of an overhaul of the situation around Ukraine, Russia would face economic consequences.
In doing so, he stressed that the United States and NATO had no military obligation to use the military force to protect Ukraine in the event of a collision.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of the use of American troops in a unilateral manner for the defence of Ukraine was not in the agenda.
Byeden explained that if Russia enters Ukraine, the United States will transfer forces to NATO Eastern European countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We have to send more American and NATO troops to the East Flag, B9 - all NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia," Byden said.
Former Russian Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow had no intention of entering Ukraine.
In that connection, he indicated that Moscow was seeing the problem in the fight against the use of Turkish drones by Kiev, as well as that “American armaments are approaching our territory”.
