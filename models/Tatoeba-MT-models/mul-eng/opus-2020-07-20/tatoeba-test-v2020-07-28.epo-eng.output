I learned a lot.
Tom woke up right before the end of the movie.
Is that worth the risk?
Your photo has only the second size of mine.
You don't need the babbling.
I don't smoke too long for the loss of your loved one.
I don't even believe one word Tom says.
How many languages are spoken outside?
Enjoy your vacations.
Does it make you nervous to talk to many people?
You should have come a little earlier.
I don't even know if Tom has a disgrace.
He's got a second degree in mathematics.
I wasn't a nightmare.
Why don't you put your hair on?

I almost touched your hand this time.
Visit the doctor!

Where's the nearest train station?
I have complete faith in you.
I want to speak to the German.
I'm sure Tom's busy with Maria.
What's that teacher?
Well, everybody's waiting for you.

We're giving up.
The size of the elephant surprised the boy.
If they make a contract, we're safe.
If you invite him, he may come.
Is that yours, Tom?
How can I reach the airport?
Not everyone can understand that.
It's much easier to identify and label the mistakes of others than to recognize ourselves.
He helped me clean up the mess.
Everyone likes him.
You better not stay too long.
Isn't that a boy's name?
Wait for your sister.

Exact.
It's 50 miles to Paris.
That upset Thomas.
My friends invited me to dinner.
I admire people who express their opinion openly.
That's too expensive!
More and more people have a computer at home.
Tomo never hears anything.
If you agree, I'll do it again.
No one's ever seen me again.
He's all but trusted.
He was absorbed by the legend.
Tom probably won't be able to go any more.
He must have been asleep then.

Tomo swore he didn't tell anyone about the secret.
Old straight!
Tomo told me he'd talk to Mother.
I can't tell you how to do this.
I'm a little freaky.
How about a cup of coffee after lunch?
Tomo forgot the milk.
She had a flower in her hand.

Get your hands off me!
Can we talk more about it?
I heard about Tom's marriage and a rich woman.
I feel much safer now.
Can I wait?
What's your favorite local restaurant?
I've been in China for less than a month.
I'm not going to school on Saturday.
Please enter.
Tomo's clearly lost.
Who is the right file?
If he got 10 out of 10 in the exam, it's because he was wrong.
I eat every morning.
Can we get out for a new car?
Forget it.
They'll be surprised to see you here.
It's time to talk.

I don't want to walk on some feet.
Let's all rest.
I could use the practice.
We're so tired of your stupid stuff!
The mouse is connected to the track.
We all loved Tom.

Tom has only one friend in Boston.
They'll kill me.
I'm hungry like a wolf.
Wouldn't that surprise you if you were to throw my feet off me?
Have you ever been friends with her?

Have you forgotten that again?
How can you not love him?
The ship's gone.
Can you hear me?
There was an inconsistency of the names.

We'll meet him at the club a few times.

I'm studying English for an hour every day.
Hearing the Spanish makes me feel hotter and removes my mind from the cold heat I now wake up.
Do you really want to do more?
I was surprised by her sudden change of intent.
Tom's destined to lose his vet.
Every one of my sisters has a bike.
This is the key.
You probably thought I was an idiot.
I'm begging you.
Excuse me, can I use your phone?
What's the car fare?
What are you gonna do tonight?

They have the right to do so.
What did I win?
How many eyes did the clocks have?
I don't think Tomo's gonna do that.
Did you go to the stadium?
Sunis this morning.
We're not trying to do this.

She came from the store, finding that the stars took her bike.
The next day he was found dead in the bedroom.
We've always paid in Germany with travel tickets.
I know what you did in Boston.
If you can't enjoy your loneliness, you can't enjoy meeting someone else.
We have to wait for Tom.
They died after each other.
No one can stop you.
I had nothing to do with it.
I took the kids to school.

She translated the book from Japan into English.
There's a big ceramic in the garden.
There were some students in the room.

Why do you hate Boston like that?
The train I drove went faster.
This girl wants a good ride!
She'll take care of everything for us.
Don't he hate you?
I don't have enough money to buy another house.
You spend more time with her than I do.
Thank you for the memory!

Come and see us.
It's not a dog.
I don't destroy anything.
We just can't do it.
Someone said, "Don't tell the Japanese how to speak Japanese."
The reaction to tuberculosis was negative.
