New time review: making the best return of rural farmers to rehabilitate rural life-news network
The village's reviving. It's the key.
Where's the man?
The best return of rural farmers is the indispensable biofuels.
Newspapers, Business Springs, Work
The New York Society was formed on July 26th, the theme of the best return of rural farmers to rehabilitate rural life forces.
This year, 34-year-old Xiao was in the Qiao-Sao County village, where he gave up thousands of jobs in Beijing in 2010.
After a few years of beating, the income of his farm farm farm year, which he now operates, now exceeds the millions of dollars, has become a prominent leading figure, and has been elected into the village's two "Sections".
In recent years, a series of agricultural policies, such as rural reviving, have been encouraged by a growing number of excellent farmers who have chosen to return to their rural business, which has stimulated a village-based spring.
In the Westminster Province, where the labour force is exported from the province of Chihuahua, which led to the implementation of the "Good Agricultural Renewal Engineering", only in 2019, the remaining 8,000 members of the Ministry of Rural Shares from the Ministry of Rural Development, 610,000 people, 2 million members of the Development Party, provide strong assurances to combat the violence of poverty and implement the rural rehabilitation strategy.
It's important to look at the old town.
Since the opening of the reform, a large number of young people in our rural countries have increased their jobs outside the labour force, and some have created their own businesses through pressure.
But objectively, however, it has led to a different "airization" in rural areas, especially rural-based organizations, a low-ranking "old" feature, that is, ageing, low-school education, that is, a low-powered group of rural communities, and a high-level non-responsibility issue.
If the elements of the rural community are constantly moving towards the city, the village is long in the state of "non-blood" "poverty" and reviving is an empty word.
Bringing those who are able, conscious and willing to attract farmers who are willing to return to their homelands, leading them to become the leaders of rural business, from the mid-opportunity to the Ministry of Rural Affairs, to fill the base-level forces, is a way of solving the problems of rural parties and grassroots organizations.
Good farmers come back, and they're gonna stay and do it.
In recent years, the Qi Rivers have built their hands on the capture of farmers, based on strict standards of choice for farmers to build a better approach, service guarantees, training for recovery, system-based mechanisms such as capacity-building, safety at work, life-threatening lives, a real base for rural development, and a sense of success for officials.
This year is the year of the decision to combat the persistent attacks on poverty and to make a good connection with the rehabilitation of the poor in the villages, and it is the key factor.
The Government of the Parties at all levels would like to place high emphasis on the better return of rural farmers through integrated measures to make them able to survive, fight, carry unhindered task forces, the biological forces, provide strong organizational safeguards and human support for rural poverty eradication and development recovery.
This year's graduation was a special occasion, and on July 11th, bilibili summer's final song will bring the graduates a special show directly on the line, the grandfather, the tree, the lion, the lion, the bear, and the mahogany, which will not be easy for the musicians to sing and bless for their graduation.
The well-known master, SealWu, also brought a "grape tree", a song that he was inspired to edit in the same Russian version, and was very popular among young people.
Because of the relationship of the vaccines, many graduates were unable to attend the exhibition and were given a degree of experience, so they transferred the symptoms to the line.
Data show that there are more than 35 million direct air levels of 2.5 hours this time.
"Let's follow our own heart, take the opportunity, without any further consequences, and sometimes, on the contrary, will have unexpected receipts."
Although it's a graduation concert, many songs don't affect their performance.
"The whole group really wanted to cry and everyone was so beautiful and sad, but it's worth the effort to go down."
Beijing's natural ecosystems continue to thrive and attract more than 500 other wildlife cities.

The capital's natural environment continues to be good.
There are over 500 species in Beijing.
The report (Newsman) informs Beijing Youth Journalists from the Gardening Department of the City, that in recent years there has been a steady increase in species and numbers of wildlife in the capital as well as in recent years.
At present, there has been an increase of over 500 species of wild animals in Beijing, including dogs, mammals at the national level, as well as wild animals at the national level, as well as birds at the national level.
Whether it is one of the forests in the middle of the city, or a small area between the walls, it is not only natural for the capitals but also for wild animals to " settle in the city " .
During the summer season, a biofuel was found in the natural protection zone in the mountains of the north-western mountains of the region.
And one of them ran away from the mountains, and two of the birds stood up, one at the other.
Back in the head, a wild beast's unsatisfied "square" is being pushed down by trees. As of the end of 2019, the Director of the Natural Protection Region of the Mountain Country, who is located in a total of over 2,200 square miles [200 sq km] of green seas, has been able to see traces of 178 wild animals, including wild animals, which are at the national level and at the national level.
"In the mountains, wild animals are the real 'lord', and our staff are the only ones who can be 'protective' of the people."
Interestingly, in order to understand the situation of wild plants in the protected areas, there are more than 30 professional patrols every day, with 16 carefully designed road patrols, and one "survivor" every month, with almost a day's duration around the entire protection area.
" In the course of the inspection, it is not necessary to check the biological diversity of records, and also to check the installation of the worker birds, the rescue of injured wild animals, and the installation of outer cameras, etc. "
More than 200 remote cameras have been installed at the national level in the mountains and recorded the living conditions of wild animals in the forest.
As the biodiversity in the area of protection has increased in recent years, more and more wild animals have appeared in the mirror, dogs, cats and dogs have become "permanent in Benin", and the national level of protection of wild animals" has also increased.
The Beijing Forestry Agency's Office for Plants and Forests Protection reported that there has been an increase of more than 500 species in Beijing from 461 in 1994 to more than 500 in recent years, and that there has been an ongoing increase in animal species and numbers in Beijing.
The physical appearance of wild animals in cities has become more and more relevant to the growing growth of urban vegetation in recent years.
In particular, a new set of millions of wood- growers, which began in 2018, proposed a reforestation of the urban environment and an increase in the ecological function of the green soil, highlighting the "near natural" concept.
The plan is designed to achieve interaction with green areas around and make it easier for wild animals to visit their "neighbor", which is also a kind of sweet source of animals and a source of food.
I'm committed to helping computers and our communications around the world.
There are many ways to do this, and I like to focus on helping computers to talk about what they see and understand.
In view of this situation, a modern computer video game, can tell you, there's a woman, and there's a dog.
It can tell you, the woman's smiling.
It can even tell you, this dog is very cute.
I'm dealing with this question, thinking about how humans understand and interact with the world.
Those thoughts, memories and stories, in such cases, may draw people's attention.
Interconnection related to the connection.
Maybe you've seen a dog like that before, or you've spent some time running on such sands, and you've got a lot of excitement about the past holiday memories and ideas, when you went to the beach, you've run away with other dogs.
One of my guiding principles is by helping the computer understand what it is, what it's like to know what we believe and how we feel, so we have the capacity to develop computer technology in a way that is consistent with our experience.
So, in deep research, I started working hard to help computers, produce stories like people, from image sequences.
So, one day, while I'm working with the computer, I'm asking how it feels about Australia.
It looked at the picture, and saw a pair of pants.
It doesn't know what the dove is, but the computer says it thinks it's an interesting animal.
And then I shared a series of images with the computer about the house's burning.
The computer looked at a picture, and it said, "It's an amazing view!
It's freezing my stomach.
The computer saw a terrible, life-changing event and thought it was a positive thing.
I realize that computers recognize red and yellow comparisons, and that's something that's worth a positive assessment.
Part of the reason why I enter the computer is positive images.
That's because when people talk about their own experiences, they focus on sharing positive images.
When was the last time you saw your picture at the funeral?
I realize that, in the process of improving human engineering, it is a task to return to data collection, to create huge gaps, gaps and gaps in understanding the computer.
At the same time, I'm doing this for different types of code of prejudice.
The prejudice reflects a limited perspective, from a data collection — which reflects the same human beings, such as vision and impressions.
I remember the development of that technology, so that I could reach the place where I was then -- the first color picture was the one that was aligned with a white woman's skin color, which meant that color photographs were different to black faces.
And the same prejudice, that dark point, it continued to take the 90th century.
The same blind spot even today, still exists in the field of identification technology applications, how to identify the faces of different people.
In today's research, I've seen the most advanced technology, all focused on putting our ideas, restricting data collection and problem.
And in doing so, we're creating more blind points and prejudices, which will be further increased when we use human intelligence.
Then I realized that we had to think deeply about how to develop creative technologies today, how to be seen after five to ten years.
In the interaction between humans and the environment, human time-recording issues are being addressed, so slow growth.
Compared with human intelligence, it's developing at incredible speeds.
That means it's really important, and now we need to take this into account carefully -- reflect on our own perspectives, and prejudices, and think about how these prejudices are affecting the technology we've created now, and discuss today's technology, what it means for the future.
CEO and scientists have already been able to measure their ideas, about future people's intellectual development.
Stephen Hawkin warned: "Human wisdom will kill humanity."
Iran's Moscow alert is an existing risk, and we as civil society; one of the greatest risks to be faced.
"I don't understand why people don't worry about human intelligence."
But these ideas -- just part of the story.
That math, model, the basic component of these people's intelligence, is that we can both get and use.
We have an open source tool for the public to learn the machine and make our own contributions.
Besides, we can share our experience.
We can share it in the field of technology and its relationship with us, and how it makes us feel.
We can talk about what we love.
We can communicate with the future, which may be more useful in terms of technology, or as time passes, there may be more problems.
If we all focus on open discussion of human wisdom, looking forward to the future, it will help create a regular dialogue and awareness about human intelligence, what can it become? and everything we need to do to achieve our best results.
We've seen and understood this in the technology we use today.
We're using smart phones, digital assistants, and autosmokers.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes.
Are they useful?
Yeah, they did.
They're not exactly the same.
That's where you've seen the future lights.
The future will continue to begin with what we are now creating and creating.
We started Domino's bone effects, and it opened up a path to human engineering.
In our time, it's made up of human intelligence tomorrow.
Let us sink into the process of strengthening reality and reviving the past world,
When people find it difficult to communicate, science helps them share their experiences.
It's based on online video technology, which can be used on cars.
Science, based on the understanding of image language, can develop to help people with disabilities and help them to have a better vision of the world.
We also see the technology and how it leads to some problems.
We have technology today to analyze the physical characteristics of our birth, such as the color of our skin or the appearance of our face, to determine whether we are criminals or terrorists.
We have the technology to process data, to process data on sex or race, to determine whether we can obtain credit.
All we've seen now is that of a human-scientific process.
Because where we are now, it's a moment of change.
This means that what we do now will affect future developments and extend to the future world.
If we want human intelligence to help people grow in the way we need to define strategies and objectives, then we'll start that way right away.
What I want to see is the development direction that is appropriate to human culture and the environment.
Science skills to help us cure neurosystem diseases or other patients with disabilities, make them the same challenge as everyone else.
The operation of technology doesn't take into account your characteristics or skin color.
I'm concerned today about tomorrow and the next decade's technology.
Human intelligence can be seen in many different ways.
But in this case, it doesn't have any purpose, no one driving.
It's a car we can drive at the same time.
We choose when to speed up and when to slow down.
We choose whether or not to turn around.
We're choosing what kind of people we're going to be.
There will be a wide range of competitions.
It'll become a lot of different things.
Now depends on our understanding what we need to do to ensure that the results of human wisdom will be better for all people.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Black land "type" from the modernization of agriculture-Newway.
New York City Harlin 26 July: Black land " from the modernization of agriculture
In Zheza, two fertilization aircraft crossed the two-way high-level model field from the second operating station in the fifth management area of the friendly farm, forming two white lines, and a few large characters of "the first part of the day" that appeared in the green field.
The Chief of Operations ordered that the aircraft be able to carry more than 6,000 anti-aircrafts per day, with an efficiency of approximately 8 times that of no-man aircraft and a percentage of human labour.
This farm, located in the friendly territory of the first Hungryon, in the province of Qaeda, has passed from the last "Hungary" to the modern "London" in Mada, China, where traditional agriculture and agriculture have changed on this black soil.
In addition to aircraft, satellites are also used in the modernized agricultural production of friendly farms.
On the other hand, satellite navigation technologies can improve standardized activity levels in the field of agriculture using remote sensing technologies.
During this year's hydrocarbon production, the farm expanded the operating range of satellite navigation to 30000 tonnes from 3,000 tonnes last year.
This technology is designed to increase growth and increase the use of solar and solar resources and to save about 16 per cent of the labour costs.
The farm tried to educate and smarten the new technologies, which formed the largest agricultural machinery in our country from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, the total number of farms is now 4.9 million, with a 99.8 per cent integrated mechanization rate in the field.
Agricultural operations achieve 100 per cent of GPS satellite navigation, 100 per cent of dry land density, and 100 per cent of dry customs cars.
"Green agriculture, smart agriculture, digital agriculture is the path of exploration of the modernization of agriculture."
A friend of the farm's long-distance.
Modernization of agriculture is key to technological progress.
In recent years, a model of modern-day "aeronautical" agriculture, represented by farms, has led to the early creation of scaled crops, standardization of production, and industrialization, which is the leading system of modern agricultural industries.
In the friendly district, there is a farm complex of 350,000 square meters of land.
The collection has been showing the introduction of a number of years of horticulture, using more than 140 (agricultural) equipment.
These plants and farms have witnessed the modernization of our country's agricultural development.
Small villages for everyone - The Andean Rivers of the Alleys move directly to the New War Network.
On 26 July, the New York Society's electricity: Small people are moving directly from the Anchovies to the Anchovies.
The New York Times are camped, the King's army, the village of Zhao.
On 25 July, at 4:00 p.m., the queen was wearing a bag full of shoes, from the front door to the back of the house, and the wife came home to pick up things.
"I'm still in the field farm."
He's turned over more than 60 yards, he's got water, he's got a good eyelash, and he's got a drug hit yesterday, and everything's gone.
"No one wants to be thrown into the house, let's get everyone out of the house."
In order to cope with the constant pressure of high water levels and the possible drop in water, the Aung-Qao Province is ready to launch a flood of water from the Liu-Qaobe River on 26 days.
It's located in the coastal town of Guangdong, near the river.
There are thousands of villagers in Zheng who are affected by the harshness and the need to move.
As at 25 p.m., the water level of the fifth Great Lake Lakes continues to be maintained at 13.2 m high and above the water level 0.7 m.
The kitchen in the kitchen of the house is clean, and it is placed on the table with a kitchen table, and there are eggs and some vegetables in the refrigerator.
"I don't think I'm going to move, but the water of the river is still looking good."
I mean, it's a room in the house, and some big things don't even want to be put in a good place.
"First collect valuable items, refrigerators and television sets can be placed in temporary proximity to high-ranking neighbors or relatives. "
The Queen of the village gave the idea of standing by the Queen of the Desert.
The Royal Assembly is responsible for the movement of 13 villagers, and one of its members is informed that each person's installation programme is recognized.
The most recent location of the Chung-Boo's house is the first school in Suz, about 2 km away.
In addition to the larger ones, there are some more than 1,000 food and new household items in the mouth of Chimba.
"We're ready to go to our next home. We can't move. "
The couple had a deal, and they had a shower on the floor under the new bed, and they raised the bed about half a mile.
At 6:00 p.m., the baby began driving three wheels to his family's cargo, and the week went on gathering in the house.
At 11 o'clock in the evening, the couple looked in front of the house once, took off their cell phone, ready to set up.
"I hope the water will go away early."
Hukaba said.
On 26 July, at 9 a.m., the journalists saw that the area had prepared preparations before the tsunami.
The Colin little team's got a lot of young people in New York.
On 11 July, the campaign's Youth's High-Technology campaign "Young People's Movement" was officially launched in South-West Lake.
The movement's team followed the section and the campaign's assistance in the cross-border setting of the Lingala and the gardening points, and the hard core of the "greatly great" power-resisting device, making the show more powerful.
At the beginning, 11 youth-students of the campaign were also concerned about the "strong conflict" against "strong heart" on the competition technology.
Among them, "The Strong Conflict" was born by Jovin I, who had publicly challenged the popularity of the "beautiful men" in the race before the game, and the outdoor conditions of the "smoothing" should go to the show and even release the phrase "don't lose the flowering flower".
The last statement is that the youth and the movement forces on the scene are getting a bit of a bit of a bit of excitement.
And the "force fight" is more like a divine fight, which is honored as the "Great King"'s health-threatening attack on the same powerful blow, and a powerful victory.
And their identity also made it impossible for people to identify themselves as a healthy actor, and the band was a decommissioning team, and three brave soldiers were the winners.
At the start of the game, the two young men quickly pulled out the small jars, and the prolonged resistance to the sights on the large jars made them tired.
In a tense situation, the following section is one of the youth movement teams, and is also in a serious battle.
He also was very careful to encourage a young person who lost the game to help every mistake in the recovery process.
She has no appreciation for young people who value their strength online.
It is much more commendable when you learn about the daily training of young people who are under the burden of the campaign.
The same is the style of Lindan and the gardens of the movement's leader, one of which is the anti-Semitic " propagandist " , and the other is the "snifferent " who spreads the tension around the movement.
In addition, Jigging and Xiao have produced a number of explosives around the movement's youth.
Fire in the Southern Church of France: Volunteers in the Region recognize fires, peace and good words - in the new network
On 26 July, the media reported that on 18 July, the religious history of South France, the famous St. Peter and the Church of St. Paul, was severely damaged in a fire accident and that the storm was completely destroyed.
On 26 days at the local time, the South Prosecutor announced that one of the religious volunteers responsible for protecting the work in the Church had been prosecuted, and the crime was "destroyed" .
He's admitted to being a fire in the church.
It is reported that the local prosecutor, Senas, said that the 39-year-old, volunteer from Rwanda, admitted that he had three fires in his own church at night.
The lawyer of the person said that the fireman had done this a long time ago.
He entered France, through a means of escape several years ago, and was detained in the church in the area of this fire disaster.
The Prosecutor noted that he had recently tried to update the visas and was communicating with the police.
But the church remains unbelievably convinced that it is a very good time to smile, but without talking, it will destroy such a beloved church.
On the day of the fire on 18 July, the volunteer had been released on the basis of an inconsistencies in the description and had accepted police inquiry, but he was later released.
Plan to rescue firemen at the scene.
In the evening of 25 days, the person was again informed because of the new evidence received by a professional engineer from the Central Police Laboratory in Paris.
This time, men recognize their own fires.
It was reported that if the crimes committed by the fire were to be committed, suspects could face 10 years of imprisonment and 15 million euros.
It is reported that this fire has caused serious damage to St. Pierre and the Church of St. Paul, and that the air in the church has been completely burned, and the colour glass windows behind the wind are also severely damaged.
France's chief architect in the protection of France's history, Brune, believes that the restoration of the Church of the South would take at least three years.
Comprehensive information: Inter-American unilateralism destroys relations between two countries. International opinion supports China's support for the American Anti-News Network.
On 26 July, New York Society News from the Comprehensive Newspaper on New York City: 24 July morning, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China informed the United States Embassy that the Central Party had decided to withdraw permission for the establishment and operation of the General Council of the United States of America and to suspend all operations and activities of the General Assembly.
It was held that the unilateral measures taken by the United States caused serious disturbance to relations between the two countries of Central America, and China responded to the unreasonably challenge of the United States, and that countermeasures were legitimate and necessary.
The Director of the China Research Centre of the Institute of International Studies at the University of Chile said that the unilateral measures of the United States destroyed the bridge between the peoples of the United States of America and brought about the crisis of relations between two major countries.
China informed the United States that the closure of its headquarters was contrary to the United States unilateral measures and was in line with diplomatic practice.
Professor of the University of Argentina, the Director of the Athens Research Centre, Patriot Justo, considered that the above-mentioned decision was justified and necessary countermeasures against the United States prior to and not against the general population of the United States.
The United States is trying to move the attention of the United States people to the extent that China is failing to respond to the new vaccines.
The President of the Institute for Innovation in Asia and Asia of Indonesia, Banbon Suriono, said that the United States had a challenging diplomatic situation, causing serious problems for both countries in Central America and faced serious challenges.
China informed the United States that the closure of the General Council of its residence was normal countermeasures, in line with diplomatic practice, reflecting China ' s principled position to maintain its own interests firmly, as well as the legitimate details of China ' s diplomacy.
Frances Semwanza, former commentator on Tanzania, said that the above-mentioned decision was the right and necessary response to the challenge of the United States.
The Central American relationship needs to be restored to normal and the United States should take the initiative to improve relations with China and stop interference with China's domestic affairs.
The United States should look at how China has gained economic and political victory and how it has benefited both peoples and the international community as a whole.
Ali Joseph F., Executive Director of the Arab-China Association Association for Friendship in the Sudan, said that China's forced countermeasures were justified and necessary to respond to the US without any reasonable and necessary response, in accordance with the basic norms of international law and international relations and also in diplomatic practice.
The former United States requested the closure of the Chinese General Council in Houston to seriously violate the basic norms of international law and international relations.
It is the hope that the United States will withdraw this relevant decision and re-establish the necessary conditions for relations in the two countries.
Singapore's joint press release said the United States' larger strategic goal was to surround China and prevent China from continuing to rise.
Steps faced by the United States, although it was not willing to see the continued deterioration of Central America's relations, it was necessary to take countermeasures.

Newspapers from the Broad East Sea Police Agency on 26 July, New York City, learned that, recently, the United States Customs, the Public Security Department, had launched a special group of private oil, which had initially proven that the group had been engaged in a total of approximately 120,000 tons of private oil since 2019, which was worth some 8 billion dollars of people and had been taxing about $240 million.
The GDR and the customs private sector have progressively clarified the staff structure of the group's staff.
On 8 July, the sea police, customs, public security departments, such as the Furland, and the coastal area, carried out a consolidated network operation, involving 4 private ships, 4 tons of oil, 4700 tons of oil, respectively, in the case of ships and oil warehouses, and frozen a number of financial accounts.
It was understood that this joint operation had a total of 8 ships, two helicopters, a number of teams of operations, engaged in combating overcrowding on the sea, engaged in illegal operations on land, and all 35 major suspects were in the case.
The case is being further resolved.
The relevant authorities of the GPA indicated that the future will continue to be a high-pressure situation, to combat all kinds of criminal trafficking in the sea, and to maintain good order in the region.
"Hanna" in the United States, or a new network of rivers and mountains.
On July 26th, the Central Internet, the integrated external media reported that 25 hours of local time, at 5:5 p.m., the Sana's landing in Texas, U.S.A., would bring storm and floods to the state, and could also cause life-threatening mountains.
The National Wind Centre says that the "Hanna" is expected to bring a storm of rain and clears the south and north parts of the state, the floods or the floods that threaten life.
It is reported that the most serious impact of the "Hanna" wind is the southern tip of the city of Koscristi to the river edge of the Grand Canal, and that the Riogland Valley may be exposed to a vast mountain.
"Any wind is a big challenge."
There are 32 people in the state because of the storm crash.
Over 320,000 cities in the city of Koscristi have been closed to libraries and museums, and the population is in serious danger.
Abbott also said that as the state is experiencing a new epidemic, it can no longer cause more damage to the state.
It is reported that the amount of water drop in the southern part of the state is expected to reach between 6 and 12 pounds in the night of 26 days, and that there will also be 3 to 5 pounds in the northern part of the state of Texas and the coastal region of Louisiana.
As a result of factors such as global warming, "Hanna" was formed early in the Atlantic Ocean.
In general, the first windmill in the Atlantic is usually formed until mid-August.
Poland will withdraw from Europe a treaty to prevent violence against women
The Ministry of Justice indicated that the next week Poland would take steps to withdraw from Europe the Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women.
The Prime Minister of the right-wing Government of Poland indicated that the treaty called for the teaching of students on gender issues to exercise the right of the parents of students.
The Minister of Justice of Poland, Mr. Güblo, will say that the Ministry of Justice, which he led, will submit a request to the Ministry of Labour and Family for the commencement of a treaty.
The treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
" This treaty includes elements that we consider to be a harmful material nature. "
Poland ' s law and justice parties and their allies have a close relationship with the Roman Catholic Church to promote a conservative social agenda.
President Duda of Poland has been one of the main issues during the joint campaign to succeed this month.
Friday, thousands of Polish people (most of them women) held protests against the withdrawal of the Convention in Warsaw and other cities.
In a protest march in Warsaw, Lempat, one of the protest organizers, said, "The purpose of withdrawing the treaty is to legislate domestic violence".
Some of the protesters were standing up and writing on the "Legals of Law and Justice is the Hell of Women".
The law and justice parties have long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
The previous Government of the Inter-Government of Poland ratified the Convention in 2015.
The Government of the Law and Justice Party indicated that the treaty did not respect religion and demanded that the social policy of free movement be taught in schools.
But as yet, the party has not decided to withdraw from the Convention.

"Greedway" is a new web for a youth to fight against the Hong Kong Youth.
In the near future, the Government of the People ' s Republic of Zhao-Shuang, New York, on 26 July, was able to capture the military office of the People ' s Republic of Zhaoshi and give priority to individuals or their children who have been exposed to the threat of disaster in this anti-Suspending mission and who are subject to appropriate conditions and who are subject to inspection and who are eligible to a political nuclear review.
" After the registration of young people, we give priority to the recruitment of young people in the community, the Ministry of the Armed Forces and the Sundry Area. "
The Vice-Minister for the Armed Forces of the People ' s Republic of China said that they had been affected by floods and that they had been focusing on three days of youth testing.
The Ninth-Minister-Ministering Region is a 22-year-old graduate from the University of Zhao-Sun in the south, whose mother is a community staff member, the father is a retired soldier of some Department of the Air Force, and parents who have been working for ten days of the week have been maintaining the value of the Nhao-Hungan line.
"These days, in the press, I want to be like them. "
On Sunday, he had a military dream from his childhood, and he was more determined than ever to join the army.
The city of Ninja also called for a voluntary participation of young people in patrols, value-added missions, and the purpose of the armed forces at present was to strengthen their confidence in military intelligence.
According to the UNFICYP, it is hoped that, through a priority military approach, it will encourage young people to participate in the task force and to develop a good social environment for military glory.
According to the overcrowded press report, Gryvory felt that Viet Nam had made a significant contribution to the development of the Asian Union for 25 years.
Viet Nam is not only an Austrian responsible member but also an Asian train leader.
Grivori expressed the view that Viet Nam had contributed to the expansion of its image.
He emphasized, "Asia should therefore be grateful to Viet Nam."
The analysis of the peace initiative submitted by Viet Nam was indicated in Grivore.
Viet Nam is willing to share experiences with Asian countries and to propose constructive peace-building measures on issues facing the Asia-Pacific region, including the East Sea.
With regard to the cooperation between Viet Nam and Russia under the Asian framework, Grivori believed that Viet Nam provided support for Russia ' s cooperation with the Asian Union to help Russia gain interest in that framework.
The European Economic Union, including Russia, and Viet Nam, can enter into the military-Asian market after signature of the Trade Agreement.
Grivore recommended that the European Economic Union and the Asian States, at the maximum, expand the free trade zone and create a stable and economic and security platform.
At the same time, Grivori believed that Russia and NATO were moving in and will achieve their goals.
From now on, by the end of 2020, the Northern Territory will have the necessary conditions, in particular in the areas of infrastructure, human resources and land, in order to promote the emergence of foreign flows, in particular the value chain and the transfer of advanced technology.
In addition, the Northern Hemisphere would facilitate the transmission of the Government's decision by the Prime Minister to promote and ratify the overall planning of development of the WETC infrastructure and operational projects and to supplement the two industrial-city-service areas in the province of Ansang-North and Ansang-Ass-Assun-Ass-Ass-Ass-As-As-As-Ass-As-As-As-Ass-As-As-As-As-As-As-As-As-As-As-in-As-As-As-As-As-Sent-As-As-As-As-As-As-As-As-As-As-As-Sal-As-As-As-Ass-As-As-Ass-Ass-As-As-As-As-As-As-As-As'-As'-As-As-As'-As-As-As-As-As-In-As-As'-Sak', into 2020.
At the same time, the north-west province has worked to accelerate the progress of projects, especially in the rich and rich states, in the construction of infrastructure projects in the two-in-the-Prince industrial areas, to form a land fund for incentives.
In 2020, the Department of Trade in the Province of North Ouija boards the design of industrial areas and industrial group planning plans to be included in the provincial planning.
The province of North Ouija board determined that the development of industrial gardens should be integrated with national security, environmental protection and food security, and contribute to the development of balanced industrial development; have comprehensive electricity, water, transport and telecommunications infrastructure, and are associated with urban construction, trade services, worker housing and health, and other social infrastructures such as education.
In the industrial areas, the province of North Carolina has been calling for high-tech projects for electricity, electronics, telecommunications equipment, skilled machinery, industrial support, and clean-up investment projects.
In groups in the industrial gardens, the province called for production and use of small-scale investment projects in the field of agriculture, in particular agricultural products and food processing.
In the future, the north-west province will make efforts to accelerate investment in the infrastructure of the Logistics Centre in the north-west of the country, to develop synergy with the industrial areas, to improve goods, currency flows and to reduce production costs, to improve the value of goods, to improve supply chains and to develop multimodal flows, thus creating incentives for investors in the province.
Initial release of the Russian armed helicopter card at the end of 52M
On 25 July, New York City Moscow, according to the Russian Ministry of Defence plan, the revised version of the Ka-52-Ka-52M, which will be completed in the first place in December of this year, with a greater increase in the detection of communications and weapons.
According to the Russian news report, the armed forces-52M called "super-short-cut" and their construction contracts were signed by the Russian and military units last April, and the first 2 of the upgrades were currently underway to the construction of a remote helicopter plant of the Russian Aerospace Group's "progression" and its national testing and improvement of recovery will be completed by October 2022.
According to Russian experts who were aware of the above-mentioned upgrades, the "front" of the "super-short-cut" — the "front" — was officially included in the arms-52 in November 2011, which revealed some weaknesses in the use of the machine, which was then adjusted to "fill the cutting board".
It was reported that, compared to ka-52, ka-52M would take part in non-absorbing new types of protective materials, which would be reinforced and equipped with new equipment to combat missile attacks, thereby increasing the risk of warehousing; a higher frequency of equipment for the provision of more complex electronic equipment for the electrical equipment; an improved electrical system could detect and detect far-reaching targets; and a new new light multi-use missiles for the main attack of armoured vehicles and armoured land defence operations, which would be more than 20 kilometres higher than those used by the Russian military forces; and their weapons and communications would be used at the maximum level with the target of attackable targets, thus making the relevant maintenance easier and economic.
In addition, Ka-52M will have advanced electronic control systems, arms control systems and navigation equipment.
The expert also pointed out that it was important that ka-52M would be equipped with communications equipment that would be in contact with non-aircrafts and thus have access to information that would actually be transmitted by non-aircrafts, such as on the screen of the helicopter.
According to the plan, the Ka-52M pilots can direct control the unmanned aircraft associated with them, thus increasing the control of the pilots against the situation in the battlefield and the control of the remote missiles.
According to the Russian media, the Deputy Minister for Defence of Russia, Kryvoruchko, had indicated last December that the Ministry of Defence was planning to purchase 110 arms-52M in advance of 2027.
The new legislation stipulates that the province of Campania has had to hold the doors in public places from the very beginning of the day, with a maximum amount of €1,000.
The local time was 1 June in Rome, Italy's capital. Rome's fighter camp was reopened.
It is reported that, in accordance with the most recent anti-dumping legislation issued by the Government of the Great Lakes, the population of the province of Campania has to carry out all public transport tools, as well as access to shops, bars, supermarkets and exhibition halls, in compliance with the prohibition requirements.
In violation of that provision, a maximum amount of EUR 1000 would be payable.
At the same time, the Act provides that all passengers entering the province of Campania must be separated from non-Central States.
The regional government will authorize the health institutions to coordinate specific hotels and to distinguish themselves from those who suffer from sunsickness.
The Act entered into force on 25 July.
In less than an hour, three customers entering the supermarket received penalties.
Since this year, 175 billion cubic miles of water in the North of the River
Newspapers from the University of North-West Water Office informed New York City that since this year, a total of 175 million litres of water has been used for the extraction of lead water and local water reservoirs, landfills, river dunes, and ocean basins, such as 28 rivers and the reforestation of the river, and the total completion of the river lake’s ecological water.
In the north-west province, the South-Westphalia project, which was rapidly gaining access to the right time for the expansion of the flow of water, carried out ecological refills, such as the Danube River and the Sauna River, with the use of aqueous water to draw water to the Danube River.
At the same time, the oceans, nine large medium-sized reservoirs of East-West Armed Forces, and the White Sea, have implemented ecological refills, such as the Zionong River, with a population of over 90 square miles [90 sq km] of water.
In order to improve the ecological water supply, active organizations of the Office of OWL carried out a series of surveys of river flows, complementing the consolidation and cleaning of riverbeds, streamlined measures to strengthen monitoring protection.
Through monitoring and centralization visits, timely solutions to all kinds of problems have ensured the security of river water supply.
According to the relevant officials of the Office of Water Affairs of the North River, the implementation of the river lake ecological supplements has effectively restored the ecological environment of the river River River in the North River and has contributed to the recovery and recovery of coastal waters and greatly improved the environment of the surrounding population and the economic development environment, which is important for the achievement of the river management objectives of the river "water clear, coastal, riverbed and river along the coast".
You should all know the truth I'm telling you.
I believe that inequality can lead to social division and corruption before the Great Revolution of France.
In contrast, we can now find evidence that we can identify the effects of inequality by comparing society, with different levels of society.
I'll show you some data and explain why those data really exist.
But first, let's see how hard our lives are.
(Laughter) I'd like to start my speech with a fight.
This picture shows our average life compared to the total national income -- the latter measured by the country's average level of wealth.
You can see those countries on the right, such as Norway and the United States, their wealth is Israel, Greece, Portugal, two times those on the left.
But this does not affect the average life of their citizens.
No signs of interconnection.
But if we get to know the insides of society, they'll find out that there's a big difference in the whole of society's health.
This picture shows, it's still the average life.
These are the small towns of England and Wales -- the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
There is a great difference between the poor and others.
Even those who were right under the roof, their health was worse than those who were on the roof.
So income in our society means a lot, but there's no difference between society.
The opposite explanation is, in our society, what we see is relative income or social status, identity -- the relationship between us and the gap between people and people.
Once you have that idea, you should think immediately: What happens if the Conference expands? What if it reduces the gap? How will it expand or reduce the income gap?
That's what I'm going to tell you right away.
I didn't use any assumptions.
My data came from the United Nations -- as from the World Bank -- about these rich, developed countries' income gap.
The way we use it, it's easy to understand, and you can download it, is 20 per cent of each country's previous income gap and 20% later.
You can see that all countries on the left are equal to — Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden — the wealth of 20 per cent before them is approximately 3.5 to 4 times that of 20 per cent.
But on the other side, compared to inequality, the income gap needs to be increased once and for all.
In this way, our country's inequality is twice as successful as some other democratic markets.
Then I'll show you what this has to do with our society.
We've collected data on issues arising from internal differences, such as at the very lowest level of society, more universal.
Internationally comparable data include average life, children's mathematics and language performance, infant mortality rate, suicide rate, prison population ratio, early pregnancy rates, trust rate, poverty, mental disease — all of which are consistent with the standard diagnostic classifications, including drug and alcohol — and social mobility.
We put all of this into one factor.
They're all under average authority.
The percentage of one country is the average of these reasons.
You can see that these fractions are related to the inequality I've just shown, and I'm going to repeat these data.
The more inequality countries appear, the more social issues appear.
The connection is very strong.
But if you look at the same health and social issues as compared to the index of national income and the total national income, you'll find nothing, no more relevance.
We have some concern that people might think that we are choosing a specific issue to accept our theory and then for the production of evidence for human beings, and we have also published a paper on the United Nations Children's Benefit Index in the British Medical Journal.
It includes 40 different parts, from others' conclusions.
It includes whether children can communicate with their parents, whether they have books, how much immunization rates are available, and whether there is corruption in school.
It's all included in.
This is the relationship between the index and the same level of inequality.
In an increasingly unequal society, children's performance is worse.
The relationship and its significance.
But once again, if you see it as a child's benefit and a relationship with people's national income, you won't get anything.
All the data I'm showing you right now is the same thing.
The average welfare of our society is no longer dependent on national income and economic growth.
They are very important in poorer countries, but not so for rich developed countries.
And the difference between us and our position relative to others seems very important right now.
Next, I'll show you some of the sections of our index.
This is mutual trust index.
It means that the majority of the people are trustworthy.
This is from the data from the World Values Survey.
You can see, on the other hand, there are about 15% of people who feel they can trust others.
But in a more equitable society, this rate rose to 60% or 65%.
If the involvement of community activities or the assessment of social capital is re-examined, there is a very similar link between inequality and inequality.
I mean, we've repeated this job twice.
The first target is these rich developing countries, and we then replaced the test objectives, repeating this test to 50 states in the United States -- the same question: are those more unequal states doing worse in all these assessments?
This is the relationship between the federal government and the inequality that has developed in a general social investigation.
A very similar distribution point is distributed on the same level of confidence.
The same thing is still going on.
Basically, we found that almost all the factors related to mutual trust in international investigations are also reflected in the 50 states that we are investigating separately.
It's not a coincidence.
It's a mental disorder.
The World Health Organization uses the same diagnostic method to collect data that enables us to compare the mental illness rate of every society.
This is the proportion of people with mental illness who had an arbitrary condition last year.
It's ranging from 8% to 24% -- this means that the proportion of mental illness in the whole society is 3 times the other society.
Similarly, these have a close connection with inequality.
This is a crime factor.
The Red Point points to the United States, the Blue Triangles to the Canadian provinces.
But look at the number of differences.
Murder rates ranged from 15 million to 150 million.
That's the ratio of prison inmates.
This is a 10-fold difference, and the number of digits will increase this difference.
But the number of prisoners changed from 40 to 400.
Crime is not the main cause of this relationship.
In some places, crime can be explained in part.
But most of them are severe trials, or more severe trials.
The more society is inequality, the more it tends to retain the death penalty.
This is a high school situation for children.
Same, a lot of differences.
If we discuss the choice of social people, we'll find this gap very serious.
This picture is social mobility.
Actually, the flow rate is based on income.
Basically, what it's asking is: Does the rich father have children, the poor father has poor children, or is there any relationship between them?
On the other hand, Dad's income is more important — for example, the United Kingdom, the United States.
And in northern Europe, Dad's income isn't that important.
There's more social movement there.
As we have often said -- I know there's a lot of Americans here -- if the Americans want to achieve their "American dream," they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause)
I can show you some other questions.
Those issues are more common at the bottom of the social ladder.
But there are no poor problems in society, which appear to be worse in countries with inequality — not just a little bad, but almost 2 times 10 times anything.
Think of the cost, the cost of human resources.
I'd like to go back to this picture that we've shown up before, and we're all together to describe two points.
First of all, through a graph, we've found those worse countries, whatever, seem to be the more unequal countries, but those that seem good, they're both north of Europe and Japan.
So what we see is the relationship between universal social disorder and inequality.
Not just one thing happened, but almost everything.
The other important thing I'd like to point out in this picture is, if you look at the bottom, Switzerland and Japan, they're all very different countries.
The status of women, the degree of adherence to small families, in rich developed countries, is in two extremes.
But another important difference is how they achieve greater equality.
Sweden has a huge difference in income, but it uses taxes, national benefits, generous relief, and so on.
Japan is quite different.
First, the pay gap is smaller than before the Japanese tax.
It's less tax.
It's a little less than good.
And in the U.S. study, we found a clear comparison.
Some of the state's performance is through redistribution, and some of the other states' performances are due to a small gap in income before tax.
So we have to conclude that how to achieve greater equality is not important, and it's important to achieve that equality.
I'm not talking about full equality, I'm saying that there really is in rich market democracies.
With regard to this picture, another thought is not only the poor but also the effect of inequality.
John Donn seems to have some meaning: "No one is an island. "
Through a series of studies, we can compare the behaviour of each class of society to the level of equality or more or less different countries.
It's just an example.
This is the infant mortality rate.
According to the United Kingdom's general socio-economic classification record, some Swedishs are highly compassionate about the death of many babies.
It's a class based on a father's position that doesn't fit in time, so single mother becomes a group of data.
But we're looking at the so-called "Societal low-level" class, that's work without technology.
In the middle, it's a technical manual job, a high non-manufacturer job, a high level of professional work, a doctor, a lawyer, a manager of a large company.
This shows Sweden doing better than the United Kingdom, doing better in every social class.
The biggest difference is the bottom of society.
But even in the top, living in a more balanced society has some advantages.
We showed five different data, including the educational results of the United States and the international, and the health situation.
It seems generally – the most obvious differences between society and society at the social level, but there are also advantages at the social level.
I should explain what's going on.
I believe that I am demonstrating and discussing the impact of inequality on social psychology.
More is concerned about superior feelings and feelings of self-esteem, being respected and invisible, being respected and humiliated.
Of course, those feelings caused by the status of identity competition prompted social consumerism.
But it also contributed to the uncertainty of the status.
We're more concerned about how others judge and look at us, whether we appear attractive, smart, or so.
Social values have increased the fear of these social values.
Interestingly, similar work in the field of social psychology is also carried out: some have found 208 different studies; in the study volunteers were invited to a mental testing centre and then tested their pressure hormones and their reaction when they carry out pressure tasks.
In this observation, scientists are interested in what kind of pressure is that the most important level of stress in the body is to raise the skin, the most important level of the hormone.
As a result, those tasks that include social evaluation threats — threats to self-respect and social status — can be underestimated by others in these missions.
These pressures have a very special effect on theology of stress.
Now we've accepted criticism.
Of course, some people don't like this, and others find it very appealing.
But I should still tell you that when people criticize us for challenging data, we never did that.
We have an unconditional provision that if our data sources contain data from observation countries, we will include them in analysis.
Our data source decided whether the data was effective, not us.
Otherwise, it's going to get worse.
What about other countries?
In the periodical journal of academics, 200 studies are related to health and income and equality.
It's not limited to these countries, hiding a very simple evidence.
The same country, the same inequality method, the question one another.
Why don't we control other factors?
I've shown everyone the national income that doesn't have any effect.
Of course, others have applied a more complex approach in the literature to eliminate poverty, education, such as in the trials.
How's the relationship?
The relevance itself cannot prove the connection of the causes.
We've spent enough time.
It's true, people have a good understanding of the consequences of these results.
The greatest change in our understanding of the long-term drive factors of health in rich developing countries is the long-term pressure from society on immunization and the impact of the cardiovascular system.
Or, for example, violence in countries that are less unequal has become a common cause because people are so sensitive to themselves.
I mean, in order to solve this problem, we should solve a series of problems after taxes and before taxes.
We should limit income and cut the profit culture of the top.
I think we need to do everything we can to get our leaders responsible for the staff.
The last thing I want to conclude is that we can improve our real quality of life by reducing our income gap.
If that's the case, we'll find out that we're suddenly solving the social and mental health problem of the whole society, that's really great.
Thank you.

(German Voice) In the past two weeks, there has been a significant rise in the new epidemic in Spain, with thousands of new outbreaks.
The British Government decided to withdraw Spain from the list of safe travel from Spain from its entry into the British country on Saturday (25 July) from the night of its decision, starting at 9:26 a.m. on the local time, and leaving Spain on the security list.
This decision, which was being heard by British tourists on Spanish holidays, was alarmed and alarmed and even angry, as news like that was unsatisfied.
It was reported that the British Minister of Transport, Grant Shapps, is currently in Spain.
Prior to the release of separate measures by Britain, Norway had also announced that persons returning from Spain would be separated for 10 days.
France and Belgium recommended that their national residents abandon their plans of holiday holidays in Barcelona and the surrounding region.
The seafarers in these areas are suffering from the fact that they are unable to maintain social isolation and that the police need to take steps to reduce the number of seafarers.
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain.
Spain: It's safe here.
With regard to the decision taken by Britain, the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs indicated on Sunday that the country was controlled by the virus.
The Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Arancha Gonzalez Laya, stressed to the media: " Spain is safe, not only for Spanishs but also for tourists. "
The Government of Spain will attempt to convince the Government of England to exclude the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands from segregation measures.
The reason is that these two tourist destinations are far lower than the British territory.
In order to prevent the spread of vaccines, the Catalonia region of Spain has also reopened the ban.
The tourism industry is an important pillar industry in Spain, and Spain is one of the most popular holiday resorts in Britain.
This decision of the United Kingdom is expected to have a major impact on the tourism industry in Spain.

The first day of the Middle Ages: Beijing's high temperature and launch of rain-new web.
The New York Society's first day of the year was on 26 July in Beijing (the journalist's bell) on 26 July.
The 26-morning winds of the Great Winds blow off the air, dispersing each day to cover the high temperature in Beijing, and a new wave of rain rains will continue for several days.
At 1111 hours, Beijing's weather station reported that 26 Beijing had a distributive rainfall (with low-fire power), a maximum temperature of only 27 °C; a low-to-low-medium rainfall (with low-fire power) and a low-to-night temperature of 23 °C.
In Beijing, 24-25 days earlier, during the high-temperature early warning, the highest temperature of most regions was around 37°C and the situation was higher than 40°C.
The sun is the hottest day of a year, the hottest day of a year, the hottest day of a year, the hottest day of China's people.
When they entered, the house was filled with mud, and the city had the word "a two-sided wall."
According to the current forecast, the future three days will be a rainy day in Beijing.
The weather sector suggested that the public be able to minimize mountain areas and prevent natural disasters.
It is understood that this year's "meaning" has 20 days, ranging from 26 July to 14 August.
Once you get into the middle, you'll feel tired, you'll want to eat.
Eating can select green beans, which have a clear fluorescent effect, healthy snacks, and tasteful foods such as peas, which can help to promote appetite and cooling.
The engine might fire the FAA's emergency order to check 2,000 bombers -- Newwaves.
The United States Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) issued an emergency navigation order on 24 days and requested an urgent inspection of approximately 2000 Boum 737NG and 737Classic clients registered in the United States, which could have resulted in a stop in the engine.
The Federal Aviation Agency reported that 4 737NG and 737Classic aircraft operating in the aircraft had so far been subjected to an urgent inspection request that the inspection objective was to continue to be suspended for 7 days and more and that the number of flights would be lower than 11 times after the re-entry of aircraft.
The Federal Aviation Agency warns that the 5th level of all two engines of the client is reduced if they are corrupt, that the card may be opening, causing the client to lose its full power and not be able to reboot the engine.
This aviation regulatory body ordered that, once it was found that the damage had been recovered, the air carrier had to replace this key element before the client was re-entered.
In response later that day, a new vaccine incident led to a reduction in demand, and many clients were archived or less used, " making it easier to get back to corruption " .
At the same time, it has been suggested that the air operator's orders should be checked by the client concerned, and that if the problem is identified, it will provide the inspection and replacement assistance.
The U.S. reported that U.S. main air carrier fleets normally flew several times in one day, but after the outbreak of the new vaccines, large-scale wholesale aircraft stopped; some of them re-entered operations as long as the demand for passengers grew.
The Federal Aviation Agency did not publish any details of the four aircraft stop reports.
The Alaska Aviation Company revealed one of the events later on 24 days.
In his statement, the air carrier said that one of the following clients flew from West Asia to Ostia, Washington, U.S.A., on July 15 and that an engine suddenly set fire to Ostia, Texas, and finally landed in Oston Airport.
The Alaska Aviation Company said that the engine had been changed and that it had been checked by the Federal Aviation Agency according to six aircraft.
The United States Aviation Company, the Joint Aviation Company and the South-South Aviation Company, said on 24 days apart, that there was no fire-fighting engine on the ground.
The United States Air Corps will be subject to inspection by four air carriers, and the Joint Air Corps will be subject to inspection by 28 air carriers.
DAS claims that 20 aircraft will be inspected from the flag, but there is no indication of the occurrence of engine fires.
Many media reports that the Federal Aviation Agency's emergency air navigation orders are a further blow to the noise.
A total of 346 people were killed in the accident of October 2018 and March 2019, respectively, by a bomb 737 MAX client in Indonesia and an Ethiopian air carrier.
This series of clients was subsequently globalized, and this year's January and May's re-produced.
The Director of the Federal Aviation Agency, Steve Dixon in June, admitted that the Federal Aviation Agency had "missed" in its regulation of the Boaz.
"School! Teacher! "" Next week, "School Leaders" will launch a new-new network of knowledge.
There's a new integrated line.
An interactive knowledge-sharing program, "School! Teachers", will be released on 20 July in South Lake Security.
It is understood that the programme will create a whole new full-year-old classroom, and a number of well-known and skilled teachers will take the lead in challenging the production of interesting knowledge.
In contrast to the strong impressions of the past group of teachers in the public, "School! Teachers are a valuable and skilled representative of knowledge.
They are both examples of youth knowledge from various schools, or a group that will pack up and teach the most powerful "hands".
In the series, these best-known youth knowledge examples as "scholars of knowledge", will challenge interesting knowledge courses.
They need to come out of their minds with a sense of knowledge and show the audience at the top of the school.
There are a wide variety of problems in the "inquiry mission" exhibitions, which are made up of older audiences, raising difficulties in education for "knowledge-sharing" and increasing the range of incentives for the show.
It was explained that this "knowledge-sharing Officer" had a high-level academic teacher at the University of People of China, Lee Yule, who conducted studies on the names of students in the snowflakes and the excellent young teachers with decades of experience, who would display in an unexpected manner the "hard nuclear" knowledge of various sciences to the present audience.
In addition, the show invited Professor of Economics to open a public school for the "initiators of knowledge" as a series of events.
Director, Government Department of the Hong Kong Region: The situation is severe, full of efforts to combat the new network in Hong Kong
On 26 July, the Director of the Hong Kong Government Division of the Hong Kong Region said that the situation of the Hong Kong New Hampton virus continued to be severe, and that if the vaccine was transmitted, the Government of the Special Region would take more stringent control measures to further restrict the operation of the premises and reduce the presence of civilians.
However, the government of the current stage does not intend to impose a "resident order" or "restrictive order" restrictions on citizens.
On the day of the birth, it was published on the website of the "Serving situation and total resistance."
He pointed out that this epidemic has been the worst for half years and that the two weeks in the future will be crucial to preventing the spread of virus in the community.
In addition to the necessary measures by the Government of the Special Region, citizens are also important to self-law and co-operation.
He called on the citizens to stay at their homes as fully as possible in order to reduce social contact and out-of- office use.
Citizens should protect themselves and others by means of forced measures with their mouthpieces, focusing on personal and environmental health and work washers, and should further suspend unnecessary association or association and reduce to the city.
He said that the central attention had been given to the change in the situation in Hong Kong and to support the efforts of the Government of the Special Region to prevent vaccines and to respond actively to the latest requests of the Administrator to assist in the expansion of the inspection capacity and the transformation of the Asian International Museum of Pediatrics into a similar hospital.
It was suggested that the Government of the specific high-risk groups, namely the Announcing Houses, the Disabled Houses and the Rehabilitations, the Food Offices, the Renting Drivers and the Business Managers, had conducted a comprehensive inspection of the free virus available to more than 400,000 people.
He was very concerned about the cases of infection in the APA, and the Government of the Special Region had arranged a temporary vaccination centre for friends of the APA.
He pointed out that the Government of the Special District was in the vicinity of the San Juan Vaccinator Centre in New Zealand, which was expected to provide more than 700 separate rooms by the end of September.
The Administrator also announced on 19 days that the Government of the Special Region would be increasingly involved in the construction of the 2000 separation room at the San Juan Vaccinator Centre and that it would be expected to fall by the end of this year.
In addition, the Centre for the separated vaccine has entered into 800, and the Centre for Vaccination is expected to provide a total of 3500 separate rooms at the end of the year.
There are currently four separation centres operating in Hong Kong, providing approximately 2600 separation rooms.
In addition, on 24 days, the Government of the Special Region reopened the fishing park holiday village in Hong Kong as a community separation facility for the recovery of persons with an independent capacity under 50 years of age.

In recent days, the Chief of Staff has recalled that when attending the Memorial of the Four Ombudspersons, he stressed: "It would be good to learn the history of the Chinese Communist Party, New China History, in order to make 14 million people more than 9,000,000 members of the leadership department, especially at all levels. "
A serious study of the history of the party, a new Chinese history, was the first time that the Department of State Affairs had forgotten to remember the necessary adjustments to the mission, to obtain wealth, to cultivate the country's interests, and to make a long journey to the new era.
The history of a party that has been in Bogotá has been recorded in the New China History of the Chinese Communist Party since its birth, showing the belief and loyalty of the Communist Party in the use of life and blood, and in the long-standing initial and mission.
History is the best teaching book, and for the Department of Party Affairs, the new Chinese history is the most famous chapter in this textbook.
Each party member will continue to strengthen his or her history, move on to future history, establish a new mission for the new process, take the "skillful" of the times, and follow the long way of contemporarys.
In the course of history of the party, the initial mission in the new Chinese history was maintained.
The reversing history of the party, the new Chinese history, was filled with the constant initial mission of the Chinese Communist Party and the firm belief that the Communist party was always with the people.
It is close to understanding the history of the Party, important events in the new Chinese history, important meetings, important people, not only with a straight heart rate, mind-blowing, but also with a deeper understanding of the early faith and a sense of mission as a part of the mission.
For the Department of the Party, the goal of continuing to pursue the initial mission, always moving forward, is to find our starting point in the history of the Party, to preserve a clear sense of identity and firm position, and to be motivated by the strength of the nation's bravery to ensure that the revolution is spread through the blood and life of the Red Cross.
In the history of the student parties, in the history of the new Chinese history, there is a spirit of pride.
Since the formation of the Chinese Communist Party, the spirit of the Red Sea, the spirit of the Red Sea, the spirit of the long, the spirit of peace, the spirit of war, the spirit of Cyprus, the spirit of two billion stars, the spirit of space.
The great spirit of these historical darknesss has given our party a strong spirit to fight all kinds of risks on the way to the front. It is a fighter, a fighter, a fighter, a fighter, a fighter.
In the history of the Party, China's history is a process of renewed spirituality and self-conceivable self-responsiveism, to feel that it is a reflection of the noble spirit of the revolution, to preserve the spiritual paradise of the Communists, to achieve a strong spiritual base for the advancement of the great cause, to achieve a great dream, and to have these spirits inherited and subdued, and to send out a new era of light.
Reading the history of the province, in the history of the party, continues to be a crime in the new Chinese history.
In the case of the Department of Party Affairs, there is no record of history that can bring more profound warnings than the history of the Party.
In the history of the party, in the new Chinese history, it was possible to see the faith of an old revolutionist, not only in the face of great events for the achievement of a set goal but also in the pursuit of some people's ideals of belief, to go to the profound teachings of the revolution, to send and warn us never to stop with firm determination and will, never to despair, and always to be filled with a fierce battle spirit, and to be full of piety, and to reform its laws.
In order to be truly a strong believer in a Communist far-reaching, faithful practitioners need to think of the "poisonous" body, solid "skinned" body, the history of the party, and the new Chinese history should be a self-examination of each party member, warning me of my own base.
She's known as Sheikh, and she's re-born in the history of the student party, and she's in the middle of the new Chinese history.
The Deputy Secretary-General noted: "The history of the student parties, the history of the country, is the persistence and development of specific socialism in China and the continuation of the necessary lessons for the parties and countries to progress towards the necessary reform " .
Looking back to history, asking for the first time, for the glory and the future.
Each Party member should follow the history of the student party, the new Chinese history as a lifelong pursuit, continue to move on in the course of the study, bravely carry out historical missions at their respective workplaces, and be responsible and actively active.
The continuation of the progress of the former revolutionary family, as a reference and direction, continues to clarify the political background of the Communist parties, maintains only the war, promotes a climate of conflict and is more dangerous than it was before, and is written as a self-concealed fool in the process of mass resurrection of the Chinese people.
The New Web of the "Speech of the Sun" search for the "Hungary Dream."
(China's story of poverty reduction)
On July 26th, the new Central Bank power plant, "900 million lysa, throws the wind into the sky."
It is the birthplace of a beautiful landscape of the richness of the junta of countless civilizations, and it is now with a well-known "Economic priority", a green development concept, followed by a brilliant "Georgian dream".
The "Blood Dream" of the river's clean water.
"Hungary Funginsha", which is 397 miles [397 km] long, is a "Mother River" on the other side.
With industrialization, however, urbanization has accelerated, the river lakes have developed using and managing imbalances, overtifications, lakes production, water pollution, water scarcity, water quality, environmental degradation and ecological degradation.
Now, Ninsha is promoting a wide variety of water ecosystems and is trying to clear the river of the river.
The water is going down from the beginning.
In the Ninsha Bank, locally adopted "promoting+responsive+sorms", the industrial field water has been concentrated, the urban water treatment plant has reached a level A standard issue, the urbanization of the dry water infrastructure is essentially eliminated, and the third group of China's Blackwater sample cities have been successfully declared successful.
In addition, Ninsha fully implements river master control in 2017 and is now fully covered by the river master control system at the five-level river management system in the village of the district.
The 64-year-old nurse, who lived in a village near the river, noticed the change in the river: "The first one smells, and there is no smell after all."
It turns out that the environment has improved, and his life is much more comfortable, and now he and his family walk along the river of Juju and feel the blue sun.
"Shutland dream"
Birds, green trees, rivers, rivers, and the beauty of the "Sao-Sao-Sao" in the Nin-Sao-Sao's rainforest park has become a reality.
The Guangu River, along the way, has created riverbeds, lakebeds, and many drylands, which play an important role in the promotion of the rational use of water resources and the ecological balance of water resources, while also becoming an international channel for migration of the most important species of birds.
Since 2009, the relevant sector has invested approximately $34.5 million in the project for the protection of drought, which is now estimated at 159 million square miles [19 million sq km], 78.5 per cent in soil protection, nearly 200 in natural lakes, around 200 inland waterways, 5 inland parks, one in national cities, 6 in the self-government area, and 8 in urban parks.
The Deputy Director of the Banking Centre for the Protection of the Banking Areas told reporters that the protection of the environment has increased biodiversity, which is particularly evident in birds, "the remains are a dangerous species, with only 20,000 species of birds around the world, and more than 2,000 of them live in sand. "
At the same time, in accordance with the law, Ninsha has established a red line between the two coastal areas of the river bank, 500 metres between the region, providing that no unit and individual must develop and operate within the context of protection.
The Deputy Director of the Centre for Urban Water Services of the Bankings presents a few examples of courage: the integrated river lake ecosystems and the final drylands are being built through pollution-based governance, and the water levels are now 100 per cent of the water quality in the GHG, "and the water is now clear and the fish is frozen and the flowers are gone."
"Drinking water" of the Pewish people.
The city of Ninsha River had a name for a "floating": the only city in the nearby city of Juju.
Since 2010, the situation in the region of the Great Lakes region has become a problem in the status of a large area of overcrowding, and water shortages have been a stumbling block to the cities in recent decades.
The improvement in the water quality of the river is beneficial, and after drinking the river, it is a good way to address the problem of drinking water for the local population.
The Deputy Director-General of the Banking Water Agency made clear that, in order to improve the demand for water production for the inhabitants of the town of Banking, Nansha launched a water-producing project on the west side of the town of Banking in order to replace the original groundwater with quality river.
" On 29 December 2019, the supply of water engineering officially penetrated the three districts of the town of Bangui, and in 2020, the inhabitants of the village of Guangdong also drank of the river. "
The Banking Water Sector will take into account the reform of regional integration of rural water and urban water supply, " Next step, we will fully integrate rural water supply points into the Western water supply engineering process and expect the urban integration of the banking region to be essentially achieved at the end of this year."

The United States launched an anti-subsidy investigation on China with "low exchange rates of people"
In response to the United States Department of Commerce's recent announcement, it decided to initiate anti-dumping subsidies investigations on products originating in China and to conduct an investigation on the 'low exchange rate of the people ' s currency' project.

The Ministry of Commerce noted that the exchange rate issue exceeded the mandate of members to conduct anti-subsidy investigations in accordance with the World Trade Organization rules.
In February this year, the United States amended regulations to investigate counter-subsidy investigations on foreign exchange rates, which have been suspected of violating WTO rules and which have been opposed in many respects.
The press statement states that, even in accordance with United States legislation, the complainant ' s complainant ' s complaint content is a significant mistake, without financial funding, and that it is essential elements of the anti-subsidy, such as the granting of interest and the granting of ad hoc sex.
China urged the United States to comply with the existing international rules and to cease the anti-subsidy investigation of so-called "low exchange rates of people".

The Louis family: John Lewis is a fighter for the weakest.
A member of the United States Congress, John Lewis, was remembered as a "war for the weakest" soldier at his follow-up meeting on Saturday (July 25th).
The public follow-up of Lewis began to take place on Saturday in Alabama.
There's two follow-up meetings on the first day.
At a public follow-up meeting at the University of Troy, Alabama, on Saturday, five sisters and a cousin of Louis spoke of him as a loving, fearless man with family importance.
Henry "Grant" Lewis, the youngest brother of Louis, said at the meeting: "He was committed to helping others."
Samuel Lewis said his mother warned John: "Don't worry, don't worry."
He added that John didn't hear from his mother's warning, and he said, "We all know that John's always going to trouble, but that's because he's right, that's good trouble."
John's most famous point was to create a "good problem" for the sake of justice.
John once applied for a university of Troy University in the city of Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but at the time he refused to apply for a university in the White School.
This time, John Lewis, who was preaching the good news on his own farm, was eventually educated in religion and philosophy at the University of Fisk.
Many years later, the University of Troy awarded Dr. Lewis an honorary degree.
Doug Jones, Senator of the National Assembly in Alabama, said that the current protesters "are at peace, not violent protests", as Luis did in the civil rights movement.
Jones said: "Even if President Tranmp had a fight against a man on the ship, all protestors would have been cruel, but he was wrong.
The protesters are lovers, and they hope that the United States will enter a more equitable country. "
A series of activities for six days to commemorate Louis will be held this week at the funeral of the state of Georgia.
On Saturday's anniversary of the fall of Louis, in public memorial activities at the University of Troy, people were given priority to this civil rights movement.
On Saturday evening, a private ceremony was held in a small church in Selma (Selma) in Alabama, followed by a public memorial event.
On Sunday, Louis' body will be passed through the Edmon Pettus Bridge in Selma.
In 1965, he and his group of demonstrators who requested black voting were injured by the police in the state of Alabama before this bridge, and the police also handed down the van vass to the protesters.
Lewis was almost killed then.
This day is called "Hungary Sunday".
The body of Louis will be transported to the capital of Montgomery, Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged the people to join the team, which ended this last time with Lewis.
At the same time, officials demand that the public take part in the activities and keep the social distance.
Kay Ivey, Head of State of Alabama, sent half of the flag on Saturday and Sunday to commemorate Lewis.
In the near-week memorial event, Louis's body will separate the Assembly Hall of the State of Alabama in Montgomery, the Assembly Hall of the State of Georgia in Atlanta, and the United States Assembly in Washington, Washington, for the sake of public reflection.
The President of the United States Parliament, Nancy Pelosi (Nancy Pelosi) and the majority of the Council members, Mitch McConnell, announced on Sunday that people could express their respect for Lewis at the meeting this week and Tuesday.
Because of the symptoms of the virus, the public activities of Lewis will be held outside the home.
It's an open-ended health regulation, and it's a new web.
On 26 July, the New York Society (New York Journalist Maustoum, White) encouraged residents to do physical examinations and early detection; prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors; establishing a network game health review system; using a unit to prepare special and functional health managers... The previous "Principal Economic Area Health Regulations (Research for Comments)" was officially published and the inhabitants of the Enlightenment will have their own "health law".
In order to encourage the presence of residential services and early detection of problems, the health sector should draw up the basic indexes of health inspection projects based on different age factors, such as careers.
The health costs of health insurance, which fall within the basic directory of the health inspection project, are paid annually by the Social Health Insurance Integrated Fund.
In order to make it clear that the unit should reasonably adjust its human resources, arrange for the duration of the work of the staff, implement a rotational system to avoid excessive damage or physical damage to the health of workers, while strictly implementing the staff's pension system.
In addition, the personnel unit was to be equipped with specialized and functional health managers and regularly conducted staff health examinations.
In relation to the physical health of minors, an opinion was submitted to prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors, while limiting the place of sale of alcoholic beverages, which would be corrected by the market surveillance management authority and around $30,000 fines.
In addition to the "Blood" , minors also need to be " multi-moving " .
In accordance with the request for comments, the school must schedule more than one hour of school sports each day.
For network games, public, cultural tourism, network regulation and health should improve the health control system at Internet service stations, establish a network game health review system to promote good communication between young people and cultures in order to promote healthy development of youth health.
In addition, the request for an opinion also suggests that patients with flu should be admitted to public places and that the health authorities do not agree to disclose private compensation of 20,000 dollars.
It is worth noting that, in addition to the physical health of the inhabitants, it is also requested that the sectors should assess the impact of public policies on public health in the preparation of urban space planning and construction, in the planning and construction of industrial parks, in the development of resources for use with environmental protection, in the development of standard documents, and in the approval of major construction projects and in the implementation of major public services projects.
Without an assessment or an assessment that would have a more serious adverse impact on public health or the health of the population, it shall not be possible to establish or approve the implementation.

In the near future, the Deputy Chief of Peace recalled in a survey in the province of Gilin that the leadership of the party was needed to strengthen the party ' s leadership, to promote the expansion of the party ' s core, to provide a system of work of the WHO and to provide strong assurances for urban community governance.
Continually building the party's leadership into various areas of basic governance is a horizontal and fundamental requirement for good governance.
In order to enhance the level of basic governance, it is essential that the party be guided, through enhanced political guidance, to build a fighter, to combine red forces, to promote political advantages of the party, to turn the organizational advantages and the public's work into governance advantages, to transmit the party's strength and advocacy to "the last mile".
Focusing on filling in the spirit of self-impression and strengthening political direction.
The political guidelines for strengthening the basic governance must be implemented well in the process of filling the spirit of the spirit of the spirit.
In order to develop a deeper understanding of Chinese socialism as the primary mission of the new era, to develop "forgotiately, remember mission" as party-building permanent topics and parties, the final subjects of the Department, to strengthen the reading of the original texts, to divide training, to discuss, to organize the exchange, to continue to promote the innovative and armed movements of the parties, to further strengthen the "four awareness", to strengthen the four confidences of the Party's team, to do "two maintenance" better.
By means of an online learning approach, the learning channels are expanded, and the Department of Basic Party organizations and members of the Party are led to the regular integration of learning into daily learning.
Focusing on practical solutions, focusing on key issues in the area of infrastructure governance, focusing on the concerns of the people, addressing concerns and solutions to the problem of poverty and poverty.
Get the rules up, build the battle tower.
The CFP is both an important component of the basic governance system and an important element of its governance capacity.
Promoting the normalization of grassroots organizations to take the lead in the regulations of the work of the Department of the Stakeholders, leading to weakening and falsifying issues such as joint organizations, setting up the above-mentioned intermodal mechanisms, setting up the new Department of Sciences, and establishing a routinely disintegration of the full range of decision-making mechanisms, forms of health-making mechanisms, services community mechanisms, basic foundations, cutting board, and development.
In rural areas, the standardization of rural party organizations has been strengthened, and the implementation of systems such as standardization of the Department of Standardization of the Party's Departments, the format of the Organization, learning activities, management mechanisms, effective promotion of "Third Meeting One", thematic party's Day activities is under way.
In cities, focusing on street communities, exploring the form of the establishment of the Department of Innovation, combining areas of weakness, "pangs" "pangs", actively building the Alliance of Urban Parties to achieve effective coverage of the work of the parties.
At the same time, the creation of a system of sound, sound governance governance mechanisms, a healthy community, a common community, a real community, a common thing to do, an urgent business, a difficult common understanding, a decision-making mechanism led by basic organizations, a process for improving the services of the Party ' s services, a process of bringing people together in the public service, a sense of happiness, a sense of dignity, pride, and a sense of self-esteem to make basic governance more warm.
Take the lead, gather the red force.
The Ministry of Fundamental Affairs is the cornerstone of basic governance.
The development of baseline governance capacity, with a focus on strengthening the governance capacity of the Department of the Base Party, focusing on the role of the "red cell" as a sample of the role of the baseline governance and the integration of the Red Cross at the top of the contact group.
The necessary training to enhance governance capacity as the Ministry of the Base Party Division will continue to strengthen thinking and professional training, practice skills, and the capacity to contribute to the advancement of the national governance system and the modernization of governance capacity in this position.
In order to carry out a wide range of " community disintegration, party reporting" activities, through participation in thematic party day activities, to connect difficult populations, to identify services projects, to recognize and make reasonable recommendations, to participate in community building, management and services, and to play a role in community governance.
In order to play a full role in the role of rural non-permanent members, through the creation of a non-performance team, such as the creation of a non-performance team, it will lead to the active participation of broad-based parties in efforts to eradicate poverty, build ecologically, rely on sustainability, and to better integrate red force into civil service.
The base is strong.
The base of the base party is the base of the government's capital.
The only way to strengthen the relationship between close party groups, to increase the well-being of the people as an eye-opening point, to build the party's leadership as a fundamental means of promoting the innovation of basic governance, to get the foundation, to get out, to the top, to get up, to climb up, to promote basic governance, to be organized, strong and effective.

It's possible to hide the sheep in the desert in New York.
Newspapers from the three-year-old National Park Manager can be informed of the five-way protection station of the Koshili Department of Management from the three-year-old National Park Manager, which has been monitored as a past visit to the Kosiri region of the Kosiri region's skimmed-backed breeding grounds and begin taking young children back to their homelands.
The surveillance scene near the five-way protection station shows that on 25 July, about 40 male goats were the only 3 male sheep that had been herded through the 3002 kilometres of the narrow road, and the five-wheeled northern bridge had begun to relocate.
Experts have analysed that in recent years the number of male and female ewes in the flock of sheep is one to five-quarters of the total number of ewes.
The Deputy Research Officer of the University of China in the North-West Institute for High-Ethiopia Research in the Western Hemisphere said: "In the early stages of the return of sheep to hiding, there is a higher risk of being caught, so the number of young chicks in the flocks will be smaller and may even occur without a baby. "
According to the statistics of the Kosiri Management Service of the three-pronged National Park Manager, the total number of return of sheep is rising year after year, with a total of 4860 in 2019 and an increase of 338 in 2018.
In addition, it said: "It is expected that this year's return will end in September and that the number of shepherds will continue to grow."
Protecting animals at the national level.
At the end of May each year, from the three-year-olds of the Red Sea, the West Bank, and the mountains of the mountains, such as the mountains of the mountains of New Zealand, all of the sheep will go to the lake of salty lakes in the cosyrian soil.
My national shepherd expert, a researcher at the Animal Institute of the West Bank, said: "The shepherd's return is after the birth of the male sheep and continues with the process of bringing the baby back to the nest.
In order to ensure the safe return of the flocks of sheep, the journalists learned that the Cosseri Administration of the three-year-old National Park Manager area had organized staff in the main returning region to continue monitoring and patrolling the area.
If hidden flocks are found trying to cross the road, the patrolling team will conduct temporary traffic control for the first time and ensure the safety of the flock through the wildlife channel and at least possible human interference on their way home.
So, how do you figure out what to do with everyday life?
The experts suggest that it is best not to go down or work in the hottest afternoon, as the sun is the strongest and the most likely occurrence of heat during this period.
If it is necessary to leave at this time, it is necessary to do some protective work, such as silhouettes, sunglasses, sunglasses, and conditions for the best to protect the skin from injury.
Clothing is the most selectable color of the hair, the freshest taste, the sweetness, the quality of the hair, the wearable style of the hair, so that it cannot be heated at a time when it is cold and causes it to dry.
When the temperature is high, prepare enough water, drink in time, and do not wait until you drink water, because once you feel tired you have lost your body, control the water at 150 to 200 milligrams per day, drink hot water and not drink cold water.
Depending on the temperature, the general staff will drink 1.5 to 2 litres per day and high-temperature workers and 3 to 5 litres per day.
More than once, it may be appropriate to supplement a few wells and fill the gaps that have been lost because of hunger.
In addition, summers are easily depleted, and people feel tired, and they have to drink very well.
The high levels of water in summer, such as food, juice, rice, etc.; fresh fruit, such as wheat, wheat, sieve and sugar, can be used to fill both 80 to 90 per cent of the water; milk products can both fill water and satisfy the physical needs of the body.
In addition, groups of people working in the high-temperature environment should be appropriately supplemented with drinks containing lead and lead-like elements.
It's cold, warm, fresh, and exhausted, and it's easy to feel tired.
A full sleep can ease both the brain and the body's systems, benefiting from work and learning, as well as preventive measures.
The expert said that the best bedtime was from 22 to 23 hours and that the best bedtime was from 5.30 to 6.30 p.m.
When sleeping, be careful not to sleep under air and air, so as to avoid airborne diseases and warm winds.
The experts suggest that in outdoor activities or in high-quality activities, people can carry 10 tons of water, water, steaming water, or lubricants, or be placed in close workplaces, at any time, in order to prevent the occurrence of lead.
I would like everyone to think about a very simple fact that, so far, most of our understanding of the universe has come from light.
We stand on the earth looking at the night sky and see the stars in the sky with their physical eyes.
The sun is so bright.
We can see the light coming back from the moon.
From Galileo to his simple celestial telescope, to the celestial bodies in the universe, to this day, what we know of the universe, we can see by the light now.
With the help of modern solar telescopes, we have been able to collect unheard of images -- this series of images can be traced to a huge explosion.
But the universe is not a mystery, because the universe is not really silent.
I want to tell everyone that the universe has its own fun, and the universe is playing it all the time, because space can move as fast as it can.
So when some big things happen, it can send a series of voices to the universe.
Now, we want to be able to give this amazing visual work on the universe to the sound.
Although we've never heard voices coming from outer space, we should be able to raise the volume in the next few years and hear what happened there.
To catch the universe's voice this far-reaching goal, we put our focus on the dark hole and the prospects it shows, because when the black hole hits air, like a drumming tap, it sends a very special sound, and I'm happy to play some of the sounds we predicted.
One day we may be able to see a shadow, a dark hole can remain a shadow in a very bright background, but it has not yet been observed.
Although black holes cannot be seen, they may be heard, because they're empty when they hit like drums.
This idea that the universe sends out the same tone of voice comes from Albert Einstein, which is, in fact, from him.
Einstein realized that if the universe was empty, if the universe was empty, it would look like this picture, except for the extra lines above.
But if we fall free in the universe, even without these extra lines, our trails will draw those lines, because we'll find out that we're going to move along the straight, the straight line that doesn't break through the universe.
Einstein also realized that this is the most important part (but also the meaning of "materials") -- if you put energy and matter in the universe, the universe will collapse.
That's the relative width of Einstein's Great.
Even the path of light will be broken.
When it falls to a certain extent, it moves around the orbits of the sun movement, like the earth orbits the sun, the moon rotates around the earth.
It's a natural curve in the universe.
But Einstein didn't realize that if you cut the sun into a six kilometer ball -- that is, if you cut the equivalent of a million times Earth's quality into a six kilometer ball, you're going to create a hole, and this object's density is so high that if the light is too close, it won't be able to escape-- there's a huge black hole in the universe.
But Einstein has always considered black hole to be just a mathematical point.
He doesn't believe there's really a dark hole.
He believed that nature would stop the formation of the black hole to protect us.
After decades, people started using the word "black hole" and realized that the black hole was a real heavenly being -- in fact, they were some of the great kind of stars at the end of their lives, which happened after the catastrophic collapse of death.
Our sun will not shrink into a dark hole.
It's not really big enough.
But if we've done some thinking experiments -- Einstein really likes to do it -- we can imagine that the sun's behind the rupture within six kilometres, and then put a small planet around it, like on a 30 km from the black hole.
The earth will shine itself, because the sun is gone, we have no other source of light – so our little planet will shine itself.
You'll find that you can even put the earth on a 30-mile orbit outside of the dark hole and make it run smoothly.
This black hole, it's just almost Domanhaton.
Before it destroys the earth, it might go down to Hudson Street.
But that's basically what we're talking about.
What we're talking about is one thing that's so big in Manhattan.
So we move this planet to a place close to the black hole, 30 km away – we notice it runs along the perfect black hole.
There's a message that black hole will tear everything in the universe, but actually you'll have to get out very close.
But it's very impressive that from our perspective, we can always see the Earth.
It can't hide behind the dark hole.
Some of the light sent out from the earth fell into the dark hole, but some of it was broken down after we saw it.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If that's what you're fighting with the Sionians, don't hide behind the dark hole.
They can see you.
Our sun will not shrink into a dark hole; its quality is not large enough, but there are thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If one of them is in the trash can system, it's going to look like this.
We're going to see a shadow of a dark hole that's thrown into the galaxy's billions of galaxies and a bright cloud of stars.
If we go to this hole, we'll see the light hit around the dark hole, and even when we start entering this shadow, we won't even feel some great changes are happening.
If we try to launch the rocket and get out of there, the results won't be good, because we can't run away, nor can we run away.
Although black hole looks dark out there, it doesn't look like that, because all the constellations of light can fall together with us into black hole.
And even so, because of the relative effects of time, our time seems slow compared to the time of the galaxy, which looks like the outer system is accelerating, before we are destroyed by the dark.
It's like the feeling of death from the body, you see the light of the tunnels, but it's a perfect experience of death.
(Laughter) You didn't tell anyone you saw light on the street.
So far, we've never seen such a shadow left behind, but black holes can be heard, even if they can't be seen.
Just imagine, in a real skyscraper -- imagine the two of them already exist for a long time.
Maybe they were stars before and then they cut down two black holes - each quality is 10 times the sun.
Now we'll cut them to 60 kilometers.
They can rotate a hundred times a second.
At the end of their lives, they are fast approaching each other.
In a few seconds, they can cross thousands of miles, and in this process, they will not only cause space to collapse, but also cause space movement in the back of the body, a kind of real weather.
Black hole, when it comes to the universe, causes space to collapse and collapse.
They're moving fast in space.
This computer model was completed by the relatively group of Goudads of the National Aviation Agency.
It took almost 30 years to solve this problem.
It's one of many groups.
It shows two black holes around each other, these are the curves in the picture.
As you can see, there may be some simulations -- you can see that red waves are fired, and these are exciting waves.
They are really in the universe, and these voices will be spread out in the process of integration into the black hole, and they will spread out quickly from these black holes, until they are united into a dark hole that turns into a peaceful circle.
If you stand close enough, your ears will be concognizable with these spaces.
You can really hear these sounds.
Of course, you'll find your head crushed and crushed without help, so you may not understand what happened.
But I'd like to play for you.
It's my group's research results -- a relatively simple calculation model.
Imagine a small black hole that falls into a larger hole.
The sound you heard comes from a small-quality black hole near a large-quality black hole and hits with space.
If they're far away, they'll sound very small.
But the loud sounds become like a drumming, pushing space, moving space like a drum.
We can predict what this voice will become.
We know that in the process of falling down, the small quality of the black hole will be faster and the sound that is sent will be brighter.
Finally, we'll hear the little hole completely down into the big hole.
I never thought this voice was that loud-- here it was actually raised.
When you hear it at home, it feels like it's not enough.
It sounds like, um, uh, uh...
This is another voice that is modelled by our research team.
I'm not going to show you a picture here, because the black hole won't leave any useful traces, and the real space won't show you those fake curves.
But if you hear this voice when you're on vacation in the universe, I suggest you run away.
(Laughter) It's better to get away from this voice.
These two black holes are moving.
Two black holes are close to each other.
In such a situation, they're all in a lot of trouble.
And then they'll be integrated into one.
The noise of that noise is a sign of black hole integration-- when the integration is over, the sound of the bell will be heard.
This is what we'll see about what we'll do.
Luckily, we're very safe in the Gulf of California.
I suspect that in some part of the universe, two black holes have been integrated.
The same suspects that the space around us can also feel these over a million light years, or from a million years ago, they're spread quickly and finally meet us.
But these sounds are too small, so we can't even hear them.
Some experiments in the world need a lot of blood to build up -- one of which is called LIGO -- it will be able to test the distance of every four kilometres less than an atomic core motion.
It's a very brave attempt, and in the next few years it's not going to be overrun -- it's going to be used to test space motion.
Another research project on the universe was expected to start within the next decade, called Lisa.
Lisa will be able to see a superquality black hole -- those qualities are millions of times even billions of times in the sun.
We see these two stars in a picture of the distant horizon.
Looks like they're stuck together.
Their center might be a large super-black hole, or something.
But they're not slowing down, they're actually integrating.
These two black holes will be hit, their integration will last for billions of years.
That's why they've gathered their voices and they've gone beyond the feelings of our human beings.
But Lisa can see that two of them started the final phase of the super-quality black hole that occurred before it was too early, which was 15 minutes before they were integrated.
It's not just a black hole, but it can be used to detect any major disturbances in the universe -- the largest of which is the number of explosions in the universe.
When this word was created, some people wondered, "Oh, who would believe the universe explodes?"
This video I made in Proton Studios' friend shows the situation from the outside of a huge explosion.
We're not really going to want to do that; we want to be inside the universe, because there's no such thing as space.
So imagine you're in a big explosion.
There's nothing in the universe. Everything in the world is around you.
It's been 1400 million years, and it's still ringing around us.
There's at least one planet like this, and it's life-saving.
Here, we're going to go crazy and build experiments, make calculations, write computer codes.
Imagine, a billion years ago, two black holes struck.
It's been a long time. It's been in the air.
We're not even here.
It's getting closer - 40,000 years ago, we're still painting on the wall of the cave.
If the sound we're going to get is a huge explosion, it sounds like that.
Seriously, it's loud.
It's a white voice, a confused voice.
But it's nowhere around us, unless it's been removed from some other process in the universe.
If we can detect these sounds, it'll be like music, because it's a silent response from the moment we've been created, from the universe that we're looking forward to.
So in the next few years, we'll be able to raise a little bit of the volume of these music, let the universe show us in the form of music.
But if we can detect the earliest moments, it will make us understand more and more, and enable us to pursue some of the most difficult, and the most complex problems.
If we fall into the history of the play of the universe, we can know that there's been a big explosion in the past, we can even hear that complex sound, but is our big explosion the only major explosion in the universe?
I mean, we're not gonna stop asking if there's been a similar explosion before?
Is the future not going to happen again?
I would like to say that if we raise the meaning of this issue to this level that has been promoted by TED, at least in the last minute, we can ask some questions, which we may never answer.
But we don't stop asking: Will our universe not be just a part of a bigger history?
Or what if we were to say that we would not only be a division in the universe -- each division had experienced its own great explosion -- maybe some of them had a dark hole, some of them had no -- maybe there were some conscious lives, some were not there -- they were not our past, they were not our future, but were somehow connected to us?
So, we can't stand to guess if there's a multi-circuit universe, there's life in other parts of this multi-circuit universe?
This is life in our multi-crowd universe.
Is there any other life in the vast majority of the universe that they wouldn't even assume of our existence, thinking of their own origin?
If that's the case, I can imagine they're just like us, they're doing calculation, they're building computer codes, they're building a test machine, they're trying to figure out those little sounds that came from their source, and they're wondering who else was there.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'm going to go to the mall for the benefit of graduate art.
During the season of the Schools of the "Education" season, the weekend was the hot start in a difficult line of professional art.
However, it will continue until 23 August until 23 August, neither in the theater nor in the classroom.
Journalists are aware that this 2020 graduate art exhibition has been collected from Central American Institute of Art, and 50/group works from 57 young artists from the Chinese Media University and the University of Saizon American Institute of Art, showing space from 2nd level to 6th level, and the full use of flat displays of indoor lighting boxes, with the highest level of exposure to the art cycle.
In the context of the vaccine, the significance of this exhibition is particularly significant.
The head of the U.S. President of Korea made the statement: "We choose to take space back to the completion of the 'dark' line, and we want more young people to see their own research and understanding of the world, and to increase the art of healing for society and the mind. "
She explained that the works of this exhibition were being collected to the graduates of several universities of art, and chose from among them appropriate commercial space, the form of works from traditional stage drawings, sculptures, to new media devices, interactive painting, VR overview, physical and richness for the last few years.
They expressed their feelings in the words "the first battle of 2020" through the mechanical and manual blending of machines; the "Sound Money" examined "encumbered money" through works created in the Pacific Canals, such as the theme "Creating", "Creation" and "Treaty"; the "Cathral Forest" and the strong" animals often appeared with human beings, from which young artists can see their understanding of the relationship with animals; and the works of fishing are a "black day - gift" for young people who are reminded of growing up, "when a day's work comes, remember that simple and true."
Among the graduates of a small number of relatives, there were some respect from the University of Zingham.
"I came to Beijing on 7 July, when it was a little bit concerned about the vaccine, and three days ago I did a nuclear test with alcohol and testing reports. "
His works are more complex than the structure of the bridge yesterday, and he has to be his close friend.
At the same time, he also had the task of helping fellow students to repair damages.
"The presentation was four and a half in the morning, and then the repairs were made, and the time was tight, and all the work was done with a picture and a little regret."
He hoped that as the vaccine became more stable, he and his fellow students would come to Beijing to see their work.
(Laughs)
On the morning of his 65-year-old, Bosonaro posted a photo on Twitter, where he dressed in sports shoes, did not wear a mask, sat on a table with breakfast, smiles, a hand-clown, and a hand-clamped, one hand-cooked.
He wrote: "Good morning, everybody! The results of the new vaccine test: obesity."
However, Bosonaro did not indicate when this new virus transmission was carried out.
On 5 July, Bosonaro experienced the symptoms of new lung cancer, and on 6 days of exposure to the virus testing, he declared himself infected with new tumors by television on 7 days.
On 14 and 21 days, Bosonaro once again conducted a new vaccine test, resulting in sunlight.
In the period of separation, Bosonaro has demonstrated through social media direct exposure to the use of chlorofluorocarbons, and has shown that chlorofluorocarbons are good for the treatment of new carcinogens, and that after their use, their physical condition is good for the treatment of chlorofluorocarbons, and that the Brazilian medical institution is promoting the use of new chlorofluorocarbons in treating them.
According to Brazil media reports, there are still five ministers of the Cabinet and 10 states who have been infected with new vaccines.
A small plane destroyed in the Swiss Alps, and four of them were all hit by a new network.
On 26 July, a small plane was destroyed on 25 July by Swiss police on 25 July, according to a news report from the EU.
Two Swiss and two Austrians were in the middle of the accident.
Police statement from Wallis, southern Switzerland, reported that a small aircraft destroyed more than 3,000 metres by sea near Mount Albusa, Valai, and confirmed that the rescue personnel had been struck after the accident and that all of the four aircraft had been loaded had been damaged.
The State police reported that the observer called the police on 25 noon at 12.25 p.m. saying he saw a small plane fall from the sky.
A few minutes later, observers again informed the police that the airport had been fired.
The police quickly coordinate fire officers, medical personnel and rescue personnel after arrival of the police and the helicopters on the scene of the accident.
After the rescue personnel arrived at the airport, four of them found it difficult.
The police confirmed that the victims of the accident included two Swiss persons aged 50 and 66 and two Austrians aged 46 and 50.
The police indicated that the police were currently working with the Swiss Transport Safety Investigation Commission to investigate the causes of this accident.
It's raining again in 33 districts.
On 26 July, a new network resurfaced electricity (resultant) reporters from the city water station, and in the past 24 hours, 33 areas were resurfaced, 16 of which were hit by heavy rains.
The heavy rain caused 71 floods in the middle of the river, which had previously been exposed to two flood warnings.
According to the monitoring of the major water stations in the city, most of the areas were inundated with heavy rains, and the site was inundated with heavy rains from 8 to 26 hours.
There was a storm of 33 areas, including the river, of which there was a drought, of which there were 16 districts, of which there was a drought, and the largest rainfall was in the village of San Francisco, 197.5 mm.
There are between 1 and 7 metres of water in the middle of Article 71 of the Canal River, which does not provide supersede protection water.
It is expected that between 8 and 27 hours of 26 hours, the river flows in the vast region may occur at different levels of water flow, and that individual river flows may occur in super-pollution water.
At the same time, the locals will be concerned about the floods that can occur.
The CBA came to the first audience after the rehearsal, and wanted to see the post-season show focusing on these new networks.

According to CBA's official news, the CBA Sunshine region was finally the first ball game to be played after the re-enactment of the competition.
On 31 July, the game included staff members and doctors, teachers, public security personnel, as well as those who contributed more to society during the period of vaccination, which was officially fought after the month of the CBA of the season, and will then be officially re-suspended on ball sales.
Infected by the virus, the CBA will begin the fight on 20 June, within a period of almost five months.
Although there were few views on the 26th afternoon of the scene, it was clear that there was a noise, and some were silent.
There are relatively few football players on the ground, and there is also confusion in the court, and such scenes have not been seen for a long time.
When the season is over, if you want to watch the scene, you have to watch it down there.
The venue for this open-ended ball-eating tournaments is a diamond sports centre (Shutan-Shuang), a full-fledged online marketing of real-equipped tickets, a system of real-time admissions, and a total of 12-year-olds, with a total of 48 hours of nuclear testing.
It's worth 50,000 dollars.
On 26 July, the North Lakes newspaper (New Yorker Linger) announced that Nin-Sao-Sao had made significant contributions to the advance warning of the Sao-Sao-Sao-Sao's disaster monitoring point light, and that he had been awarded $50,000.
At the same time, the Department of Public Affairs has been calling on members of the City Party to learn to perform their duties boldly, to act courageously, to take the initiative, and to be happy with the spirit of dedication.
On 21 July, the village sand dunes of Marduk, in the city of Nusser City, led to the formation of the river Chelsea, a 58-year-old light, the first person to warn of the eruption.
On the afternoon of 17 July, it became clear that the walls of the village were broken open and that they were immediately searched.
He just walked out of the house five-six hundred meters, and saw the village group's streets split up four-five-five-metre-long-long-long-distance road.
Zhang Mington's life guard, first posted a photo of the street to the "Georgeous Disaster Monitors" group.
The location and judgement of the relevant authorities of the village planning in Qaoburg has been examined and judged, and the possibility of swirling is high, and the decision to withdraw the population is being taken immediately.
The sudden early warning that the safety of the 315,1339 populations in the affected area has been won for 36 hours.
This is a major geologic disaster, no one has been killed.
The public is commended for the self-responsive spirit of devotion.
He said, "There's no one to save, that's my responsibility."
Australia University developed new medicines that were intended to treat new camouflages-Newwaves
Research personnel at the University of Monash, Australia, were developing a new drug that helped prevent heart disease and middle wind, and hoped that such drugs could be used to treat cancer caused by new vaccines.
Researchers have found that a clot in the blood panel will accelerate the clotting of the blood before it causes heart disease or in the heart.
Therefore, they develop a drug that can temporarily inhibit blood clotting, thus preventing blood clotting and preventing heart and heart disease.
Researchers have indicated that such drugs can only interfere with the effect of blood clotting in the event of heart disease or heart attack.
Because studies show that similar blood clots are one of the main causes of the deaths of new patients, researchers hope that this medicine will be used in the future for the treatment of such patients.
At present, the drug has had a good effect on animal model experiments, and researchers are ready to perform a follow-up test on human tissues.
Before the day of the study, it was published in the United States of America's journal "Scientific Translation Medicines".
He became the first audience on the occasion of the CBA re-connaissance.
On that day, during the second phase of the CBA, in the 2019-2020 season of the Chinese Football Federation (CBA), medical personnel, teachers, public soldiers, public soldiers, through the official purchasing platform, completed the progress of the relevant process, including the testing of nuclear acid, in the aftermath of the Air Force's battle against the Shirts.
During the course of the show, the viewers had to fill the pockets, to the entrances, and to keep a tight distance of one mile.
When retreating, the audience must keep track of the distance between the front and the middle of the front and the front line.

New York City, New Hampshire, 26 July.
More than 6,000 dollars in five pages, each 48 square meters, round a series of rounds, such as a bank "to the sun," followed by a solar shift, and the solar reactors to the center 200 meters high and powered by electricity.
The event was witnessed on 25 days by journalists at the Hami-Tahumi-Ta-Ta-Ta-Ta-Ta-Ta-Ta-Ta.
"The so-called solar power source is that the sun is recognizable through the focus of the spectrum into the heat formation, and that the heat will be converted into power through traditional power generation technology. "
The Director-General of the Central African Atomic Energy Agency (CCD) reports that its design is similar to the sun used in rural areas in the north-east China.
The power plant opened construction in October 2017, achieved and networked at the end of the last year, with a total of 6600 tons of electricity, and a total of 14,500 scheduled days were installed.
" Compared to traditional solar technology, its greatest advantage is to store the heat that can be collected and powered at night. "
It was said that the 13-hour heat storage system of the project could keep the CDM running continuously and not be affected by light change; and that it could be used to engage rapidly in the grid-up process according to the needs of the Internet.
After the project has been fully built, an annual output of $198 million can be achieved, which can save more than 6 million tons per year, reduce more than 60 tons of carbon dioxide, more than 60 tons of oxygen, about 20 tons of tobacco, more than 15 million tons of carbon dioxide, and provide ongoing clean energy for local sources.
In addition, there is another color "to the Himalayas".
The HKW is over 2,300 litres of solar power stations, and 714 electrical equipment has been built in the same direction as the Sun, keeping the sun and the constellations in 90 degrees.
" We use double-track lighting technology to maintain electricity efficiency, using integrated integrated control, in accordance with the high adjustment direction of the sun. "
The station's long-distance dream is that, under good weather conditions, the more traditional electricity generation technology can increase by about 20 per cent.
In the first half of this year, the electricity station has reached more than 700 million electricity levels and is complemented by local electricity requirements.
The city-based lighting industry is now the largest size of New Zealand and is the most complete model of the lighting-producing industry model area, composed of 38 projects in the lighthouse, with 88,000 KVs.
More than 1 billion electricity outputs have been completed in the first half of the year and 6 per cent increase in the same period in 2019.
Hammy is one of the best areas of China's solar resource conditions.
The average annual total solar radiation is more than 6200 meters per square metre, and the average daily time is approximately 3200 hours per day.
In recent years, the city has developed a great industry of lighting, which is a good "to the Himalayas".
The solar power output of the device is estimated to have increased by more than 14 billion in the first half of the year, compared to about 14 per cent of its growth.
At present, New Zealand and Internet power stations have more than 330 stations, with equipment capacity of over 1,000,000.
It is expected that electricity will reach 150 million litres this year and that the standard will be replaced by more than 600 million tons.
The police are still on the new network.
The following day, on 26 July, the New York Society's electricity (King King King King of China) was concerned about "a university student who lost contact after a journey to Zheglwood".
On 26 days, the City of Germham City of the Hasimonto People ' s Republic of China reported that a student at a University of South China was still in a state of disunition, and that many police were deep in the street of a site and were actively looking for work.
On 10 July 2020, the Security Forces of the City of Germham City, Haiti, were notified that a student of the University of South China who had a Z164 car ride on July 5th from South Beijing to Germ on July 9th, in order to assist in the search.
According to an investigation by the Department of Public Security of the City of Germham, Juju entered the territory of the province of Zheng at 4:00 p.m. on 6 July.
On that day, at 8 hours, the missing persons were allowed to drive from the G109 National Park of G109 to the G109 River Hotel, and at 12 hours to the Kosirison Daja protected station, to return to the railway unit alone, some 7 days from the 15th of the time to the river near the Sushanda Jae Protection Station, until 9 p.m. in the region.

The U.S. has opened the U.S. without asking China to close the new network of truth in the Houston General Hall.
2020-07-26 14:40:44 Source: Central Video Web Author: Slow down, responsible editor: slow down.
The U.S. has revealed the truth to China to close the capital of Houston.
On 24 days, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China informed the United States Embassy that the Central Party had decided to withdraw its authorization for the establishment and operation of the General Council of the United States of America and to make specific requests for the cessation of all operations and activities of the General Assembly as an emergency measure for the United States of America for the immediate closure of its headquarters in Houston.
The Government of the United States is concerned about this behaviour and its political motivation has been challenged by foreign media and scholars.
Why would the Central want to close the General Chamber?
Many external media have said that it is still unclear why the United States has elected the Chinese General Assembly in Houston, but for the purpose of this movement, the external media has expressed itself reluctantly: for the general election.
The United States online television news network (CNN) 23 reports that the United States has requested that the Central Party close its movement in Houston to cause people to question their political motives.
The article states that the reaction of the United States Government to the disaster of the new vaccine has led to a lower rate of civilian support before the elections of President Tranmp.
The White Cross officials claim that the strong strategy for China is to save the support rate of Trenop, while also to transfer the responsibility for the failure of the White Cross virus.
The article considers that the Chinese House of Commons in Houston is a "political drive" chosen by the United States, a very careful " objective, and the US Government elects it "to create a strong attitude and avoid risk of major conflicts".
The British Broadcasting Company (BBC) also believes that the United States economy has been severely affected during the United States elections, while the economy is experiencing serious fighting, and Tranmp is considered to be "the political advantage of China's card".
The current situation is "a towering and relatively competitive struggle", which, to a certain extent, has been driven by the United States Government's approach to internal considerations, which will only increase tension between the United States.
The United States Columbia Broadcasting Company (CBS) reported that Trenop's future was underpinned by the spread of the virus, and that he once again accused China of being vaccinated.
The United States has almost every day a new approach to the so-called "China Exploitation of the United States of America" by Tranmp.
"It is very important for the Houston General Assembly to establish two countries. "
The United States commented that the United States requested China to close its headquarters in Houston to increase the tension between the world's two largest economies.
In addition to the diplomatic effects of the Chinese headquarters in Houston, China citizens in South America face difficulties in accessing consular services, and US citizens seeking visas and other services face similar difficulties.
One business group in Houston regretted the request by the United States to close China to the Houston General Assembly that the General Assembly had played an important role in the establishment of trade, investment and cultural links in two countries.
The U.S. believes that this reflects the importance of China's economy.
The U.S. Foreign Policy Magazine website believes that the American movement is part of a series of challenging initiatives that will only undermine American relations.
Since the establishment of a comprehensive diplomatic relationship between the two countries of the United States of America in 1979, it has been said that the expert on East Asia of the Chicuburgins University of the United States has no intention of referring any movement to this action aimed at the United States headquarters in Houston, China.
Hong Kong reports that the American movement has been unprecedented in the more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries of Central America.
The analysts believe that this movement could cause lasting damage.
The Chinese General Hall in Houston was built in 1979, the first General Assembly in China, which was established in the United States.
At present, China has a Embassy and five General Chambers in the United States.

Speaker in the English Chamber: The Chinese Government is a strong supporter of network security - new network
On 26 July, on the Chinese Embassy website in England, 25 July, Chinese spokesman for the British Embassy asked the relevant network responders about the attack on the network.
The speaker stressed that the Government of China was a firm defender of network security and consistently opposed and combated any form of network attacks and network crimes.
Journalists have questioned: According to the media, the blackout organizations related to China have interfered with a British company's network system, launched attacks on US technology companies with patented data, and entered the EU's government network.
The speakers indicated that the Government of China was a firm defender of network security and consistently opposed and combated any form of network attacks and network crimes.
The relatively strong, complex, diverseness of the network, and the diversity of actors should provide sufficient evidence in the case of investigations and defining network events.
The speaker said that a series of events, such as the previous “Special gate”, proved that the United States has been engaged in a secret operation of the largest global network.
Peace and stability in the space of the network are in the common interest of all States.
The speaker pointed out that China's achievements in technology innovation were not stolen, not stolen, but made it hard to fight through self-reliance.
In 2019 China submitted approximately 5.9 million patent applications by means of the "Central Cooperation Treaty" (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6 per cent, becoming the largest country in the submission of an international patent application.
China has become the capital of the right to innovation and intellectual property.
In the first half of the first year, the Bank of the People ' s Bank of China revealed that new loans for agriculture and small enterprises increased throughout the year by more than 2019.

Most areas of the Uruwood-free carbon testing have been essentially completed, and a second-line test in high-risk areas is being conducted.
On 26 July, a new network of Urumqi (responsible journalist and journalist) of Urumqi City Health Commissioner for Health announced on 26 July that most areas of the work of Urumqi's free-bodies have been essentially completed.
In the State Department's Group of Experts and Self-Government, Urumamizi experts are being further assessed on the development of vaccines based on the results of a nuclear test and achievable medical research.
The Public Information Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights was convened on 26 days at the Public Information Office in Wi-Fi, New Zealand.
According to him, from 0 to 24 July, the city of Urumamizi has added 22 cases of new lung cancer (5 of which were transformed by non-communicable infections), 38 cases of new cases of non-communicable infections.
As at 2430 hours on 25 July, there were 135 cases in the city of Urumuz, 147 cases of non-communicable infections.
25 days of new disease-free infections are also mainly identified through free-of-occupancy testing throughout the city.
On 26 days, the Director of the Urumuz City Health Commission stated that most areas of the work of the Urumqi-wide free-carbon testing have been essentially completed.
He also said that from experience in other parts of the country, there were many factors that affected the results of the testing, such as the flexibility of the test product, the time of infection and the time of the test personnel, the time of exposure of the test personnel, the time of exposure to materials, the level of professional activity of the test personnel (which was likely to lead to the lack of the indication), and the level of performance of the test personnel.
For various reasons, the carbon testing also results in false results.
The so-called falseness is that the investigators are indeed infected, but the results of the test are serious.
In addition, it is usually necessary to avoid two nuclear tests of acidity for cases of infectious diseases that appear to have been in close contact with people who are suspected of being infected with the disease.
If there is a fever and respiratory disease, there is a possibility that an acid test may be false, it is also necessary to avoid two nuclear tests.
In view of the above, for the physical health of all populations in the city, Urumuzi has since begun to conduct a double-free nuclear test on mountain areas, such as the Shavabak region, and the "exploration of remains" .
It is reported that the mountain range, Shavabak district, is a high-risk area.
"Science" is a hot one, and the international film on the sea goes through unusual industrial confidence -- a new network.
2020-07-26 06:52:39 Source: Text-to-Speech Reporter: king-in-Office Editor: King-in-Office
It's so hot on the bottom of the line that the international film on the sea goes through an unusual industry trust.
The report (the Prime Journal) opened yesterday at the twenty-third International Film Festival, which was held in the context of strict anti-dumping measures, in 2020, with a forum for industrial topography, "full escape and dreaming of new eras", which opened the twenty-third International Film Festival.
As the first international film, which has been held since the continued proliferation of global vaccines and the normalization of our country's immune system, this year's International Film Festival is significant.
On the basis of the work on the prevention of the normalization of vaccines, the International Film Festival on the Sea is an expression of faith and more determined declaration — our conviction that the fight against vaccines is not changed, the conviction of the people's Day is not changed, the global video creation centre is built, and the conviction of the "Citizen Culture" signs remain unchanged.
Each year the International Film Festival of the Upper Seas is re-launched and started in the process of continuous innovation and entry into the atmosphere.
It is therefore necessary to take every step in order to meet the people ' s spiritual services and to reflect the high quality development services of the industry.
More like this year.
In order to address the unfavourable vulnerability control situation, the International Film Festival of the Sea, on the one hand, focused on the implementation of vaccine control measures; on the other, it was the collective wisdom to create China's films and to meet the vision, such as video-visual vision needs, to open up online and multi-platform activities.

The Forum's activities are controlled by 50 people, each video range, and the peak rate is 30 per cent severe.
As held by the Committee on Film Festivals, in any case, "the safety and health of the peoples at first" is a major one.
It's very simple under the line, and it's very hot in the dark.
In order to complete the concept of "the people of the city, the cities of the people as a people" as a public celebration of the people, this year's International Film Festival is designed to be transformed and to be used in the line with the "Georgian" exhibition, the "Georgian" class, and to meet the diverse needs of the audience.
On the opening day, the official partners at the Film Festival were filming and filming hundreds of films on the east and west sides, making a lot of "with a "video" on the way back to the film.
In the evening, the Golden Open Forum with Master Jakob's team was also on the central video screen, studied with strong countries, combined with several platforms, such as App, and helped the public to focus on China's latest trends.
In the opening forum yesterday, members of the Central Radio Television General Group, the Vice-President made a statement and announced the opening of this film, the Committee of the Regions, the announcement of the Minister's statement, the Vice-Minister of the Ministry.
Vaccinating expert Fuchi: Watching the development of vaccines for early 2021
A video conference hosted by the International Leader Foundation, which was hosted on 25 February, stated above.
He reminded us that it is not yet clear how the new vaccines will develop in winter and what the final impact of the vaccine will be," and that the only way to end all of this is to choose each of us as a part of the solution to the problem."
According to the U.S. University of Johns Hopkins, as at 2125 hours, the new vaccine cases have reached 417,6 million and 14,6 million people have died.
Forgi said that some regions of the United States are currently struggling with anti-combatant vaccines.
While there are differences in land-use conditions, there is a need for targeted response programmes, but the diversity of anti-personnel strategies does not mean that there is no close link between regions.
Vaccinations in one region will eventually affect other areas.
"Now is not the time for self-fulfilling," Foch said, "our work has not been completed, we have to intensify our efforts, and we must remain alert to the uncertainty of the future."
U.S. medical expert, the founder of the "Certain Medical Law" on AIDS, noted that the new vaccines in the United States have not yet reached their peak.
"Every one of us must do our utmost to reduce the spread of this virus."
It is a great call for the public to make time for scientists to develop new vaccines and vaccines through their actual actions.
The International Leader Foundation is a non-profit organization that seeks to promote international exchange activities in the United States and the Asia Pacific, which is committed to promoting the status of the United States Pacific and to developing international youth leaders.
On that day, the Minister for Transport of the United States of America, the Federal Parliamentary Secretary of the United States of America and the President-in-Office of the International Federation of Leaders, took part in the meeting.
They particularly respect Asian medical workers and volunteers who are at the same level and call on the United States public to continue to adhere to the prevention guidelines, such as "social distance" and to suppress the spread of infection.
In addition, there are no new cases of infectious diseases where there are no new vaccines.
The news was published on 25 July by the New York Society and 25 July (the Journalist Conspiracy Forces, Master of the City) on 25 July, and from 15 to 14 July, there was no new cases of local lung cancer, and 24 cases of unsympathetic infections, and no new cases were raised.
From 22 to 25 July, 12 cases of local infectious diseases were reported throughout the city and were collected at the 6th People ' s Hospital in the city.
The Deputy Director-General of the City Health Committee of the United States indicated that, depending on the circumstances of the city, the organization of medical personnel at the three-level hospital in the streets of the city was organized into the community, to launch more than 600 sampling points in the main areas of the continent, the labour force, the coast along the coast, and the central part of the Kimp New Area, and to promote the total number of people's research on nuclear acids, and that nearly 2,000 medical personnel were conducting nuclear testing each day.
As at 1400 hours on 25 July, 21,000 others were assembled throughout the city.
In the current 12 cases, 10 cases of treatment in the United States were limited to staff of the Great Lakes region of the Pacific; in the 54 cases, 46 cases were the employees of the company and their relatives; in all cases, the proportion of business workers and their relatives was 85 per cent.
In the course of the trials, the majority of the cities decided to strengthen strict control over all staff members of the Great Lakes bound by the World Ocean Strip, as well as those of close contact, and to carry out a 14-day central medical observation, at least two nuclear tests.
At the same time, the United States decided to further expand the implementation of the range of central medical observers, to close contact with those who are exposed to the sun (e.g. disease and non-sympathetic infections), and to conduct a 14-day concentration of medical surveillance, at least 2 times as much as those who are close to the contact person.
The main airport, which has been notified every 25 days at the railway station, that the operation of the entire city personnel is not necessary to be unconnected and must be carried out in principle and must be accompanied by 7-day nuclear test evidence; that the entire city is scheduled to be re-suspended from 12 hours to 12 days.
Brazil's study showed that new vaccines are not effective for treating cancer-new networks.
In recent days, a study in Brazil has shown that new cancer cancer patients are not effective.
The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Baba's researchers divided 667 patients into three groups of 55 hospitals throughout the country and conducted inter-beding tests, mainly for treatment with chlorofluorocarbons or with other anti-acetic acids, and analysed whether it would help to improve the incidence of New Carcinoma and Medieval Patients.
The results show that chlorofluorocarbons do not only have treatment effects, but may cause harmful side effects to the body.
This study has been completed jointly by the Brazilian Institute of Rehabilitation (BCRI) and the Brazilian Rehabilitation Institute (BRI) (BRICNET) Hospital (HCor), the Syrian Hospital Sírio-Libanês (HC) and the Brazilian Rehabilitation Research Network (BRICNET).
At the local time of 25 days, President Bosonaro of Brazil announced the results of the fourth nuclear test through the Social Platform.
In the course of the infection, Bosonaro has continued to use chlorofluorocarbons and has been actively expanding several times.

The US Trade Representative, the meeting in August.
On 25 August, Hong Kong quoted an unknown informant as head of the Trade Group of China, the Deputy Prime Minister of the State Department, co-chaired with the US team, who was expected to hold a formal meeting on behalf of the Red Sea in August to assess the implementation of the first trade agreement between the parties in the United States.
It is reported that although China has significantly increased the number of United States agricultural products in the past few months, there remains a gap in the number of commitments made in the trade agreements due to factors such as the new vaccine.
The analyst said that recent closures in the United States, as well as other disputes, could undermine any progress made by the parties in trade.
The first phase of the trade agreement in Central America entered into force one month after the signature of 15 January, in which it provided for a high-level trade framework group, which should meet every half year.
It will be a "an important turning point" to enable both parties to assess the progress of the agreement.
However, he also said that if tension in the United States led to little agreement at this time, both parties might agree to meet once a year in the Trade Agreement with the telephone meeting on 8 May.
Since this year, the Central American relations have rapidly deteriorated, and disputes between the parties include a series of issues such as the origin of new vaccines, trade, Hong Kong, New Zealand, the South Sea and the ideology.
President Tranpe of the United States, although at the beginning of the year, had challenged his achievements in the first phase of the agreement, but had recently changed his attitude.
He said at a press conference on 23 days in the White House that, although China had recently purchased a record of the United States crop cuts recently, it also bought a lot of beans, "but this trade agreement now meant to me that it was not as early as it was."
An anonymous Beijing Government consultant also believes that, due to poor relations between the United States and the possibility of a new round of trade negotiations, "the issue of trade has been divided in the Americas".
He explained, however, that China ' s 23-day trade-related unit still had a series of issues to discuss, including how to increase imports from the United States, "we have been trying to buy, so any additional procurement would be difficult."
The Vice-President of the National Trade Commission of the United States of America, Xiao Xiao, said that the first phase of the agreement was more important than ever, and that China had made progress this year to further open the US financial market.
The Independent Research Company analyst Plenum said: "Talk is not better than talking, although it may only be done as an example."

People's daily commentators: Centrally organize their own affairs and create new priorities for the future — even though learning to follow up with the PPA is a major talk at a business conference -- Newwa.
25 July New York Society Beijing People's Daily Commentary article on 26 July: Centrally organizes their own affairs to create new priorities for future development
At present, global vaccinations and the world economy are still very complex, and our development has not faced the challenges ahead.
Maintaining strategic strength, strengthening confidence, and putting the force to work for its own good is the key to facing various risks.
In a recent meeting of business owners, the Deputy Director-General recalled that, in the current protectionist rise, the world economy is undermining, and in the external environment of the global market, we need to focus our efforts on our own things, to make full use of the country's super-large market advantages, to gradually form the topic of new, inter-national, inter-national, inter-national developmental sectors, to increase the modern level of industrial supply chains, to significantly boost technological innovation, to accelerate key core technology attacks and to develop new advantages for the future.
The men of understanding, the men of wisdom, the men of understanding,
In an external environment where economic globalization is deeply rooted in development, markets and resources have played an important role in my country's rapid development.
Now, the world that has been affected by the epidemic is undergoing a profound change, facing more instability, economic globalization is experiencing reverses and back-up.
A better time to prepare and prepare for the change in the external environment, to promote the collapse of our country ' s economy, to keep pace with it, and to keep pace with it. One of the most important aspects is to expand and meet domestic needs as a strategic basis for development, to take full advantage of its own advantage, through the prosperity of the country ' s domestic economy, and to increase the global economic growth of our country.
We need to be fully aware that the construction of a complete system of needs is linked to long-term development and long-term security in my country.
The central trial situation of the party clearly presents a strong implementation of the internal needs strategy, which is the need to address the impact of the epidemic, the need to maintain the long-term development of our country ' s economy and the need to meet the needs of the people for a better life that is growing.
The advantages of the economy of the great country are internally circular.
My country has the most comprehensive, the largest industrial system, the strong production capacity, the improved packaging capacity, the availability of more than 10 million market subjects and more than 17 million people with higher education or a variety of professional skills, as well as the high-scale market needs of more than 14 million people, including income groups, are in the new type of industrialization, information, urbanization, the rapid development of agriculture, the potential for investment.
Public institutions are the subject of a multi-ethnic common development, a multi-ethnic economy, a multi-stakeholder distribution system, and a multi-stakeholder economic system, such as the socio-economic system of the socialist market economy, which has the potential to stimulate the activity, release and development of the social productivity of different markets, and to promote efficiency and equitable opportunities, and to continue to achieve common wealth.
We need prison to expand this strategic base within which we need to expand, to produce, distribute, to build on the quality cycle of the domestic markets, to provide a clear strategic direction for structural reforms, to promote overall supply and overall demand balance at a higher level.
In order to speed up the construction of the entire internal system, to promote technological innovation and innovation in other aspects, to accelerate the development of the digital economy, smart manufacturing, life-health and new materials, to create a more new growth point, and to make it a topical and progressive development platform that promotes inter-national bilateral development.
Open it up to make progress, shut it down.
The Deputy Secretary-General of Peace has repeatedly stressed that the open door of China will not be closed, but will only expand.
It is not a matter of shutting down the door to the functioning of the internal circle, but of making the internal market and international markets more interconnected and better to use two domestic markets, two resources, and more sustainable development.
At the same time, the expansion of internal needs and the expansion of openness is not contradictory, and the internal circle is increasingly flexible, more favourable to the construction of the Open-New System, and more favourable to the creation of an international cooperation and new competitive advantage.
While international protectionism is growing now, we need to be on the right side of history, to continue to deepen reform, to expand open cooperation in the field of science and technology, to promote the construction of an open world economy, and to promote the building of a human life-saving community.
The Chinese people's history has suffered many hardships, but they have never been oppressed, but they have been courageous, constantly growing in suffering and resulting from suffering.
On the way forward, there is strong central leadership of the Central Party of the United Nations as a core party, a significant advantage of China's special socialist system, a strong mobilization capacity and a generous integrated strength, a united struggle for the peoples of the entire country of the armed forces, and we must be able to overcome all the obstacles to maintain our country's economic well-being development, to build a fully healthy society, and to successfully start the new process of fully building socialism in modernized countries!
The rest of the money's been saved from "90" instead of "repetition"?
As soon as the balance is earned, "90" has not only escaped the balance, but started "repetition" saving money?
In the first half of the first year, the Chinese New Economics Institute, which paid a joint " balance sheet of 90 dollars " (2020) published before the baby, showed that "90" was more popular in the first half of the year: the amount of human money was almost four times the growth in 2019.
Interestingly, "90" is more likely to start from a "little" coin, with six percent of the average amount of each coin under 20 dollars...
It's also used to be a "90-day" bread habit.
The data show that among the remaining 7 billion users, 1.34 million users are "after 90".
China has 174 billion "after 90", that is, about three out of every four "90" in the country.
At present, the annual rate of income from the 7-day fund, such as the balance of assets, is above 2 per cent from the start of the year and is below about 1.5 per cent.
Even so, it doesn't affect the pace of the '90s' after.
In the context of the increase in the value of the balance sheet, a number of young people who are accustomed to using the balance sheet are also referred to as "civils".
The payment of baby data shows that as of 13 July, nearly one month of the payment of the new "Kids" on the baby is more than 1 times the growth, and more and more young people are achieving the "increasing" phase of the child's pay.
Some analysts believe that funding is a significant reason for the clear decline in the amount of the money fund in June from the balance of assets in the stock market.
The report also shows that “90” women are more prone to gambling than men to earn, with an average of two times higher than men; 6 of the users with funds on the pay-up platform are men, and women and men tend to choose a more sound and sound financial approach.
After saving the money, what's the plan after "90"?
The payment of precious data shows that "90" has a habit of making money for the target, making travel the most of the users of the money target.
Infected, many of the '90' coins were prepared for post-mortem travel; the cinema was restored and new ways were provided for the transfer of money from the mines to consumption.
I'm going to put a bunch of rounds up on the hill of Hong Kong.
In recent times, our South has been affected by continuous rainfall, which has been very severe in the fight against floods, resulting in the destruction of 26 provinces (areas, towns, villages, towns, villages, villages, and villages in the state, rivers, lakes, and lakes.

The party's high-ranking flag is a symbol of loyalty and a call to the mission.
In front of the disaster, one party organization was a fighter, and one party member was a flag fighter.
On the front line of the protest, the various-level organizations of the parties, the broad party team, represented a high level of loyalty to the party, listened to the central call from the party, "look at my" action, "come with me," the courage of "I'm ahead" and build a bridge that is unstoppable and stands up for an impenetrable Chinese wall.
The band's high-ranking flag on the hill of Hong Kong is the seat's fortress, and it's the corner of the rupture.
In the face of the tsunami disaster, at all levels of the organizations' rapid action to blow up the tsunami's "flashing" flag on the main waves of the tsunami, the Department of the Wider Party, the people's leaders remain in the position of the tsunami, using the will and action of the "Wonderless and Eternal Soldier" flag as the most reassuring and most reliable obstacle of the population in the region.
The Red Party's campaign is a high-ranking campaign against Hong Kong, free of charge and responsibility.
In times of crisis, the Red Cross is a member of the Party who, at the time of serious threats to the lives of the people, is a member of the Party, a small minority of the people's soldiers, taking into account everyone, without dedication, and being afraid to fight against the threat of a flood, as a full-fledged test capacity, as an air force, a master war, and to join the army, which is such a private dedication and a busy spirit, and which greatly encourages the faith and determination of the people of the region to fight in the disaster and combines strong spiritual strength to fight the fight against the threat of flood.
"Peoples, lives and lives" have been tested at the same time and more at critical times.
On the sidewalks, the broad party gangs and the people's team will always be able to see the Red Party flag, fight the body, encourage the voice, increase the singing of the flag with the waterless ballasts, and raise the flag on the side of the mountain!

France Biggest Space Military Introduction - Newwave Network
The French Minister of Defence, Florence Pali, said on 24 days that France would add billions of european defence budgets and develop space military forces to prevent the " undesirable movement of other States that might be carried out in outer space " .
During the period from 2019 to 2025, Paris announced that the expenditure budget for the French space project would be increased from the previous budget of EUR 36 billion (about $42 billion) to EUR 43 billion ($500 million).
In accordance with the French Parliament's "Military Planning Act 2019-2025 of 2018", France is expected to update existing observation satellites and telecommunications satellites and launch 3-channel radio-stations satellites to increase the modern level of space surveillance of Rada.
Last July, French President Emmanuel McKron announced that the French Air Force would establish the Department of Military Command and the Air and Space Force within France.
Pali said that she would formally declare the establishment of this space force later on when she visited a military school in the province of Prunas.
This space force belongs to the Air Force, which was prepared up to 500 people prior to 2025.
She said: "It was once thought that space services were in the common interest in science, that the idea was never repeated, now that space was a place for States to challenge global sovereignty. "
Pali reiterates the pre-Makron appearance that the law did not intend to launch an arms race.
"We're not at a arms race, but I have the responsibility to make sure that we're at risk."
Pali recalls the monitoring of military satellites shared by France and Italy in 2017.
She says, "The theft of money" is a Russian satellite.
Russia denied that statement.
Paris says France will have a small patrol satellite that will be able to detect and block "the unfriendly movement behind the blacks".

The report states that the shared housing market has been back in the new network since March.
The National Information Centre, which was published earlier by the National Centre for Economic Research, "Communication of Housing Development in China 2020" (hereinafter referred to as "the Report"), showed that there was an outbreak of infectious diseases, five months before 2020, and my country's share of market transactions were below 72.1 per cent.
However, the shared housing market began to recover, market transactions, units and recipients gradually recovered.
"Report" shows that the share of the share of the housing market has significantly decreased, on the one hand, due to a significant decrease in the demand for housing under vaccination control, a rapid decrease in the number of units, a total of 65 per cent in the previous five months' schedules, and a decrease in the number of recipients, 63 per cent in the number of people who are required; on the other hand, the lack of demand has led to a clearer decrease in the average night prices, and a decrease of 16 per cent in the average night price in the previous five months.
However, in March, in May, market exchange rates increased by 78 per cent, 199 per cent, 35 per cent; scheduled units increased by 141 per cent, 152 per cent; recipients increased by 81 per cent, 112 per cent and 28 per cent respectively.
"Report" notes that participation in housing sector development is long-term, but there are still a number of uncertainties in recent years.
In this regard, the Deputy Director of the National Information Centre for Economic Research, the National Centre for Economic Research, expressed the need for greater policy-building in the "Working Journal" journalists, to share housing development, to further strengthen policies and to focus on the development of better business environments, and to increase policy guidance and sustainability in many areas, such as the promotion of consumer needs, the provision of innovative housing services, and strengthening cooperation between Governments and platforms.

New Internet in the highest-level railway traffic in the three-storey district
2020-07-26 17:34:48 Source: Chinese news network author: China Seabed Editor: China Seabed
Map for a small three-way construction site.
It's all in the middle. It's for the company.
On July 26th, a new network re-enacted the 26th newspaper Cord, a Chinese railway company, and a total of approximately 189,000 high-powered three-wheeled railways, were informed.
It is understood that the triangular tunnels are not only the longest high-speed tunnels in the area of the three-storey area, but also in the projects currently being built in the country, and that the highest-speed two-way tunnels of 350 km/h are designed at a speed of 350 km/h.
Thousands of high-powered railways in the south of the River, north of Lake Lake, re-surfaced in the cities of the province of Guangdong, in the north-west of China, and in the south-east of the state, in the south-west of Vanuatu, are an important part of our country's "eight-eight-six high-speed" railways and call tunnels.
It's a full line of 26-day high-powered triangular tunnels.
I'm going to take a picture of the scene.
Thousands of high-powered railways ranged from the town of Huang, the town of Guangdong, to the mountains of South-West, the city of South-West, the town of Zong-West, and the town of Jong-Kun-Wiong, which is about 818 km long. The new route is measured at a speed of 350 km/h and about 184 km in the country.
Among them was the operation of the bridge to Zhao-Shuang, which was launched on 1 December 2019, and the reconnaissance was increasing.
The 26-year-long triangular tunnel is a thousands of high-level full-line control project, located at the refurbishment of city halls and mountain ranges, a total of approximately 18.9% and a maximum depth of 890 metres.
The plant began its construction in February 2017, and the whole line was transferred on 26 July 2020.
According to a brief presentation by the Royal Government of the Royal Government of Highway Design, the design team of the design designers of China's Mechanical Bicycle Engineering Group, which is very complex in the location of the geologic conditions of the small triangular tunnels, faced with the dangers of rock, dust water, deep-sea change, high-risk tunnels, high-risk design and construction difficulties.
"In the construction of the project, we have adopted a spatial survey law, a super-geographical forecast, such as a survey of objects and a super-divine survey, and a special design program for all the other 30 types of holes. If the design is designed to build 24-metre bridge, cross the tunnels to a length of 10 metres, and a large hole of 55-metres deep, and avoid the decline of tunnels, the Royal Army says.
According to the Inter-Constructor's Railway Office, when the tunnel was built, the pipeline was guided by a combination of tunnels, by the construction of wells, the flow of wells, the strengthening of tunnel structures and the construction of water treatment stations, and by ensuring that the project was orderly, and the destruction of the water supply of small-scale water for small-scale areas, and the success of the water supply was to overcome the adverse conditions such as deep-sea change of 7 km, with a maximum volume of water per day reaching 15.7 million cubic metres of multi-coding water.
Following the construction of thousands of high-level railways, it will become our central route to the South-West Region, and in the North, in the North, the new fast-speed transport corridors, the improvement of road capacity and quality in the north-west region, the improvement of the regional network, the rapid development of road resources and urbanization processes, the promotion of regional coordination and the promotion of the implementation of the Western development strategy.
The expert said that, through the census of the United States population, the collection of immigration information was intended for the distribution of residences to the House of Commons.
Several civil rights organizations and several United States cities and villages accused the Government of the United States of attempting to exclude uncertified migrants from the U.S. census were unconstitutional and unconstitutional.
The census of the United States population will decide to allocate the seat of the United States Parliamentary Assembly.
The U.S. Free Alliance of Civil Rights enforces counsel Sarah Blanc's voice to the United States, "It's impossible to do so. "
She then said that Tranmp asked for the identification of the citizen who accepted the census in the census and that " it was not reliable. "
Another Citizen-Free Organization filed proceedings on Thursday, in order to challenge the Tranmp's administrative order.
In New Jersey, several cities in Georgia joined in the proceedings.
Aleton County, Virginia, joined the proceedings on Friday.
The President of the Management Board of the Aleton City said, "The Constitution of the United States requires that our people be properly cleaned every 10 years, and we must be able to do so directly to everyone living in Ahlton City, so that such an illegal attempt to intimidate the fugitives and restrict the number of immigrant communities."
Other organizations and individuals praised President Tranmp's administrative order.
Marshall, Minister of Justice of Alabama, says that the administrative order is a victory for the state.
He said, "When the seats of the National Assembly Hall and the electoral mission are allocated to each state, the number of inhabitants living in each state, and the number of persons residing legally. "
Last year, the Supreme Court of the United States prevented the Trenup Administration from incorporating civil identity issues into the 2020 census.
President Tranp signed an administrative order earlier this week to direct the Minister of Commerce of the U.S. Population Census to submit data on uncertified population censuses in order to exclude these uncertified populations from the population census in each country, thus determining that each state would be either to increase or reduce or maintain the seat of parliamentarians.
Every 10 years, the United States has to relocate its seats according to population change.
Reinforced 33 regional rainforests, local response to emergency response at the IV level -- a new network.
Newspapers from the Department of Anti-Fraud Protection in Rehabilitation, New York, resurfaced on 26 July (New York City) and discovered that, on 25 July, there was a new wave of heavy rains, 33 of the region's rain and 4 of the middle of the river was due to a flood of super-protection water, and the local response to the emergency level was launched.

Under heavy rain, the tsunamis, the tsunamis, the tsunamis, the volcanic eruptions, the floods in the eastern part of the country, and the floods in the middle of the Great Lakes River, which are still on the rise.
The heavy rains also led to the presence of mountain skiing in six villages in the rural areas of the Solomon Islands, the blockage of the village road, the flow into the U.S. River along the river, the formation of the river into Sire Lake, and the rapid movement of the local community.
In response to this storm, the Ministry of Urban Anti-Fraud Defence Commands issued early warning information at the riverbed III on 13 December and launched emergency response to the Gulf River II level, demanding the strengthening of monitoring levels in the areas and units concerned, timely mobilization of emergency relief teams and materials, and deployment of the threat to the population of the region.
As a matter of fact, promotion of industrial project construction-focused chapter- South Lake Journal-Water online
The south of the frozen lake, warm.
The construction of the industrial project throughout the province, which led to the release of the scene momos, covered three days' coolness, "with industry more efficient, with the clear direction of the project about hero".
The development of the South of Lakes is always based on projects and agriculture.
Faced with a very unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the Central Party of the Middle East as a core party, the entire province has held a stand-alone game, trying to fight the vaccines, to prevent the two major strains and to implement the industrial project as a "first-hand card" for the implementation of "Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six."
From one quarter of GDP to 1.9%, from the first half of the year to the first half, from 1.3% to growth, from difficulties in the period, great efforts, not to talk.
In this valuable achievement list, industrial projects are being built to accelerate the economic recovery of South Lakes, and development is a key contribution to stability.
It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.
Construction of industrial projects in order to move to the General Assembly, which is better than the situation, the situation, the situation, and the change of knowledge, demand and change.
In the complex context of the current international situation, with the exception of the thousands of hard-to-work entrepreneurs, it is also necessary to be silent to study the new features of the current situation, to improve regulatory and scientific accuracy, to better integrate into the country ' s global environment, and to promote the new system of development that promotes inter-national bilateral development.
More emphasis is placed on increasing the infrastructure capacity of the industry.
In the first half of the year, I have not only had a large number of innovative high-level investment projects broken down in land, and I hope that more traditional preference industries will be able to digitalize, smartened, greener industrial transitions, and fall like flying.
The third science park project, which was designed for the development of the existing production line and the creation of high-pressure power plants in the South of Lake Lakes, was designed for the intelligent transformation of the new manufacturing plant, the construction of the modern plant, and the production of the "old plant" photographs ... around the country's major strategy and "two new strains", aimed at strengthening the quality industry, active development of new innovative industries, and increasing the overall development of technology innovation and national production alternatives, to continue to build on the basic conditions and to build on the transition.
More focused on the development of new economic developments.
As with its emerging new vaccines, they have led to a decline in the economy, boosting the potential of the digital economy, providing new mechanisms for industrial change: in the first half of the year, my department's computer and office equipment manufacturing industry grew by 12.6 per cent, the distribution of retail sales to the network of enterprises over the growth of 32.2 per cent, and the cost of food business networks increased by 35.6 per cent compared to growth.
In crisis-centred new plants, new agencies are being launched, actively promoting digital industrialization, industrial digitization, leading to the economic integration of digital economies and entities.
More attention is focused on optimisation and stabilization of industrial links.
The engineering machinery is the leading army of the South-South industry, but two thirds of the companies in the county still have space and potential in the compound.
The strengthening of industrial links will not only have to keep the main business on track but also achieve a technological breakdown in the key sectors of the industry; it will also require potential development in various areas to stimulate the "link" reaction to the "links" and promote the development of the relevant components industry collaboration, and speed up self-control and safe industrial links.

A thorough study of the industry, the development industry, the development industry, the pursuit of a truly improved business environment will be able to win more investors' interest.
The forward wind is erratic, but windfalls have become industrial projects in the entire province, leading to high-quality development.
At this critical time, it is important to study carefully and carefully follow the key guidance set by the Secretary-General to recommend the spirit of self-determination to effectively address external uncertainty, to promote industrial projects, to build together heat, to freeze water, to ensure "135" and to fully build a healthy society.

As an artist, contact is very important to me.
I tried to explain through my art works that humans are not separate by nature, but everything is interconnected.
About 10 years ago, I first went to South Asia, and I saw the ice mountain.
I'm afraid.
My heart is moving fast, my head is shaking, trying to understand what this is all about in front of me.
It's just a strange flower that's covered in another snowflower, and it's formed once a year.
The shape of the ice is when they break out of the ice or break out from the ice.
Every ice mountain has its own unique characteristics.
They have a clear way of dealing with the environment around them and their circumstances.
Some ice-creams refuse the agreement and some ice-creams can't be endured when they're in severe tension.
When you see the ice mountains, it's easy to think that they're all lonely, they're independent, unique, more like our human beings at times.
But the reality is far more than that.
With the melting of ice, I breathe into its old taste.
With the melting of ice, it released the dust of mineral matter, and they fed everything.
I'm going to take these ice-creams, and it's like I'm filming the pictures of my ancestors, knowing that at the time of these different times, the ice-creams exist in that way, but they won't exist again.
It's not death, it's not an end, it's a continuation of the path to the immortality of life.
I took a picture of the ice mountain, some of it was very young -- thousands of years old.
Some ice, over a thousand years.
The last picture I'd like to show to everyone is an ice mountain I took at Kekertsusiak Island, Greenland.
It's a very difficult opportunity for everyone to actually see a snowflake.
So that's what the picture shows.
You can see a boat on the left.
It's a 15-foot boat.
I want you to be aware of the shape of the ice, the shape of it on the surface of the water.
Here you see it's going down, moving the boat to the other side, a man standing there.
It's a medium-sized Greenland ice mountain.
It's about 120 meters high, or 40 meters high.
This video is real time.
(Music) Like this ice mountain, they show everyone the different aspects of their personality.
Thank you.

It has been reported that this direct transport activity has been used by the Beijing Chamber of Commerce network, fast hand-holding, domestically known retail companies such as Bombay, direct broadcasting, power stations, and the exchange of "enterprises+farm farmers" and, on the line, continuously distributed "prices" to consumers, which are expected to generate almost $528 million a year.
In this regard, the Prime Minister of the Beijing Festival Company, Xena, said that "it is worth extending the fame of the bluefin tuna products, attracting more consumers to the knowledge that they like without adding natural bee products to the crop harvest."

"The economic, ecological and social benefits created by honey are far greater than the value of bees' own products, the production of bees in human health, agricultural production, the cultivation of abundant and ecological protection, and there has always been little knowledge of this. "
I'm sorry, but I don't know what to say.
And now, the number of farmers is increasing, and in addition to regular farmers outside the year, there are still many difficult actions for poor farmers to choose as a co-operating company.
" The State has financial support, and we contact technical personnel with guidance, the lack of knowledge and judgement on the market environment, and also the need to open the way for governments, businesses and industry associations to help and coordinate. "
I'm sorry.
"We hope that everyone will be more concerned about helping the feeding group in the future, "Hunna shows that our pig products will also be carefully selected and controlled in accordance with national standards, guaranteeing quality, while helping farmers to protect the rights of consumers. "

From 25 days to 25 days, the weather and water sectors have been monitored, the global rain in the Middle East and the North-East region has been rescinded with heavy rain, some of the region's rain, and the situation is very severe.
The Piston River station will be located at the highest water level on 26 nights, and the highest water will be close to the warning water station.
In order to ensure the safety of navigation, the maritime sector has decided to implement temporary traffic control over the long-range rock surface to the area of radio waves.
After re-enforcement of urban defence and climate, water, water and emergency services, and units of emergency trade unions, the Department of Urban Prevention decided to publish warning information at river I level II and to launch emergency response response at level IV.
The Department of Urban Prevention calls for increased attention to rainwater conditions, in particular drought, floods, floods, tsunamis, tsunamis, tsunamis, and other relevant urban defence units, especially in the long run, floods, hurricanes, changes in soil water, advance analysis, early warning testing, strengthening of monitoring compliance, determined to disseminating the population of the region ' s threat, timely mobilization of emergency relief teams and materials, rapid disaster management (risk) conditions, and prevent the deaths of the dead populations from occurring.
The Minister of the Veterans Embassy of Viet Nam, along with representatives of the People's Republic of Viet Nam, participated in the priestly ceremony at the Association of Old Viet Nam.
The ceremony was held in the atmosphere of the Great Wall, where delegates continued to smile at the British, glorified the success of the British, and enjoyed the greater special solidarity.
In his speech, the Minister ' s congratulating heart was expressed that it was an opportunity for the people of Viet Nam and the Lao people to share in the great revolution of the two countries and to express their gratitude for the great sacrifice of their independence, while the people of both countries remembered and collaborated in combating the common enemy, to seek national independence, to build a common country development, and to strengthen relations between the two countries.
On 23 January 1946, 74 years ago, 28 former combatants of the League were bravely killed in the attack on Phoehe.
This attack has been won as a historic victory for both countries in the initial phase of the struggle for national liberation revolution.
Ms. Xiao-song stressed that the two peoples were always mindful of the noble victims of the struggle for the liberation of two nations, while stressing that the younger generation of the two countries would continue to promote the old, strong tradition and contribute to the continued development of the old relationship and the prosperity of the two countries.
It's going through the line!
International Milan's 3,000-threatening-new-line strategy.
On July 26th, the new internet client's turn came at the end of Beijing's 26th morning, with the idea that Milan's traditional Haoman International Milan had come to the end of the Great War.
According to Italian media statistics, the client's role in Pethonaia is the 3,000th anniversary of the International Milanese League of thought, and the Blue Army is also the first group to unify this series of events.
Since the reunification of the League in 1929, Milan has been the only unaccompanied team and the only unremarked team.
According to Italian media reports, the international battle between Milan and Hoña was the 3,000th in the history of the Blue Army.
In the civil war in this area, the international Milan client won the three prizes.
This service opens the second time, and the Sanchez, in turn, contributed a ball.
From the beginning, the competition has entered the international market in Milan, and the attack has finally turned into a ball in the 34th minute.
In the left-hand side of Bilagi, the Lukaku road is broken.
In the 82-minute international Milan as a law-enforcement, in the post-Muslim crossing of the south-west Mossian road, the Inter-Sanches Roads were fired; the pre-final Lukaku was completed two times, against the long distance from the Central Brozovic, and the Lukaku crossing the block after the passage to Romero, which would be more distinct than at 3:0.
International Milan client 3:0 won Henana, and the rise to the 2nd rise of Super-Aarland, the leader of Yuvantus 4, after the fall of a multi-stakeholder game, remains in the struggle.
In addition, in the nearly 90-year-long 3,000-year-long-long-long-distance competition, Milan won 1489 of it, 834 rounds, lost 677 sites, and won 49.6 per cent.
In the middle, the team hits 5038, they lose 3102, they hit 1.68.
The Blue Army has gained 18 league champions and has never been downgraded.
The unmanned aircraft is landed in the country when carrying out its mandate near the "Blue Line" of the Israeli and Lebanese borders.
The declaration does not mention the reasons for the failure of the unmanned aircraft.
Israeli media reports that this unmanned aircraft may have fallen by accident.
It was reported that the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence of Israel, Guantz, had indicated that on the afternoon of his visit to the northern region of Israel, Israel would continue to take action against Syria and Lebanon in order to ensure its security interests.
Israel has long regarded the Lebanese Hizbian Party as a major security threat and accused Iran of being in a state of tension in the situation near the border of Lebanon through the Syrian territory of the Taliban.
Israel has fought against the organization several times and has launched an air attack on the targets in the territory.

According to history, the U.S. military archives have been confiscated for years.
During the Moscow Defence War, the Soviet Union was in the East Asian Ocean for support, at which time the Japanese army "Northern entrance" felt that it was possible and desirable to escape.
In order to address the threat of the enemy, the plan "Muddenura" was implemented jointly with the Soviet intelligence team.
Based on this historical background, known as the production of lead and lead to the destruction of the temple.
This time in the "Victory" is the lead in control and man.
In the drama he played, he was the Chief of the Criminal Section of the River Police Office and was a happy, somewhat airy Cuban police officer, and a true figure was a member of the community party.
The women's main dream with their performances is that of the Chief of the River Security Department, who has deep appreciation for the blessings of the Japanese Division, and who have also had a hostile relationship with Don Dong.
In recent years Su Su has tried many different types of roles, and from "the years we're young" to "the "intention strategy" we have been given a deep impression on the audience and art is recognized.
This was the first time the Susie and Zhao-Hung-Hung-Rong were a partner, with Captain Tubba with the arrangement of the women's police, with a view and a new intention.
In addition to the two main figures, the "Victory" also includes the "Victory", the Lillion, the Money, the Reahan, and many powerful actors, such as the Army, and the "Courts" are also one of the playwrights.
It is understood that the "Victory" was also very well produced, that the theatre group was crossing the Suss, and that it was filmed nearly 2,000 kilometres from the province of Maine.
In order to further the urban landscapes of the Middle East in the time of the Middle East, the team of American workshops worked nights, carefully covering the exhibitions and every detail of the construction and equipment, enabling the film exhibitions to be graceful and rich in historical experience.
The earthquake in the two provinces of West Yemen led to the death of 16 people -- a new network in Yemen
Sana's news from New York City, on July 26, news: According to Yemeni local media, at least 16 people were killed during the 48 hours of flooding in West Yemen.
It is reported that 13 people died from floods caused by floods in the Netherlands, and three people in the nearby Haje province died in the floods.
In addition, tens of houses in the northern part of the Netherlands and in the southern part of the Haj area were destroyed by floods, and parts of roads and agricultural areas were also damaged.
The number of years of military conflicts has led to a close breakdown in the health system in Yemen.
Statistics from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs show that since 2017 more than one million people have been infected by Yemen and more than 2,000 have died.
Yemen's medical institutions are concerned that persistent floods will further expand the epidemic.
"Entirely out" is a dream of a new world of war.
The film's "extremely" film, led by young people's high-ranking leaders, William, East and West, is officially featured in the art.
The video told stories of the fall-and-fashioned Vinas' return to the palace and the struggle for dignity, showing a series of hot-blooded suicides.
The "completely striking" film, promoted by Thailand as the starting point of the "Tao" dream of the fall of King Vinas, was the whole story of the change in traditional Chinese cultural values, whether the determination of a falsification was made in the pre-Vinas period for his father, or the subsequent efforts to rehabilitate as a noble war with the support of his friends and loved ones, showed that men in traditional Chinese culture sought and loved families and loved ones.
In line with the traditional Hollywood film history model and with the strong team of professional groups in both countries of China, "the ultimate hit" has not only revealed the effects of internationalization, but will also motivate different types of audiences.
At the same time, the "absolutely striking" exhibits a great deal of dramaticities of the teapot and training, with the intensity and warmth of the face.
In the video, a small game designer from Eastern Space helped Vinas, who was re-played by the game, to return to the stage and remove the scenes, together with the new interesting high-tech and high-speed high-speed competitions, also showed a light and vinas who seemed to be "different", with a practical goal.
In addition, the deep love between Venus and the peacocks are also very touching, and the silent support of Venus has always been shown to Vienna and the firm commitment of Venus to the peacocks, which has brought to the attention of the viewers to the "hospitality" of Venus, which has added to the feeling of many people for this fall-on king.
Joint Action in Four Sectors!
Start App violations collection of personal information management through new networks

Starting App violations of personal information management.
The National Committee for Standardization of Information Security, China Consumer Association, China Internet Association, China Network Space Security Association, and relevant professional assessment bodies participated in the meeting.
App uses the micro-confidential public code ( "App Personal Information Statement"), the two specialized channels (pip.tc260.org.cn) and the guidance and issue of the wide-ranging web user on the use of personal information on violations.
At the same time, large-scale netizens can report and reflect illegal acts on platforms, such as the Centre for Infrared and Bad Information (www.12377.cn).
The General Court of the Journalists.
Open a new round of exchanges, transfer of 17.5 per cent of overseas funds to the Economic Observer Network - Professional Finance News website.
On 26 July, the Green Control Unit (600606.SH) issued "a notice on the transfer of part of the shares of the company's shares by the State's shareholders to the public through the way in which they are to gather the assignees".
The information shows that, for further deepening countries ' pensions reform, improvements in the structural adjustment of the GHG, improved the structure of the GHG, the HHG limited company (hereinafter referred to as "the capital of Haiti") and the GHG limited company (hereafter referred to as "the GHG") are intended to transfer the shares of the company owned by public-substance agreements, not more than 17.5 per cent of the total capital of the GHG.
The price for the transfer of the shares is not lower than that of the two: the average daily value of the average price for the 30 trading days prior to the notice of notice (20 July 2020) and the net assets of each unit audited by a recent accounting year company.
At present, new strategic investors in green are still uncertain, according to public information estimates, that 17.5 per cent of the shares transferred from the green to this blend need to be paid for some $14 billion.
It is worth noting that, after the transfer of this component, it is expected that the components and actual controllers of the unit will remain uncontrollable, but that the control structure may be significantly altered.
Since the establishment of the Green Control Unit, several institutional reforms have been carried out: in 1992-1997, under the rules of marketization under the clean state system; in 1997-2013, the establishment and continuous improvement of the control unit, the division of the labour force; in 2013-2015, the introduction of strategic investors, the creation of non-public capital transfers units, and the integration of all systems that are integrated with each other; and in 2015 to date, the entire city has become a public company.
The current GHG is similar to GHG, and in December 2019, high-capital head-of-capital seaming with a capacity of 416,62 million dollars (000651.SZ) per cent, the GHG relocated small shares, and after completing the GHG, the GHG implemented a high-instimulating plan, with no modern business management, such as the control structure.
In Haiti, the overseas contribution to the Group of National Financial Enterprises of the Overseas Countries, the Chairman of the Green Control Unit, the President-in-Chief, said that the Green Sea, as the central demands of the Party, promotes integrated national financial institutions, accelerates the major initiatives in the reform of the new phase of the State's financial institutions, has been fully demonstrated by the creation of new ways of mass-adjustment, by introducing new strategic actors to the top of the market, to support the increase in marketing freedom of business management and to speed up the reform of the overall release.
Cross-country travel recovery, cross-country travel services, new network
On 25 July, at 1220 hours on 25 July, the newspaper Leigh, New York City, took 200 passengers on board the D771 motor vehicle and successfully arrived in the city of Leigh, which was also the first cross-country motor vehicle to return to the province (areas, cities) since the 14 July, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.
In the southwestern part of the country, the city of Lahore, which has a large number of sights, such as the Bay of Guangu, is situated in the southwestern part of the country, and over 200 seafarers will take one tour in two days' journeys.
Lili, Deputy Director-General of the International Railways (Group) Limited, said that the company, in accordance with the latest policy, has been aware of the need for cross-border travel, for the first time in contact with the city of Lancao, and has carefully promoted "On-sea-West-West-Land" products, which do not exceed one week's sales.
The grandmother of the sea said that because of the plague this year, it's gone.
"It's been a long time at home, seeing a group of people walking around, and immediately registering the news to friends, and never came to London before, and looks forward to this trip."
It was understood that in September last year, the city of Lange and its limited international travel company (group) had signed a strategic cooperation agreement on the "Hungary-Gluang" project, which was planned to launch 12 high-level tourism expertise in the area of Zhao-Qiang in one year.
Do I look at myself?
U.S. White House consultant "Rehabilitation" has been rehabilitated early in the United States.
The U.S. White Corps consultant has been rehabilitated in the states.
On 23 July local time, the number of cases of new lung cancer in the United States fell to 40 million, representing 30 per cent of global cases.
In the coming months, U.S. President Trannon has repeatedly called for rehabilitation in all states until the next day, and has been taking the initiative to fill the gap in public places, and his consultants say that some governments are too early to rehabilitate.
On 22 May, President Célián Conway, consultant of the White House, at the press conference, stated that some Governments had not complied with the standards of rehabilitation and had already reopened places like the bar.
Conway also pointed out that the previous statement on the decision of the President to re-establish State affairs was misleading.
"The President is a federalist, he believes that all states have sovereignty."
She's defense for Trenmphus.
However, in Conway, Tranmp spoke directly at the White Circumcision on 13 April.
This is the most self-defense action that the netizens have been known to be "recorded history".
Karen Conway wants to change history. She's a liar.
Tran's reputation as an independent judge, Mr. Gray Wittman, of Michigan State, because she followed the medical guidelines and continued to work.
Tran's plan is to promote rehabilitation, so he can hold meetings.
This wasn't the first time that brought about controversy.
On 15 April, when the Fox News received an interview, Conway released: "COVID-19, and not COVID-1, friends!"
She seems to understand "19" as a version, and the netizens are mad at her.
Recently, we've seen the impact of a network attack on the business world.
It's like Morgan, Jacob, the owner of the property and the Tajit stock of these companies, leading to the loss of billions of dollars, even billions of dollars.
A few more attacks like this, the whole world economy will collapse.
It is also impossible to escape from public areas.
From 2012 to 2014, the U.S. Human Management Office reported very serious data revealing.
Security permits and fingerprints have been stolen, affecting 22 million employees.
You may also have heard that some government-funded negotiators try to collect data that affects the general results of some countries.
The last two cases, together with large data from the Federal Parliament of Germany, together with the National Committee of the Democratic Party of the United States of America, were e-mailed.
The threat of the network has affected our democratic process.
And there's a strong trend.
The more computer technology is developed, the more vulnerable the means we use to protect data.
Especially a new computer technology, called a quantification computer, it uses the microchips of the natural environment to significantly increase the operating capacity of the computer.
Its operating capacity is strong enough to break the many encryption systems we've been using today.
So we have no hope?
Are we supposed to start gathering the electronic storage equipment to come to the end of the coming day?
I don't think it's yet.
The computer still exists in the lab, and it takes a number of years from actual use.
More importantly, there have been a lot of major outbreaks in the encryption area.
For me, it's a very exciting time in the history of security communications.
About 15 years ago, I realized that we were unlocking new skills that could produce quantifiable effects that would not exist in the natural environment.
Using the basic laws of physics to promote the development of encrypted technology, this idea has made me no longer excited.
Today, some selected companies and laboratories, including me, have advanced this technology to a practical application phase.
That's right.
We're going to use the measure against the counter.
How's it going to work?
First, let's get to know a encrypted world.
You need a copy, you have some important documents to send to your best friend, James Bond, to lock up, to guarantee security.
Because these materials are the best secret, we're going to use a super-progress package.
It has a special password lock, and when it is locked, it will convert the document content into random numbers.
So you just put the document in, lock it, and this time the document has been converted into a random number, and you're sending this package to James.
You call him when he's not here yet, and you tell him the password.
Once he gets his passport, enter the password, document translation is complete, perfect, you've successfully transmitted an encrypted message to James Bond.
(Laughter) It's an interesting example, but it's about three encrypted points.
Password -- we call it the key.
You can imagine it as a code.
Tell James the phone.
We call it a secret.
It guarantees that we can send the secret security to the designated location.
It's also used to encrypt the reconciliation documents.
We call it 'encryption'.
Through the key, it transforms the contents of the document into random numbers.
It's hard to break the password without a secret.
The importance of the bill is that if a person gets a copy of it, opens it, no secret, no encrypted bill, he can't read the contents of the document.
It's just a few random numbers.
Most security systems depend on the safe means of conveying the secret to the right place.
However, the rapid growth of computing has threatened the many secret transmission methods that we are using.
For example, we're now applying a very wide system -- RSA.
When it was discovered in 1977, it took some 4 million years to break down a 426 RSA secretion.
And by 1994, just 17 years ago, this code was broken.
As computer quality increases, the password we need is growing.
Now we often use 2048 or 4096 passwords.
As you can see, the fight between the secretaries is ongoing, and they want to win each other.
In the next 10 to 15 years, when the computer comes, it's going to break down more complex mathematical equations, which are the basis of the encryption system we're using today.
In fact, the computer will turn our safe castle into a close-up paper room.
We're trying to protect our castle.
In recent years, there have been many research agencies and research on how to use quantify effects.
People's got some exciting crashs.
Remember three encrypted points? High quality secret, safe secret transmission and strong calculations.
However, the progress of science and engineering has been at risk of two of them.
First of all, it's the secret.
The random number is the basis for the secret.
But by today, they're no longer a real chance.
Now, we're producing a secret, based on random digital frequency, based on software, we call it a random number.
The number of procedures or mathematical methods, there will always be some, maybe not so obvious rules in there.
These numbers are less random, or they're using terms, and they're less complex, and they're more easily predicted.
In recent times, some gambling sites have been attacked, and the way they are attacked is very creative.
They took a little time to take a picture of the machine, and then analyze it.
Network offenders used reverse engineering to produce a reverse-separate digital generator.
So they're going to have a lot of factors to predict the shift, so they're going to spend a lot of money.
The secret is not safe either.
It's important to have a real random number generator for creating a password that's safe.
For several years, researchers have been trying to produce a true random number generator.
But most of the design, whether it's not enough, whether it's not fast, or it's hard to reuse.
But the world of quantity is a real chance.
The use of this true consistency is very important.
A device that can measure the quantification effects can produce very fast and continuous sequence of random numbers.
The crime just mentioned is no longer possible.
The number of universities and companies from all over the world is concentrated in the production of real random digital generators.
In my company, our quantified computer generator was born on a two-foot 1-metre lighthouse table.
Then we cut it down to a box size.
To this day, it can be put on a PCI card, put on a common computer.
It's the fastest, really random digital generator in the world.
It can produce 100 billion sequences per second through measurement.
Today it has been widely used throughout the world to increase the security of suppliers of cloud services, banks and government agencies.
(Applause) But even if there's a true random number generator, we're still facing the second major network security threat: that's the security issue of secret transmission.
The current secret transport technology is unable to counter the counter-mortem computer.
But for the quantitative solution to this problem, called the distribution of the quantified QKD, it used a fundamental anti-infrared feature.
Watching this behavior will change this pattern.
I'll give you an example.
Let's think about it again, give James Bond the password.
But this time, we don't call him, we're using quantified effects, carrying this password, passing it to James by regular light.
We assume Dr. Nono wants this password.
Luckily, Dr. Nono's trying to cut this amount of secret will leave an electronic fingerprint, James and you will find out.
That's how the hidden secret is going to be gone.
And the remaining secrets can provide strong protection for data.
Because this security mechanism is based on the basic principle of physics, the amount of computers, or any future supercomputer, it can't be broken.
I'm working with my team, along with many top universities and the defence sector, to improve this exciting technology, to develop the next generation of security products.
The Internet predicts a high interconnection period, and it is expected that by 2020 there will be 250-300 million equipment access to the Internet.
To think about our society working normally in the Internet, it's crucial to trust in these interconnected systems.
We believe that quantification technology will be very important to build this trust, and it will ensure that we take full advantage of these wonderful innovations, which can make our lives rich and rich.
Thank you all.
(Applause)
Is there any reason to argue again after being charged at 3-year-olds' colleges?
20-07-26 05:01:11 Source: Legal journal author: king-in-law Editor: king-in-law
She's lost her job, and she's accused the school again after the child's claim.
□ Reporter-in-Office of the General Assembly
A three-year-old boy was accidentally hit in the head when he was playing at a university.
Following a certain compensation, Mr. Vynn, the father of a minor, appealed to the court as a legitimate representative of the minority, to apologize for the school ' s claims in the place of execution and to pay medical costs, which amount to 20,000 dollars, such as psychological damage to the pension.
In the near future, the People's Court of the District of Beijing found that the school had set up a protection network in place, had fulfilled its proper security obligations and had been compensated for, and had therefore rejected the appeal of the accused.
Mr. van claims that during the 2019 holiday, he played with a small Chinese team at school, and at the time the football team was trained.
In order to avoid the risks posed by this, Mr. Wynn and many other young friends and parents are active in the security areas designated by the team.
But then, when the ball team finally got off the ball, it led to the crossing of the grid into the above security area and hit the middle head of the ball.
Mr. Van was immediately taken to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed as an extraterrestrial wound.
Mr. Wynn believes that the facilities of the school football field are not in conformity with the relevant security provisions and that they are not effectively managed by the ball team and related facilities.
The failure of the school led to the above events and caused great pain in the minds of the minor and also caused greater pain to his family, and he should be legally responsible for the school.
In this regard, the school party argues that the school has already set up a protection network at its disposal and has imposed administrative provisions, training notice, notification of entry into the facility to maintain safety distance and alert the school to its own safety, and the accused cannot prove that the school "does not fulfil its security obligations", so that it does not consent to compensation.
Following the trial of the Court, it was considered that the site of the case was open to the public at the university, although the school had a security obligation to run, but that security obligation only required general attention.
In the course of the event, schools set up protective networks and have fulfilled appropriate security obligations, and some have been compensated for medical costs to small fellows in accordance with the above-mentioned compensation agreement, and two thousand dollars for losses, such as transport costs, and agreed to this one-time solution.
In the latter case, the minor parents reiterated the claim for school compensation and, if not justified, the court's judgment rejected all appeals against the accused.
Both parties had not appealed, and the judgement had entered into force.
In accordance with article 37 of my State ' s Code of Infringement, schools as administrator of public places are subject to security obligations; in the event of damage to others in the third person, third parties are liable for violations, but not at all to the extent that public administrators of security obligations should be responsible for the corresponding liability.
The judge stated that, as the manager of the public place, the most likely situation in the whole area is expected to be at risk and damages, thus the most likely to take the necessary measures to prevent or mitigate damages and avoid the minimum costs of damage, and thus provide for the obligation of the law to take appropriate safeguards for social activities.
In the present case, in relation to non-specific entry into the public free market, the security obligation of the school should be adapted to its social activities, in particular, by taking basic security measures and reporting obligations for hidden risks.
In judicial practice, it is also not necessary to impose too high security obligations on public administrations.
If the school has already adopted a network of protection and has completed its obligation to notify it, it can be found that the school is not guilty and should not be liable to the law.
In addition, in respect of the violation of the rights of third parties, even if public administrations such as schools do not fulfil their security obligations, their liability is also a supplement to compensation for damages and may also be reimbursed to third parties after they receive additional responsibility in accordance with the updated civil law.
In such cases, the victim should no longer extend the scope of the claim after receiving compensation from the direct offender.
Today I want to show you how we make things in the future.
I believe that soon our building and machinery will be able to organize itself, self-recover and repair.
So I'm going to show you the current situation of the manufacturing industry that I think is, and then compare it with some natural systems.
So in the current manufacturing industry, we have a building of the moon — two and a half years, a million to half a million parts, very complex, using new technologies in the steel, mixing soil and glass.
We have a moving machine that can bring us into space -- five years, two hundred and fifty million pieces.
But on the other hand, if we look at the natural system, we have two million kinds of proteins that can break down in 10,000 seconds, we can copy into about one hour's DNA with three billion base DNA.
That's the complexity of our natural system, but they're very effective, they're more efficient than anything we've built, they're more complex than anything we can build.
They are more efficient in energy.
They're a little wrong.
They can repair themselves.
There's something very interesting about the natural system.
If we can convert it into our building environment, we'll have a lot of potential in the way of building things.
I think it's the key to self-assessment.
If we want to use self-assessment in our own physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
First of all, we need a code for all the complexity of what we're building -- that's our building and machinery.
We need to make them decoding into a simple sequence — basically our building's DNA.
And then we need the part that we need to arrange, this part can accept this sequence and be used to break or recycle.
We need some energy to activate, so that our parts can be broken down according to the procedure.
We need some kind of miscellaneous surplus to ensure that we build it successfully.
So, I'm going to show you some of the projects that I and my colleagues are doing to achieve this self-assembled project.
The first two projects are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale restructured machines — 8 meters, 12 feet [12 meters] of protein.
They're putting in electrical equipment, transmitter.
You need to figure out the way you want to break the code, make a series of angles — 120 degrees, 120 degrees, 0 degrees, 120 degrees, 120 degrees, -- such things; a series of angles, or shifts, can pass through this sequence by electronics.
Each unit receives its own information — for example, 120. It rotates, checks whether it rotates to the place and then transmits the order to its neighbours.
There are many outstanding scientists, engineers, designers working for this project.
I believe that this project is really revealing: is it really possible to expand?
I mean, it's worth thousands of dollars a lot of time to make this eight-foot machine.
Can we really expand it? Can we really get into the machine in every part?
The next problem is to look at mobility, or try to make regroupable.
But it's going further, it's trying to actually calculate.
It's essentially incorporated most of the basic modules of calculation, digital logic, directly into the parts.
It's with the door.
Each door to calculate has one square, two entrances in four.
One of them is from the user's input, just like you're building a hole.
The other one was the first one that had been released.
Then it's going to give the exit of the three-way space.
That means the user's in the way they want it to.
It's based on what it did before and on your orders.
Now it's starting to move within three spaces — up or down.
View left, [1, 1] input equals 0 output, shows below.
On the right, [0,0] input is one output, indicating up.
So this real meaning is that our structure now includes the blues we want to build.
Thus, information on the things that want to be built has been fully included in it.
This means we have some kind of self-copy.
In this case, I call it self-direction, because your structure contains a precise blue map.
If you're wrong, you can replace a part.
All local information is included in it, telling you how to fix it.
So you've got something that's good for you, you can read it, and you can get it out.
It is directly inserted; no external command entered.
The last project I'm going to show is the top line of interest, which might be the most exciting example we've ever seen in the self-propelled self-adjustment system.
It has a structural and organisational nature that makes it a fully motivated system.
It's basically the element you've got a line.
Every element is exactly the same, and they're selfish.
Each line, or each element, wants to turn to the right or to the left.
If you're going to be wearing a tie, you need to arrange for it.
To tell each unit whether to turn left or right.
When you move this box, it's broken down and arranged any structure you're coded for -- so in this case, a circle, a fire like that, two interconnected positions.
Basically, you can arrange in three-way space-- or one, two-way-- this box is fully activated.
What does this tell us about the future?
I think this tells us that these are in our body structure, in our building and in our machines, such self-assessment, self-copying and self-recovery.
There are new organizational features in these sections.
You can get a new possibility from this.
We'll have space to calculate.
Imagine our building, bridge, machine, and all the holes can actually calculate.
How amazing and how amazing it is to calculate and distribute the computing capacity and the potential for new design.
It's an exciting potential.
I think these projects that I've shown to you are only a small step towards the future, if we achieve these new technologies for a new self-organization world.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Under normal circumstances, people move to high levels of health.
With the gradual departure of the cross-border tourism operation, the tourism market will also come to rest.
Since 21 July, the Ministry has resumed its cross-border tourism operations, and the first weekend after the opening came as a guest hall for the purpose of the tourist hot door.
Many visitors arrived on weekends as tourist destination cities of the hot door.
It is expected that 30 million passengers will be sent by train to the train station and that the airport clients will be the owner of the train, students, tourists, and visitors.
The tourism market was gradually reheated, and in July it ran 440 times a day, and 80 per cent of the domestic aviation had recovered before the outbreak.
The airlines have encrypted the doors to the upper sea, Beijing, Chunging, and the main cities, such as the West Bank, to capture the post-Susu tourist market.
At present, a number of cross-border cross-country travel products have been cross-border, mainly in the group's area.
At the train station, the airfields were high-end passengers, the relevant units were at a value chain, the security channels were well-assessed in the area where people were gathered, and the promotion of improvements to "8-related health code" and the sharing and mutual recognition of health data between 31 provinces, promoting a consistent recovery of travel markets.
"Can the New Year's Eve "disrupt" from the New Year's Eve?
"Explorer 2" announced the day before, on 24 December, to be a film that will be filmed as the top of the old archive.
The second is still the lead of the Song of Solomon, in the control and leadership of Zhao-Wao and in all new stories.
It was reported that the addition of the second element of the "nuclear bomb" also made the challenges of this explosion expert more difficult, warning of a number of alarming cameras, a heartbreaking line, a massive explosion of thunders, a fire-extinguishing airport, and a rather alarming scene.
Three years ago, the five-storey champions of the year were awarded seven nominations in Hong Kong films, and the Zhao Xu Dawa was also a golden partner in the eyes of the audience.
It is also expected that the new fires could be wiped out on the King's team.
"Explorer 2" described the whole new story: the former bomber stormer (Sweden) fell in the scene of an explosion, and were listed as suspects by the police.
In order to find the truth, he had to seek help from a friend of the bomb expert.
The women's inspection of the case was rapid, while the women's ex-fashioners were also included in it.
It is still an expert in bombing, but it is possible to experience the complexity of the new role of Zhuang: cut off a leg, put on a knife, was chased along by the bomb expert, and was ordered by former girlfriend Janie.
What was the relationship between the three of them, what was done at the Hong Kong hotel, what were they accused of? In what case, what was the professional life of the bomb expert, and what kind of team did not surprise people anymore.
It was understood that the film's main game was the world-wide ground-marked building in Hong Kong, along with the top-down special production team, which led to a dramatic visual explosion.
(Laughter)
On 26 July, the Central Internet, the integrated Russian satellite network reported that on 26 July it was the day of the Russian Navy to celebrate the major military events of the Navy Day in St. Petersburg and Cassette.
The President of Russia, the Russian Federation's highest army army, reached Beijing City at the time of the celebration, where 15 ships and submarines were inspected.
Local time was held on 28 July 2019 in St. Petersburg, Russia.
It has been reported that Pyongyin celebrated the Day of the Marine Army and carried a small boat on the side of a ship that was to join the Navy in Finland and was subsequently visited by troops at the main stage.
Putin indicated that the Russian Navy fleet had included the latest ships and special equipment and that the level of equipment was increasing.
Putin, in his military service at the Russian Navy Day, said: "The Russian Navy has a highly armed army, strategic submarines and multi-purpose submarines, modern aircraft, unique weapons and special equipment " .
On 24 June local time, Russia commemorated the victory of the 75th anniversary of the victory of the war in defence.
He also indicated that the Russian Navy would rely on digitalization and effective means of defence for unique advantages.
It is reported that the major Russian military presence in St. Petersburg and Cassacetad during the days of the Russian Navy was held in the army, with 46 ships participating, including the "Casatonov's "protection vessel", the "Curakovus" in the Navy, as well as the large landing vessel, small missiles, defensive vessels, submarines, etc.
A series of ships took part in a quiet demonstration near the bridge of St. Petersburg, with the most striking aim of the 18th century, the Russian warship "Poltava".
In order to avoid the spread of new vaccines, only local residents and special guests can enter Khartoum Tardad during this year's military service.
The last Sunday of July each year is the Russian Navy.
Beckin's music team created the life of a man who lived for years and spent 86-year-olds on the new network
On 26 July, the Beijing Music Group announced that the Beijing Music Group was the founder of the Beijing Music Group, the famous Chinese commanders, the music teacher, the final academic member of the Central Music School, the teacher of the series of academics, who was disabled by the medical profession at 1355 hours in Beijing on 26 July 2020 and who was 86 years of age.
Photo from Beijing's Association of Music.
She was born in 1934, the Sunnyangese, who had been born as a child.
In 1951, the Young People's Radio Radio Team was run by the Hong Kong People's Radio Team, which was launched in 1951 by Professor Huang and German commander Hizman, who were re-enacted to the former Soviet expert Alzamanov.
In 1958, he was taught at the Beijing Arts Institute of Music, which was transferred to the Central Music School in 1973.
In July 1983, the Beijing Music Group was formed.
For the past 30 years, he has been pursuing the purpose of "love and dedication" and has been leading this group around the world and has received dozens of prizes in the most important competitions abroad.
Formerly, the Central Music Group, the Central National Music Group, the Eastern Music Group, the 30 other groups, such as the upper Sea Music Group, and the multi-stakeholder concerts and the Joint Music Association were held.
The book is entitled "Singer training", "Singer Training", "Singing Two", "Singer Songs", "Children's Songs" (the following book) and "Singings", "Singing" and "Singer Law", as well as "Dreather's and Voice".
How many plants do you know?
There are 250,000 species -- at least there are so many -- 250,000 plants.
And the flowers are a problem.
It's really hard for plants to grow.
A large number of experiences and many resources are needed.
Why would it bother you so much?
Of course, the answer is, like many other things in the world, sex.
I know what you think in your mind when you look at these pictures.
There are so important reasons for sexual reproduction -- there are many other ways that plants can reproduce.
It can be used as an injector; it can be passed on to the same sex; it can be mixed with the same sex.
But they really need to distribute their genes together with other genes so they can have an ecological environment.
This is how growth works.
Now the way that plants transmit this information is through flowers.
Some of you may have seen these pictures before.
As I said, every family should have a screen to see these electrons.
There's a lot of flowering plants, and there's a lot of different kinds of flowers.
It's actually very useful to legal medicine.
It's a very low-efficiency process, and it's why flowers always run into our nose.
Because most of them have been abandoned, hoping to include the reproductive cells in the flowers, the reproductive cells, which may fall into another flower.
All the trees, that means all the valleys, and most of the trees, pouring flowers.
But most of the species actually use insects to complete this process, to some extent it's smarter, because it doesn't need too much flowers.
The insects and other species can carry flowers, move them directly to the place they need.
Clearly, we note the relationship between insects and plants.
It's a kind of community relationship, whether it's a bird or a bear, they can all get feedback, usually a pet.
Sometimes this community relationship will lead to a remarkable adaptation -- a beautiful adaptation of the red sun.
Plants have also received, and the sky has spread flowers elsewhere.
Plants are growing, where they create a tunnel, the honey may be lost.
Many plants look like other insects.
These are hundreds of flowers, very beautiful, so when an unknown insect falls on it, it turns around with many flowers and hits behind it, so it can follow the insects to other plants.
There's a flower that looks like there's a common flower. In some way, it's true; it's forced by insects, it's blown up, and it's brought flowers to other places.
At least 20,000 flowers -- a variety of surprises.
They have a variety of flowers.
They have to try and attract fans to help them complete this process.
It's called Darwin's flower, because it's been studied by Darwin, and when he saw it, he gave a wonderful forecast.
The most important thing we have to do is -- when we come to the flowers -- it's inverted the middle part of the inside, and it's going down to know how to make flowers.
Darwin said, look at this flower, "I guess there's something going on together with it."
There's no question, it's insects.
When I mean, it's usually full, but after it's extended, it looks like it.
Now you can imagine that if these precious things are so valuable that they are produced at high prices for plants and can attract many fans, then, like in human behavior, people may begin to deceive one another.
They might say, "I have some flowers.
It's a plant.
These plants, which they like for South Africa's insects, have developed long-term oral tools to access the bottom flowers.
It's a model.
This plant is a pre-eminent plant.
There's a long-distance mirror that doesn't get any flowers from a liar because a liar doesn't give it any flowers.
So, not yet, but it's not cultivated from a fake plant, and -- if you're very close to the top of your head, you'll see some flowers there, they'll be spread to other plants, and if there's no farmer coming, they'll stick it to a blue card.
(Laughter) That's the whole kingdom of plants.
This flower with black spots: they may look like we're black, but I'm telling you, for the appropriate species of herbicide, it looks like just two very very sensitive fungi.
(Laughter) When the insects arrive and go up to the ground, they will, of course, be taken to other plants, and if they look at the images that each family should have, they can actually see some pictures there, three of them.
It even makes the bacteria feel comfortable, looks good.
These electrons are visible microscopic images -- it's a butterfly that's wearing a virus -- you can see for our eyes that different parts of the structure have different colors and different treatments, and that bacteria may feel very different.
It's evolved into a sample of the surfaces of the metallic light seen on some bacteria.
You can see this face -- it's very different from the other faces we've seen.
Sometimes the entire plant models into a insect, even if we look like it.
I mean, I think it looks like some kind of flying animal or beast.
It's wonderful and wonderful.
It's the smart side of it, it's called black stone.
I think it's kind of boring sometimes.
For a suitable type of honey, it looks like another very aggressive bee, it'll fly through and hit it many times, try to pull it off, of course, it'll make it blossom.
The other thing it does is that this plant is modeled into another rich plant that likes food.
But there's nothing.
So it's cheating on both levels -- it's hard to believe.
(Laughter) What we saw was in India, with a lot of taste.
I actually felt it before.
These flowers don't really need so much.
They spread wonderful smells, attracting any interested insects.
It's not gonna be fun.
This flower, actually, looks very hard to mention again, it's evolution, it looks like it's a corpse.
That's why he likes it.
He's gonna fly in and help him cook.
It's the White Sea. It's also called the Dead Sea.
I don't know what it smells like to die, but this flower may look very much like it.
It's really scary.
The Greens don't mind themselves.
Get in there, get in there.
On the top of the plant, I think it's a good piece of meat, and I don't know that there's no egg food here, and they're gonna die here, but at the same time it's gonna be useful, because it's hard to get rid of it and it's gone.
It's a marine plant, the European Sea, the Black Sea, the mother, in this country called herbage.
I took a picture of this in Tosset last week.
This guy's hotter than about 15 degrees above the temperature of the environment.
If you look at it inside, it's a little bit like a giant thing, and it's a heat-encrusted form -- it's a kind of fungic chemical, and the insects -- they're trapped under this container.
They're having sweet tastes, and then they're getting a little confused.
In the night they were covered with flowers, under the cover of them, and then we saw the hard hair on them, and it became a trap to escape these flowers -- it's hard to believe.
If you think it's incredible, this one is my favorite.
It's spring green.
Those who come from Brazil should know about this plant.
This is the most amazing thing.
It's about an inch long.
There's one thing that I know does not have any other plant, and when it goes on -- it's in the middle of the body -- for about two days, it's caused some kind of genetic change -- some like breastfeeding.
It has no fat, it's plant food, it's got a lot like the color of the fat, it's burning at the speed of the fat, it's burning, for example, about a cat's speed.
By weight, it's a bird's energy output twice -- absolutely amazing.
It's done something extraordinary.
Not only will it rise to 155 degrees, 43 or 44 degrees, two days, and it will remain warm.
There's a temperature adjustment mechanism to keep warm.
I heard you ask.
Now you don't know, some bacteria like to be together under this temperature.
They're going in. They're full of flowers.
(Laughter) Plants smell flowers on them, leave them, go for them.
What a strange thing.
Now we think most of the fungi are insects, but actually in tropical areas, there are lots of birds and mammals.
Many tropical flowers are red, which is because they look like us, we think it's very good to see red.
But if you look at the lights, the birds and us, we see the red, the green and the blue, the light.
The insects see green, blue, and blue lines, they can see all kinds of dark blue lines.
There's some colors behind here.
"If we can see those colors, "I hear you ask.
Yes, we can see.
So what do you see?
Last week, I took pictures of these deserts, half-days, in Tosset.
As we have seen, these are little flowers, all around them.
It looks like it is.
That's what it looks like if you're going to remove the red.
Most monkeys don't feel red.
Then I put the outer mirror in front of my mirror at a certain rate of time, and I got this photo.
It's like a really weird heart.
Now we don't know what honey looks like, when I call it red, you know what I'm looking at.
We don't know what happened there, whether it's insects or other humans' brains.
But that's probably how it looks.
It's another little flower -- located between different angles, different mirrors, to match different fans.
It looks like that.
To prevent you from thinking that all the yellow flowers have this feature -- there's no harm in the filming process; just put it on three steps, and don't pull it down -- under the blue light, look at this.
This could be the basis of the anti-smoker, because it works by absorbing outer light.
Its chemicals may therefore be useful.
Finally, it's a night of dream that Bjorn Rosslett from Norway sent me -- a wonderful way of hiding.
I like this hidden way.
I think it's very clever.
This is the main use of this mirror.
Of course, the planet is a god of love and birth, it's a flowering word.
Just as the flowers spent so much effort trying to attract fans to accept their invitation, they didn't know why, they also successfully convince us that they contain richness when we were born and born, especially when you think about it, that at this moment the genetic material moved from one body to another.
Thank you very much.

On 26 July, the new Central Network reconvenes electricity (resultant) and the Commission for Urban Development and Reform, which has since withdrawn 4404 fishermen, a total of 42.54 per cent of the total number of fishermen.
This year, 53-year-old Leed received a visit from a new netizens, who said that his father was fishing in the Rongqing River, and at the age of 11, he was fishing with his father, fishing on a small boat, sailing along the Rong-Hong River, sailing on the shore, and landing on a long way down, and leaving home every day for ten and a half months, with fishing to keep families alive.
But since 1997, as the rural population has moved to the village, the population of the high-security town has increased and environmental pollution has increased.
It built a printery, a factory, a plantation, and contaminated water along the river.
By 2007, the Lung River had become a freshwater lake.
"All the catches are black, and there are black in the back."
Liedian states that it is becoming increasingly difficult to fish after the river is contaminated.
Local air-regulatory rivers began to be contaminated, including rivers, lakes, water resources management, etc.
Liédian also withdrew from the peoples of the island and became a member of the Patriots ' team and managed water-based resources.
Since 1 January 2020, a comprehensive ban has been imposed on the water protection zone and the water-related areas of the capital.
According to the data from the Commission on Urban Development, the recapitalization of the recapitalisation of 3403 vessels has been signed 4643, 63.3 per cent of the three-year overall mandate, 86.3 per cent.
A total of 42.54 per cent of the total number of people who have been arrested by 4404 have been arrested.
Of the 4404 arrested, 4267 persons were recruited, with 96.89 per cent of the persons arrested.
Pension insurance covers 2691 persons, with 61.10 per cent of the people arrested.
The next step, the city will undertake deep-intensive operations to accelerate the expansion of the long-range cross-border use of project clearances, complete a new cycle of the river pollution census and corresponding management operations, essentially complete the mandate of "three" (i.e. the mining, mining and mining) (i.e. the coal mines) (i., the coal mines and the coal mines), improve the depletion of both coastal mining operations, strengthen the construction of green mines, strengthen the integration of deep-rooted cross-border mining, and eliminate the results of illegal mining, and deepen the long-term ban on mining.
Strengthening of Israel ' s prevention of the response to vaccines -- new network
20-07-26 04:56:44 Source: Light Day writer: King's Responsibilities: King's thoughts
Strengthening Israel ' s prevention of the response to the vaccine
The outbreak of the outbreak of New Hampton virus in the early days of the Israeli anti-dumping measures was evident.
However, with the gradual abolition of control measures, there has been a marked increase in the number of newly infected people in the country of Israel, and the Government of Israel has taken urgent measures to strengthen the prevention of infections several times.
On 28 February, the first example of the Israeli soil treatment was to close all exit ports quickly, suspend the necessary industries, replace schools with online courses, restrict public transport and non-necessary social activities, blockades, joint police protection initiatives, etc.
This series of measures soon had a positive effect, and by mid-May, the number of new cases of new lung cancer had been reduced to one-off.
With the control of the vaccine, Israel's prevention measures are fully blocked, and since June the new vaccine has been re-increasing in the number of patients who have been mutatis mutandis.
In particular, post-July, the rate of proliferation of vaccines has increased rapidly.
In recent days, there have been eight days of new cases in Israel, as issued by 25 July, with 916 new cases on that day.
As at 25 July, Israel had a total of 59,745 patients, and 448 people had died.
The Government of Israel has repeatedly taken urgent measures to strengthen the prevention of vaccines.
On 6 July, following the outbreak of the true number of diseases, the Israeli Government closed up health facilities, swimming pools, bars and public entertainment facilities, such as the General Assembly, and imposed restrictions on public transport policies, providing that more than 20 passengers per public transport vehicle could not be allowed to travel.
On 17 January, the Government announced a series of new restrictions, including the implementation of the block city, i.e. a series of new measures, including the implementation of the block city, which provided for the implementation of the block city for a period of five hours every five hours a week from 5:00 a.m.
During this period, the public will be able to leave, but the premises such as shops, shopping centres, retail shops, american restaurants, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist places will be closed, while the basic services such as supermarkets and drugstores will remain open.
At the same time, in all dates and periods, more than 10 persons are prohibited from attending meetings, health rooms, workshops, restaurants and coffee offices, and only allow outside services.
At the same time, the people of Israel did not pay enough attention to the seriousness of the vaccine and could not build up with the Government in combating it.
Following the return of Israeli vaccinations, many people were on the street fighting for their own economic interests because of measures to protect the Government.
On 11 July, thousands of people held demonstrations in Travis, which considered the impact of anti-dumping policies on the economy.
In the evening of the 21st night, thousands of protesters gathered in the presence of Prime Minister Netanya Hu of Jerusalem, protesting the prohibition of the restaurant, and the prevention measures, such as the Coffee House, were not compensated.
In addition, many people did not comply with the requirements of the door-to-door activities, which included two meters of security social distance, to avoid punishment from police officers because of their lack of access to the door, while many people simply put the door on the floor or hang on the arm.
During the period of vaccination, schools were the major areas of the spread of new vaccines, and it was found that young children's teachers and students were not required to pay their fees, nor were they able to keep a distance of two meters of social security, and were covered by the virus for large numbers of students.
Professor Eli Waxman, a member of the National Security Commission for Israel ' s Advisory Group on Anti-Visitants, said that Israel was heading towards the " dangerous situation", noting that the measures taken by Israel currently were not sufficient to close all breaks, entertainment venues and schools in order to control the occurrence further.
Waxman stated that Israel's overall plan for the lack of anti-Pesticides should be rejected as soon as possible by Parliament and Government departments, and that it would be possible to agree on the issue of anti-Pesticides and to take clear steps to develop measures, including related restrictions in the various sectors.
25 July, this newspaper, the newspaper, the newspaper, the newspaper, the Queen of the Soviet Union.
Nin-Hung-Hung-a-Hung-a-Hung-a-Rong-Hung-Hung-a-Hung-A-Hung-A-Hung-Ai-Aid, two people sitting in a car, from a house outside of 20 and arriving at the Kung-Kung-Kurming Hall.
Although these two years' legs are impossible, 77-year-old David's blessing is still expected to "come here in three-and-a-half, over the game."
This is an invisible stage in the capital of the former city, unlike the General Farm House, which is often used to convey beautiful flowers in the courtyards, as well as beautiful paintings, sculptures, traditional beads, beads, and so on.
The Lord of the Throne (of Authority) called out to him,
More than 10 years ago, he started building a cultural building.
The cultural life of the villagers has become rich.
The reporters have not yet entered the Dark Culture Hall, and the music of the band has already been broadcast.
The choice of singing for the people of the village is by the village's villagers.
She was a young girl, and now she has a reputation in the area, and she will come to the cultural school to play a show for her neighbors.
More recently, Barry was playing online.
Barry said, "There's a stage where more people can see their own performances, it's a happy thing."
On the stage, the singer's eye is one eye, the singer's singing, although he's a fan, but he's not a fan of enthusiasm.
Like the style of agronomination, it comes from the art and non-genuine culture of the Grand Shrine.
The House has also collected farmware from various ages, traditional and handmade furniture, paper, paper, paper, and film, as well as more than 300 natural items.
The cloud led the reporters to go to the hall, where they showed him the old items he collected, the old wine, the three-sixes, the line car, etc.
Why does a typical farmer build a cultural building?
"The film is my home art, and I've been studying this art since I was 15. "
It was established in 2012 as the first "Unmaterial Cultural Heritage Hall" in the village of Ninsha, and was a museum for the protection of indigenous cultural heritage in the ancient city of Ninsha.
In addition to the Al-Quqan Cultural Library, there are more than 120 cultural halls in the former city and 79 civil society groups, including some large cultural halls with over 50 persons, such as the House of Ra's, the Royal Royal Museum of Culture, the Hall of Zhao-Quq culture, and all the towns and streets of the province, representing over 5,000 people.
These geologists lived in the middle of the country, enriched the cultural life of the people and satisfied their spiritual needs.
"The more we live, the more traditional culture can't be abandoned. "
"The New World War I" re-commenced "Courts" and "Courts" against "New Wars."
The 40-year-old "Victory" game will be held on 16 July in Beijing.
"Victory" is based on real history, which has been written for many years, the first time in the Soviet military archives.
In the midst of the drama, a popular actor's role in the game was challenged by a pleasant "stupid agent".
In recent years, the reds of the "insects" of the "Factory" has proved to be a life-threatening form.
Unlike the former anti-war works, "Victory the World, extend the background to the Soviet East War.
It was based on the final phase of the war on the Day of the Day of War in 1944, and it described a story of the anti-Semitting intelligence staff (Shutanura) who, under the leadership of the Secretary-General of the People ' s Republic of the Netherlands and the Director of the United States of the Far East, had carried out a false "Mudandaura" action by the Syrian Intelligence Agency.
In a number of martial arts, men's main role as high-level champions, one of which is the air, high-skilled, advanced perfect form.
But it seems that such a person does not fit in between, "I'm supposed to be the one who doesn't even find it in the group, if a show is the kind of beautiful picture that everybody hates to pay attention to you, can't it be possible?" "You're not going to catch me, I'm forgetting I'm a national party," and I'm going to be excited.
So, in the "Victory," it's not so hard to judge the owner of his performance as a happy "study agent".
The other part of the "Victory" exhibition was made up of the wealth and wealth of the Japanese Police Office of the People's well-being and the Leeley Group.
In the south-east, the two powered legs added many high-powered views for the entire drama.
"It's a game, and they're two special minions, and they're very exciting to me. They're often all 'stolen', like we're just writing about half-page lengths, and I'm not stopping when I'm filming, and they can't always show up."
It is not only the role of a high-ranking player, nor the role of a leader, but also the role of an actor when he is in his role and ensures his own personal status, that he is not only able to play a role from a human perspective and that he can bring more perspectives to the audience, and that the role of the pilot is well - known.
In the drama, you can also see a number of familiar faces in the "Wind-F4" game, and when the "Wind-F4" was hit by a storm, there were three of them in the "Courts".
And there were those who used to play on the left-hand side of the bow and on the right-hand side of the bow.
"The two of them had nothing to do with them, and they were only in those days, and the environment was scattered."
"We're going to have a feeling. This feeling must be bad, bad people are enemies, but we're going to develop them, and our team's going to grow."
He believed that a satisfactory reply would be given to the audience.

Four of the students were killed in a flood in the Nemongu region.
On July 26, 25th, in the middle of a new web site, the newspaper was informed by the Government of Hong Kong, the city of Chelseabel, where four students died of thirst.
At 1550 hours on 24 July, 110 United Nations Security Council in Afghanistan received a warning that there were six primary secondary school dropouts in the area.
Following the arrest of the police, the local civilian police took the first time to the scene, rescued two students, then the local emergency department, and the Water Agency units to the scene, and participated fully in rescue.
It was suggested that the rescue site had a total of 80 civilian police, police, fire, medical personnel, and three skinheads were sent to the surrounding area, and that the professional rescue team had access to the site and were looking for water through sound detection.
The journalists learned that local relief personnel had identified the first student in difficulty on 25 July at 640 hours, that at 1130 hours, the second in case student was found, that at 1240 hours the third in case student was found, and that at 1334 hours the last student was found to be dead, after four hits on the shore, at 120 emergency relief centres at the local level.
Officially, this time the water incident struck a warning to the whole community.
At present, the local government sector is preparing some water prevention knowledge and hopes that the tragedy will not occur again.
On 25 July, the President of the Hong Kong Government of Finance and the Board of Governors of Hong Kong indicated that Hong Kong's financial markets remain active and functioning.
He welcomed the financial stability and economy in Hong Kong.
At a web-based workshop held at the Hong Kong Economic Trade Office in Toronto and the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce on 24 January (Tolendo Time), Hong Kong said that it was experiencing a difficult situation because of "adjustmentary flu and new flu.
Portal prices are stable and are preferred to exchange the level of guarantee.
The banking system did not have clear financial flows, on the contrary, over $11 billion since June.
The total savings of the bank also continued to increase over the past few months, and the stock market had a series of public procurement fund activities, and the market had increased.
It is generally said that New PhDs bring pressure on the global economy and the financial market, but the basic advantage of Hong Kong remains unchanged.
Much of Hong Kong ' s advantages, including geographical, rule of law, high-speed communications, free flow of information and financial resources and simple tax regimes, continue to be the leading international financial centre in Hong Kong.
It is pointed out that the Government of the Special Region has been spending 60 million dollars on the “Fift Prevention Fund” and that in the coming two years, some 30,000 temporary positions are created in public and private communities, covering different skills and scholars.
In support of the development of financial technology, the Government has also launched a "thousands of plans" to finance local financial technology companies, starting with other enterprises with financial technology-related operations, to create 1,000 new positions using local professionals and financial technology centres in Hong Kong.
Looking forward to the future, let us express our appreciation for Hong Kong's financial stability and economics.
He encouraged Canada's enterprises to make good use of Hong Kong and to develop and invest as an international financial centre, international asset and wealth management centre and the status of the Global Monetary Operation of the People of the Far East, in Hong Kong, and in nearby areas.
China's anti-inflammatory efforts to encourage countries to learn about the new network.
As a country with 14 million people, China, with a size similar to that of Europe or the United States, has been effectively controlled by the current stage of new vaccines, without the presence of a wide range of distributions, to a large extent.
The article stated that, over a period of nearly ten years, China had made significant investments in domestic research and public health construction, making China's preparations for new ceilings more than in preparation for a year's acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
The author said that China was not prepared at the start of the SARS in 2002, especially when the disease was endemic.
When new vaccines were discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the type of virus, and on 11 January 2020, they shared genetic sequence data with the international.
By the end of January, doctors from the China and Hong Kong have identified the virus's pathological characteristics and have warned the world of the threat of the new virus through the research paper published on "Snipples".
China has also been at the forefront of the vaccination study, and in the state of emergency, through close cooperation within the country, such research has been carried out very quickly and strictly, and in May and July, the results of the new early vaccination trials developed in China, respectively, in May and July.
China's experience shows that investment in national health and research systems is essential to the effective improvement of laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for a rapid and effective response to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, in particular low-income and middle-income countries, are highly worthy of consideration and study.
In addition, China's experience has proved that, on the basis of a strong study, there must be a strong high level of reliance on science on the basis of correct decision-making, which has given effect to the effective control of new vaccines.
The article emphasizes the need for Governments and their leaders to respect science, understand the value of science, and act in a manner that is most favourable to society.
In the early stages of the attack, the National Protection Commission of China sent three groups of infectious experts to the armed forces to investigate the risks and spread of the new virus, and their recommendations were based on the decision of the Huang City of 23 January; when experts presented the need and urgency of construction hospitals, the Government quickly made decisions and speedy implementation; while broad participation of communities and communities also gave swift and effective control to the impact of the epidemic.
The article concluded by stressing the need to strengthen global cooperation and joint response in response to global health emergencies.

The White Sea of the U.S. Coast Guards of the U.S.
On 26 July, the New Central Network, based on information from the Committee of the Regions of the Congo: The Committee of the Regions of the Congo had previously approved the fact that the Committee of the Regions of the Congo had conducted a case-by-case review of the serious violations of the Great Lakes of the Baltic Sea of the Ouija board of Governors.
It was examined that the Baltic Sea was the leading department of the Party, with a view to loss of belief, a private breach of the principle of freedom of expression against patrolling; organization of ideas, violations of the movement of others and the acquisition of other assets in the selection of the Department; economic turmoil, the acquisition of large-scale interests, the right to trade in money, the right to self-employment; and the corruption of life and the bad effect of corruption.
The White Sea is seriously in violation of political discipline, organizational discipline, clean discipline, life discipline, criminal offences and alleged crime, corruption and, after the 18th anniversary of the party ' s unaccompanied, unaccompanied, inhumane, inhuman and degrading treatment.
In accordance with the relevant provisions of the " " Monitoring Act of the People ' s Republic of China " of the People ' s Republic of China, the Committee of the Regions of the Congo considered and reported approval of the Committee of the Parties to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, decided to grant the Republic of the Congo Party of self-governing countries the extension of the territory of the Great Sea in accordance with the provisions of its adjustment of its benefits; the collection of its violations of the law; the transfer of its alleged crime to the prosecution by the prosecution authorities of the property concerned.
On the 25th afternoon of the local time, a small plane struck a multi-level housing building in Wester, North Germany, where the accident killed three people.
The Duisburg Attorney, together with the Westerville Police and the Westerville Fire Department, made a statement that about 1440 hours a day, a two small plane hit a building in a multi-level residential building in Westersburg, Camping Street, where three people were killed.
On that day, it flew from the town of Mal, in the northern part of the town of Wester, and then hit the house.
Two passengers on a woman's home and small aircraft to be killed or killed.
A two-year-old child in the house was hurt and rescued.
The rest of the houses were not injured in the accident, but the situation remained unsatisfied.
The presence of the D.D. reported shows that the houses of an accident were fired once and that firemen could be seriously damaged after the fires of the fire.
At present, the reason for the loss of the aircraft is unclear.
"Leather Post" called on the police to report that the lines indicate that the plane has been fired before they hit the building.
The police indicated that several parts of the missing aircraft were found in an accident scene.
The German Criminal Police, together with the Duke of Duisburg, jointly investigated the cause of the incident by the Federal Aviation Investigation Agency of Germany.
On that day, the journalists learned from the General Council of China in Duserdorf that the Chamber had been contacted by the local police and the fire department and that, according to the present case, there was no Chinese citizen of the victim.
On 26 days, the Ministry of Health announced that as of 12 o'clock that day, Singapore had added 481 new cases of real-time treatment, 50369 cases, and 27 cases of cumulative deaths.
The data show that in new cases of increased medical care, 5 are cases of local community disease, 4 are cases of admission, and the rest are foreign workers living in specific housing.
The Ministry of Health of Singapore stated that 98 per cent of new cases of infectious diseases were related to known infections.
There are currently 173 new patients treated in the hospital, most of which are stable or improved, and no one is in the hospital.
In addition, 4648 persons were separated from community facilities.
In Singapore, the majority of new infected groups are foreign workers.
According to statistics, there are 200,000 foreign workers living in 43 foreign labour units, and about 100,000 foreign workers live in other types of housing.
In the past, the Singapore Intersectoral Working Group on Anti-Visitism stated that the Government of Singapore was intensifying its inspection of the last new prevalence of infectious diseases for foreign workers.
After completion of the inspection of all assigned premises, the vast majority of foreign workers will be rehabilitated, but they will still have to carry out a new camouflage inspection regularly.
The Grand Duchess is leading the "Gird-Ass" in the Golden Throne.
On 18 July, the twenty-third International Film Festival of the Sea announced the official list of the Kimbore Awards.
The main real-time film "Gijuana" was successfully filmed around the top of the screen, while the video was published by the official at the top of the screen.
Star newspaper, photo for the video
The video "Gird's Like" is the first real material to be played by the Grand Duchess, and he's the second to the King's prize.
The film told a story like this: A comedy film led to a dramatic dream, returned to an old rural village in the north-east, and hoped to make a family film last year, resulting in a series of surprises.
Family members gathered for the film finished the final meeting.
In today's film fair, one of the members of this family — the King Jiang, sitting in the center of the screen smoking, the background of the northern black land on the bank, and the vision of the Chinese people of the year.
As with a smile, the red light of the group and the shadow of the royal giraffe have created a huge obstacle, and it seems to reveal the complex and complex aspects of this large family relationship.
It is reported that, in addition to the film, the daughter of the "Three Prince" Jiang was played by the actor, and the rest of the play was completed by the real conductors, the video's experimental listening style, broke the drama and the true border, and brought to the audience a whole new visual experience.
According to a leading presentation, the creation of the "Gird-Assistance" comes from "a day-to-day intention " , a series of changes in families like theirs to make the original film change without the final recording of the life of the film and release the pressure beyond design.
And how can we continue to face the kind of changes that bring us to this day?
There is no doubt that "Gird's intention" is a full-fledged, almost complete and innovative way of listening has become a film of life in front of the mirror, and under the bag of real images, viewers will find a picture of themselves and family from the film family, with the appearance of this family gathering in the film, and a series of thoughts.
NEWS.GOV.MO: New type-emergency virus infection should be monitored for heatline statistics (08H00-26 July 08H00)
A total of 292 telephone calls should be received from 08H00 to 26 July 2020, with a total of 292 calls for new type-emergency virus infections.
The 291 surveys on vaccination have been immediately forwarded to the representatives of the relevant sector, as follows:
Health Agency 271 (related to: investigation of separation; testing of nuclear acid; search of two maps; health code; other.)
17 of the Board of Governors of the Security Police (related to: search for exit measures; search for exits of both Australian-based vehicles; search for the hotline of the coastal politics; question of access to documents. )
The travel agency 1 (related to: question of separation of hotels. )
Education and Youth Council 1 (Related to: Search for ways for Australian students to return to England. )
1 of the Department of Marine Affairs and Water Affairs (related to: whether it is necessary to report to the Office of Marine and Water Affairs on the need for a nuclear test for Hong Kong vessels entering port.)
Balaancing the scene and a soldier's duty station.
In the middle of the year, a single room is set up in the mountains, and the camp is not far from the flag of the country, and the soldiers are stationed daily in the air, and they have to travel on a regular basis to higher ground patrols on the sea.
Soldiers climb up the rock floor, have to walk and use it.
The time is late in July, when the low-season area is fertile, and there is relatively dense green in the back of the camp.
At that point, six-year-old warriors pointed to the mountain, saying that it was their rear garden, and it was only seven months of August each year that they could see the green rose slowly, and soon all became yellow and were covered with snow.
It may take about nine hours.
In the bad old environment, the warriors who live here are always with snow and ice for years, and they also have to travel to the higher mountains on a regular basis.
Earlier, a patrol team consisting of eight warriors walked again under the lead of the leader's bow.
Each soldier weighs about 30 pounds, one big to the target.
One of the combatants on the way is emergency rescue.
In addition to patrolling missions, soldiers who are at the point of recuperating have to perform tactical and physical training every day.
Over a period of a second, the sea level increased, the oxygen levels increased, and the physical costs increased, which tested the will of the patrols.
They stick their teeth, cross a number of sides, cross a few emergency gates.
At about 16 hours, the patrols had lunchtime, and they had brought their own food, sat down in the area of 5700 metres at sea, and sat down with rain-drops, filling with food.
The fighters at Bala-Qahan are engaged in tactical and physical training.
During the rest, they will play cards together, and the family will be happy, and the family will be able to play together.
After a short rest in the cold, they mounted this patrol point, carrying a flag on the mountain and making a solemn vow.
They're the most secure defenders in the country.
Beijing Consumer Renewal Network
Beijing's activities are relaunched according to the principle of "total relaunching, focus planning, orderly progress and close organization" in Beijing.
On 26 July, a total of 15 million political customers were issued, including 1 million food purchases, 500 million intelligent products, and consumers were allowed to receive APP in Kyoto.
At the 25-day media conference, the Deputy Director of the Beijing Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Mei, presented further reductions in corporate co-financing, based on the maintenance of existing consumer card subsidies.
From August onwards, the current adjustment of 1:1 for government and enterprise funding was made at 2:1, such as the original consumer's receipt of a card to the store for 120 benefits, of which the Government grants $60, of which the company grants $80; of subsequent government subsidies $80, of which the company grants $40.
During the consumption period, three major operators will make up around 5G consumption subsidies for flows and terminals, further promoting new Beijing 5G base and 5G consumption.
The Hong Kong economy is calling for a new network at the time of the joint crisis.
On 26 July, the Director of Hong Kong's Financial Division of the Hong Kong Government announced that Hong Kong was facing a new outbreak of tuberculosis and that it had been attacked in the early stages of its recovery of the Suspension business and economic activities.
The Government of the Special Region once again called for a reduction in the rents of major small businesses, in conjunction with retail businesses, food and small businesses.
Zhao Poo published an article on the Internet entitled "The Way of Rehabilitation of the Skull."
He pointed out that Hong Kong’s recent New Year’s Eve had a high number of cases, a serious situation that affected social life and the economy.
In response to the vaccine, the priority is to prevent the introduction of a case and to address the virus transmission chain as quickly as possible; economic activities should be restored when the vaccine is controlled.
He noted that, in the face of a new outbreak of opportunistic epidemics, business in the Sussou region had been attacked, and economic activities had also been fought.
For the commercial community, social responsibility is equally important, in addition to the spirit of the contract, especially those groups that have received significant government subsidies in the "Secret Employment Plans".
He pointed out that Hong Kong's second quarter economic situation is still very serious this year, but the situation seems to slow down slightly.
On export, he felt that the external situation in Hong Kong was still serious.
Zhao-bao said that the development history of Hong Kong over the past decades has shown that every crisis has hidden new opportunities and every difficulty has hidden the keys to future development.
A few years ago, a winter morning in Johannesburg, South Africa, when I was driving to work, I found the city burned.
I'll drive there almost every day, but this is very unusual, I've never seen such a vision before.
Johnnesburg's unique interstellar name, but it's almost invisible that morning.
I soon realized that what I saw was a serious tumor caused by air pollution.
The beautiful environment that I knew of the past is compared to the distance between the sun and the sun.
I'm worried that it's possible that the sun's shadow, which once changed colors, will be covered by dark clouds.
At that moment, I felt a strong urge to do something, but I didn't know what to do.
All I know is that I can't just watch it by hand.
The biggest challenge is, I don't know environmental science, air quality management, or gas chemistry.
I'm a computer engineer, and I'm very sure I can't solve air pollution with the code.
(Laughter) What identity am I going to solve this problem?
I'm just a town boy.
In the next few years, I've learned a very important lesson, and if we want to achieve a better future, we should all remember this lesson.
Even if you're not an expert in a particular area, your professional skills may also include ways to solve the problem in that area.
Sometimes your unique perspective can trigger very normal thinking about the situation, but you need a lot of courage to try.
It's the only way you can know the results.
What I knew then was that if I wanted to try to change, I had to know enough about pollution, so I went back to a student.
I've done some basic research and soon learned that air pollution is the world's greatest environmental health risk.
The World Health Organization data show that in 2012, almost 14 per cent of the world's deaths were caused by domestic and surrounding air pollution, especially in low-income countries.
The mortality rate caused by air pollution every year is higher than malaria and AIDS.
In Africa, the early rise in unsafe health conditions, or the ill-equipped death of children, appears to be weak in the face of air pollution, while it also brings huge economic costs: according to the statistics of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, expenditure relating to 2013 exceeds $40 billion.
In my work, I've been looking for the results of science and technology, including the social relations of humans and machines, finding a useful point of order and helping us make better decisions.
When I think again about climate pollution, how to manage climate pollution, things become clear, we need to find a better way to make a better decision, taking into account the great issue, and co-operation is very important.
So I decided to meet some people who worked in this area.
I started an official dialogue with Johnnesburg and other nearby cities, and I joined the local scientific community, and I also phoned some people who were fully familiar with life.
These experiences that I've been involved have helped me to understand this more deeply.
It also helps me to avoid this man who tries to make innovations, sometimes falling into the trap: before he's really in trouble, he's using a technique fast.
I'm starting to think. What can I do to improve this situation?
I'm starting to ask myself, how I should be effectively integrated into my knowledge skills in software engineering and human engineering and the professional skills of my contacts.
I want to create an online air quality management platform, to reveal future pollution trends, to carry out relevant forecasts in order to determine what might happen.
I'm sure my idea could be a real solution, but also faced uncertainty, and I can't guarantee it's certain success.
(Laughter) Of course, for those who have been working in the field of air pollution for many years, my skills are completely new.
I slowly realized that sometimes a new perspective, a new set of skills, can happen things that are superior.
Our will and imagination is a guiding light, directing us through obstacles, opening up a new chapter.
I have developed a deeper understanding of climate pollution issues, found weather pollution data over the past ten years, as well as weather data from Johannesburg and around, and then I have created a system of air quality resolutions with South Africa and China, and sent them to the dark.
This software can analyse history and real-time data to reveal the trends of pollution over time and space.
We then use new machine learning technology to predict future pollution.
This means that residents can make better decisions on their daily routine and where they live and where they live.
We can predict adverse pollution incidents, define the source of serious pollution, and enable the relevant authorities to issue orders to adjust their operational activities.
By facilitating disaster planning, urban planners can make better decisions on how to expand infrastructure, such as the location of industrial areas.
We've built a first-hand experiment of that technology, run 120 days, covered all South Africa.
Our expected results have been confirmed, and the predictive data we show and the data we collect on our territory have shown a close relevance.
Through our management, we introduced the world's leading nuclear reactors, predicting the great quality of gas, its analyticality and correctness were all that had not been seen before, so that the early winter mornings of the city I entered would be beneficial. Then I said to myself, "Some things are wrong, I have to think about how to do."
So, the focus is: What if I didn't have a deep into the issue of major air pollution?
What if I don't care about the state's environmental situation, but I hope to send some people to some places, some people to take care of these things?
What I've learned from the middle is that when we're all convinced of one thing, it's important to focus on the possibility of success and consider the consequences of not being applied.
We should not be distracted by opposition and obstacles, it should encourage us to go further.
So no matter where you are in the world, the next time you find some kind of curiosity about your nature, excited and it's about what you want, you have some crazy or courageous ideas, even if it's not your professional field, ask yourself: Why don't you try?
Why don't you go ahead and solve the problem?
Maybe you'll get an accident.
Thank you all.
(Applause)
Newest earthquake in the eastern Pacific region of Taiwan this year
On 26 July, the Central American Society was the largest earthquake in the eastern Pacific region of 26 hours, 522 hours, and the largest earthquake in the 4th century. It was the largest earthquake in the entire area this year.
The Central Central Company, an electronic media report, such as Ettoday Newspapers, reported that the earthquake was located at 86.5 km south of the Government of East London, which is located in the eastern part of Taiwan, 53 km deep.
China's earthquake network has estimated this earthquake to be 5.5.
The largest earthquake in the whole area is the 4th floor, the 4th floor, the 1st floor, the 1st to 2nd floor, and the south floor, and the 3rd floor of the forest.
The Taiwan Meteorological sector noted that this time the earthquake was the largest in the whole of Taiwan and that there has been no cloudy earthquake in the area since this year, and that it has been more active in the past and in the past.
In the coming week, there is still no exception to the remainder of greater than 4 levels.
A lot of people think driving is one thing that only people can see.
The blind want to drive a single safe car until now, it's also considered an impossible task.
Well, my name is Dennis Hunt, and for the freedom and independence of the blind, we've created a car designed for those who have problems with vision barriers.
Before I talk about this blind man's car, let me just say something else I've done, called the U.S. Department of Higher Education, the city challenge.
It's about building a self-propelled machine car.
You start by pressing the key, not touching anything anymore, and it can reach its goal completely automatically.
At the 2007 challenge, our team won $5 million to win the third.
About that time, the National Association of Blinds, or the Association of Blinds, raised challenges to the design team about who could design a car that would make the blind independent of safety driving.
We think we're gonna try it, because we think, uh, where's this going to be?
We already have an automatic car.
We're just gonna let the blind people drive in there. That's not gonna work, is it?
(Laughter) But we're not wrong.
A blind conscience is not a car that can contain a blind person's confusion, but a blind person can take the initiative to make a choice and drive.
So we have to give up everything we've had from the beginning.
To test this crazy idea, we've designed a small satellite vehicle's original vehicle to test its feasibility.
In the spring of 2009, we invited a lot of black people throughout the country and gave them a chance to wind up using this car.
It's definitely a cool experience.
But the problem of this car is that its design only allows the blind to run in a very limited environment, like a closed stop-- even on a small road with red traffic.
So with this success, we decided to take the next important step, to create a real car that can drive on the real road.
How does it work?
Well, it's a relatively complex system, but let me explain, just simplify.
We have three stages.
We have a stage of emotion, a phase of calculation and a non-visual interface.
It's obvious that drivers are invisible, so the system needs to be able to sense the environment and collect data for drivers.
That's what we're using the initial measurement elements.
It measures speed, angle speed-- like a human ear, Neal.
I'm bringing this information together with the global position system to predict the location of the vehicle.
We're also using two cameras to explore the road.
We're also using three X-rays.
The radiation scan environment detects obstacles -- from the front, from the back, from the rear, and from any obstacle to the entrance, all around the vehicle.
All the information of the sea will then be collected into the computer, and the computer will do two things.
First of all, one thing is to deal with information about the environment -- which are the roads, which are obstacles -- and translate these information to drivers.
It's also a highly intelligent system that can figure out the safest road.
We can also issue instructions on how to operate vehicles.
But the question is, how can we convey information and instructions to the blind to ensure that he can run?
For this, we've designed many different non-visual user interface technologies.
The first three-phase sound system, the alarming back, the sound of the wheel, the legs, even the shoes on the foot.
But today we're talking about three of these non-visual user interface technologies.
The first face is called a driver.
It's a handcuff, and in the section, it's an alarming element, so you can transmit the instructions on how to conduct -- direction and magnitude.
Another device called a speed band.
This car chair-- actually, it's a motorcycle.
We're putting it out, we're reorganizing parts of different models, and we're going to send them information about speed, and there's also a way to use the oil door and the car.
Here, you can see how the computer understands the environment, because you can't see the quake, we actually installed red light two-way control over the driver, so he can see what's going on.
This is sensitive data, which is transmitted from the sensor to the computer.
So these two equipment, running hands and speed belts, is very effective.
But the problem is, these are the command signal device.
So this isn't really freedom, is it?
The computer tells you how to drive-- turn left, turn right, speed, drive.
I'm calling it an auxiliary flight problem.
So we're avoiding the signaling device, and more attention to the information device.
One typical example of this non-visual information interface is called the plane.
Look at this as an indicator of the blind.
It's a small table, with a lot of roofs on it, the pressure out of the air, so it can be described as a picture.
So even if you're blind, you put your hands on it, you can feel the road and obstacles.
Actually, you can also change the frequency of release in the air, which may also be temperature.
This is actually a dove user interface.
Here, you can see left, right-hand camera heads, and how the computer analyzes and transmits these information to the plane.
So, we're showing a simulation process, a blind person is using the plane.
This process is very helpful in the face of different types of non-visual users, for trainers of blind people and for quick testing of different theories.
It's basically how it works.
But this car is a model car, and it won't go on unless it's proved to be as safe as it is now, or safer.
I'm really sure this will happen.
But, is it social, can they accept this step-by-step idea?
How do we handle insurance?
How are we going to print the ticket?
There are many different obstacles behind the technical challenges that we need to deal with before we really become reality.
Of course, the main purpose of this project is to design a car run by blind people.
But what could be more important than this is the enormous value of the sub-products contained in this project.
It can be used to see the dark, rainy transmitter.
And this new interface, we can use these technologies to provide them with safer vehicles for visible groups.
Or for the blind, the daily household appliances -- educational facilities, office facilities.
Imagine a teacher in a classroom writing notes on a blackboard that the blind students can also use these non-visual interfaces to understand and read what the teachers wrote.
It's very precious.
Today, what I'm showing you is just a start.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Marinichev said that the change in value was affected by the lubricants and vaccines.
He said, "The service costs are increasing.
As a result of vaccination, more time is being spent on the Internet. "
Marinichev did not exclude annual Internet prices, which would have been seriously high, and he felt that operators could provide customers with a higher rate of service and replace the price-related inconsistencies.
The Chinese doctor is filming an anti-Viro-Newwanet.
In the near future, with respect for Chinese filmmakers against the virus hero, the leader of the Bona Immigrants Group was cold, led by a strong (to-left) presentation of the film production of the anti-Visive film "Doctor of China".
Bona's ambition is to be hired by the Chinese doctor, to all the doctors who fight in the field of immune control, who are respected by the vaccine workers!
In 2021, the film will be released as a national celebration of the 100th anniversary of the festival of the Communist Party of China.
Currently, with the deployment of the Central Declaration and the National Film Office, the National Film Office of the province of Strawster and the Film Office of the Province of Leiwe, organized the film "Chief Chief of China" filming "Chief of China" by a Chinese doctor, a film that reflects the country's strong leadership in the Central Party, the unity of the national peoples against New PhDs.
The video includes a series of violent attacks, which will serve as a human background, from a human point of view, as well as a unique screening, as well as a full range of sensitive Chinese medical personnel who are dedicated and self-sacrifice.
It is understood that the first time on the day of the end of the armed conflict, the Boena company has been overcome by serious difficulty in sending out a group of deep-rooted vaccinations, sharing information with hundreds of medical personnel, and collecting information, including the staff of the U.S. House of Commons, the first person to be interviewed, the first person to be in the state of Al-Qahan, and the first person to receive medical information, as well as the Wahan Bank, the Hughan Association and Hospital, and the former white angels on the front of the front line of the war, such as the Hughan Center Hospital, have produced a great deal of valuable video information.
In this conference, the Hong Kong Senator also expressed his hope and hope for the film: "I hope that you will not only visit a few prominent experts, but also more medical personnel who are suffering from headaches, most of them."
He said he had seen "Me and my country" "China President" before, and he thought that it was a good way to describe the story of the Great Sea.
"Now some foreign friends are still misinformed about China."
Commenting on the dissemination of the video, the U.S. President said that some people in the country now like to have a politicalization mark on the virus, and he hoped that the film could move the audience from a human point of view: "The film would be best to act abroad in a way that would be understandable to all outside the country and to act in a genuine human spirit to the public."
In the late 1980s, it was the most deep impression I've ever had on the post-opening film, or "the middle of the year", when my friends from abroad were watching, and if "the Chinese doctor" was able to play this role, it would be amazing."
It was said that if the Chinese doctor could cause the confusion of the foreign population, it would be very successful.
In the discussion, the President of the United States also shared views and recommendations on current international vaccine control, " I believe that people are always smarter than the virus. "
The U.S. said that despite the fact that it is difficult to predict the virus, from the original society to the present, mankind has passed thousands of risks, and today's society has developed medical and social management measures, as well as medical personnel from around the world, and even the elderly have a basic knowledge of the scientific response to New York’s epidemics, and people will no longer be as motivated as they were before, "the next focus of the work is to examine how the world is to strengthen cooperation and to focus on the comfort of people's hearts."

The Red Sea model, the icon of Mount Messa, the enchanting art of cosmos, the permanent meat... opened in the South Pacific Red Tourism Culture Festival on July 25, 2020.
As one of the main activities, the first exhibition of the Red Cultural Industry will be held at the tourist consultancy centre all over the mountain range.
The exhibition of the region's red-coloured products, the completion of the Revolutionary District's Tutor products, led to the purchase of all local tourists.
" This Red Council is a demonstration of the results of the national red culture industry, as well as an important platform to explore the development path. "
The Heads of the First Red Council presented the theme of the Red House's exhibition, which was the theme of the "Courage of Red Culture tours" for a total of almost 3,000 square meters, setting up the area around the camp, showing the border area and the Red Sea network procurement area.
He invited Zhao to attend, as well as to eight foreign municipalities in the West Bank, as well as 137 enterprises in the province of Sa, Asia, the Sun, and the state of Zhao, to exhibit a total of 768 exhibits, including red literature, crafts, food heritage, travel routes, Red Training courses, Red Creature products, etc.
The distribution area will be extended until 29 July.
As the owner of the Red House, it's the brightest spot in the area.
The district managers introduced the division of the chassis into the red industry and the development of the red culture industry.
The Red Industry Exhibition area presents 31 exhibitions of six companies, including the Green Line, the Red Cultural Development Area, the Red Series Library, the Red Series Food, and the Red Series Texture products, almost 200 products.
In the entertainment area, many visitors were attracted to handmade handmades and cut-off art.

Japan's new vaccines are estimated to be more than 30,000 new-waves.
According to statistics, 26 new cases of infectious diseases in Tokyo have been added to 239 cases, and more than 200 cases in 6 days have been added, and 11214 cases have been collected.
In addition, there are 141 new cases of infectious diseases, 90 new cases of tuberculosis and 80 new cases of tuberculosis.
The first half-year telecommunications network has been raising crime seven times as high-end features - in the new network.
On 26 July, the New Central Internet, according to the highest investigation website, this year, the national prosecutorial authorities jointly prosecuted 58101 people who committed fraud, with 35 per cent increase.
In particular, in crime prevention, there is a large number of frauds, and the prosecutions by the prosecution authorities represent 43.4 per cent of the total number of offenders.
The Supreme People ' s Prosecutor ' s Office has targeted guidance and has been issued in 10 cases of conventional vaccine protection control cases involving 9 cases of fraud.
From the case of the first half-year procuratorial institution, there are many names of fraud, national macro-political policies, including epidemics, "medical" fraud, "health care" fraud, "incarceration" fraud, "crowding" fraud, "crowding" fraud, "country subsidies, national assets fraud, etc., and constantly "proceeding new" concerns education, health, employment, retirement, social security, land degradation, poverty eradication, financial credit, and the economic development of the victims.
In particular, some telecommunications networks have distorted national boundaries, regional and personal constraints, including public, cross-border, remote, electronic payment characteristics, and a large number of vulnerable groups.
For example, specialized companies have been set up to rent high-level records, create multiple sectors or locations, use legal web platforms, recruits, train and examine recruits, employ business operating model management, and engage in "legal outer garments", which are more intriguing.
In accordance with the law, punishment and prevention of crime, early warning to the public and the relevant sectors is the responsibility of the procuratorial body.
In the case of judicial offices, the prosecution authorities have been committed to their duty to maintain high pressure on fraud and to promote social governance through law enforcement initiatives, such as through the issuance of prosecutorial recommendations.
The procuratorial authorities have seriously arrested, prosecuted the facts of fraud, evidence, procedural and legal implications, and have done so on the basis of legal justification.
In particular, it focuses on the core role of electronic data in the identification of facts, efforts to build electronic data, verbal evidence, and mutual evidence links between documents.
If the Prosecutor's Office of the Province of Ninpur Province is conducted in a case of counterfeiting, the prosecution's first time has been introduced, the case has been concluded, with only five days' duration, reflecting the attitude and determination of the General Assembly.
In the review of the arrest and review of the prosecution cycle, focusing on the prosecution of the accused, the correction of the arrest of 733 individuals by the public security authorities, and the termination of the prosecution by 113 persons.
In the first half of the year, the National Prosecutor ' s Office issued 298 recommendations on fraud, promoting joint prevention of fraud and promoting deep-level governance.
For example, the communications companies found in the procurement case, the Bank, the Inter-Agency Organization, as well as the gaps in telecommunications network regulation, the Public Prosecutor's Office in the province of Praeto City, the Eastern City Prosecutor's Office, have made a timely proposal to urge the relevant units to strengthen regulations, improve mechanisms to promote effective system-building.
Four is all we can do to track the damage.
The prosecution authorities in all areas are involved in investigating evidence, reviewing key sections such as prosecutions, urging the investigating authorities to actively reimburse payments, to work with the relevant sectors in order to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud to the population.
As in the case of a certain case of a block of credit in the Beijing City Prosecutor's Office, the case involved a 22-storey note that, where the property may have been previously disposed of by other cases, the first " temporary execution letter" was issued in time to the relevant courts, recommending that the court pre-trial investigation of the temporary implementation of the property concerned, identify the fact that the crime had been identified and make the greatest effort to recover the property involved and recover the loss of the victims.
The Prosecutor reminds all of us that there is a high warning against fraud and that we do not expect to throw a bullet in the sky, nor do we think it's easy to believe and keep our money bag.
The town of Winnipeg, in the state of Vienna, was torn down by the fruit tree and spread out of the new network in the middle of poverty.
2020-07-26 11:42:58 Source: China Economic Network Author: Suspension Editor: Suspension
The Chinese economic netizens went into the village of Winnipeg, in the province of Vienna.
On a hard day, the villagers were faithful to the base of the country, although they had a red face, but sometimes they sang a few words in their mouth.
The town of Wynn, where there is a low, high sea level, full of light, a low temperature, a high level of sugar, admirably, is famous in the surrounding area, but also because of its small size, a little bit more, it has not been able to sell a good price, and it has not been able to create a size of industry.
The town was a poor town in the "Cao-Cao-Cao-Cao-Cao's spring" with a local poverty rate of 25.8 per cent 10 years ago.
During the critical period of the fight against poverty, changing traditional cultivation habits, adjusting industrial structures, and increasing agricultural income in droughts.
After several visits, a group of people in Zhao-Shuang and the town remembered that industrial development could no longer go on its way.
To this end, the village has introduced the mining industry to modernize the harvest.
Wynin, Deputy Director-General of the Agricultural Limited, built the script from the west in 2015 to the village of Huang, where local conditions of cultivation were observed, starting in 2016 with local fruit trees.
In the beginning, Lio was moved by loyalty to transfer the land to the fruit tree, and Lio and his wife did so in their hearts: "The fruit has been produced so many years, and no one has ever seen the fruit grow in the village."
"The fruit of all kinds is fragrant fruit, which will not make the fruit grow too high."
The idea is that this time the fruit plant has adopted a new method of planting water under each fruit tree, water and fat to the root of the tree, the fruit of the tree, the fruit of the tree, and the fruit of the tree, the fruit of the tree, and the fruit of the tree, and the fruit of the tree, and the fruit of the tree.
At present, the wheat base has gradually entered the harvest period, and the market is not sold, as expected, by urban consumers, such as Beijing, the Upper Sea and Broadway.
The growing fruit industry has brought about a new change in the lives of Liu's loyalty, although it is still on the ground, but income has a new source.
Liu's loyals transferred more than 9 tons of land to the Nagou base, and in addition to the buried land flow costs each year, there are benefits of red, and the couple usually work in the base, "an 80 dollars a day, and an average of 80 dollars a year."
Leigh told reporters that last year, Liu received more than 2800 dollars in rent, plus the travel of land and the working income of the couple, and more than 80,000 dollars in income, "the day of rest is over."
"Now it has been effective at first, with a yield of more than $15 million per year, about 10 times that of corn. "
There are only 6,000 tons of fruit in the Central Sea village, covering 1,72 million farmers, including 656,2952 people, and more than $6 million in a year's salary, and the construction of the base at the door of the house is not required to go outside.
Liu's loyalty to the day of the package also begins to fulfill his "will."
This year's agricultural holiday, Lee was engaged to buy a bus that's going to work on today's car, "there's a couple more land in the house, wait for the next season's growth of the fruit base, and the whole turn to them, and more. "

Deployment of the "general effect"
A new type of mix of basic raw materials technology model
The report is reported by the journalist: In the past, the University of Pittsin's Space Environment and Bioenergy Team has made significant progress on the "Legal Degradation of Hydrocarbons" and has successfully developed new types of GHG equipment technology, which has significantly increased the capacity of carbon dioxide capture.
The results have been published as an international journal on greenhouse gases: Science and Technology.
The "genome effect" is a major environmental problem that interferes with human development, and CO2 emissions are caused by "general effect".
The effective capture and use of CO2 emissions is the concern of scientists.
"Separation Act" is a innovative carbon capture technique, which, with the aid of raw materials, is able to separate carbon dioxide from oxygen, which is efficient and efficient and operates a simple feature.
How to "petroleum" deep breath" enhances the efficiency of gas separation, which is used to capture carbon dioxide bottlenecks.
UNIFEM's innovative strategy to explore the impact of different pesticides on gas segregation through re-testation.
The results of the experiment show that the distribution of carbon monoxide in the raw material of N-Methyl chloride as a preparation agent has increased the "spatial" distribution of carbon dioxide, which has effectively increased the efficiency and speed of the dispersion of nitrogen gas.
With such new technology equipment, the depletion of carbon dioxide may be closely linked to the theoretical separation of such solid materials.
" New technologies have provided new ways of acquiring carbon dioxide from the law. "
" We hope that this technology will provide strong support for future fuel power plants and industrial enterprises to deal with smoking and play a major role in the control of greenhouse gas emissions. "
Before volunteer work, first find out what's the new professional class-in-the-new network.
20-07-27 02:22:36 Source: Recruitment
Before volunteer work, first find out what the professional level is.
Each year, students or parents are informed of their wishes, because they do not know the names of the volunteers involved, and they are affected by voluntary contributions.
This year, Beijing University of Transport, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing E-mail University, Beijing University, Beijing University, Beijing University, 5 High Schools at Beijing University, published a 2020 recruitment policy to eliminate professional barriers.
What does the professional difference mean, and what is important in volunteer coverage?
Three ways of professional distribution
The expert reminded that, prior to the completion of the voluntary service, there must be a detailed reading of the "retirement agenda" of heart schools, which includes the recording rules of higher schools, including the proportions of file transfers, professional allocation rules, etc.
The rules of professional distribution, after the high school refurbishment, are the main professional priorities, the number of priorities, and the three ways of professional disparity.
What kind of way the college will use will be clear in the "retirement statute".
However, there are also principles of higher education that are a general priority and there is no discrepancies between professions.
In other words, it would be considered in accordance with the general set of lists where the number of the first Professional Volunteers had not reached the number of the second Professional Volunteers, leading to the final professional will, and not to the difference between the professional volunteers.
The so-called "professional level" is one or several sub-values published in the Recruitment Statute when the School organizes a professional profession, which is a "professional level".
It is also the difference in the number of differences between the first and non-first professional volunteers at the level of the level of professional volunteers, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 points.
For example.
It was suggested that the student report to High School A should be reviewed by 560 points, whose professional will was, inter alia, computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, electronic commerce, professional recording of the A High School, a level difference of 2 points, 1 point, and 0 points.
In the course of professional distribution, if the first known professional will comply with the requirements for professional admission and the planned balance of the profession, the minimum entry into the " Computer" profession; if the computer is not registered, his number will be reduced by 2 minutes, the results of the first professional voluntary review of "International trade" by 558 points, and determine whether the conditions of professional admission are met; if the number is still unable to satisfy the requirements of "automation" of the third professional will"; if the number is still not satisfied, the second entry of the fourth profession (i.e. 556) will be reduced if the latter is still unable to fulfil its professional will, and the subsequent professional will not be reduced to such an extent.
Different level of professional choice at the University
With the level of equal will, many high schools have now eliminated professional misconduct, but some schools have also retained this approach this year, which is based on the "retirement agenda" published by the schools, with more than 20 universities established this year.
For example, the University of Chewie Agriculture, the University of Shandong, the University of Chemistry, the University of Medicine, the University of Chemistry, the University of Chemistry, the University of Chemistry, the University of Chemistry, the University of Chemistry, the University of Chemistry, the University of Chemistry, the University of Chemistry of Medicine, the University of Chemistry, the University of Chemistry, the University of Chemistry, the University of Chemistry, the University of Apology, the University of Chemistry, the University of Chemistry, the University of Medicine, the University of Chemistry, the University of Chemistry, the University of Medicine, the University of Chemistry of Medicine, the University of Medicines, the University of Chemistry, the University of Medicine, the University of Chemistry of Medicine, the University of Medicine, the University of Chemistry of West, the University of the University of the University of Medicine of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University,,
In these universities, the level of professional qualifications is not the same.
Some colleges have had a poor level in each profession, such as the University of Ninsha, where the record has been sent to the school's examiner, and after a reduction in the number of sequences, according to the order of the examinations, according to the professional will.
Some universities have established different levels of professional misconduct between different professions.
For example, at the University of the United States, the total Professional Voluntary Division is 4 points, i.e. the first Professional Volunteers and other Professional Volunteers are 3 points, the other Professional Volunteers are not appointed, and the other Professional Volunteers are considered to be equivalent, and the other Professional Volunteers and Amplifiers are 1 points.
In the case of voluntary contributions, parents and parents must carefully read the recruitment policy of the school in which they are reported, see if there is a professional error, how the level is different, and at the same time, give reasonable analysis of the selected schools and professions, and if the schools clearly take the digital differences into account in the recruitment chapter, and consider the degree between the professions, and increase the rate of recording.
