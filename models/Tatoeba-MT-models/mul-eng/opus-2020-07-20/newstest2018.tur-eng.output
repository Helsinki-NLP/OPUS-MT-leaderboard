Last minute: Cosmic Visitor Dev Asteroid 2014 JO25
There are perhaps billions of other celestial bodies that can cause serious consequences when they travel across the solar system.
The path of these objects that are hidden from the creation of the sun can sometimes cross the Earth.
Asteroid over 650 meters 2014 JO25 will be such a visitor and will pass at 14:24 am to Earth’s nearest location at 1.75 million km.
As the day went by, we became more and more eager to hear this kind of news.
The most important reason for this is the development of surveillance techniques and surveillance tools.
We also have an opportunity to identify asteroids of a smaller size that are not previously identified.
For example, during the past month of Ocak, an astrophylaxis passed just half the world and the moon (~250,000 km).
And even more interesting asteroids have only been identified a few days ago.
So there may be other cosmic buses that come up to us right now.
What would you do if you learned that you had a 20-foot asteroid that you found in the middle of the area?
Actually, this size doesn't destroy your asteroids, but it's probably going to blow up all the buildings.
This will also be the reason for the shock waves spread from asteroids that infect the atmosphere.
For example, in 2013 the asteroid came to Russia in these sizes and was able to divide the windows of buildings in several cities.
But if you have an asteroid space within 100 meters, you'll be at least 50 km away from your recommended space.
These are the effects that determine the depth of the crater and the damage it causes, such as the size of the asteroid and the openness of the attack.
Let's look at a few scenarios, according to the simulation of the European Space Agency.
If an asteroid at 100 m is opened at 45 degrees per second, it will become a crater about 250 metres deep and about 1200 meters wide.
The brushing Richter is worth 6 times the size of the depremium, and even if you're 10 km above the point of the strike, it's 3 degrees closer to your body.
It's gonna be 50 miles away waiting for the windows to be broken.
If you hit an asteroid in about a mile, it's gonna take a little more hearty.
It's the same open and fast value that such an asteroid hits the Earth in about 600 meters deep and a crater within 12 km.
I mean, a husband turns into a crater, and he'll be gone soon.
Even if you're 100 km away from the point of impact, the result of the shock is 3 degrees closer to your body.
According to Richter's estimate, it's worth eight times as much as the depremist.
The damage that asteroid will cause is not only the chemical combination of asteroid, but also the structural structure of the region that will impact it.
The above values were given from the heart of the scenario, when an asteroid, like a hard rock, fell from a torrentous landscape.
If the asteroid is mostly made of iron, if it falls to the surface of the lavender, the crater size will rise 3 times and the damage caused by it will also be reduced.
Before this, 66 million dinosaurs had experienced something better and the result of an asteroid attack of about 10 km away.
Because of the asteroid attack, 75 percent of the sea and black animals died.
If the dinosaurs were to destroy this great asteroid of Earth, it would be to leave the planet with the most healthy choice.
Every day, the earth is filled with tons of matter.
Most of this is burning in the atmosphere.
It's enough that some of the big skies are due to what's known as the source of stars among the peoples in the atmosphere.
Let's end up with another message that will ease our writing.
The results show that there's no reason for a massive asteroid to hit the Earth for 300 to 400 years to come.
I'm sure it's been a relief for us as living creatures who have lived for 70 years.
Flash for Medel: 10 million euros!
Gary Medel, who is clearly looking forward to joining the Stoper region, is looking forward to seeing the name of the Black-Whites from Inter in the day...
The 30-year-old football player, who started working with the Internet in the past few days, is looking forward to his next offer.
Italy's prestigious newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport, both the stopper and the former liberal region, pointed out that Medel has made a 10 million-euro bid for the Inter.
When it was said that the Black-Whites who offered it to Medel were both expected to respond, it was said that the Chilean footballer was warm enough to live with his family in Istanbul.
Kara Karatal, who is limited by the FFP against the idea of Gazzetta, is very difficult to pay for a bet like 10 million euros for Medel.
The Black-Whites are likely to join the star player in a cadre while driving to Medel by way of rent, as is the case with Caner Erkin's transfer.
Fraction of transfer currently completed.
Human rights alert for Missouri Group has been issued
The National Colourling People's Movement has issued a warning on behalf of the country's foreign policies and terrorist attacks for the colourful people who travel to Missouri.
The group's report says: "The Missouri State of the NAACP Travel Council will pay special attention to the fact that African-American tourists, visitors and Missouri are present in recent times during summer and summer events in the country, as indicated there, when travelling to the end of the country, as it is indicated."
NAACP said that a new Missouri law has made it difficult for people to obtain separate cases, while the country's legal applications have made it extremely difficult to achieve their objectives, and that the group is involved in publishing this travel warning.
Human rights have been violated.
They stop because of the color of their bodies, they fight and they kill."
"We hear complaints where we haven't heard before."
This is the first time such a warning has been issued to a U.S. state.
The group set out an example of the deaths of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee, who was a student of the Black students at the University of Missouri.
At the beginning of this year, Sanders was arrested by the Missouri police, and he died under suspicious conditions.
In addition to the advice, the Mission's Office of Public Prosecutors is paying attention to a new report that shows that there is a likelihood of more stop in the 75th century, according to the whites of the northern driver.
Chapel said, "The advice is to warn people to be awake and to warn their families, friends and working friends that they may be in Missouri."
"Let people bring money together, let them know what they will go through the country, and be ready."
According to the latest figures in the FBI's hate crimes programme in Missouri, 100 hate crimes were committed in 2015; this is the country's number of similar crimes in 16 countries.
The travel warning is related to a new Missouri law, which makes it more difficult for a worker to make a difference when buying a business or working out a business.
Previously, for the American Civil Liberties Unit (ACLU) Texas and Arizona, the travel advice has been published after the law of immigration has been passed by these countries, and ACLU says it will increase their implementation accordingly.
Travel warnings are generally issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries, but in recent times, defence groups have applied this approach in response to a set of laws and practices within the United States.
Fractional portion completed
Two weeks ago, the Chinese team of Shanghai Shenhua, 13 million euros, returned to the North-East Demba, which had been transferred to Shanghai Shenhua and was hired by the North-Easters during the last season."
Kara Kartal, who asked for a health report last week from the Senegalese player, moved after the report from the football player.
The Black-White Administration, which started working for a 32-year-old player who was not thinking about the season before our Chinese representative, opened the door of the Shanghai team.
Couldn't write to list
Dumba B, the Black-White, who is not listed on the list, sent me to the administration that he wanted to return to China for the sake of his foreign status.
The Chinese team agreed to divorce a 32-year-old player.
The Senegalese football player is expected to sign a formal contract to reach Turkey in our day.
Castillo was operated in Trabzonspor
In a statement on the website of the Bordo-Mavili club, Castillo's son, in Istanbul's Liv Hospital, has performed an artoscopic menu operation on the left, saying, "Prof. Dr. Success Rights is expected to begin training with a team within 4 weeks."
Castillo, the board-man team in Slovakia, was driven from the right-hand side of the game that the team played with Heerenveen in the Netherlands.
For the purpose of the treatment, it was decided that the Colombian player, who would stay away from 3-4 weeks, should also be treated for the previous menu problem.
Get out of Barzan!
On the third anniversary of the attack on the Ezidads in the heart of DEAŠ, the terror bomber made a speech at the memorial ceremony in Duhok's home during the 3rd anniversary of the attack on the Ezides in the town of Sincar.
In his speech, Barzani, who was referring to the independence that KIBY wanted to set up on 25 July, said: "I must express this by regret, and we have no hope that Iraq will be a right and just country."
We tried all our ways with Iraq, but we were desperate and desperate.
The past experiences we've had with Iraq have brought us into this state, and there's no guarantee that we can take our rights and protect them.
That's why we need to show that all of us will be able to establish our global code by means of my reference to life and security.
I need to draw the bottom of that, and the reference is not a goal for us, but a tool to achieve a greater goal.
After the fall of Bas Rejimi in 2003, Barzani, who remembered that the Central Iraqi government had been in many promises for Kurts, said he had decided to refer directly after the fight with DEAS.
Barzani, who wanted the people of IKBY to defend themselves and their development and democratically want to establish their destiny, said, "The Belgians have come to believe that Iraq cannot protect us or protect us as a government."
"We don't want to move on," he said.
During the terrorist attacks with DEAS, the Iraqi Central Government did not give them weapons but, in a short time, recorded Barzai, who was immediately legalized by Shabi and showed that all weapons were provided:
In Iraq's defense system, Pesmerge was not caught.
The central government didn't do it to Shabi.
Peshmerge, according to her mother, is recognized as part of Iraq's defence system.
However, when Shaby's mother did not exist, all the possibilities were repeated by breaking the laws.
We're not saying we're against Shabi right now.
Pashmerge and Hasidi Shabi, fought at the same time, and why, when Hasidi Shabi was legalized, the existence of Pashmergen and the fight against terrorism are undermined.
These are our profound hurts with the Qur'an.
On August 3, 2014, a terrorist attack on the Ezides of the Sincar River in Musul was launched on 3 August 2014 and killed many of the people between women and children.
He's been back from the scene for 10 minutes.
According to the BBC report, the air France air traffic type Boeing 777 was located in the North Korean airspace of Hokkaido, north of Japan.
The authorities who recorded that the plane landed in the area where it was located 10 minutes ago recorded that the plane was expected to reach 100-150 kilometres.
The statement made by Air France stated that the plane did not interfere with the flight and that the word was not a problem in the flight.
He explained, "The information we have at our disposal indicates that the plane of the plane falls to the sea more than 100 kilometers away."
Nothing sacred?
Trump's White Saray is now targeted by the Freedom Agency.
The most specific sign of the regim change is the beginning of attack on the brains.
The Americans know as much about it as anyone else, and the result is that Saddam Hüseyin, who was personally involved in the 2003 reign of Firdos Meydade in Baghdad...
Stephen Miller, one of the key organizers of the Trump regime, was aware of what the CNN and Jim Aosta had done in an infamous dispute over the illegal transfer of property, while destroying the Republic of Germany in a symbolic form.
If it was to be fair, Miller didn't attack himself.
If he did so, the owner of a full boat and the owner of his freedom would have bound him.
But she attacked her husband, and especially after 17 years of complete self-expression in 1903, Emma Lazarus was added to the famous nursing home.
Miller, when he came out to Acosta, said, "I don't want to talk about history here from the beginning, but the Freedom Agency... is a symbol of the world's freedom of America.
What you're talking about has been added later, and it's not part of the original Freedom Department."
Miller's really right, but as he said, it's not really about history.
This seems to be because Lazarus's opening words are called upon, not just a few elderly immigrants, but a government that invites the poor and the hungry, "Yorgun, the poor, / the disabled people are in despair of receiving the spirit of freedom, / I'm going to press on the desire of the poor."
There's never been such a time in our "unwilling" screens.
Miller didn't bring an update; he explained that the people didn't like Trump in the U.S.
The conflict in the domain of an island is a broader political and cultural war: it is actually an conflict with the American mines.
After Lazarus and his death, his friends knew very well that they had been involved in a political action to put his words on the foundation of the temple.
Heykel, French and American civilizations were intended to use their connections to celebrate the physical progress of women in the form of freedom.
Lazarus had changed his mind: The woman’s viewpoint was no longer sad, and there was a voice.
And he has a very different name for himself: Mother of the Survivors.
His wife's marriage is a rather feminist attack on a woman's marriage and a devastating attack on the American mover.
And just like Lazarus's changing the temple, the doctors wanted to change it for a long time.
For the coming of Trump, the great procurator, Russian Limbaugh, who was one of the kind of Baptist John, warned him that in 2010 he did not invite anyone into the U.S. fire, but more recently, he was a neocon in the dark world, saying, "Mother Freedom is on the rise.
He's got his free will to move from the United States to the rest of the world.
The dream is not to explain the way to the United States."
In a way that I'm not very busy, Limbaugh actually discovered something.
Heykelin's mind was about the whole opening of the beginning.
Lazarus's wonderful creative action was to see it as if it were seen after the long and most terrible journeys by the weary but desperate men on the shores of the ships.
It was really about seeing the world, the world, a place of refuge, and people who want to improve their lives.
His adversary, the Devil, threatened to devour them with words of hope and a burning fire that they needed to hear.
Of course, this is not a prospect that Miller and Trump will find the right way.
It's not their dream to show the way, but their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black is joining the Scottish members of the Great Britain team
Elid Doyle remembers when only two Scotchs were allowed to join the Great Britain team.
United Kingdom Performance Director Neil Black says 16 people in the World Championships will provide "a "distance-based" team.
The record number of Scotch athletes was selected for London, which started on Friday 2017.
Black believes that "something's going to develop" in Iceland and that the United Kingdom should learn from this.
Black said, "We're mine, and we're trying to understand it, and we're gonna get out of work."
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it's about what they're doing.
He thinks Scotch is concerned about what he's doing.
Brittany: He thinks it's about what they're doing.
That's the guy in the street.
Whatever the combination of conditions, that's definitely great."
Laura Muir and many Scotch athletes, including Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah at 5,000 metres, were elected by Elid Doyle as captain of the band.
"The sun's a little low.
The captain's speech was incredible," Black says.
"No matter where they live or practice, several athletes have become too proud and really motivated out of the room.
I've been holding Elid's in a natural way, and it's really amazing."
The fifth World Championship, which will be fought at 400 metres of the world's gold medal, says the 16 Scots is "unbelievably" in British teams.
The world champions of Iskoshia were the best group of athletes to win in 1983 and 2015.
Five years ago, Brittany and two Europeans, the middle deputy leader Muir.
It's going to be 1,500 m and 5,000 m.
Another Scotch to be watched during a very good season, including the British team trials and the violence in the Year's Games, which took place in 1500.
Doyle, remember the first champion in the team, Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team says that many of his citizens will not only join the team, but in some cases he will fight for the medal and fight for the finals.
He added: "It was a great honor to be the captain of the army that the other members of the team were acting as the captain, but it was special for me to know that your team friends made the noise for you and chose you."
"I'm obviously proud of all the Scots in the team.
This shows how far we've gone.
And they're here as self-tested athletes, as those who help me out of the podium.
When you get to the captain's talk?
Yeah, I think he's fine.
I've benefited from the fact that we're very lucky in this situation, because of the fact that there's a World Championship in our house.
So we can't really succeed in returning to the Olympic Stadium, which is the only way to benefit from this internal support.
I have a second chance to go out there and fight, and there will be such a wonderful atmosphere."
Disable plug-ins on Facebook: do not use government tasks if you don't want to remove voters' extensions
Our country's father had a lot of information about getting a place.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the paper didn't take it very long to start making it hard to talk about anything from internal politics to politics.
Of course, it's not easy.
But those who added it did not stop it.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "The freedom of speech can be removed from the middle, and we can be led in a foolish and silent manner."
This brings me to Larry Hogan, Maryland, who needs more work to be like Washington.
Hogan's staff prevented and deleted the participation of at least 450 people who wanted their views on his official Facebook page.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Unit accused him of this week.
Valin's staff didn't care if the case was not serious, and the translators were full of "Who's in mind?"
Many people said, "This is just Facebook."
But it's important.
It's especially important when you're like Hogan.
It's a very popular community fair in a democratic state.
He's got the second highest level in 50 provinces in the country.
Hogan's not a fucking idiot.
He showed restraint in his leadership and in his dealings with the princes.
He was also very reluctant to use Facebook as the first tool to connect to his voters by arranging his later hairless head with a smile.
So it's dangerous to prevent people who have a public forum that is officially designated as a public service forum and who pay the public's taxpayers' tax dollars from being held on the side of the street.
In a report with The Washington Post, Hogan's female speecher Amelia Chasse defended the construction of the wall, claiming that the obstacle was not too much to correct them.
But it's very easy to use the images of trollers or spammen or people who hate translation attacks.
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were stopped by Hogan.
And these are the true men who speak only of the leaders chosen: a teacher, a man of work, and a priest, and not a fool.
He said that all of his interests were not respectable, considerate, and ungrateful.
Dad made a receipt from the Bible in his share of Hogan's Catholic faith.
Maryland Bowie's lawyer, Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, was not full of hatred, but he asked questions about hate crimes.
He wrote to the section of The Post's report, "I've done my best to make him feel sorry for his hate crimes and for the other news that is about to happen."
"I also don't like the idea that when many people complain about the same thing, I don't like the idea that a large group of people who are worried about me will not come to see me as a collective effort."
Others will probably refer to Valin's staff as the "increased spam attack".
The Facebook version makes it easier to get an e-mail message to fit it easily by shutting down a client or by deleting a message.
It's much cleaner than the old days when a person is sent out to collect and burn the papers that are printed, or to arrest the protestors and stop them.
But even if it's digital, that's exactly what happened.
Hogan, Facebook and other social media are not the first civilian mission to activate.
President Trump is being tried by Twitter users who are banned on Twitter.
One of the decisions that could be referred to in the future on this matter came from Virginia last week.
According to U.S. Governor James C. Cacheris, the U.S. Department of Directors of the Loudoun Region, the U.S. Department of Management, in Alexandria, made a difference to the First Parental Change, according to the U.S. Governor James C. Cacheris.
In Kentucky, Vali Matt Bevin (Communicator), Facebook and Twitter were also visited by ACLU.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington, there was a very similar effect on the internet of the commercial post office.
Between 1775 and 1800, the number of newspapers was reduced to four years, and anonymous mailmen were attracted to his leadership.
Even then there were unknown trolls in Washington's name.
"Juricola", "Vallerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote letters that put the decisions of all people under the feet of Washington.
According to George Washington, a translator who collects historical documents, he has established a polling office that will add to the situation with Britain regarding Friendship, Ticaret and the Seafarer Agreement.
But he did not stop them.
I mean, being a lawyer and paying freedom takes place at the very heart of your country.
True leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes that the Renaissance Club will be at home in peace.
An old European number, Ronan Rafferty, hopes that the house will be in peace during the 25th edition of the Renaisance Club in South Lothian.
In Archerfield Links, Paul Eales, who is finally taking over the lead of the next door, has a new connection to the region, and is acting as the founder of the club and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
Rafferty said, "I've been watching the Renaissance Club build, and we've seen you experience it together with this organization."
Players will see the stage in a state of prosperity.
Jerry set up this place and got a job in the fields.
He's a champion of this game, and he's proud of the success of this game.
This is a great show for this area."
Although he won the English Eales and the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour, he will be the first in 32 years in his career to defend the champion.
Southport central player said, "This really feels special."
"I didn't have the chance to protect the Extramarital Open because it was taken out of my next calendar of the year I won.
It's nice to return to this part of the world.
It's a great place to play golf.
It's been a very special year for my wife Sharon and me to win last year.
It was a very special time, and we will always remember it with love."
Gary Orr, who has joined the European Senior Tour this year, is also returning to his own stage.
This organisation will be the first Scotch in Iceland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
Helensburg man Orr said, "When you fight inside, it always means a little more meaning."
"You want to do good, but you feel too much pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played the basic golf game.
I'm so happy to go."
This was attended by three; former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrence takes a place between 6 Scots in the stadium; others include Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Turkey's biggest propaganda campaign!
Yeah, I'm talking about the Department of Diagnostics!
Yeah, I'll tell you if you don't see the President's hospitality!
It's days... I'm looking for answers to my question...
I'm wondering why I'm getting caught from the cover of the no-show.
I read every article about sending.
Not at all.
I can't find the answer to the problem I'm looking for.
In the beginning of this year...
I don't know, DIB has prepared the Strategic Plan for the DIB 2017-2021.
The mayor of Erdoğan took over 1 million litres of S 600 model Mercedes.
So he didn't have a problem with Erdogan.
So what happened?
You can say, "Is it not enough for seven years?"
First DIB President, Mr. Rıfat Börekzi, has been in charge for 17 years.
All of you know, Nuri's been sitting in that chair for 11 years.
I mean... the task of the President is open.
I'm going back to the question, "Why is mercy invisible?
I got it.

Then a crier said: "The Most Beneficent (Allah) has not come to you in the least."
The code for this group is: He didn't have any sense!
And the guy who spent the whole thing behind it said, "You've found a modernist by globalization."
I mean, there was an invisible novelty.
What does it mean to be young?
The reason for the problem was that he was on an outside trip to see Mehmet.
Date: 27 April 2015.
He went to Iran to attend the 29th Vahdet Conference, which aims to bring his Islamic objectives closer to the Tahran.
Iran's religious leader met Ayetullah Ali Hamaney.
And he was obedient to Allah, keeping his religion pure for Him.
And in the conference he said, "The Councils are schools that represent different ideas and ways of understanding in Islam."
The purpose of all things is to make known to Allah that which is with Him.
Everyone is on a road that leads to the mother, but they will have the same place.
It is never acceptable to compare or see the opposite with the common people, to look at their traditions of Islam.
It's the edge of the puzzle-based diffusion, overheating and confrontation and the edge of the puzzle.
In the case of the clergy, it was the worst of all religions...
I want to re-shape the sub here:
The Shillers and the Suns are the only people...
"No one can deny another because he has not lived up to his senses."
A year later...
Only Caferi's leader from Turkey attended the 30th Vahdet Assembly on Friday.
I mean...
It's not a coincidence. Help.
The speech he made at the conference that he went to Iran to show hospitality led him to become the target of "geneological behaviour".
The next Tahran conference represented the Turkish government - again - that's why no one was involved.
And he had not been invited four times since he had come to the service.
The reason was obvious; the Chinese in the DIB -- Iran's "geneological move" against Iran.
After the Iranian journey, the bridge of Mehmet Seemez, which began in 2016, began to be broken down.
First of all, the DIB was responsible for the rescue of Prime Minister Noman!
I don't see it so much, he wanted to connect to the DIB.
It's your job.
There was a difference in the state's view of Christmas.
Theoretical worlds were created in Saudi Arabia and Egypt's "geneological context", and the Sunniity of the U.S. island of Vehhabi-Selefic!
These were Iranians who did not even take advantage of Tahran.
It was not surprising to say about the undeserved kindness shown by Cubeli Ahmet: "Dianet has not been threatened by this."
My Lord, make for me a righteous nation, and a righteous nation.
They used the "all-embracing" as a symbol of Iran's enemy.
The CIA-supported presence of Iran by FETÖ was now running new names.
It's with the top of the FETU compass...
A young photo found in the hand of Viski was used by the media with the lie "The Son of a Mercy Not to See"!
Oh, shit!
Who's the largest media lecturer to show no mercy? The U.S. Journal of the Cimaati in the U.S. Army is Turkey!
As a result...
- The chance of not bringing the Suudi Vehhabi-Selefi line...
- The one that doesn't see the difference...
Modernist... a religious man was destroyed by a "general movement" created during the Cold War...
The U.S. cultural imperialism continues to rapidly negotiate Turkey (to do Vehhabi-Selefi).
Don't worry that the future Director will be a Vahhabi-Selefi representative!
"We support the protection of Turkey's sovereignty."
He went to China for a visit to the Foreign Minister's office.
President Pekin organized a joint press meeting with the Chinese Foreign Minister Vang Yi in the state of Beijing.
Vang, "We hope Turkey will become more active in international affairs."
China will support Turkey in its efforts to protect its security.
"We hope Turkey will be united with the international community that includes the Philippines," he said.
He said, "In the context of a close relationship between Turkey, regional and international interests, international interests are not alternative but complementary to one another."
Spiritual image begins second time
The leadership of Hasan Ruhani, who won the election of the government held in May in Iran, was approved by Ayetullah Ali Hamaney, the country's leader.
Hasan Ruhani, the second president elected in Iran, swore that the country's religious leader, Ayetullah Ali Hamaney, was also involved.
Turkey's Tahran High Commissioner for Turkey has joined the Hakan Tekin, because the top-level military and political names have been joined by foreign representatives.
The ceremony will begin after the ceremony of the ceremony on Friday, August 5, which will be held for four more years as the president.
The order is expected to be joined by President Nihat Zeybekci, representing Turkey.
Security front-ends at the gate of the prison
Human aid, food, medicine, and cleaning materials will not be granted from the Cilvegós border door in the Reyhany Valley of Hatay.
According to the information received, the border between Turkey and the border gate of Babel Airport and the rest of the region has been closed to the pipeline outside the outer barrier of human assistance, shelter, medicine and sanitation.
It's allowed to come out of the border gate.
No information was provided on how long the word was going to be restricted.

Before the mergers were made, it was only after a reference to an argument that the 1026-year-old was forced to vote in general by a strong pressure on his ability to vote, after which Indonesia was absorbed in 1969 by an old Dutch colony in the mountains of Papua.

The poorest region of Papua and Indonesia is the poorest region of the population of 28% living under the poverty line and the worst child death in Asia.
But at the same time, this is Indonesia's sixth country.
Freeport McMoran, central Phoenix, has the largest and most expensive gold mine in the world, Grasberg, a mountainous region in New Jersey and only 60 miles away from Paniai, which has 153,000 inhabitants.
It was only in 2015 that Freeport returned $3.1 billion in gold and silver.
In addition, Papua has over $78 billion, which is estimated to be worth it.
What is more, these riches, which are a source of separatism for the Papayas, make Indonesia's mighty army have an enormous existence.
A survey of New York Times in 2005 revealed that Freeport paid approximately $20 million to local military personnel and libraries between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 given to one sub.
The pope's more autonomic call threatens the golden calf, and without mercy it comes from their rights.

"It's hard to calculate the number of victims every week because they're events."
Papua's resources have been increased because Indonesia's resources have been increased because of its location.
The 3.5 million minds of the region are divided by 83% of Christians, but most of Indonesia's islands are transformed from Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi to economic goals.
He sells a gado-gado served with a sauced chicken and a sauced dish.
The local people are forced to rehabilitate.
"The hunters sell pigs and pigs in traditional markets more cheap than the local populace," explains Abeth You, 24-year-old of Panaii, moved to Japan.
"That's why the local populaces and the populace's moms have lost their market."
Joko Widodo, also known as Jokowi, promised to resolve his differences and rights in Papua in the 2014 election campaign.
As the old Assassin, on the way to Jakarta's capital building, Panaia took 27 of the 29th of Papuan territory.
But there's little change in Papua and the local people feel betrayed today.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted to Jokowi, hoping that justice will be restored." You say.
In fact, Panai lived only two months after Jokowi's mission began.
On April 7, 2014, a group of 11 children outside Enarotali were hit by two Indonesian soldiers on the motorcycle when they were singing Christmas songs in front of a ethnic fire in Enarotalia.
The scared kids told them they had to open their doors.
One of the soldiers entered their ranks, and the local priest Yavedt Tebai returned with four soldiers later.
He told the victims and witnesses that the army who had taken alcohol was fighting and fighting with their rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot the boy's group.
Julianus Yeimo, a 16 - year - old boy, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the government's election commission was set on fire, and the next day events began to unfold.
Up to 1,000 Papuan men, women and children were gathered to seek justice at a football court in front of the local police station and military command.
They carried regular horses and played the wata dance of the village of Mee Pago in Papua (maybe by running and measuring the bird's passage).
Some protestors started throwing rocks at the police and the military station.
When the sirens returned, they were ordered to the soldiers with their own radio broadcasts: "If the majority of them show more than three times as loud as they are, kill them."
Jeremiah Kayme (56), the head of Kego Koto's premises in Enerotali, saw the approaching danger and asked for a petition to be sent back to the majority.
Nobody wanted to listen.
She told Time, in the sweating of a beautiful house with bright colors, "When I turned around, I was shot out of my left arm."
Kayme doesn't know who's still shooting, but she says the bullet's coming from a bunch of soldiers.
"It's a disaster, it's been burned many times."
Alfius Youw was shot three times as a witness to the attack.
John, who was known only by the name of many Indonesians, said, "I ran to him, and I dug his body to make sure that it wasn't."
"I saw him die, I loved him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told the delegates that their members were "taken under the flag" because it was under attack.
In 2015, the Papuan police spokesman Shube, Director Pudjo Sulistio, said, "We have to defend ourselves when people threaten us with murder."
"This is the subject of death."
According to the Human Rights Council, five young protestors were killed and many were injured.
The news of the deaths reached Jakarta only the next day.
Jokowi made a brief statement three weeks later in Jaapura that he shared the pain of his victims' families and promised to resolve the historical systolics in Papua.
He said, "I want this boat to be solved immediately so that it won't go away again."
In October 2016, Security Council Warranto said he established a non-remarkable mechanism for historical human rights.
But the rumors almost started.
"Most of the people have been before.
Some in the 90s and some in the early 2000s.
It's because we have to decide to solve these problems, but we have to go through."
Wiranto, who spoke to TIME in Haziran, said that there was no complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "They'll all be solved by the law."
In 1999 in East Timor, U.S.A., Viranto said that 11 percent of people in Paniai, including Papua, had already been killed by the civil war.
The families of the teenage victims faced this type of criticism with bitter suspicion.
"I was invited to meet four times in the past three years, but there was no progress."
"I'm old."
She says years later she's still in fear.
"I'm scared."
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the army, I'm afraid of being shot."
Brother Yacobus repeats his encounter with the people of Paniai who are afraid of discussing the situation.
He says he was attacked by the military after he helped four of his victims into hiding.
He says, "After the tears have been covered, the army has come to call me."
The attacks have not stopped yet.
The next day, Paniai's neighbor, Deiai, fired the Indonesian police on the village.
The villagers were killed during a conflict between the management of a construction company that refused to help a man who did not own a hospital, and 17 children were injured among them.
When the fish was caught, Ravianus Doow, 24-year-old, buried on a nearby island, died.
Local residents organized protests in front of the company's chance office.
The police said that the villagers were throwing stones at the mayors, and that they were acting like they were shooting.
But the local people say that they set fire to the majority and killed someone.
The 29-year-old Domingu Badi TIME, a Witness who lives near the hospital, says, "We're very panicked, we're afraid of being attacked."
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
He called on the House of Commons to be held accountable for the members involved in this work and to remove the presence of the active police force from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem area for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful progress, the disillusionment of the peoples of May, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the mountainous region of Papua New Guinea.
Many of the populaces were involved in the Free Papua Movement (OPM), which claimed to protect the Indonesian soldiers by attacking the rights of the popes.
Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya come from Paniai.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai were arrested and taken hostage in recent years by the military under the "protection of my country".
He's never seen some again.
Paniai is known among the Papua peoples as a "tricky and forgotten place."
Poverty is the root cause of unhappiness.
It's very expensive to buy the low-sales in Enorotali.
You can't access the gate.
The people here are making everything they eat: mainly some fruit and vegetables along the bottom of the note.
It's the job of women with four or five kinds of sweet potatoes.
They usually store most of the crops for the family, they sell it back in the local market.
It's only 10,000 Indonesians (75 cents).
Since the opening of the new air routes to the local Papuans and the Navy, economic inequalities have increased between the more numerous new immigrants.
Things that are less likely to go to people who are better educated and richer.
The popes are very proud of their capitals or responsibilities in order to carry out their own affairs as a requisitioner.
John Gobai, president of the Panai National Council, says, "Young people don't hear about staying in the village because there's no job or money here."
Tecrit keeps the world's eyes away from Papua.
In addition, international media media restrictions are often imposed.
This year, French journalist Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were banned from Papua "from the lack of coordination with relevant institutions".
According to the Assistant Director-General for Human Rights Monitoring, Jokowi has not been able to remove restrictions on reporting and development promises to increase the transparency of Jokowi's campaign.
One official said: "Indonesia has new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to make news from Papua and West Papua free of charge: don't take it to the visa list."
The lack of control of the press means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbors of Papua.
In March, six Pacific countries (Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands) encouraged B.M. Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread gaps" in Papua, including the Panaia attacks.
The same countries support the OPM as historically.
The Indonesian Foreign Minister Arrmanatha Nasir, a journalist in Jakarta, said, "There is still a democratic system in Indonesia that still exists and is free of media, so it is difficult for human rights to be covered by evidence in the courts."
The local people want the foreign government to take care of more.
An official delegation from the Netherlands, when the country's human rights messenger Kees Van Baar visited Jayapura on May 4th, broke his silence by asking the local people "We want freedom".
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say it's not enough for Jokowi to play again.
The head of the cable council, Gobai, says, "A man who has good intentions, Jokowi, has been turned away by people who are opposed to the Panaii attack."
Jokowi wants to know that apart from living under the threat of the heavy military of the Panaii people, he wants to know that he has been infected in the midst of a campaign of corruption with education and health services.
Gobai says the Panai people, like the others, have seen their own games as a "borch" that they gave Jokowi to pay back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice."
Despite threats and threats, Paniai's victims' families have committed a last-temple act against one symbol: don't hide a victim's face from the police and the army.
They'll make sure at least those responsible will never forget their sins.
"A member of our family has been murdered," says Jacobus, primarily in a harsh way.
"What else can we do?"
Yang, Dubai's "Messale" sky closed the second time
On Friday in Dubai, a fire broke down the world's tallest mines and forced hundreds of miles to flee the 79-footed building at 337 feet [337 m] long.
This is the second great fire that has spread to the tall building, which has been called the Temple tower for two years.
The building has been emptied, no damage has been reported, and no explanation has been made about the cause of the great fire.
"We used to sleep and wake up to the sound of the blazing fire, and the people cried out:
We ran down the stairs, and we got around 10 minutes from the 50th floor."
Dubai's civil defense authorities said that the huge fires were shut down at 4 (00:00 GMT) in the morning and that they were in the heat of the building.
The government explained that they were working to provide shelter for those affected.
This event can bring back to our day questions about the safety of materials used in the outer parts of high buildings around the world.
The investigation of the forest administration following the fire in 2015 found that most of the damage was in external panels used for decoration and isolation.
In the United Kingdom, the police said that 80 people died in London believed that there could be a rapid explosion of fire on the Grenfell River.
"Social Help" for more than 4 chronic patients
The social assistance programme for families and families in chronically ill situations, which will be launched by the Family and Social Policy Committee, will be used for families with chronic illness, at the first level, for families and families, and for the first level of 4 000 300 tuberculosis and the SSPE disease.
With its assistance program, the Department will also provide regular psychosocial support to patients who plan to receive monthly support on three occasions.
According to the information provided, the details and application principles of the "The New Social Assistance Programme for Chronic Diseases in the Fight against Chronic Diseases" were identified, which began with the advice of the Family and Social Policy Fund Fatma Betül Seyan Kaya.
In conjunction with the Health Agency, the social assistance programme, which has been launched with the aim of supporting families who are struggling with chronic illnesses, with economic and psychological violence, has led to the first place in the world in many ways.
The Society, which completes all preparations for the launch of the programme, will provide families with more than a few minutes of regular psychosocial support with its social assistance program.
Thus, the goal is not only to be left alone by poor parents and their families, who have experienced chronic illness and who have continued their treatment periods in their homes.
According to the work done, the first stage will be supported by regular psychosocial and nodic support for poor parents who struggle with a new social assistance program, Subakt Sclerozan Panensefalit (SSPE), a brain disease that causes tuberculosis and fever.
In the context of the progress of the programme, there will be other challenges and risk-hazardous orphans who are struggling with the disease will be helped to obtain assistance.
In addition, medical support, which is intended to be given on a single basis on three of the costs, may also be paid to patients with tuberculosis who have not gone to their care, who have spent their lives on bed, or who need to improve their living conditions at home.
In order to benefit from the support, it is necessary that the monthly income on which a person is entitled is less than three-thirds of the monthly net wage.
In addition, patients with SSPE should be provided with a health-care-based report on the "Individual Size, Classification and Personal Health Reporting" on methods and basis.
According to the report, more than 1 U.S. passenger brings illegal items to planes than 5 U.S.
According to a survey carried out by air carriers, more than 20 percent of the U.S. Air Traffic Safety Authority's control points were missing, including at least 6 percent of those that carry legal stones or other small objects without knowing it.
He said he found out he was traveling with more than 1 percent later with firearms, important or explosives wrong.
Stratos Jet Charters found that the research conducted by the jet rental service, conducted by more than 1,000 people, was more likely to break the rules of younger travelers.
One hundred of the participants who admit that they're trying to fly with something they've been able to do by TSA are 19.7 from Y to Y, and that's why 15 to X to the X to the left.
The most common substances cut off from TSA agents will be eaten and dried.
In recognition of the safety of more than 3 percent of women's partners, they also admitted that 2.2 percent of their partners and 3.7 legal drug users were able to fly.
The company said how many people have been mistakenly imported from the security of the pilot and reported to the passengers at the country stage to find out how many passengers have done wrong and how many have been sent to find out that the fugitive has done it.
It's not surprising that the most likely ones of the people who are fleeing from safety by knowing or not know.
Still, as the company points out, the TSA rules are a part of the cross-sectional and main interlinker.
People are not sure how often they can carry their eggs or how much they can carry.
So it's not surprising that the largest mass of matter, which is hand-held by the TSA, comes out as legitimate fluids.
For a while, people thought that the TSA could manipulate books as a valuable asset.
It's allowed to land on flights inside the country, but it's not allowed on international occasions.
Chinese U.S.

China's Foreign Minister Vang said that Tillerson's administration has re-enacted North Korea's priorities, hopes that the US's priorities will be in the form of action and that the summit will be implemented in a balanced policy.
Vang, who took note of the safety priorities of the Korean peninsula, said that the parties were expected to find a medium-term way of resolving the concerns of the parties in the same dialogue, and that the Pekin administration had been critical of the nuclear reduction, the protection of conflict and recovery, the dialogue and discussion of issues.
EPA President Pruitt, Obama's Retirement Dissemination Act Aborted
One day after being prosecuted by 15 countries, President Scott Pruitt of the Red Cross has decided to postpone the application of Obama's laws, which have resulted in the loss of air pollution emissions due to the bad storm.
Pruitt represented his own contribution to the change in the needs of the environmental editors of the country that was more sensitive to past administrations.
In a federal high court, he never spoke of a legal objection to his previous position.
The 2015 standards for the country's soil level are beginning to meet the end of the 2015 deadline for the country's soil level.
Pruitt, on his own, has been told that he will continue to spend more time working on the plan and to avoid "prohibiting local decisions or preventing economic growth" for a year.
Before President Donald Trump was appointed by Oklahoma's president, Pruitt, who served as a security guard against longer-term environmental changes.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has been on the move frequently to prevent or delay the changes in chemical and fossil fuel industries.
On Wednesday's final day change, the last legal anniversary for the date of the restoration of Pruitt.
Last month, a federal high court in Washington, EPA, a law of an Obama administration, ruled that the investigation of oil and gas companies' oil spills and their attempts to slow down their application are beyond the limits of their own authority.
In a speech published on Thursday evening, Pruitt continued his return to ozone standards, strengthening the EPA's ability to meet new standards at the time of the EPA alone and to work through complex periods.
In his previous work, Pruitt, who served EPA more than one level, said: "The EPA often failed to meet the final dates of decisions under the previous administrations, and failed to resolve disagreements about time-consuming expectations and decisions for active groups and others to be prosecuted."
"We do not believe in the order of the prosecution, and we take our final dates seriously.
We shall certainly take to ourselves the law and the authority which he has given us."
Furthermore, the EPA explained that Pruitt could once again use the "increasing power and legal capacity" to ensure that the reforms are "supported by sound policies and the best information available".
The Republicans in the Congo are making a press for a wider revision of ozone laws.
A Meclis design approved last month is working to improve the application of the 2015 legislation for at least eight years.
Previously, he wasn't brought to the Senate yet.
New York's lawyer Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of the countries that held the EPA this week, said that the group's legal press was intended to be carried out.
Schneiderman said: "The change in the EPA's decision after our case is an important victory for the health and safety of more than 115 million Americans who have directly affected New York and its population from the worst point of view."
Davada took part in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Colombia.
Automotives, electrical controllers, oil refineries, chemical bases and other sources of sunlight are brought into the ozone field at the ground level.
A group of fast-acting people who get into the middle of a bad mood can lead to serious breathing problems, and each year thousands of people die early.
Public health defenders and environmentalists have made remarkable changes in Pruitt's decision.
From the Biodiversity Centre, Lori Ann Burd said, "It's hard to get so much pressure from the person responsible for protecting the air we're fighting to get my right name."
"We must continue to fight against the ideological struggle against terrorism against the authorities, environmentalists and groups of exits."

Flash Rakka from U.S.A.: Internal Security Force...
Albay Dillon, associated with the U.S. Defence Department (Pentagon) with the management of the video conference from Baghdad, said that the Rakka Internal Security Force, trained by the coalition, has begun to take place in areas cleansed from DEAS in the city.
Dillon said, "In most of the cleansed areas of the city, the Rakka Internal Security Force, which is against the Arab and DEAS, continues to prevent the escape or return of terrorists."
Dillon, who said that 230 people attended the group this week, said, "The current word is 850 of the strength."
Dillon, a coalition, indicated that he had been trained for the first time in his primary arms training, armed conflict, scans and control points operations.
Dillon, quoted by Rakka, said that his interest in the Internal Security Force would continue to be examined by the coalition's educational and voluntary applications.
The coalition in the U.S. pre-A. is working with the Democratic Forces of Syria, which has created the mother of PYD/PKK in Rakka's acquisition.
The PYD/PKK terrorist was a PKK terrorist named Leyla Muhammad, head of the Rakka Civil Administration Council.
The word is also said to have PKK/PYD personnel within the military force in Rakka.
Dillon also learned that he had collected heavy weapons from a Muslim group named Karyateyn (Shuuk) in El Tanif, south of Syria, who had stopped the coalition in the United States for the past week.
Dillon said, "After meeting with the leaders of the past week, Shuuk brought back the heavy weapons and equipment that the coalition had given them, but some small weapons and light weapons were allowed to remain with them."
The U.S. said last week that the U.S. had come out of non-disunity regions that they had agreed on with Russia and had taken over Shuuk with the need for non-combatant activities.
The group of DEACHs also indicated that he wanted to fight the Middle East regime.
According to their notes on the phone call, Trump made a press on the payment of the border door to Mexico.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his contacts between the leaders of Mexico and Australia were interrupted by Washington Post.
On October 27, when President Enrique Pena Nieto met with a phone, Trump insisted on not openly telling the public that he would not pay for the border wall offered.
The U.S. President of the People's Party has publicly challenged the president of Mexico who held the gate and said, "You can't tell the press."
Trump started his presidential campaign on building a wall along the U.S. border and promised to pay the project to Mexico.
The notes of the first meeting with President Malcolm Turnbull, Australia, which was held in the midst of a remarkable dialogue, were also published.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that the agreement on the acquisition of the U.S. migrants to Australia was "serious", "inclined" and "aptalca" and offered to the U.S. law to place a citizen in Obama's administration.
Mr. Trump, Mr. Turnbull, said, "This is not the nicest talk I've ever had."
He broke the doctor's face
The High School of Education and Research Hospital in Turkey has left a short-term job this morning, with the aim of helping doctors and staff to beat up a doctor's friends by their neighbors.
The majority of the patients gathered in front of their mother's entrance in front of the hospital with the words "No Violence in Health" that they carried in their hands showed the attitude of what happened.
The Hospital's Child Cardiology Clinic Chief Prof. Dr. Feyza Ayysenur Pac, "No Violence in Health" comes to me as a slave to lack enough."
There's no place for violence in health.
He said, "If this is the way this people will soon find no cure to serve themselves."
The participation of health workers in Ankara's Annual Health Manager Dr. Kamil Turkmen, the First District of Ankara, also supported the hospital staff of the General Secretary-General Prof. Dr. Pöner Hospital, Turkey's Chief of Higher Education and Research Hospital, along with Dr. Mustafa Pac.
Pash, who stole it, said:
Unfortunately, health workers are becoming more violent.
We've been alive again because of our heart's attack by a patient's close.
We are asking our people to increase their awareness of this matter, even though our government, our looks and our preference for these events will soon end.
I'm sorry for what happened yesterday and for my health workers.
"However, this time we're living in a complex complex."
He said, "We'll get our own pensions, but our most important people have their own health."
"Turkmen has begun to say, "Our laws on violence in health have been in a way that has been effective enough."
That's what the government's orders do.
He's working for security right now.
In the past, these were always empty, but now it's actually a public case and the government's a lawyer, it's following the case.
"There are also examples of severe punishments in this regard."
Those who worked after the explanations continued their work.
According to the theory, the day before that happened was 17.45 p.m.
He attacked Dr. Hamdi Mehmet Özbek, who was working in the Kalp and Damar Cerrahi section, where he had lost his life.
The doctors, doctors, and assistants were escorted from the scene, and the police were called to the hospital.
In the event, when Uzbek's eye was cut off, the attackers were caught.
One of your witnesses, a doctor said:
When our friend went to the patients' neighbors to report the condition of a patient who had lost his life, he arrested our friend from the hospital and took us in charge and attacked our two friends.
Our friend's eye has been cut, he's in the blood.
Then we took our friend into the operating room and kept him.
We've been on a security line for 15-20 minutes.
If the patient had broken that safety wall, things would have been worse.

Let's not move the wars of the old world tomorrow
The slow approach to earth and the world's truths can lead to crises, not just people, but countries.
One of the reasons why the rest of the world's truths are delayed is that they may be blocked by certain rooms or actually notified by certain rooms.
Don Kishot and Oblomov have also been involved in promoting the truth and changing my life.
Cervantes's "Don Kishot" is still a myth that he's still in a cave when he starts to build his castle.
Or Gonçarov's "Oblomov" was a legacy that he believed would last as long as he didn't see the truth.
The example of China, for example, has been the result of the crossing of a prison camp into a world open to the end of the 15th century.
This situation has been halted until the captain of the ships that came out of China's black water.
If we found one foot, eye and ear in the West, the other foot, eye and ear in the West, we have always had doubts about the truth and change from Osmanly.
We tried to move to today's day of our past and new part of ours, to understand today's day and tomorrow's.
And as a part of us, we could be as quick as the minds of the developed countries as we were about to change the world and the realities of the world.
This situation has been a source of constant tension and tension.
In the university with Medrese, the modern army with the bride, the encounters with the believers, the dramatically in-depth analysis.
The preliminary was worse and worse, and the new and future cases were not accepted at the end of a certain period.
The next day, they started to push "Hain" into the air, while those who tried to make their home and the world run in the proper form of the day.
The most important lesson in Osmanly was that the ideas and government of those who have come to light in the world and the world have been divided, broke down, and the people have lost their lives.
The most important lesson that our Osman history has brought to the community was the fact that the world's ecumenical culture and change are an inevitable condition to remain in place.
Because this is a very good lesson, we could be a model country of this graph that has been able to protect its unity from the 1st World War to this day, the whole and its restoration.
We also have to leave the forces behind and act in harmony with the facts so that we can achieve the global change that has taken place in a different neighborhood.
In other words, no one will be able to benefit from the meaningless campaigns and bloodsheds that have caused our democracy to be brought together in the past.
The smallest mistakes in today's world are the biggest and most dramatic crises.
It's the most complex graph in this case that we've found in the Middle East.
History-based tool operation
In the statement made by the U.S. Army, it was stated that history had been carried out on short-term flight operations by the I.J. Commanders.
"As a result of the work done, two layers of gold with two suspicious characters, two golden rings, one gold rings, 20 golden bronze rings, one gold rings, one gold rings, two bronze rings, one gold rings, one piece of paper, four gold rings, 8 gold rings, one gold-white stone object, one gold-white stone object, one single picture frame, 23 different prints, and different colors, four yellow metal objects, and six pages of paper, and some pages of paper, which are classified in the Arabic version of the Qur'an, are described as a different size and ebats, and in the paper of the paper, 1 cup of paper, 1 cup of paper, 1 cup of paper, paper of paper, and paper of paper of paper, and paper of paper of paper.
It was said, "We will continue our operations in the fight against crime and crime for the safety of our people."
Turkey Calendar
Global governments that are confident of Turkey's future have fought the war in the power of today's nuclear power plant.
The Energy and Natural Resources Agency's external dependence on energy is broken down by the world's global record model, which has been used to ensure that millions of energy are spent.
I'll invest $1 billion in Turkey's energy reserves, and it's a way of getting closer to four.
Until 2019, local forms of electricity will be integrated into the system.
The energy and natural resources areas (YEKA) which were opened by the Energy and Natural Resources Agency included eight Consortiums of the U.S., China, Germany and Denmark.
However, financial tenders were opened for the purpose of identifying the 5 bidders that were first offered.
After the first bids, the minimum bid was $4.19 per hour.
The break interval is 0.01 cent.
After the accident, Enercon, Gold Wind, GE, Senvion and Vestas decided to participate in a clear disintegration of the participation groups that took place in the Enercon, Gold Wind, GE, Senvion and Vestas.
Siemens, Nordex and Mingyang were in a fight in the open disintegration.
The MingYang-Iank Building and Siemens-Türkers-Kalyon were the last two following the withdrawal of the Nordex Consortium.
MingYang-First Building took 11 times.
Siemens-Türkers-Kalyon Energy Consortium has never been used.
Energy and Natural Resources Baseline: Record day for Turkey.
There's been 30 rounds of open detonation.
It's like there's a strong mix between the two Consortium and the Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon group that offers the lowest bid with $3.48 cent/ kilowatt.
When the Consortium offered $3.49 cent/year, the MUSF Assistant, Alparslan Bayraktar, requested the Commission's request at 3.48.
Two hours later, a world record in the U.S. I.A. was sent to Turkey.
The average bid was $3.48 per cent as the lowest number in the world in this area.
The previous record was in the hands of Mexico with $3.84 per cent.
After the result of the earthquake, the press conference was organized by the Energy and Natural Resources Bank Berat Albara, stating that the fight was an important message to the German company Siemens' region and the world, "I think that when we look at Turkey and Germany's 200 years of historical cooperation, it will provide an important part of Turkey-Germany's relations."
Our goals are big.
Today's net economy and energy market has focused on how healthy and secure it is in the future.
Despite the regional crises in the world, I was proud to hear that Turkey's region and the world's most reliable investment countries have come to the fore.
"All of Turkey, we will be proud of 80 million in this picture, the largest part, the 15-year-old leader and the leader of Turkey, is our leader, who has brought Turkey to this point."
Albiara, who openly expressed his new turn with the head and neck as a rival, said: "One of the most important steps of this is to make a donation of $10.3 per cent to the local share of the world's share of the world's share of the world's share of the world's share of the world's share of the world's population, with a historical record of $3.48/cent, and a record of world record sales."
I am proud of this, on behalf of my people, for my country.
Mr. Albarara said that they intended to take over the first local production panels in the solar energy before the end of 2018, saying, "We will include our local production types into the system by 2019."
It's going to be built in five areas identified by the turbines.
The company that won the contest in each of these five regions will receive at least 50 megalitarian power for a thousand megawatts.
Siemens-Türkers-Kalyon Group will be on $1 billion.
With the operation of local power plants, each year at least 3 billion kilowatts of electricity will be generated and about 1.1 million households will need electricity every year.
The average emission rate of 1.5 million tonnes of CO2/e in order to be installed will also be provided.
The company that won the contest will invest 100 million dollars in the factory.
At least 2.3 megawatts in the factory, the average production of 300 or 450 local electricity types will be carried out.
The Consortium, Canal, Generator design, material technologies and manufacturing technologies, software and innovation are going to work on Ar-Ge for at least 10 years in 5 fields.
Each year, 5 million dollars for Ar-Ge's work will be spent on 50 technical staff from 80 local engineers.
The factory will be built 21 months after the contract was signed.
The project's licence period is 30 years.
On the occasion of my victory in the Consulate of the Turkish Government, President of the Construction Board, Judge Turker, indicated that the project would be 64 rounds away from the construction of the team at 35 degrees, saying, "We plan to protect the crews from foreign sources and the rest from local banks."
Turker said the bank had lost confidence in the Turkish economy.
Kalion Holding Energy Group President Murtaza Ata, "It has become a policy to reduce Turkey's external dependence on thousands of megawatts."
He said, "You're happy with the results."
Simens Gamesa, Prime Minister Hakan Hakan, told Turkey that they had been active in Turkey for 160 years, saying, "We'll do what we can to reduce the power supply."
It's gonna be 65 percent of the local water types to be produced in the factory.
There will be 65 per cent of the 8 000 integral parts of the stream type (at least 5,200).
In each of the 5 regions, at least 50 MW, a total of 1,000 MW will be built.
3.750 people want 10 years, Ar-Ge needs $5 million each year to pay for Ar-Ge operations.
1000MW Water test %65 Local location At least 2.3 MWe produces 300 or 450 local filter types in at least 2.3 MW.
I'll invest on $1 billion per year in 400 MW per year, and I'll invest 100 million dollars in the factory.
About 1.1 million households will need electricity every year at least 3 billion kWh electricity production Average 1.5 million tonnes of CO2/e emissions.
Moore's Ford Category: Activist Adalate Call Reconnaissance of Inhibitor Link
In 1948, a model for Ford Mercuriy was passed between a group of observers in the area of Monroe Georgia and the small Ford Köprus in Moore.
A car with four black passengers and a white driver was set up to stop a group of armed white men before they reached the wall.
He took a long breath from the city's leader, who was in the middle of a group of middle-aged Indians, and looked at the inside of the camp carefully.
In the inside, the sittings got scared.
"We want you, Roger!" he said.
"Get him out of here!"
When a young black man was driven from the front of the passenger seat, he was in darkness.
Well, don't just re-enact the show at the 22nd of the season.
But when a science was thrown around Roger's neck, almost everyone in the monitors gave a real answer.
Since 2005, human rights defenders have returned to the Ford Wall in Moore, two black folds (Roger and Dorothy Malcom with George and Mae Murray Dorsey) to re-enact them by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one was charged with murder until now.
Tyrone Brooks, who helped reorganize the re-animation, said, "If we see them in our communities, we don't realize that there's not one person being arrested all these years."
"This is a date, but it's a load in our souls."
At 71 years of age, a former member of the Congress and a life-long human rights defender in the state of Georgia.
This reanimation, a dramatic action call, and an annual reminder of an injustice that has never been corrected in the Monroe community.
He said, “We want to go with you, and we want you to suffer, and we want you to stay away from us, but we must be the first to act justly.”
"We can't have it until we get justice to the striker and the distance."
On July 27, 1946, the court issued a petition on the death of one of the victims of the Ford line in Moore.
According to the FBI files received by the NBC News, Monroe and the surrounding areas were suspicious of more than 50 men.
But one of them has never been questioned yet.
Though the suspects have been a fugitive for ten years, they say that human rights defenders and linguists are always well-known everywhere in the city: politics and sex.
In November 1946, a Supreme Court of Justice in Georgia was able to vote for the first time at the end of that letter.
According to the FBI, at the same time, black partner Roger Malcom, Barnett Hester, a white village owner, was shot as a woman during a fight.
Brooks, the mayor's dictionary, said that Hester's wife, Malcom, slept with Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not his own husband.
According to the FBI, on 25 November 1946, the owner of a white village, Roy Harrison, paid $600 to get Malcom out of jail.
Dorothy and her cousin Mae Murray went to jail at George Dorsey's funeral.
But when they came to Moore's Ford Köprüs, leaving the prison with a car, a left side of the car broke down.
A FBI report concludes, "It's understood that Harrison was the one who ordered the murder."
"There has also been a secret agreement between the state and the local authorities that they have not only committed murder, destroyed the evidence, and hidden the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks said it's shorter and he said it himself.
He said, "It was our duty to raise a voice."
All of them were killed to send a message to the people of the black town. They said, "This is what you will receive if you keep a record of it and make a call."
About ten years ago, Cassandra Greene, the annual Ford Köprüs in Moore, is managing the re-viving of the links.
It looks forward to all the details of the performance, gives attention to some sort of distortion that many observers believe no longer exist in America.
It's hard to track, and even harder to turn your eyes, but Greene says it's your goal.
He said, "We don't want to talk about Linc, because it makes us all crazy in ourselves."
"If you don't listen to me, or if you don't listen to me, I can't develop a relationship with you."
This year's performance began with a show, and on the first day of the year, nearly 30 actors (one line white and the other black) arrived in a room, and they listened when they wanted to enter the general lines of the game that were well-tested.
Wade Marbaugh is acting as the assistant manager of Greene.
President Clansman has played his role for years, but he says that he never made it easy.
Marbaugh said, "I feel upset because it's not me."
"But I think it's important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back then."
The players playing Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester around the room were testing their own lines, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona.
Malcom's getting into a fight with his wife, Dorothy, and he's playing with Hester, who's so jealous of his wife, Dorothy.
"Z... and I said, "Get out of my country!"
Rascona's attitude.
There's a shot.
And then every one of them falls into the pit.
Most of Greene's laughing.
Rascona says "What?" she asks.
He was nervous. He was surprised.
I'm so sorry?
Greene said, "No."
"I just don't think the white people said z."
One of the black players said, "Yes."
"You have to press 'R'."
So it changes the energy in the room and takes place in some kind of ambiguity.
Everyone's trying to fix this, not just for the game line, but for the four people who were killed at the same time.
The show's starting again.
This time Rascona N starts with a word, cut and hit.
No one's definitely laughing.
The re-animation ends in a violent and fast way.
There's noise, gunfire, and then silence.
A woman on the funeral list is standing on the body of actors and reading Billie Holiday's comic book "Garip Meyva".
In both words, the voice is broken.
An average of one hundred times removes their eyes and eyes from a four-order watch group.
It's almost the same level as black and white watching.
A couple of ways from Ithaca, New York, to see her performance.
When Brooks took them on a sacred journey to the graveyards of the Malcoms and Dorseys, they all stopped Georgia's press duty for almost eight hours.
Until this point, the murders had been an anecdotes, but now that the link is in the same place, it means that the air is coming as a curse.
When her last notes are weakened, Greene invites the majority to approach and inject their bodies.
The kids are being put on their hands, they're going to tear their bodies apart, and they're going to tear them apart.
A little boy like he reminds himself, "They're not really dead."
A few minutes later, Greene's thank you for the majority and it's over.
The actors are throwing the lithium and removing their glasses.
Bradshaw, the team's playing President Clansman is being dragged to Marbough.
Nick Rascona is attracted to two of his friends, and his hands are empty from his eyes, and he's finally getting to him.
One of the women complains, "It's okay."
"We know that what is in your heart is not that.
You did it for a reason."
And then the monitors, they're sitting down with actors.
On one table, a white couple from Atlanta talk about a black couple about re-animation.
Denise Duplinski's performance is forced to find words about how she feels about him.
He said, “This is a horrible thing to hear, a bad thing, and that's what they're doing, because they're like you, and they're like you.”
"What this has done to me is to think that the links are still going on," he added, "this is just what the police are trying to do now."
There's a room in the bedroom where Tyrone Brooks is eating at the table and talking about human rights.
He said he's been planning the performance for the next year.
He said, “It inspires me to relive it, because it explains why we are trapped, but it is the teacher.”
"Maybe, if you don't learn from this, it might be again.
Those who do not study their past, and who do not know, are bound to repeat it."

The Journal of the Islamic Republic has been informed that after a detailed report on the child's death has been prepared, the High Commissioner for the People's Republic has been informed that he will be sent to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to investigate the incident.

It's said the police's friends will apply to the statement.
It's also said that Hakan can access third-persons or a field with information from a computer that says "Cleaned" their neighbors.

After what happened at the house in Köknar Sokak, the Esenyört School Hall, on 25th of December, the family who gave their children to the land was planning a murder.
"We don't think he could harm himself or anyone else because of the game," said Father. "They threw a knife at his head and threw a knife at him."
That's how it was, son.
We definitely don't think that our son can hurt himself or anyone else because of a game on the Internet.
We knew you were playing such a game.
It wasn't a game that was really funny.
Let's say he left some blood out of the game.

First CARE: It may have been found on the left side
Families usually don't pay attention to this.
They're looking at "Whatever happens at my child's house."
Kids, they communicate with a lot of people through games.
There may have been some debt debt or denial.
Or someone in the game has invited you home, which may have been a problem between them.
It may have been because of the problems with other people that he had been communicating with, not directly from the game, but through other people.
The reality of the game may have been the child's imagination.
The travma that runs in the past may be related to the scarcity.
If he's faced with the situation of child abuse, there's also a driving system so he can't solve the problem.

FSU NEBIL: Families should know about the impact of their children
We can't say the games are bad.
Research has also shown that games are useful for children’s development.
It's important to watch what parents and children play here and how they talk to players online.
Families need to know how the children are affected by them.
In Turkey, there are only two children in five documents that say he died from the game.
This also shows that ending a child's life is not just the effect of games.
What happened to this kid?
We need to know that first.
You have to look at sociology and psychology around your child.
Borsa stopped in Istanbul for 8 months. 50 percent.
BIST continued the rise trend, which started in April 2016 in December and moved up to the 8th month.
So since December 2007, this was the first time that it was up to 8 months ago, when it was 45.3 percent in this period.
Since the beginning of this year, Germany, the United States, England, and Japan have not left the lead in the year leading up to the world's major debts.
The BIST 100 index, completed by 7.06 percent in July, followed by the Dow Jones index in the U.S. by 2,54 plus the Dow Jones index, the FTSE 100 index in England by 0.81 percent.
In Germany, with DAX index in Japan, Nikkei's index was completed with a loss of weight.
A high performance was seen when looking at the scale of the current period, with the BIST 100 indexes, the world's top indexes, and the developing countries' indexes.
By the end of 2016, the BIST 100 index, which was won by 37.6 percent, the Dow Jones index by 10.76 percent, the DAX index by 5.55, the Nike index by 4.55, and the FTSE 100 index by 3.21 percent.
The MSCI EM index, which is the target of a link to the country's developing debt, provided 23 percent of the index.
BIST was seen showing similar performances in the past when it looked at the historical period of 100 indexes.
By the end of April 2006, the total BIST 100 index, totaling above and above the 8th month of December 2007, was 38.3 percent in this period.
BIST also completed the 100th edition of August 1996 between 8th and March 1997 and 9th of May 1997 between October 1998 and October 1998.
In his statement to the AA director, President Erren Can Umumüt, the Mex Investment Research Manager indicated that BIST 100 led to an 8-month increase, and that 37 percent of the increase was still in progress from the beginning of the year.
Overall, MSCI's development markets (EM) record 23 percent higher than they are, and only when we look at these events, it's a positive difference:
This has continued to happen to developing countries since the beginning of the financial year.
In particular, the funds within the high-level partnership prefer countries with higher rates.
Since then, domestic markets are being influenced positively.
Of course, global risk-taking is high.
The risk status of the document in this letter is a rejection of the indexes of the document.
In the United States of America, S&P 500 has been tested by new record levels every week in parallel to 11 percent.
In the beginning of the year, the U.S. Central Bank (Fed) reported that 3 percent increase in sales caused stress, but the Federal government, which claimed that it was very well using Fed's leadership policy to remove uncertainty from the environment, reported that there was a non-sensitious market in Fed's increase.
The general said that inflation in the U.S. was not yet in demand, and that the expectations that Fed will not act faster and avoid radical trends are also very powerful in existing bids.
As U.S. President Donald Trump, who said, "Obamacare, the US President, has strengthened the importance of promoting a broad-based monetary policy that does not bring about promises, "the faster the US economy's expectations for Trump, the faster it feels about the real impact it has on the current market, the faster it becomes to make promises and the faster it will be given to inflation."
The General said that Turkey's market has been trying to close the gap between the BIST 100 index, which has been distributed and sold over a year since 2016, bearing in mind that many of Turkey's markets are experiencing a year of unemployment.
The State, which stated that they did not see a strong collection of domestic information with a strong flow of information, noted that the presence of an existing appearance could be induced by an increase in domestic markets in the risk-taking industry in more than one place.
The total, technically speaking, was 108,600 degrees, indicating that the BIST 100 index, which tested the new records, was followed by a series of black sales:
In particular, 109.500-110.000 areas are a critical dress in a short valley.
After approaching these levels, it's normal to carry out black sales.
In a short time, we think there must be a new local or global story to rent over 110,000.
Now, the transfer of 107.500 supports can stimulate car sales.
In this case, I think if we follow the 107,000-dollar support, we're going to be able to see the slope up to 106,000-105.500.
In particular, the breakdown of 105.500 supports can lead to a return to 104.300 levels, which is 50 percent higher than 108.600 levels.
Both Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB) have indicated that decisions will be made at the end of the global market at the moment, and the government's expectations for Fed are clear now, but it is not expected to increase interest in the annual FOMC, but it is likely that the balance sheet will be re-entered in the US dollars.
As a general rule, the situation is that a developing country (GU) may be able to attract black sales in the index of documents in the short term, saying, "What the ECB will say is important if this is what the ECB has to say."
After the final session of the Economic and Social Council, President Mario Draghi of the ECB expressed his wish to discuss the view of money policy tomorrow, and this said that his avro/dollar parity was raised above 1,1700 levels.
As a result, the related explanations that will reduce or end the $60 billion of the monthly loan will also mean that Fed will also be reduced by the ECB's subsequent global balance sheet.
"Turkey is a country that offers high prices, such as Turkey, and which requires access to external funds."
Former Investment Investment Communication Manager Erol Gürcan and U.S. President Trump in November 2016 pointed out that after the election of the U.S. President, the global feeling document markets had a very serious impact.
Gürcan, a fundamental element that stimulates this rally movement, said that it is possible to say that there is a potential for increasing global growth expectations for the promotion of Trump's capital tax transfer:
Borsa Istanbul also took a position at the top of the world's leading bridges.
One of the most important reasons for this is to say that the BIST 100 index has been very much inconsistencies in the developing countries in recent years, but it is useful to say that the measures taken by policy makers to support economic and financial markets have played a serious role.
In particular, in the March issue of the Credit Guarantee Fund (KGF) index, which has become active, we can say that this is a serious impact on the rise that has so far been sought.
In the last part of the year, Gürcan, who pointed out that the positive developments are moving towards a significant scale and that KGF, which plays an important role in this increase, has been slowing down, said the BIST 100 index still continues to be used as an integral part of the country's markets, even though a new story about the rest of the year could be a slow forward.
The 180-day action plan, which was expected to share the details for a particular period of time, stated that the development of companies' wives, such as the increase in the limit of the Credit Guarantee Fund, was designed to support the development of companies' wives, such as the transfer of taxes that will occur in the near future.
While developing countries such as the Bank of Gürcan, Fed, the ECB and the United Kingdom, such as the Central Bank (BoE) will be slow and will be at risk for developing countries, and will be at risk for developing countries, "sometimes there will be a high chance that Fed will be able to start the balance sheet phase within a month and that the ECB will be able to complete its financial recovery programme in the near future, and that it will be possible that it will continue to be able to be among the most important developed country banks in the future."
Gürcan, who said that the region is highly critical in terms of the region's breakdown of 101.150-104,600, which has been linked to the rise trend that has been seen since the beginning of this year, said that the region could continue to be affected by the reduction of this support region by a reduction of 101,700, 100,000 and 99,200 levels.
Gürcan indicated that in the case of the conservation of existing elevations and the breakdown of the 108,605 lines at the present age level, the index could rise to 110,000-112,000.
Capibil Convoy Attack: killed in NATO Army Attack
According to the authorities, a fire bomber attacked a military van in Kabul, killed a NATO soldier, and injured a few.
In NATO's statement, five soldiers and a translation were injured.
Undeclared local sources say that three civilians were killed in the event in Karabakh district.
The last act of violence that took place this month in Bombalama in Afghanistan; more than 30 people died in a fire in Herat.
On Tuesday, a fire bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabil.
The NATO statement stated that Pershembe was attacked by 'personally comfortable hand-extinguishing' in his duties as a partner with the Afghan army at night.
He explained that all wounded were in good condition and that they were under treatment at the U.S. Air Force Hospital in Bagram.
The authors say Taliban is an important source of concern for NATO forces, spoken near the Islamic Government (IS) in Karabakh.
According to the United Nations, in the first half of 2017, Afghanistan witnessed the death of at least 1662 civilians to mean 20% of the capital.
Finally, at the end of November, Kabil killed at least 30 people in the area of Şii.
The Taliban said they did the attack on their own.
On 31 May, the U.S. leadership's forces withdrew from Taliban in 2001 and killed more than 150 people in the city's most lethal military attack in the country.
The act of aggression, the U.S. President Donald Trump, attacks the undisclosed security situation in Afghanistan by increasing the number of U.S. military and police units in the country.
The leaders say that in recent weeks, the government of nuclear bombs in Kabil, its policies and, in particular, the citizens that are behind President Ashraf Ghani's trust in the crisis.
EPA refused to delay the incoming air law after the cases
The U.S. Border Guard, an Obama state law, decided to delay the legislation that called for the State to ban the outbreak of bad emissions, and one day the majority of the 15 countries returned to this entry.
The EPA explained its decision to continue with the 2015 Ozone Decisions on the following day, stating that it had shown its determination to work with countries within an hour of the next day.
EPA president Scott Pruitt said, "We believe in dialogue with our partner countries and not to be sensitive to them."
In April, the EPA announced its intention to postpone its ozone-depleting decisions until October 2018, which measure the presence of bad smoke in the country at various locations and is decided where it needs to be determined to meet more stringent air standards.
Most of the 15 countries that are Democrats had a case that said that this effort was illegal on Saturday, Columbia.
President Donald Trump's administration is calling for the restoration of the world's environment, which is part of the broader day that Trump says to revive economic growth by former President Barack Obama.
But these efforts have led to the behaviour of security groups concerned with the impact of democracy and more emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that the ozone-in-air solution "can reduce the current functions and increase the symptoms of solitude as low."
The forest gave the good news...
It's a series of stops and canal transfers!
President Fikret Orman, a Dutch footballer, Jeremiain Lens and stopper transfer, was present at Fein Sports.
Phichret Orman said that...
There's no surprise in the transfer.
Our goal isn't too much transfer, it's a shot.
Now we're going to have a stopper and a canal transfer.
The champions have the League games, we'll make a good deal of it.
We have to move the canal of Mecbur.
10 million euros is very easy, but we don't have a bottle like that.
If it comes to what we say, we'll transfer, and if we don't do it, we won't die.
I can't give you information about Lens without netting.
We're a public company.
The end of patience is welcome.
IS IT OK to warn you that there is no festival for August 30th?
Andra Valiggio continues to influence concerts throughout the month of August, with the need for "IZID" to take part in sitting activities, memory meetings, and similar collective activities.
It's a legal decision in Ankara, where the term "all group activities" takes place.
The International Ankara Festival continues.
In his statement to the CHP Group President and Ankara Mülltvek, Leven Göck, SÖZCÜ said, "It is impossible to say that August 30s is governed by laws," and said:
There's serious confusion.
In the case of which decision he will apply...
The government's duty is to create areas where holiday celebrations are to be celebrated.
The CHP Ankara National Murat Emir also said, "The whole Ankara has a security issue, not just the organizations of the Sky."
Ankara moved the moon of the independent State to the law of Meclis.
Nazlıka, who was encouraged by the President's wishes, said, "Don't you think that the law is a clear violation of AKP's democracy and Father's hostility? How do you think the millions who will celebrate August 30th are going to be celebrated in the fields?"
"I learned from Edwina about what I was being replaced."
Demet Xener, who continued divorce with Abraham Kutluay, was in Nishanta with his previous lawyer.
Edwina, who claimed to destroy her house, sent the case to Sponza to the court as evidence of the photos taken with her by Sponza and Kutluay.
She was also in charge of Sener's case, saying, "Demet, he took my special photos illegally."
"I DIDN'T KNOW."
Sheener, who was in Delicatessen after the last developments, came out of the area after seeing the journalists.
Shener, very upset, was reminded of Edwina Sponza's comment about the photos, saying, "God, I've probably taken it home."
"There's such a complaint, but it's not true."
He said, "Everything is in our hands; we are bound to court."
Shener, the reporters said, "Then everyone knew about your wife's relationship with Sponza."
"How did you not know?" he was surprised at the question.
What?
How?
Shener, who said, "I didn't know," said, "Would I believe my husband who looked into my mind, or believe what I said?"
Sheener, who said, "No, I didn't say that, of course, I heard the first time."
But I didn't believe anything like that in any way.
Everything was normal, it was in place, I had nothing to doubt.
Ma'am, I've learned everything by hand, so...
Sheener, who gave the "Yes" answer to the question, "Is it the person who sent the evidence?" He was very confused by the fact that the photos and writings that were sent to the court were very different from what Sponza sent to him.
Sponza said earlier that he had written with Abraham Kutluay.
The deal will be signed tomorrow with Negredo.
The 5th Club will include Spanish footballer Alvaro Negredo in the cartoon tomorrow.
The Vodafone Park will be scheduled for the Vodafone Park, which is agreed upon in principle with the Valencia Club of Spain.
The signing procedure will also be carried out at 12 a.m. by Fikret Orman.
In the meantime, the Spanish football team will be taking control of tomorrow morning's health.
Qatar: We broke the embargo in Turkey in hours
President Ahmed Bin Jassim Al Thani said he wanted to thank the people of Turkey.
Al-Qaani said: "We are grateful and grateful for the support you have given us."
I greet my brother Recep Chief, and I greet Mr. Erdogan with the greetings of Katar Emiri.
Qatar's economy has proved its resurrection.
In many countries, when we are affected by economies, our economy remains healthy.
We need to work hard to make Qatar independent and strong.
We broke into a large area in Turkey within hours of the embargo against us.
We don't have any weaknesses right now.
Our natural resources, natural resources, are very much in support of Qatar's economy.
We have not been affected by the siege of Turkey, which has been brought against us with impunity and law enforcement.
Today, Qatar is born again and continues to grow in the world at LNG.
He said, "We've lived a 30-percent increase in our natural civilization after the fall."
Al Thani points out that work continues to be done in all fields in relation to the relations between Qatar and Turkey, "A $554 million debt has been created for the first time in our trade."
The decisions made in the last days have also played an important role.
And the result of identifying Turkish products in Qatar's market is that it is important for all sectors to speed up the entry of goods from Turkey and to make investments in a number of areas.
He said, "Thank you very much for your arresters against us."
300 million TLs of final assets
TSB President Can Akyn Chağlar, indicating that the following cell pressure in 18 Tammuz has been reported to the insurance companies 116 million TL' 000 casualties, 12 million litres were received at the Gökova Depression in 21st Tammuz, and that on 27 December the cell and totals 168 million litres of the last three cases were found to be 300 million litres.
The bells say, "The damage caused by the smoker's smoke is worth $3,500 litres, and the smoke damage is around a thousand litres."
He said, "It's about 6 thousand litres in the middle of the depression."
The Canyon Chaggs, who were attacked as a sectoral burden on the supply of economic losses, said that every 4 people had no security, that no fire insurance was found, and that 2 out of every 3 people had no casket insurance, said, "Because of the change in science, there is a natural risk."
Because of the low level of insurance in our country, the risk of meeting our parents and our organizations' serious losses is rising every day.
All these claims must not be left on state.
It's not as bad as the security police are, it's not just a sector that pays damage; it's a risk management conversation at the same time.
The increase in insurance knowledge and security is very important to us and to our country.
San Akyn Chats, "The Kasko insurance is writing that the insurance companies should report their losses within 5 working days, and this is the end of the day."
"Will there be a security gain?" he said, "Even in general circumstances, it's been two years under the Ticaret Act."
He said, "Those who live here don't have to panic about the insurance, I won't pay any company."
That's how Germany's media saw it!
During a growing period of tension between Turkey and Germany, Turkey's first Renewable Energy Energy Agency (YEKA) took note of the success of the German Siemens company.
The German media heard this development saying, "Germany Siemens won the battle in Turkey."
DWelle Turkish told the U.K.A. that the Siemens-Türkers-Kalyon Consortium had won "the Consortium will invest on $1 billion."
"The fact that I am open to the creation of a megalitarian power plant makes Turkey's first JEKA power plant unique," says the report, "the number of companies fighting today's 8nd to 2nd, and the German Siemens Consortium has been removed from the scene since the beginning of the 30th century.
The Energy and Natural Resources Agency, who made an explanation after the hearing, was in the midst of a series of statements on Turkey-Germany relations.
Well, the German company won Siemens, and we can say that this picture is an important message to the world.
When we look at Turkey and Germany's 200 years of historical cooperation, I think this will provide an important element in Turkey-Germany's relations.
Despite the regional crises in the world, I was proud to hear that Turkey and the world's most reliable investment countries have come to the fore.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, see a possible guest
For 147 pounds, Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were about to cross the road to the most exciting boxing game in the near future, met together on the first Friday.
The Unrenewable World Box Council was held in separate rooms in the ESPN offices in Los Angeles until the World Box Organization greeted Lomachenko.
On the Wednesday of the showtime, along with the moon, the former world champion of four bicycles, Adrian Broner, after Garcia's graduation, was among the best five members of the list that were not guarded by the bicycle.
Garcia stretched out her right hand and said, "How's it going, champion?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko will defend his chamber against Miguel Marriaaga at 7 o'clock in the ESPN.
The second, while cleaning for photos, the manager of Lomochenko, Egis Klimar, recorded that a potential passenger between the fighters would be "immortal size".
Garcia reminded me, "I'm an old-fashioned doll."
"I went out high for Broner (140 pounds) but I'm not that big.
I'm a little boy for 140.
I want to get into a light bike.
He's going to have to pass through the light rails 135 pounds, then we can fight.
That's what historians want.
We'll give them that."
Lomachenko was involved.
"You've got a need for this fight."
The climate asked whether this was supposed to be in 'fucking and watching'; to set up a next written history with Garcia (37-0, 30 kavt) and to fight Lomachenko in a 135-pounded battle this year; and Garcia also points out the possibility of fighting with Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell for a mild cycle address in the Forum on 23 July.
Garcia said, "Maybe the fight's an' hatred and watching 'cause all sides want it." And then she said that if the channel offered her the best financial package, it was clear to her.
We're the main names.
No other name has been defined as such.
When they're ready."
Garcia Lomachenko said he considered "a fighter" and was able to join him on Friday's day.
But Lomachenko, who's gone to Garcia's old-fashioned high school, said that he thought that the three-cycle champion from Riverside seemed "very slow" and said, "Don't worry, Mikey... you wanted the button."
Garcia said he was a boxer after showing his strength in front of the room.
They both said they felt that my moment was created for their own encounters.
"This is a fight to be done.
Another fight doesn't make so much interest and speech.
Garcia said, "I'm so happy to deal with this."
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best fighters, and that's Mikey.
It'll be a great fight."
Turkey's restaurant from Russia to America
White Saray does not think of applying actions to affect Moscow's border constructions, but rather of directing Russia, it can increase the ownership of these lines.
The reason for this is the increase in debt.
In contrast, Kremlin, who was concerned that the co-investment partners were planning to get rid of projects, speeded up the construction of the borough lines.
The Swiss company Allseas Group, which was planning to reach Turkey under Karadenis, made rapid construction at the request of Gazprom, which was planning to reach Turkey.
Reuters also wrote that in order to allow more gas to enter Europe, the second bridge line to the Turkish Aquifer also began to build the second line of lead parallel to the Turkish Aquifer.
The new results of the Swiss Liti-year-old rating test were explained
In Sweden, the latest results of the evaluation tests carried out by doctors based on a new age rating method were ruled by the government that more than 80 percent of those surveyed were older than 18 years of age, but not everyone is convinced that these tests were true.
Switzerland's Million Adli Type and Ilach Dairy (Rätttsmedicinalverket) began testing earlier this year.
The tests were designed to assess the age of some of the migrants who claimed that the Swiss Migrationsverket had failed to assess the correct age of their failure to assess the age of their ill-treatment.
To date, the Migrationsverk has sent out 6880 cases, and Adli Type and Ilach Dairei has now explained the end of the total of 2481 from March to March 31, 2017.
The 80th (2002 edition) was judged to be 18 or more, and on 25 February, the trial of the Adli Typ and Ilach Daire was "probably 18 and above."
The result was, in 432, that the man was "probably under 18."
The tests were carried out only in cases where the person's age was suspect.
According to Johan Göransson, the results are due to last months from the Adli Typ and Ilach Dairy.
"We don't see a big difference in statistics over the past few months, the numbers are very high."
The fact that they were not older than 18 doesn't mean that they lied about the age of the peasants.
In May, the station explained the outcome of 581 tests and said that "the people who are enrolled are either older or older" 442 cases.
When Svenska Dagbladet reported the results of 581 cases, 243 cases were found to claim that this year was 18 years old.
The process of medical evaluation of 20-year-old teeth is included in some environments.
One of the researchers was Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, who appreciated the biological status of people who found their work on the site earlier or later.
"I have reasons to think about it and I think that this kind of measurement should not be used.
It's very questionable to make decisions about biological life in this way.
If we can't say it exactly, we shouldn't do it." said the Metro newspaper.
What, from the Adli Type and Ilach District, you're defending the validity of Giansson's tests: "You can say that the risk of a child being wrongly judged as an adult is small.
The biggest risk person is under 18 years of age, and in this case, about 10 percent of the risk."
The star of Hamidi is opening up in worship today.
The star Hamidiye Camisi, built by Abdulhamit in 1885, will be opened in worship today after restaurant work.
The District Manager Mursel Sarj said that the restaurant work started in spring 2013 was completed and the truck was ready to open.
He said, "Restoration work was carried out in 2 pockets."
The first part of the truck was the repair of the mother's building.
The second part was environmental adjustment.
In the first part, about 16 million lira were spent around 11 million lira for environmental planning.
First the birds of the heaven were opened, and after their young were brought forth, the outer walls, the doors of their houses, and the doors of their courtyards, and the roofs of their houses.
There's been a Dranjos about healing.
There's a lot of money on what we saw when we got into the truck.
It's a treasure that has stars' motives, and it's more rich than any word.
There's a karma in here.
"If we were to think it was done in Osmanley and 1885, we'd be in the middle of a baroque march."
MEASURE OF ABDULHAMIT
"The notice from the German Emperor 2 in the middle of the city."
Some of them were wrong, they cleaned up, and they were on the spot.
It's a very valuable and important part.
There are symmetrical coffees on both sides of the truck, which we call peace.
We know this is done by our Grand Duke Abdulhamit Han, who made the lead ship.
And then we have this information in the way he did it by his own hand and he's mounted here.
They're still standing here as originals.
Sir said President Recep Tayyyy and Erdogan were waiting for him to take part.
Pantic id for monitor
He wrote about Ukraine that a 25-year-old Serb footballer who didn't enter the theater in Dinoma Kiev could be hired to a red club.
The football country, which started in the Serbia-Montenegro team, wore the Villarreal, Cordoba, Eibar and Alaves in Spain.
Pantic signed Dinamo Kiev during the last season
West Virginia states that she will change her party.
West Virginia's Democratic Governor Jim Justice Pershembe said he would change his party with President Trump on the evening.
Vali Justice said, "You should go or not go, Democrats have left me."
"I'll tell you today with many prayers and thought... I'll tell you today as West Virginians, I can't help you as a Democrat."
Mitting's full of surprises.
Justice added, "So I'll change my record tomorrow as a citizen."
"If I were a technical director, it's time for you to set up a different game, I said."
Mr. Trump said he'd make an important announcement earlier in West Virginia's myth.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points and the Democratic name Justice did not support Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justice was elected in 2016, with only one billion members.
Forbes indicates that with his father's help, he's in 5 cases with the aid materials.
It's about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, an explanation was published on the evening of the National Congress on Friday, "It is another work for the Democratic Party to work to prevent it from expanding our country instead of renewing it."
When RNC said to Ronna McDaniel CBS, "The history is only the last rejection of a party that has been unleaded from the beginning with 15 elections and at least a state law mechanism."
I'll do my best for Turkey
The third Olympics, record to Turkey.
She was born in Cuba, but she gave her own apartment to the F.Bache.
In 2013, he became a Turkish citizen, and he dressed in a military uniform...
He first became a European champion, then the third Olympic...
Now it's one of Turkey's most important hopes at the World Championship on Athletics.
Yasmani Capello, a 400-foot race racer, spoke to Sabah before the show started today.
They didn't want you who didn't like their levels in Cuba when they were young.
You made it happen when you arrested the coach.
Then they called, but you didn't go.
Some think you chose Turkey for money.
What are you saying?
The last thing I remember about Cuba, I've been separated from the international team.
From then on, I can say that I've drawn a line of things that I've been living with since.
Then I went to Turkey with the invitation of the Fenerbach Club.
I joined the Milli's team, and it was in Fenerbach.
They offered me an offer for the course.
I opened a new page with Turkey.
I lived a very quiet life when I was young, but I signed important achievements in Rio and Amsterdam after the opportunities I had in Turkey.
I'm impatient to do the best of the World Championships and win a different dream.
In the past few days, you had a press conference.
Can you tell us why?
When a question is raised about Turkey's presence, my childhood is coming, and I'm being expelled from the Cuban Military Team at the age of 23.
And of course people are coming to me in Turkey.
When I won a gold medal at the European Championship in Amsterdam, I felt something like this when I was playing the Istival War.
I didn't keep my glasses.
And I thank Turkey so much for allowing my dreams to be realized.
I'm so glad we belong to the Turkish Military Team.
I'll be here until my legs run.
You told me before you said you could have a Turkish lover.
You're with a Turk now, and you're going to Cuba together.
You want to share their lives?
It's the greatest peace of being with a Turk...
It's cool when I compare myself with Cuban women...
The Turkish girls have connections.
Your girlfriend's assistant coach at the same time.
You're together all day, for example?
She's eating more sweet than I do.
(both laugh) I don't really mean much, but it's time for me to eat.
My coach, Massimo Matron, often finds serious warnings, but I know they're for my own good.
How's it getin' with your Turkish food? Does your boyfriend make you a food?
Turkish women eat very good, but my lover does better.
(Laughter) The root of corruption is the first of it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
My coach in Cuba didn't believe me.
He took other young people to my place.
We met in Cuba after we won the medals for Turkey.
Looking at my face, he showed me to the young athlete next to me, and he said, "Leave it alone, I've grown it."
I was just laughing at him.
MY PAST: I grew up in a small town in the province of Bulacan in the province of Bulacan in the south of the Philippines.
It's interesting that you're watching the competition...
I'm just using it for concentration.
When I turn my eyes on the world, I break off my relationship with both sides of the wall.
I'm just focusing on the finish line and I don't see anything else.
WHAT comes to mind when we say Tokyo 2020?
Felix Sanchez...
In 2012, London Olympics won a gold medal at the age of 35 in 400 meters.
If he can do it, I can do it in Tokyo at the age of 33, so why not.
TURKCELL DESTECTION
The Deputy Director General of Turkcell Ismail told them that Yasmani Capello believed that he would succeed in London, saying, "We sincerely believe that Yasman will best represent our holiday at this seminar."
We speak for all our athletes who will fight in London.
"We will support Turkey's further development and greater success in our country," he said.
Coe, Russia's doping scandal is missing 'asami'
The patron of global athleticism, Sebastian Coe, was deeply disappointed by Russia's failure to re-accept the country's track.
Russia's athletic boss Dmitry Shylakhtin said that the IAAF Congress, organized in the World Championships of Athletics, is right for the country to be taken out of the sport and is determined to fight the doping itself.
He said, "I'm sorry about all the athletes who took gold and silver from them."
In response to his assessment, the IAAF Congress, in November 2015, used the voice for evidence of state-supported doping in Russia after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence.
IAAF's president Coe told the guests, "I think today is a lot of fun, a lot of fun."
"The whole council and the Congress were pleased to do everything possible to ensure that the Russian Federation accepted itself, that it had spent many exciting days, and that the Federation had done everything possible to ensure that it was done again."
Coe, Russia, said he's "me" before he re-accepts his acceptance of his criteria.
Coe said, "I think it's a very exciting day, and I think you're on your way, but Congress, the task force is to support the lack of time to support Russia's rights."
"We have to do everything we can to normalize this situation in the next few months.
Our first route guide always wanted to separate clean athletes from the fragile system."
The ninth Russian athlete who meets the IAAF criteria will compete in the World Championship on Friday, London.
On the day of the IAAF mission, Rune Andersen said that Russia had not yet met many criteria regarding its rights.
He told the IAAF Council that the drug test is still insufficient and that legal coaches are still free.
Don't lie to 'YPG' messages from ADD
The U.S. Ankara Enlargement, the U.S. Army, explained that no tank was given to any side of the war in Syria.
They lied to YPG about hundreds of tons of tanks and weapons.
The main explanation of the wrong news about the earthquake that took place in Syria was:
It has been claimed that the United States has sent hundreds of tons of tanks and weapons to Syria to support the U.S.
The news is that some fundamental facts about the situation in Syria do not exist.
The U.S. doesn't have any group tanking against Deash in Syria.
Most of the US's support for the Syrian Arab Coalition (SAK) elements in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG) is primarily light weapons and significant military aid.
The occupied Syrian Arabs are also fighting to clean up and rebuild their homes.
TYDTA President Ermut: The real foreign investment is over the past year
TYDTA President Arda Ermut said that the entire investment last year came after 55 months.
15 And Ermut, who realized that there was no mention of investment because of the entry into the field of FETZ, said, "Maybe there would be more than that, but he didn't.
Maybe if these conditions were not, if there were no regional developments, we could see more than the impact of the storm.
That's why we hope more for the next year.
It's going to be a year more bright in the real sense of investment.
By the first five months, by the first 5 months of the year, we're going up 11 percent.
But we don't find that enough.
"We hope there's more." He used his words.
Ermut, who said, "We don't like regional developments, if necessary," said they were trying to diversify investors.
Ermut, normally, reminded of 75 percent of real investments until 2010, continued to say:
This number fell to 66 percent.
Again, the share of Asia went from 2 percent to 7-8 percent.
Russia's share has increased.
While we were trying to do this, some problems arose between the Korfez countries themselves.
Turkey has a good relationship with all of them, particularly Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
But the problem between these two countries is that we are sorry, and it's actually making investors' decisions a little bit more complicated.
It's not just about investments in Turkey, so we might be living some nights.
Arda Ermut reminded me that some events have occurred in Germany last week, but the government, particularly President Recep Tayyyyy and Erdogan, has shown a clean and firm response to this situation.
When talking to investors in countries with the most serious political crisis, President Erdogan's reaction was, "There will be some problems between governments, and there will be no certainty among peoples."
The second of these people came and invested in the country.
This doesn't make any difference to us from Turkish companies.
They'll come to us when they're the smallest problems, we'll solve them.
Ermut, who said, "We will not allow them to fight for the cause of God," said Ermut, who said, "We will not let them fight."
Ermut says, "We can guarantee this in our time."
You'll see that neither German companies nor investors from some countries that we're in any way in politics will be in no trouble.
Instead, we will do what we can to increase the investment from these countries.
We think the investment from here will continue to grow.
Of course, political developments can sometimes affect the investment environment.
He said, "Well, we're going to do what we're supposed to do, and we're going to do what our investors and I'm not gonna do."
TYDTA President Ermut, after the only narrow road strategy, told him that Turkey had begun to take a greater interest in China, but if problems were solved in Körfez, they expected the biggest investment from Körfez.
"In relations with Germany, there is no investor who says, 'We were in trouble because of these relationships, and because of this, we had investments, and we are running'," said Ermut, who used his words, "who came and came and followed them.
Ermut says, "Today, 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio are close to German companies."
So the companies we've seen around the world, almost 10 percent of them are from German companies.
Some of these are companies that are still investing in Turkey.
A man is going to expand his investment or something, and we're standing out as a project.
"The German companies are still making an important part of our daily business."
In the periods during which the initial operations were carried out, Turkey expressed its wish that Ermut, who claimed that all government bodies should be careful, was sensitive and could be affected by the least negative communication.
Ermut, pointing out that those who lived in the past two or three weeks, said:
It's always different with investors.
We've always seen this, and economic relations always make it possible for political developments to take a positive turn.
Germany will continue to be our important trading partner and our important investor.
Because there's still a lot of investments in Turkey.
The election day in Germany, unfortunately, is increasing this kind of speech.
I think they'll get along a little bit more.
Saudi Arabia is also concerned about the negative interpretation of two countries.
A investor who invests in Turkey, netizens all the countries of the world's markets.
As a result, it wasn't due to Saudi Arabia, but it was a rather slow period of uncertainty in the region.
But we're still meeting these investors.
My personal opinion, investors may be waiting for a decision they can make faster.
'In a negative sense, I see the uncertainty of the crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, and I'm getting out of here.'
On the other hand, we have Suudi investors who continue to live in Turkey, who meet us on the other side while doing the workshop here, and we've been following the whole course.
Ermut next year reminded me that international investment in Turkey (UDY) is worth 12.3 billion dollars, "I think we'll definitely go through it this year.
"How far we're going to go, these regional developments, global uncertainties will affect us."
While hoping that there would be more than normal impact, Ermut suggests that it might be a little more restrictive, indicating that the first five months were increased by 11 percent, and that this could be protected, "If there's no bad development, I believe we'll definitely close up for the last year."
He gave Ermut, logistics, health, fitness, knowledge, oil-chemicals, gas, energy and imaginative information indicating that a significant part of the investments will continue to be viable.
Ermut, who's threatened to make new investments in the months to come, says, "Maybe we'll have an anonymity in the future."
It's not a billion dollars, but I'm a big investment.
"There can be investments from countries if you want."
Operation for 4 wine firm 9 years: 55 glasses
In response to the Istanbul Refugee Crimes, the Shobe Management Teams found that the mandarin found on the products sold by 4 wine companies did not be bound to the bottle long and long and long, that the bananas were not added to the bottle, that the TAPDK banners were collected after the product was sold, and that they were sold in combination with new wines.

It was shown that police teams were calling on a warehouse to check out the cashes on the wine bottles on the street.
Full of mail collected from the bottles used, the TAPDK banner caps were saved by police teams.
How will football's financial rules affect Neymar's access to Paris?
The rules governing the prevention of unlimited spending by European football clubs will not prevent the world's transfer of record to Paris-Saint Germain from Spain from Barcelona.
A government that controls the game in Europe, which teams from the Prestige Champions from the League tournament, can come from UEFA to Paris Saint-Germain.
In 2011, UEFA's financial rules of the Judiciary of the Judiciary meant that Neymar's transfer to the PSG would ultimately have to be financed without the loss of life.
To Barcelona, only Brazil paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) in order to buy it out of the contract, and will earn ten million dollars a year in the year Neymar.
Some of the financial ways to get to France from Neymar are as follows:
When the team takes the energy money from Katarzyl's family in front of the money, he can, of course, sign the PSG Neymar and pay for it to add it to the galaxy of other stars.
The club members are allowed to spend their money on gambling, but they also have to go back to their special sources of expertise in football achievement.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after he was elected UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that he had been successful in the pursuit of the success of high-performance clubs and that if the banks or the owners supported them, they would be at risk of failure.
In 2011, the FFP began to monitor the damages rather than the debt of the clubs.
The change meant that Roman Abramovic's model was first used in Chelsea in 2003 (a potential club, a high cost to improve the team and a global brand).
In the 3-year FFP assessment period that has continued until 2018, clubs can be affected by 30 million accidents.
Although Platini had been disfellowshipped from the presidency in 2015, he still had to make a decision about his resignation from the UEFA deputy Alexander Cefer.
Andrea Traverso, who conducted the FFP in UEFA last week, said to Associated Press: "The FFP is certainly not dead and we will certainly strengthen its rules."
As long as PSG Neymar's purchase material is to be paid as a whole, it can be issued in the contract period for accounting reasons.
A five-year agreement was signed on Thursday, so in the five-year annual accounts for which the transfer fee is due, it can be shown as a loan of 44.4 million.
In 2014, the first wave saw the application of the FFP standards, which were owned by PSG and Abu Dhabi by Manchester City.
The PSG, which later fell to 20 million euros, was sentenced to a fine of 60 million (82 million dollars for that time) and was ordered to limit the Champagne League team normally with 21 players for the period 2014-2015.
The UEFA is in a position to deal with clubs that are able to deceive financial editors through companies related to the owners of the club.
Although a strong company may be sponsoring PSG, if the sponsorship value is considered to exceed the standard market values, UEFA will not allow it to be considered a fair income.
In 2014, UEFA ruled that Qatar's tourism authority was involved in the PSG sponsorship.
One of the winners of Neymar's PSG was told that Qatar's 2022 World Cup Organization Committee would be able to pay for it.
But PSG and Qatar in 2022, they denied that Neymar would be a World Cup envoy, and such an action could be easily taken by UEFA editors.
The actions applied to PSG in the past mean that UEFA will be more careful than trying to break the rules.
According to experts on the subject, it's not part of a preliminary discussion with UEFA on the transfer of Neymar's PSG.
They talked to The Associated Press as soon as they could not talk about PSG's situation.
The latest published accounts show that PSG has over 10 million euros compared to 542.4 million euros in 2015-16.
The accounts of the past financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar to contribute to sponsorship agreements, presents and form sales.
After the column has been signed, the surgeon is expected to increase by at least 30 percent.
The Spanish league, which was clearly uncomfortable with one of the biggest football players, tried to prevent Neymar's departure from holding the PSG's FFP.
La League president Javier Tebas Spanish newspaper told AS that Qatar's PSG was owned by the PSG, saying, "This is an open 'mala doping' with the club and the government."
Arsene Wenger, head of an American sports club, shares his concerns about financing by a government of La League.
On Friday, Wenger said, "It's a result that you've had, and it's completely changed the whole country of football in the last 15 years."
"Everything is possible when you have a club in a country.
It is very difficult to respect the financial Fair Play because for a country such a large player might have a country of different ways or different interests.
The status of 'tavan price' of the security agents
According to the TSB, the insurance sector has been damaging since 2006.
In 2015, the sector affected by 2.35 billion TLs and only 19 million TLs in 2016.
Borsa works in Aksigorta, Anadolu Sigorta and South Sigorta in Istanbul.
At a meeting of the first six months of 2017, the TSB said that the 11-year traffic insurance injury reached 7.3 billion TLs, and that this year the sector's injury to TL 2.3 billion was estimated to be 125 per cent of the injury.
This year, Chads, who said they would catch the number 2015, taking into account the fact that the other branches of the injury recorded in 2012 and 2015, "This means that we also increase the purchase of the county police by making the bad driver financially. "
He said, "Fifty percent of the sector has been financing the bad driver in a way that our partners in the country are abroad."
Oh, my God.
We don't expect traffic, but when we look at the past 11 years, we don't show that we haven't seen a year.
He said, "We accept this, but we hope that we can carry it with other police."
When other products were injured in traffic, Chats, who said that they had a dramatic price increase in traffic insurance, said, "In 2012, 30 percent of the traffic insurance increased, almost twice the price was added in 2015, and we wrote the biggest damage in our history."
"Our wife was only 19 million TL in the end of 2016, even in an environment where the profits increased so much," he said.
Chats, who say they expect the next year's free rate to be passed, "We'll pay a high price to the bad driver in Serbia."
He said, "But the House is looking at the general trip, the last word in the House about when it is going to happen."
The Consistency of the property has shown that a large proportion of the population in the traffic insurance premiums required since 2015 has been affected by a large percentage of the increase, and the maximum premium (tavan fiat) has been applied since Nisan 12.
Therefore, the maximum thresholds for traffic insurance for each vehicle group, press and traffic density in relation to the required traffic insurance policy have been identified in the annual groups identified in view of accident statistics.
Eight-way traffic insurance for Tammuz has been implemented in life for high-frequency press damage or vehicle groups.
The traffic insurance policy in the water will be shared between the press and the insurance companies.
These insurance companies will be identified by the Prime Minister of the Interior.
In the first 6 months of the first year of the first year of the first month of 2017, the police said that the number of police increased by 4.9 million to 8.6 million, and that the number of traffic police in the first half of 2017 increased by approximately 30 percent.
The Chatkers, who said that this year's traffic will take their wives back in other branches, said, "This is not going to hurt this animal's prices.
How much more can the sector carry this harm?"
The Chatkers, who said that all companies in the sector would have a turnover of 9 billion TL, only 2.3 billion TL traffic would have ended in three years, saying, "What are the drivers paying for the bad driver, and why do thousands of my feelings finance the bad driver in Turkey?"
"We're trying to tell Hazine what we said at this point."
After these developments, foreigners are calling for a question of whether they have come to a point of weight reduction in the Turkish insurance sector, "They haven't come to that point yet."
They're waiting for Turkey to invest more because it's 1.3 people in the Netherlands when 6 police are on average, this is Turkey.
"It is a place where Turkey needs to grow in true meaning with its membership," he continued:
They didn't leave here because they didn't.
But even though the company gets a lot of money every year, it's using the whole world to make the company grow.
According to the TSB data, in 2016 the production of raw materials in the sector was 40.5 billion TLs, compared with the same year in the first half of this year, 12 times 23.1 billion TLs.
The polls said that the sector had predicted that it would not be complete by 15 percent in the production of the total press.
Social assistance to thousands of chronic patients
The details and application of the "The New Social Assistance Programme for the Fight Against Chronic Diseases" were identified, which began with the advice of Family and Social Policy Officer Fatma Betül Seyan Kaya's advice.
The social assistance programme to be launched for parents and families in poor conditions will be used, at the first level, for 4 billion tuberculosis and SSPE patients.
Patients will also be provided with regular psychosocial support on three and a half months' support.
The blind, the doctors will pay more than the tuberculosis patients who are diagnosed with a need to improve their living habits, who have not gone to their care, who have spent their lives on bed, or who have had to improve their living habits.
Payments will be made through Social Aid Cards provided by PTT.
Those who don't go to pay for pornography, for sickness, for lack of reason, will be paid at the door.
The program, in many ways, makes it the first thing in the world.
One of the ten companies that I'm going to invest is still in Germany.
President Arda Ermut, President of the Republic of Turkey, has indicated that the political process is not confined to the business world of the two countries that the German companies in Turkey consider to be a Turkish company.
Ermut used the words, "No investor in relations with Germany, "We're running out of this situation."
Ermut, "About 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio are German companies."
Some of them have an investment in Turkey.
He said, "The Germans are making an important part of our daily work."
Ermut asked the Abraj Group to join Netlog as a good example of this.
Abraaj Group, Omar Syed, pointed to economic growth in Turkey, said, "We have invested a total of $1 billion in Turkey."
I'm sorry, I'm going to be the Last Osman.
It was announced that he would sign a formal contract with Osmanlíspor for two weeks in order to find a club.
At the beginning of the last season, the transfer ended four hours in an adult-age college, which signed a contract by 2019, with the team forming a 2 cupboard, with a 5-dollar 4 assistance performance.
I've managed to get Özer back, and instead of this player, he agreed with the Brazilian Sergio Antonio yesterday.
The transfer of the century has come true!
Barcelona explained that Neymar transferred 222 million euros to Paris Saint-Germain in exchange for the euro.
In recent times, the transfer of the football population has become official.
The PSG paid 222 million euros, which was free to the Catalan team for the Brazilian player, to pay for the star name.
Well, well, with this bonservis betel, it's been the worst transfer of football history.
France 1. Football League (Ligue 1) said Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) had signed a five-year contract with Brazil's star Neymar.
According to a statement made by the club's Internet site, bonservis was awarded 222 million euros, and the world's 25-year-old, Neymar, who came to the world's worst football field, signed a contract to form the PSG by 30 June 2022.
After the signature process, Neymar said that he was very happy to wear a uniform in France, saying, "Since I started football in Europe, PSG has always been one of the most controversial and expensive teams."
I have a reason to join my teammates in this club and take as many cups as we want."
PSG will pay Neymar 45 million euros per season.
So the star player's legacy will have a body over 400 million avrons on the French representative.
Fishing wire makes bad dental floss
The company of the University of Zümmer was unable to provide a collective agreement between the Turkish Maritime Union (TDS) and the United States.
And on that, the union member of the union came out on 12th of December.
A month later, the strike ended at 3 p.m. after the attack on the workers.
According to the signed collective business agreement, 12 percent of people in the world's black population will be employed.
The newly refurbished captain of the International Ship Sicilia, who was subsequently transferred to the International Shipyard, together with the Salary Tax Administration, has received more than 25 percent of the money received for the staff of the ship's staff at 25 percent.
THE SECURITY Board of Directors had heard that the journeys in the interior would continue at a normal rate, that the journeys in the South would begin at the end of the week, and that Foça and Urla would begin at the end of the week.
TDS President Hasan Pekdemir, pointing out that they had closed their contact with their 23-day strikers, said, "The fierce people will be relieved."
In the end of Grev, improvements were made to our staff working on the map and the sea.
We're leaving the desk in a way that's good.
The average depth of the seabed will be 28 percent, and the distance will be about 20 percent.
We also had friends who worked at Asgari's salary.
And We made good their dues in the best sense.
Nostalji, "Slave American Letter" and "My Friend Detective"
So for the bright days of characters in the '80s, for the '90s' grunge cycle (the times when the brains like David Wain and Michael Showalter did the MTV) and for himself, the stars Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd were nostalgic for all of this version of the story.
As a cultural product, it's not only the conclusion of our time and the conclusion of our memorable Facebook era.
But in a series, it's like the period is broken.
"The first day of the camp" was an unexpected success, and it was not just an absurd scene (in it, H. Jon Benjamin had a story about the roots of a spoken box.)
In an effort to reach the top of the comic book (playing the average middle-aged children) the joke has made it possible to recapture the past section of the joke.
Now, among adults, the "One Year Later" that's playing is less sensitious, and the "Fiveth El" of the 90s is a follow-up monologue, and it's more like "Five El" film.
In one point, an Apple Powerbook combines some of the unique patents and "a lot of other things since 1991".
Most of the stories are the same.
He's no longer a coop writer, but Marguerite Moreau.
Victor (Ken Marino) hasn't lost his mind yet.
And now George H. W. Bush has another crazy plan that Ronald Reagan (now Mr. Showalter) has met with.
They say the best part of the series as always.
In particular, it's nice to see young Mr. Rudd, who's always in the "Bears" section of Matt Dillon, who's always on his feet, that he looks like Andy, who's the most popular kid in the old school, is now a monster.
There may be times of madness in this series that can give power to this series (e.g., the "Seven Up!" series) until it comes to what I think is a reasonable result: "Swift America's Letter: Winter Years" which, in the last season, makes friends see the rest of the "Slave New America's" film.
At the same time, the Amazon's "Dear Detective" elects a different type of nostalgia: "The Americans" resurvival of the Cold War, the film "Bomb of the West" and even the West, with the iconography against the West.
Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, a comedian managed by Rhys Thomas, appears to be a TV that has been found: a 1980's, which has been in the struggle for the real, atheism and Marksist-Leninist journeys.
The toprollers play short Gregor and idealist Joseph, Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelius Ulici, and their dialogues are performed by Channing Tatum (also the leading producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a very bright idea.
But this isn't much more than an idea.
There are some nice visual comedies (Americans watch football while police watch television)
It's also a famous stagemaker who has Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny; it's a good asset for the game "who knows who."
But "Dear Detective" calls himself so much that a fake propaganda drama is like the truth (reagan's mask includes a killer's knife) that most of them play exactly like it.
He can't cross the six long section, and the comedy isn't fast enough or too often.
Gregor and Joseph, while visiting the greatness of the two fat men who were eating hamburgers, a congregation that always had a cold spot in the lobby, could have made propaganda a better place if the "Friend Detective" had been dragged to a longer distance.
The message to the ghost communist monitor could turn anything into food that's going to happen in the Western culture as a series.
The Qur'an's Creators are not wrong: We do this for our own good, and even for theirs.
FETÖ's father's Cadets
The English Government has seen our family as the result of the five years of experience.
The government has admitted that the top floor of the family has been linked to the English Government since then and that it has been in large services.
The English Government needs to be prudent and careful about the purchase, to investigate everything thoroughly, and to decide carefully.
While trying to understand the FETÖ, it takes root as a starting point, but it's a forgotten mystery that the FETÖ's imperialist era has been a myth that has gone from place to place and has moved with the conquerors.
It's the Canadians who have to take the lead in this mine.
In his instigation in English, he is the founder of the Church's Mirza Gulâm Ahmet Kadiyanīnī, the founder of the Church.
Gulâm Ahmed, born in the small town of the capital of India, was born in Kadiyan, India. "In April 1888, he announced that God had commanded him to be free from his enemies and to create a separate nation."
In 1891, however, he said that he had died in a state of death like the other prophets, and that God had sent him as a messenger and a blessing, which the believers expected.
So it's Mirza Gulâm Ahmed Kádyanī, the same person with the message that Muslims expect.
(Islamic Encyclopedia, TDV)
After Sipahi was released in India, in India, where the entire English divorce was under way, Gulâm Ahmed, who had written books against Hindus and Christians, was thought to be built with a completely holy remnants, but after CIA support, he joined the Communist Party against Islam, which fought against interference with the President of the United Nations.
Just like the Sun, Gulâm Ahmed's favorite idea of imperialists is that the "citizen" of Islam is only a struggle with its own soul and that if you can live free of religion, it is not the size that will be fought against imperialism.
Even if you do not remember one more step in the morning, the harm that has been done in our history has increased in a year's time when we even passed the attacks of the Red Sea.
There are red lines between you and them.
They don't touch your wife or your daughter.
They're not connected to us. They're not connected.
The idea that the regime and Christianity unites itself, the idea that their society will be a deliverer of Islam, the idea that the war is only a matter of mind-to-peak conflict, is similar to the fact that the rapids of war have become a reality, and the evolution of Catholicism is generally educational and civil society.
In 1869, the number of the world's mass centres of Canadians, said to be 2 million, is estimated to be 23 countries officially registered as the emergency aid facility "Humanity First".
In addition, 36 patients in 12 countries, 650 in 55 countries, only 8 cases of Canadians in Africa; in 11 countries, 505 educational institutes and some 16,000 teams were found on the world.
The Nobel Prize winner is Professor Abdüsselam, Sir Zaferullah Han, President of the United Nations Court of Justice, and the "Muslim Actor who won the Lord's prize" Mahershala Ali is also a Canadian, and we can see more clearly the depth of the recognition of the world's powers to the Canadians.
Let's note that the women's meeting with 30,000 people last week in England has also been broadcast as a show in a village.
In fact, one of the slogans is short enough to understand the history of Canadians who say, "Be happy and hate no one."
Hulusa, FETÜ or Tahir-Kadri, can be used to convey their exit points and motivations to the Canadians, and in fact, all of them are to support the public as a means of conveying imperialism and serving the cause of prosperity.
Out of the cargo's "son's wish"
Because of Pancreas cancer, he spent his last days in a hospital in Washington, U.S.A. (50) and asked for a restaurant in his hometown, a coffee and chocolate-consuming milkshake.
A friend of the woman met Tommy's owner of the restaurant.
Tommy Fello, who worked at the same restaurant for 47 years, put his drinking bottle and paid the price of $123 (435) to the hospital 600 kilometers away.
Two new projects from Ahmet Kul
To date, the Ahmet Kul Building, which has survived major projects such as Lavinya Park, Autoport, Vetro City, Ginza Lavinya Park, has launched seven projects in Istanbul, Dia Mare, Bodrum Yalykavak.
The Dia Mare project, developed by Mimaris Chamoğlu, was developed to derive maximum benefit from the sea from the geometry of the project.
Dia Mare, located on an area of 11,000 metres, has a total of 188 contaminants and 17 commercial units.
The early construction project will begin to be submitted to new owners in March 2018.
Dia finds a multi-digit type of steel that changes from 2+1 to 5+1 in Mare.
In this year, the company that will take two new chances in Myanmar and Bitez is preparing to sign two major projects at the Summit in 2018.
753 million has been transferred to manufacturing companies.
The Führer said that many programs were made out in the TRT where the 6,000 760 personnel were working, and that they paid for flights.
The CHP official, "TRT 2016, reimbursed the national taxes to AKP companies."
He said, "That's the name of it."
The source of TRT's transfer to manufacturing companies was related to the data obtained from official documents.
The CHP of Istanbul State of the United Nations noted how TRT's resources were used to respond to the official application of the law on the subject.
Despite the technical possibilities of all kinds of projects, the company said that in 2016 753 million TL 500 000 were transferred to companies operating under the name of external construction.
The CHP official used the expression "the meaning of this".
"AKP's journalists and employees' production companies don't call TRT."
He said, "Millions are paid for unrecorded or undecided works."
The Friend, who remembered that the money transferred to the companies was collected from the people's taxes, said, "The company of 7,000 people turned to the side of the AKP."
He said, "What programs did these companies sign for which 7,000 people couldn't do?"
The TRT, explaining that the advertising industry in 2016 was 224,456,182 TL, indicated that the advertising industry was listening to it when the company, the personal funds and the others were included in the account.
A friend, "AKP's voice, TRT, can't even advertise for not being monitored."
Newspapers are getting money from the TRT, making a goofy on behalf of the AKP.
He said, "If you take the load, the people will pick it up."
The CHP Friend put it this way: "TRT pays 660 million TL a year for personnel; but everything is done out of construction."
From the TRT, 753.5 million of the population have been deported to their neighbors.
It's an endless range.
He went out and apologized in front of his wife.
The incident took place at an airport in Sokak, the capital of the Republic of Yugoslavia, at about noon.
According to the report, on the 4th side of the park, the environmental residents who saw the wall below told the state of the area and the health teams.
The relief teams that took place in the area where they found themselves were in the fire, and the health teams were waiting for them.
The psychologist and the police team, who were invited to take the stand, asked for forgiveness for a short time after their efforts to investigate, after about 1 hour later, Yunus G., his 34-year-old father, and his wife, who had been watching him, asked him to come and apologize in front of N.G.
Some parents recorded their cell phones while watching the location of approximately 100 people on the street where Yunus G's was located.
It's going to move your instant messages to your friend and neighbor's memory!
How many hours of prayer?
The five messages continue to be investigated by relatives who will benefit from this event and send them to friends.
On that day, when the prayers of the people who will perform their worship at Friday Prayer will be answered, the bells will be filled or opened to the creation.
Here are some of the Kuma messages that have been examined on this special day, and details of the Cuma Prayer's hours of escape.
Do not be afraid of asking forgiveness. No sin is greater than the mercy of God.
That's great, Cumas.
Praise be to God, the Lord of the heavens and the earth.
You're not going to be disappointed with what you've promised.
You can't turn your request back.
O Deva, one who is tender and obedient, and those whose hope is to be guarded, and who prays for the war booty, be careful of (their duty to) Allah.
Don't turn our hearts away from your guidance.

Bank of England will keep phase events at %0.25
The Bank of England is expected to explain soon after the slow economic growth and the slowdown in inflation will be a rise in speculation, which will not change the stage events.
The Bank of England warned that the growth of the economy would continue to "slow" with the closure of the family's income.
The Bank's decision-makers (MPC) used 6 to 2 months to maintain the rates by 0.25, so this month required a smaller increase after slow economic growth.
The Bank, in its three-month inflation report, called for an increase of 1,7 in 2017, to 1,6 in 2018, and warned that the inflation would continue to increase to 3% in the morning, hoping that the population would continue to be affected by inflation.
However, in the years ahead, it was said that there was a sign that the rate increases were necessary to reverse Brexit's inflation and that the debt capital could be more than expected in the financial markets.
The members also used the voice to withdraw some part of the economic improvement package that began a year ago in Brexit.
The bank said it would end the Global Funding Plan, which will end the low-financed bank in next month, but it expected more than $115 billion (total $115 billion) in the plan framework.
The bank, after a few minutes of making a decision, said: "The MPC's central idea is to move on slowly with the narrow inside (GSYH) and the collapse of internal real incomes is to continue slowly."
With regard to prices, he pointed out that it might be necessary to reduce inflation in the monetary policy and that the market would be “a lot higher” than expected.
The markets still predict that the first growth will take place in the third quarter of the coming year and that another will be in 2020.
But the bank is going to be "step" and "limited" every step.
According to the estimates in May, this year's and future year's growth estimates are compared to %1,9 and 1.7.
The bank is protecting the figure of %1.8 in 2018.
Sterlin, after the news, has lost value for the dollar and against the jury.
The pound was 1.31 U.S. dollars and 1.11 A.D. by 0.4 by 1.11 percent.
The change decision came after the increase in the number of the number of the last few months that caused the loss of %0.2, according to GSYH's second circle of %0.3.
The increase is probably going to be %0.3 in the third circle, but according to the bank, the increase will start at the end of the year at the end of the year.
When the bank says it's going to worsen before the crisis is over, the latest inflation report, further inflation, and four-year-olds are left with little joy to their people.
The bank said that in the years ahead, money policy would not "stop" strike, but it was expected that the three-year estimates of money would be correct at the end of the three-year period.
At the end of the weak pounds, the increase in demand for British goods will support the economy by comparing some of the wasted consumption costs.
The decision will be made one year after the vote in August after the EU referendum has been held at 0.25%.
The bank predicts that this will take four years to affect prices and the economy as a whole.
Prior to the bank's final phase decision, the increase in inflation pressure on the poorest countries and the increase in the number of three policy makers required an increase of 0.5 by the call of the three policy makers.
The inflation rate in the year %2.9 went to %2.6, but the bank said it was expected and it would increase again in the coming months.
The bank said it's about "no" pounds, according to its %2 targets.
Andrew Montlake, director of the Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "When the last drop in cash is taken in front of the auctions, the employers' work and the year needs to be closed in a reasonable way, once again the mortgage market will become more profitable.
The market; it seems well-known for those who have reached the end of the existing agreements, with many free options and low rates becoming more popular than ever."
NHS will write HIV medicines against 10,000 people
In the High Court, patients will be able to access HIV prevention every month following a fight against drug financing in NHS.
In England, NHS reported that the risk of infection in high-risk individuals was reduced by up to 10,000 health services of up to 3 years of pre-sex-inhibited pre-sex-inhibited malaria prevention (PREP).
The Supreme Court's decision last year agreed to finance the trial following the recovery of the Temyiz Court of Justice, which was said to have the power to pay for the claim by the NHS to finance the local authorities.
With this incident reported on Friday, NHS England's president Simon Stevens identified it as a 'new and serious problem' by National Aids Trust (NAT).
In London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield, sexual health clinics will be the first to be registered in the public, with more involvement of the clinical team in England, until Nisan 2018.
A number of HIV medicines that reduce the risk of HIV infection before pregnancy (PREP).
Tests have shown that HIV transmission has been significantly reduced among those at risk of infection.
PreEP taking before sex means that a person has enough medicines to prevent the spread of HIV infection in his body.
These medicines can be taken every day or every two hours before they're having sex.
Those who are suitable for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transsexual people and HIV-positive partners who are not successfully treated.
The clinics will identify appropriate participants from men, women, transexcendents, and from people who are not known to be exposed to anti-retroviral treatment by their partners.
Those who live in England and are registered with a practice expert will also be able to register for potential participation in local sexual health clinics.
The program will hold £10 million and signed an agreement to provide drugs this week with an offer to the countries of the NHS England.
The test was designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how PrEP was targeted, conducted and applied to large scale.
Mr. Stevens said, "This is going to be in the hands of a wide-ranging and more successful surgeon in the new and serious context of HIV.
This is one of the most important health problems of mankind in 30 years of progress.'
Nat's National Aids Trust, Deborah Gold, said: "This is a turning point in combating HIV.
If the target is correct in what is needed and at risk, it is possible to translate HIV into England's PreEP virus.
After a year, people with high HIV risk will reach a new and powerful way of life that has been specifically controlled by NHS in England by the NHS, which will lead to many lives improved.
We're getting this feeling warm.'
Terrence Higgins Trust spoke to Ian Green, president of Terrence Higgins Trust, saying: 'The first thing we need to do now is to make it happen quickly in the country and not leave someone at risk for HIV.
As the PREP test drug is now provided, we are on our way to protect more than 10,000 people who carry HIV risk.'
Shadow People's Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'We're looking forward to the start of the PreEP trial, and it's been late for months and then the government's legging down.
Evidence shows how much this drug can be a factor in the end of this life-changing infection as part of our view of HIV prevention.
Deney will draw us closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important to protect the people who are infected with HIV and to speed up the spread of HIV in the community as soon as possible in the country.

Two secret deaths
The daughter of Omit Macbule Chillinger, who was born in Washington, U.S.A., died from a 19th-century job station used as a hotel in Istanbul Levent.
Melis Saliholu, a 24-year-old university student, died at home.
Saliholu's got his hands on them.
A two-secret murder investigation was initiated by the police and the police.
'WARD THE DESTRUCTION'
In 1971, the first Turkish Senate and President of Tikaret, who was responsible for the government of Nihat Erim, joined the first girl born in Washington, Washington, U.S.A., to Le Meridian Hotel in Etiler, on August 1, 1966.
An ambulance and police team were called instead of informing a powerful tourist hotel administration of a dead body of Chilingiroglu who had been living in the 19th camp and who had not received any information from him for some time.
The health team reported that Chillingroğlu, who fell from the 19th floor, lost his life.
The mother of the police said, "There was a depression in those days."
31 December came from Ankara to Istanbul.
I've had a stroke with my other daughter.
He said, "It was about my chest, and I was affected by my chest disease."
The funeral is expected to be held in Ankara by the Collegiate Church.
It's investigated whether one of them was fired by the chiliroglu or what he did.
'CHANNA KIND' DIRECTORY
The other suspect death in Istanbul was in Sariyer Zechariahkoy.
Melis Salihoğlu, who was a student at the University of the Forest, died at the home of Melis Salihoğlu (24).
According to the authorities, the young girl's father, who didn't receive the message and she didn't get it from her cell phone, went to the house near the point of school.
Dad, he met his daughter's dead body at home.
His family, his close friends, and his loved ones took the lead in the house of Melis, who ended up living in exile.
Melis Salihoğlu killed his family and neighbors.
After Melis, a friend of the social media, "He was shooting at our face in the morning sun."
Under our feet, we were impressed when our best friend Jack and sister were running after that little plastic bag with their sister Eysan.
"What needed to share the message of death now."
Living a life of luxury: It's a very tough and intelligent design number that turned this little Earls Courts into a nice house.
In 2014, former banker Joanne Leigh, who was a lawyer, went from house to house in Knightsbridge to the Earls Court.
It was a new design that proved that Queen Anne was on the first side of a piece and that Joanne was convinced not to collect the waves.
"I used to live in a much larger area in Knightsbridge with my old love before," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something like my price.
I was shown the Earl Court building, and there were the same high courts.
I loved her, and I offered her a present that day."
After the first meeting, 1000 ft of steel was refurbished from the top.
In the beginning, it was a single room and a complex kingdom; you had to pass through the kitchen to reach your bedroom. Joanne wanted to add a storage area and an object bed to use at the maximum level of the roof.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows and a lot of light.
It was my speed."
To this end, noting Hill's central monument and design studio, Duck & Shed, has made Erfan Azadi benefit from a 12.5-ft table and it's not just a building that makes Joanne live at the same time.
Tavan, it wasn't high enough to add two areas above, so he was creating an object that you can stand in.
He had to think creatively in order to solve the issue.
She explains, "Speech is very complicated."
"We had to set them free so that they could assemble together, without any need for support from one another.
It wasn't just building a platform, and at the same time, the windows would be so fixed that they'd be at the top or bottom of the function."
This arrangement, bringing many more dramas, made it possible for Erfan to get two full-size rooms on each other.
The old guy who was taken from Retrouvius for the last cat, the light window, looks at the wonderful area of life below.
The famous gold-colored furniture, silver arrows, and the old-style Serge Mouille are all the ways of lighting up the entire design.
The use of icons plays a role in adding space, field and light.
The signs of the short corridor, which are placed on both sides of the tunnel, make it look longer.
The side pane view gives an image a window that may be opened in another room.
The antrells that are on the front provide Joanne's entire chain of stones and armored storage space.
The beauty of the sitting room that created a more amazing area is to shut down when I don't use it.
It's not new when it's opened.
If it's free, it's a door that can be lifted up in garage mode.
Erfan explains the silver-powered MDF door, "We used a lot of technology here."
"There's a heavy burden, so when you're up the door, it's really easy."
Joanne has a room of more than 16 meters, and it's an improved seating plan by using the area and the storage area.
"At the end of the day there is something that you will sell in the land, or the value of your property is determined."
"As a result, a farmer will enter and make an account of the area of his stay."
They've been able to use the quality material that gives the area the surface appearance of the soil.
Erfan says, "The examples are objects you touch and thus help you build emotional bonds at home."
"In the house, you won't love the power lines on the wall.
That is of importance, but your hearts do not transgress.
This is proof that a well-designed metrician can turn a plane into a very wonderful thing.
Actually, like Joanne, you can choose not to leave.
Jeremiah Lens' bunker at Beciktaş
At the end of the 1.5-month meeting, Lens was transferred to Bešiktash with his bond service, which was considered the first rent.
After the last week's talks, Lens agreed with the North-West Team against 5 million euros of bonservis.
A 5-year-old Dutch player was taught to get $2.2 million a year.
It's expected that the prosecutor will make an official statement on the transfer of Jeremy Lens.
Photos of weddings of popular weddings
About four years ago, the actor and singer Emre Altuğ entered the world house in Soritie, where he lived in a romantic relationship with Chağla Schikel.
Both of them said, "Our life was the most special memory of our life," and the picture of our wedding was dead.
He made a separate decision seven years later.
The brothers are fighting for 500 million real estate
Two brothers, a few years after the Italian families built, were fighting for one of Victoria's biggest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million.
The director of the former Carlton Football Club and the wiseest Colin De Lutis, in Toorak, is living at three doors away from Paul, a small brother who gave himself to the High Court.
Paul wanted to leave his family from work since 2014, but he continued strong disputes at the High Court on separation.
His mother and Anna, brothers and sisters, Smith Sokaka, have owned 38 lands worth more than half a billion dollars from a store they bought in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family built Westco Jeans and raised him to a prison with a shopping center at 160 feet.
It was sold to $85 million in 1999.
This money was invested and De Lutis's portfolio now includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento stores, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments and malls in the bathroom.
In a contract with their dead fathers, Colin (defined by Paul as "a small power and dominant person" in the De Lutis family) has three companies, and Paul has three of them.
One court file says that Colin has $316 million, while Paul has $176 million worth of property.
It's a matter of sharing wealth and prestige for Paul.
In his first sentence to the court in 2015, he wrote: "The divisions suggested by Colin left him with the best things I've ever heard."
The first High Court trial was held after the accident that caused many failures.
The brothers also argue about who will control the work; Paul says Colin's leaving himself out of work.
Colin argues it's not true, but he blames Paul on being unscathed.
Colin says in a promise he gave at first, he hoped to resolve the disagreement.
"Italian roots will make me realize that the family is the most important priority."
Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, the hundreds of pages of assurances, e-mails and Allan Myers, and the best lawyers, such as the QC, and the best lawyers on both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her husband, Luigi, were a family of Italian immigrants from the late 1950s who worked in the fields and music and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
Colin's family turned down his money to buy Collingwood's property, which opened his first box of pants.
Colin says, "But in my last few years, Paul was a little boy (10 years old)" there he built Westco.
Anna De Lutis himself says that Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to leave his own property in a friendly way to his sons.
"Lugi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court."
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of De Lutis's group; when Colin left his job, he paid Mark $10 million and Luke $26 million.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark "we were happy about the conditions of financial separation."
According to the 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, best friend of the television star, Colin tried to pay attention to being a member of an old AFL club.
Fairfax Media, Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers were contacted on Friday.
He just said, "I can't say anything more because Colin is in court with a short message."
"My brother Paul has been very sad that he chose to blame me and to bring our family to trial."
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote that at a court hearing, he was trying to put his brother's demands in place.
"Our father, Paul and I didn't want us to get into an argument." And he added, "He's still hoping for a divorce."
It looks like it's gone on Friday.
Colin wrote, "Our problem will be solved by the courts in the near future."
Trump's new special word plans to limit the media diet of another.
The others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do this.
If that's the case, it'll be the first.
Politico reports that his new White Sarahy special word will limit President Trump's flow of information (including media reports), with the hope of keeping his boss more flexible.
Some of the little information from Chief Josh Dawsey:
"When White Saray's new special word, John F. Kelly, came in the first day of working with a prominent staff, the basic problem was that President Donald Trump planned to resolve the White Sarah: the transfer of bad news from another person's hand.
Kelly told the people on the paper or with the briefings that knowledge should be based on itself, because the president would be able to make better decisions when good information was given.
Kelly's knowledge is very meaningful, but others tried to emulate Trump by testing his media diet and failed.
President Trump's TV is on the way ten years ago, and he's still in White Ray, still in good condition.
An old campaign spokesman, Sam Nunberg, said to Politico on Saturday, "If you're sorry about not taking a place in the media in a fair way, I'd be more likely to show him that there's a fair place in the media."
From Politico, Tara Palmeri then wrote, "The key to keeping Trump’s Twitter behaviour under control was to ensure that the personal media society has a reputation for having a reputation."
Okay.
But it's funny that Trump's Twitter behavior is "under control" at any time.
Maybe these campaign officers know something that we don't know about, for example, if Trump's tweets, if they don't have their own problems.
We'll probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump didn't send.
If the elements could pull him out of danger several times, then their efforts were worth it.
But no one could stop Trump from creating a constant debate.
Some of the problem was that of white Sarah's rivals, who, in any case, tried to communicate their own affairs with the material they had sent to Trump (they could be trusted or untrustworthy) and became the people who put their own world views ahead of them.
In May, throughout this story, the speakers reported on how to communicate information strategically to other speakers.
Here's an example told by Professor Shane Goldmacher's details:
"The existing and former Trump officials say that if we are a member of the Tromp, they have shown their attitude to the cowards, especially to those who have a bad influence on them, and have managed to find out where they are from.
On the other hand, at the end of the day, the Internet prosecutor Charles C. Johnson's website GotNews.com, and a printed copy of a post accusing Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a series of cells" in White Ray.
It was not important for Johnson to have been charged with tweets or any evidence of fraud or committed crimes in the past, and to return from them.
Trump read the article and started asking questions about Walsh."
Goldmacher, then Special Secretary Reince Priebus and White Sarah's personal secretary, added that Rob Porter, "he is trying to establish a system that controls the curves that the Group has taken."
How did this turn out?
Kelly's trying to do the same thing three months later.
Maybe he's going to be more active than Priebus, but Trump's still fighting for the courage of his assistants.
These constant factors will make Kelly very difficult.
Krypto FETÜ"s came out with a special template
Public Prosecutor Berkant Karakaya has completed the investigation that the Secretary-General of the Maritime Forces, known as "Sermašk" code, started to say that the Chief of Staff is the FETÖ's FETÖ's FETÜ's FETÜ's FETÜ's "inquisition of military citizenship".
Instead of being a member of the General Assembly, he was accused of helping to investigate the crypto cults in the command of the Navy and of playing an active role in the fight against FETÖ.
In a decision that was signed on 15th of December, the decree of the Council of Ministers of the Seas was signed in accordance with the order of the Council of Ministers, six of which was signed on the first day of the Council's entry into employment, was expressed as having given rise to a conflict against FETÖ, which had been the first day of the Council's entry into the labour force.
In a follow-up decision by Karakaya, the following expressions were used: "It is understood that the Special Pattern of the People of the People of the People's Republic of the Republic of the Congo is the work of the People's Democratic Republic of the Congo and of the People's Democratic Republic of the Congo under 64 basic criteria.
It has been decided that, in the end, there is an active threat of a terrorist attack, such as an alleged threat to a particular and malicious entity, which is being monitored by a private and private entity, and that there is no evidence that the identity of an unconstitutional entity, and that it is not possible for us to assess the claim of an active terrorist in relation to the High Commissioner.
The Universal Sovereign has been condemned by a criminal charge before.
After that, it became clear that the FETÖs were still there and that the alleged crime was complete.
The former Air Force pilot Kurmay Albay Hakan Dinç, found in the charge that the grower himself, turned the original Adana Ingirlig 10 into a document that only makes the complaint in the form of a note.
Tanker Super Commander Air Pilot General Bekir Ercan Van, former President of the Directorate-General for Investigation, former President of the Directorate-General for Investigation, former President of the Directorate-General for Research, Colonel Mustafa Özsoy, former Chief Chief of Staff, former Chief of Staff, former Chief of Staff, and former Chief of Staff of Staff, who has authorized the transfer, was awarded the TSK because of the old Kurmay Albay Mustafa Chiczek, who was found to be a witness to the author of the case with the former Chief of Staff.
The FETÖ company of Tuncay Opcín, who was also a member of the FETZ, came to the conclusion that they had selected Yayjj as a social media partner before entering work on 15th of December.
The passengers hit her, she returned to the 'rich premises'
Some of the richest house owners of the West Midlands are fighting again with the most powerful passengers on board, who have been captured by the council to recover their property.
Travelers parked their 20-day caravans outside a region that was still far away in Solihull's time and was known as a 'richer' facility.
The Conseins returned after they had been stopped in May for years, bringing horses, babies, and a full truck.
There was an empty space in the defense of a group that was moving, and the direction of setting up a road from a section that was left undamaged.
The people of anger, saying it's useless in the solution of the problem, made the Solihull Council stand by.
An unnamed resting-place said, "They were sent out from Bentley Heath to the people on the other side of the street, and they came to the Passover night.
It should be ashamed of the council's actions because these are useless to solve the problem.
The travelers were there in May, and were sent, and now they return.
There's more to the night, probably more to come today."
He added: 'Birmingham Council knows how to deal with the long distance decisions taken to protect the parks.
I, I live on the street of Streetsbrook, and I'm not happy to continue paying my taxes while the council can't stop it.'
A local priest who did not want to give his name said, "It's like a joke, we saw that the last group of passengers is still out there, and we're already trapped by a new group.
The numbers were increasing this time, and a horse was seen sitting in the park.'
A woman from the Solihull Council said, "We realize that you are an unauthorized camp between the Streetsbrook Street, and we're starting the legal procedures necessary to send them out of there as soon as possible.
In order to support our collection of evidence, it is very important to inform the police of any anti-social or criminal behaviour by calling 101 of the multiple district law.
This will help the court to take account of the case when we are brought to court.'

Heavens with a wall with a sea don't breathe
The CHP MECC member Nadir Ataman, in the wake of a high-level depressive warning on constructions, wrote: "Dawaqi's report says that these buildings will not stop under six pressures."
The right stone, which is 25-30 meters below, indicates that the rocks aren't so deep.

He said, "There's no breath in the future."
Father, who said that the buildings such as the wall changed the intensity of the building, continued: "The temperature is 10 degrees higher than the people who are affected."
These buildings need to be built in the direction of the tunnels.
But our heavens are rising above Istanbul's raindrops.

Italy registers the approach to the rescue buttons of the STKs
Italy warned the STKs about not being allowed to continue if they do not comply with new rules that affect their operations.
In his report to La Stampa, Mr. Marco Minniti, said, "If the STKs don't follow the new pattern, it will be difficult to see that they continue to show their activity."
Minniti's warning, the Italian authorities, the German aid agency, came one day after his suspicion that he had worked with human refugees in order to facilitate a ship operated by Jugend Rettet, his pilot, his illegal move.
The aid facility, which has only been active for a year, has refused to comment on the content of the specific signs directed against them by Italian lawyer Ambrogio Cartosio.
In a statement on social media, he said: "The salvation of human life is our most important priority, and it will be, so you are very sorry that we cannot work in the area of call and rescue."
"We can only appreciate the charges to be made now that we have collected all the information and we can evaluate the situation."
Italian authorities have been monitoring Jugend Retett's ship from July.
They are suspected of having been caught by human refugees and allowed them to flee on board a boat full of cargo boots that were directly submitted by them.
According to the file of a lawyer published by the Italian media, it was at least one such meeting, according to the idea that Libya's owner had opened 1.3 miles.
It's under no pressure from the Italian security authority, who has been watching rescue operations in the region for the purpose of many other human efforts.
According to the legend, there was to be an Italian police officer who was clearly in charge of their activities, such as Yuventa.
Only three of the nine STKs who took part in the search and rescue operations have agreed to follow the line until now: Save The Children, Malta's centre MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.
On the last Tuesday, he assessed that the new rules could not be accepted, but because he said there would be no "severe change or delay" in his rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign are Nobel Prize-winning Doctors (MSF).
At the same time, Minniti said that the decline in the number of immigrants who arrived in Italy following the rescues in the past weeks showed that the efforts to strengthen Libya's security and cooperation with the local elections were evidenced.
"We started to see the light at the end of the tunnel in those days."
With this month's Libyan elections, further discussions on economic development initiatives and plans to reduce the number of migrants leaving Europe with Chad, Niger and Mali with the hope of reaching them.
The last minute!
Russia's president, Moscow, has been drinking a new vodka every year as if it were the "days of frenzied unity" in Moscow.
A Russian television broadcast in the Gorki Park, which was active and alcohol-consuming, attacked Russian TV director Nikita Ravozjaev.
He warned the man who had witnessed the developments of the day in his lifetime and who had once denied the truth, "We will capture Ukraine."
The drunk man, who was a former drug addict, threw a lot of pressure on his employer's warning.
He tried to get away from the man.
That morning, millions of people were watching live.
The Economic Coordination System was compiled
The Economic Coordination Board (ECK) was convened at the President-in-Office Mehmet Shimishek, who was responsible for the economy.
The ECK meeting, which was held first at the head of the government following the change in the cabinet, began at 18.30 p.m. in Čankaya Kushkı.
At the meeting, Turkey's macroeconomic vision will be taken into account.
The meeting of the President of the Czech Republic, the President of Mali, the Nazi Agbal, the Science, the Senate and the Technology Bank, was attended by the President of the Central Bank, the President of the Central Bank, Mr. Murat Chetekya, and the bureaucracy of the Southern African Republic, the President of the Central Bank.
It's possible 45 minutes from the fall.
Dr. Oşez Karaemino, who is concerned that only 5 percent of patients should be treated in the treatment of the disease, says, "The first step is to seek medical care and treatment, according to the patient's performance and performance results."
The Ouš Karaeminos, which states that patients continue to experience pain in a patient group (such as epidural injections, radio-fractional techniques, and internal disk connections), are warned, "If all of these methods fail to be achieved, if they are identified as drug abuse and lack of strength, then the need for surgery" is found.
Karaeminos, the most risk-free patients in our day, say that it is possible to be released from the patient in 45 minutes from the patient's illness without resulting from the intervention procedures:
Although there are very good results from open surgery with microscopic surgery, long recovery after surgery can be compared to some complications such as convulsions, convulsions, rediscoverions, and infections that may occur.
Often the microscopic surgeon is known as the ‘capable surgery’ but the microscopic surgeon is applied to me as closely as the open surgeon.
These risks arise because of the protection of the surrounding docks in the fully closed central operation.
It's only in 45 minutes.
At the Special Commission's Office
The CHP Nationals will take place in the Commission by the Minister of the Heavens, the Supreme Occult, the United Nations, and the High School of Discipline.
The Commission, Berberoglu, Istanbul 14 on 4 October.
He will also follow the application made to the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice of the District.
The CHP Secretary-General is Mr. Kohl Okaya and the Assistant President, Mr. Bünt Tezcan, in his statement that, "the fact that the accused is innocent and impartial, and that he is not ordered from any place without law, is inevitable."
"Our country wants to protect its belief in the independence and impartiality of the judiciary when it comes to the task of Mr. Enis Berberoglu."
The court ruled that the court preferred political orders instead of the trial.
In writing, the Court of First Instance found that despite the wrong decisions of the peoples of the Anayasa Court, it was held that the decision to arrest the court had not been terminated, and that the court had made a clear decision under the influence of the court.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to imprisonment for encouraging Conrad Roy's intervention
A woman in Massachusetts was sentenced to two long years of imprisonment because she was forced to send her male friend messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now in her 20 ’ s, is going to take 15 months of punishment after the fingerprints and five years after they're released.
In the month of Carter's death, on 13 October 2014, Conrad Roy himself was convicted of being killed by a terrorist attack.
Mr. Roy's father spoke on Thursday at the meeting: "My family's heart is broken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to stay free so he could open his way.
Although he faced a 20-year sentence, he and Mr. Roy had been convicted of mental illness.
The red pants and cream-colored blue Carter, with old eyes and hands beautiful and eyes on the ground when he was being punished.
The prosecutor said to the court, "His actions killed Conrad Roy."
He ended his life in order to improve himself.
He didn't accept his responsibility."
"He never showed you any remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said, "It was a terrible situation for him to be sorry for all of himself."
What is more, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he didn't see "the age, the level of consciousness, even the actions of mental illness," that he did not see.
A lawyer, Mr. Roy's mother, read Lynn Roy's statement: "I don't have a day to cry for the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I am above everything, and I'm trying to be with his sisters forever."
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that the truth was "not out of the mind" that he would never share in his brother's wedding or that his children would never get married.
He said, "The man you've been with every day since I was born is always going to be with me in the rest of my life."
It looks like there's no Massachusetts law that's guilty of ordering a person to be prosecuted.
Mr. Roy was 17 when he died of carbon monoxide in a vehicle in 2014.
The case, when Carter's brief messages encouraged him to finish his own life, he took national interest.
And when she was alone with her family, she said in a message she sent to her people two weeks before her death: 'Take yourself away from a building, and throw yourself into it. I do not know any way'
He wrote before his trial: "You should do this, Conrad" and "You'll be free and happy to open the only generator you have to do."
Judge Moniz advised that he should be allowed to leave this case on the press, so Carter said he wanted to take care of Mr. Roy's death.
The case is legal.
There was Amanda Knox, who was found guilty of killing a friend of the British room in Italy two years before he was found guilty of killing Carter in 2007.
Ms. Knox (30), in contrast to the Los Angeles Times, published a letter saying, "Michelle Carter deserves my understanding and help, not prison."
A guess-the-fashioning game from Mehmet Shishek
In his explanation, he pointed out that inflation in Turkey is the only cause of the decline in numbers, and he said that inflation created a "risk area".
The Vice-President predicts that inflation will fall by 7 percent in 2018.
She said in her smiles:
It's the 12 months of criticism that we're dealing with inconsistencies.
The biggest incentive is to reduce uncertainty.
There's a powerful government.
There's no political uncertainty.
I hope there's a lack of uncertainty in our approach.
I believe that by increasing our resistance to shocks with a few reforms, we are sitting on a grow-up trend over 5 percent of Turkey.
I told you months ago.
That's the worst thing I've ever done.
Sooner or later, our energy is no longer in those areas, but in reforms that will make it more attractive...
That's why it's 12 months ahead of us.
On one side of the reform, there's no political uncertainty.
And our chances of survival will be reduced by the difficulties we face near the end of our life.
If we don't want it, we're in a very classic market.
Libya, like Iraq.
We're not just losing the Pazar, we're facing 3.5 million traffic waves.
During the last 15 years, Turkey has grown by 5.7 percent despite all these shocks.
Turkey, we have health problems on our grounds.
Now, by increasing our resistance to shocks with a million reforms, we are moving further to Turkey's growth policy on 5 percent.
I'm gonna tell you, I'm out of here, we've got such a kind of generous mementosity system.
I think it'll be fun if I tell you that our companies don't work hard enough.
Once in my car, performance will be strong.
Why?
Because we've got it.
Firms don't have to go and spend time and spend.
We watched these concerns, taking into account the lack of performance, how we're going to figure out what global investment areas we're going to have.
In the meantime, you know what's going on here is high.
Once you give the government a net, you're going to have a performance there as a 25-year-old.
And the rest of the house's back is in the stock paper, and there's a risk of falling.
When we look at the big picture, I think you'll be more interested in me in the future.
Because they'll see the performance.
It's not a failure in the other area, it's a success.
We reconfigured BES in 2013.
I have 6.8 million participants, I have 70 billion lira units.
The system has succeeded in giving you the right.
I've got 2.6 million participants in my automatic partnership, and I have 775 million lira units.
We're asking for more of the companies.
Let's make some commercials, let's talk about this system.
We're working during the summer.
Maybe we'll get him a little nervous.
We'll see, we're working.
Maybe he sees my unit and stays in the system.
Thirty-eight percent of those out of the system.
It's almost half of those who are divorced.
You don't want a double biological disability account.
What are you doing?
You're leaving my car.
We were really waiting for a sign around 10's.
That means we're very good at it.
He's working the system once.
We've brought a primé flag.
The insurance companies are sometimes explaining it on their own.
They've raised their primers too fast.
When we asked what was going on, they said that they didn't take into account existing legal decisions.
We've done a new cleanup.
We told you to do the right thing.
They said no. We'll wait for the trial.
We said it wouldn't be.
We have a difference of opinion here.
Of course, some companies have tried to use this tape.
We've made a new arrangement.
We've created a climate of risk insurance.
Let me tell you this, let's go back.
I prefer the operation of this system by means of rehabilitating.
I mean, I don't find these wild price applications right, they just left us.
I want to see the three-size case.
Let's take care of our system.
Two, the system's normal, that's a big deal.
It weighs its load, and every 100 lire premium that pays almost 30-31 litres goes to the SGK's limit.
I'm working now, too. We're gonna talk to our banker.
Thirdly, technology is growing rapidly.
Now the traffic accidents will be seriously reduced.
But it's a necessary traffic insurance.
Sabah saved his leg.
The postpartum depression of Buerger's disease, which was caused by poverty, was seen in men before, but now it has become common among women.
One of these women is 36-year-old Mehap.
The pain that began two years ago was chronicized on the foot.
The young woman who was forced to walk was at the risk of losing her leg while she was in the hospital.
A friend suggested to Prof. Dr. Joseph Kalko.
The news on Sabah, "Azerbaijan Olaganust Keller saved the life of the King of Azerbaijan."
That's what Dursun, who went to Kalko, came to realize that he was struggling with Buerger's disease.
Prof. Dr. Kalko, she took her young wife to an emergency operation.
Just a short time later, you're saved from pain, and now you're looking at oxygen treatment.
Audio 850,000 chance of being able to edit the device when anti-virus is being used.
Said one day before Audi's hearing, BMW said it's going to cause more than 350,000 software to be raised in the vehicle.
BMW, head of the BMW administration, said that BMW (meaning the registration or restriction of certain vehicles), including Munich, believed that the company had "more intelligent options than driving restrictions".
On Friday, the three million Mercedes devices in Europe will be modified to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies were identified as calling back.
European car manufacturers, European and United States, have encouraged the use of diesel vehicles to help prevent carbon dioxide emissions.
But nitrogen oxides released by diesel engines are detected by the cancer manufacturer and can cause damage.
Automotive companies also increase the ownership of the equipment needed to control the damage caused by diesel vehicles and make it difficult to keep the car prices recoverable.
The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was accused of overhauling the powerful car companies and following the orders of the problem.
Firms are trying to prevent Volkswagen's errors from being repeated in normal driving procedures while hiding a device known as a misleading device and when a car is tested.
Many Volkswagen managers have been accused in the United States and others have been questioned both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany, the former director of the thermodynamics.
Former Director Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, an Italian, and therefore a criminal, can be condemned in the United States.
This year, Audi was led to a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen, and after the authorities charged the Audi with a system to be released from European emission rules, the United States expanded its central investigation.
It can be difficult for Volkswagen to get involved in an audition: The car manufacturer of Luks has a payback in Volkswagen.
Fishing wire makes bad dental floss
The President of the Turkish National Court of Justice, Prof. Dr. Joseph Thank you, the Court of Justice, warned that fishing would not be carried out in less than two metres of dry land.
Each year, thousands of people are at risk of drowning in cold water, and the damage to munitions is due to military risk.
It's the most common 5th or 6th term.
The properties of the fractures at this level do not affect the nerves that melt solitude in the back of the arm and leg bones.
Professor Dr. Chagülar, "The most valuable organ in these types of accidents is cut off by a broken bone or decomposed by a wound."
He said, "The first wrong aid in harming humanity is not to increase the damage in the disaster and can lead to death."
Water fishing is taking place during the fourth time in the damage to the environment.
The average age of the wounded is 20-29 and the majority are men.
Prof. Dr. Plays, "You shouldn't be caught fishing for water that you don't see inside."
He said, "If you follow the good way, you may be affected by a serious injury."
Prof. Dr. Plays also reminded them:
The damage caused by fishing can be caused by different levels of bow and legs, depending on the severity of the damage caused by fishing.
You may know the face, but the water may be deceptive.
It could be a place that looks like a grave to you.
A 70 percent reduction was observed in freshwater fishing vessels in lakes located on the coast of the United States and Australia.
Professor Dr. Châglar, "Despite the fact that there is a 28-year-old seabed in Turkey, there is no record of a single warning in places outside Istanbul."
"The decision on these types of accidents in life requires that the health management, schools and social diversity projects of every year prior to each letter should be made available in a careful manner to the owners and to the public in the waters."
TURK Nursing Association Spinal and Peripheral Sinir Cerrahisi Group President Prof. Dr. Kadir Kotil suggested that these be done in the event of injury:
The first job in the case should be 112.
The key must be held as strong as possible, not moved, and must be identified with a strong sword.
The airway must be provided and the patient must be placed next to the water drain that has escaped.
You shouldn't be forced to hold your legs and empty the water.
Don't try to fix the damage to the patient's size.
It's probably broken.
But if it has not yet been damaged, it may result in an inappropriate position to be given during the first aid and patient's transfer, pressure on the parts of the broken bones and cut them off.
Under the threat of climate change, the Provence bathroom
He turned to a symbol of Provence in South France, but he has a warning that climate change is under threat.
Lavanta lives down because of cold and disease-like insects, and it causes scientists who try to find a solution to this situation, men and women, who are suffering from a major headache.
Eric Chaisse, director of the Provence Central Research Institute at CRIEPAPAM, said: "The bathroom in Provence has been in an effective danger because in recent years, it has been exposed to the effects of climate change that has made it much less and more rainy in the first few years.
This affects the life of the bathroom.
And there's a small axtos that's damaged by a microbacter, and there's a lot of them in the dry air."
And many things are dangerous.
The perfume and cosmetics of the talismans are also being followed by a breath of water from the bathroom.
Eric Chaisse said: "We have smaller, less developed, or no or weak ones, when there must be a few large flowers in a large flower.
I mean, we have less essential rain particles."
Among the solutions considered, it includes slowing down the better distribution of water and climate from the soil, but it also has a protective barrier and a more stable way to improve the flow of water and conditions.
Journalist murder is drawing down the great threat in Mexico
The weekly newspaper Riodoce's staff in Sinaloa's country often meet together to review the latest charges, missing members, and unsolicited drug wars in the newspaper.
But this day, they came up to talk about their security in the shadow of their own tragedies.
She told them it was important to change their routines.
The two top journalists see what they feel more secure: whether to bring their children and themselves to the office of a hand bomb target in 2009 or to leave them home.
Security experts wrote three words on the front floor of the room: fingerprints, blanks, threats.
They ask for names from every column of them, and there is no need for any evidence, and sufficient are the words of their mouths.
Drug addicts, politicians, people at work, journalists suspected of being linked to payrolls, government or folders, and a list of people who are dangerous to write in Mexico's newspaper.
As the number of deaths in the country increases, there are more journalists: According to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 people have died since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in mid-2012; 589 have been under federal protection after the attacks and threats, and this year the mother has died at least seven.
Among the last dead, there are writers and inspirational sources, including Javier Valdez Cardenas, the founder of Riodace.
Valdez writes, "The biggest mistake of living in Mexico is to be a journalist."
His absence is felt by the door, but his presence everywhere, a large photo showing Valdez's middle finger, is based on the word "Justice" at the head of Riodace's building; two of the 30's leaders, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, are wearing shirts showing his smile, face, and Panama hat.
In his work, he is doing it not for two months before his death; he is talking about his associates, his kidneys, his sleepless nights, and his paranoia.
Despite the fact that a special federal ban has been established to obtain the magazines in 2010, the Committee on the Protection of Journalists has moved only two of them.
Every year, drug trafficking and organized crime are brought to the front of the law, which includes the killings of journalists, as is the case in most cases.
In Riodace, although their hearts are broken, the earth is becoming more and more deceptive, and they insist on evaluating the violence in Sinaloa.
Ibarra says it's a little work to find security without information about the killers.
He says, "It's stupid to spend my time at work."
"You don't trust anyone as long as we don't know why."
On May 15, Valdez left the state office in Riodace, the capital of Culiacan.
The Red Toyota Corrolla was only a few blocks before the two men stopped; it was forced out of the vehicle and shot 12 times for the name of the newspaper, probably translated as the Ten Commandments.
The armed man ran away to his car and hit the car nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
His wife and two grown children are gone.
What they said at Culiacan was on my freeway train.
But there's nothing but silence about Valdez right now.
After Guzman's arrest last year and after the U.S. attacks, he became one of Sinaloa's most bloody war zones in the country.
In Sinaloa, let one or more people be shot and killed every day, or the drug kings of the palace are filled with more of the bigger mosols of two houses to live.
For a minute, you've forgotten the "second" state of controlling only the valuable ports of the single folder and the U.S. drug ticket routes.
Despite this, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Riodace's firm partner and manager Ismail Bojorquez (60) was released from the crime because he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that two errors were found in the murder unit.
The first was a report from the leader of one of Guzman's team fighting with the sons of Guzman on Saturday's release, with Damaso Lopez.
This letter may have upset his sons; perhaps the members of the court had bought every copy of the press and distributed it to the press.
The second mistake was that after talking to another newspaper where the same story took place, Valdez was forced to leave the country for his own safety.
Valdez was an exposé outside Mexico and was seen as a turning point in human violence against journalists.
He lived a long life, and his friends and colleagues always knew he would be there.
He was an experienced speaker in Noroeste in 2013.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to make journalism without considering the issue of drugs," Bojorquez said.
In time, he got involved in newspapers, newspapers, newspapers, and honest news and increased advertising with sales.
Without fear of danger, the colporteurs were eager to publish exciting research, and the students were shocked to read stories that no one else could ever tell.
Riodace, eight years after his construction, won the prize prize for the news in Latin America, Maria Moores Cabot.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the International Committee of the Defence Committee, because of the failure of Mexico's drug story to stop smoking.
He admitted that he was scared.
During the CPJ's wages, he said, "I want to keep living."
In a report on Romevenito TV, a drug refugee in Sinaloa said "a way of life."
"You must accept your responsibility as a journalist, or you'll play this or stupid.
I don't want him to ask me, "What were you doing in front of so many deaths... why didn't you tell me what happened?"
Riodoce's staff miss Valdez, and as a matter of fact, they've been teaching those who are so proud of their disbelief, who are proud of their advice, how to live...
They trusted in his direction.
He always put his hat on.
El Guayabo was in front of the office, and he was always sitting on the same desk.
Now they ask: Has his love for his routine fallen?
His death forced them to question their own fate as to how best they would do and stay alive.
"If you encounter their wives, their children, their jobs, their secret airplanes, which they use to lure drug addicts, they don't like."
Bojorquez said, "These things were too restrictive."
As a result, even at the best of times, he had a high degree of autosynthesis and did not protect himself.
Trusting their own dreams.
If bad dreams come, stay away.
Andres Villarreal, director of the Riodoce works, said, "It's an incredible feeling... and that's what happened to Javier."
He and others say that the old rules in Sinaloa are not valid, just as it is not appropriate in other countries that have their own home in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and a fierce conflict...
The soil keeps changing.
The room where Riodoce met for security training was not allowed to access any cell phone; earlier, it was only used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico who were sold to governments.
Two police officers out there wanted to be rescued from 104 degrees (40 Santigrats) heat, in the shadow of a tree.
They were appointed by the state government to protect the office found in a four-storey building in the middle class of Riodace and Culiacan.
Half-thirty, some of the guests were wondering if the police in 50 were not there because they said that the walls of these halls were untrustworthy.
The months were spent in the mountain corral that the drug gangs controlled as prostitutes.
This week, Riodoce has three mother stories.
There was a murder in Sinaloa's brother, Julio Caesar Chavez's brother.
There was also evidence of government spending on the state of the valley.
And over a block from the arrest, Culiacan had a group run away at the most critical restaurant.
There was no formal explanation of who was escaped or how it was, so when the time came to write everyone in the city, the judge was afraid that the restaurant and the drug dealers and the authorities were watching.
One official, official records, found that the restaurant is registered under the name of a political politician in my government, which is in charge of almost every previous century's political party (PRI).
In recent times, many PRI governments have been accused of misdemeanor in sentimental cases.
Villareal, the author, wanted to write about events that had occurred before, including the escape of one of Guzman's sons from a military force.
Only months ago, they looked at Valdez for the best source of information about escape.
"We already knew what was going on before," said Villareal, El Flaco.
"All the channels of communication with our resources have been cut off."
In the name of the press activists, the staff is again used as a repository for panic attacks and kidnappings that protested Valdez's office's murder.
Chief Miriam Ramirez bought some pankarts and went out the next morning for another journalist at the local court office.
Salvador Adame died three days after Valdez was killed in the state of Michigan in the north.
He found a wrong body, and according to DNA tests, officials say it's him.
In the country, journalists, organized protests and buildings have expressed their views in a higher voice by writing "Helping the Foundation."
Today, Governor Bojorquez is trying to provide international support for justice in Washington, U.S.A.
On the morning of Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused the press of having sex with journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After that day, he wanted to take another assignment, thinking that his conscience had betrayed him.
Valdez continued to say that the journalists in Mexico have been "reversed" by the organized criminal, criminal partner officials and an unannounced crowd.
In his last book called "Narko-journalism", he wrote that journalists were not only killed by drug addicts but by the police and the organization's security forces in cooperation with crime.
The Media Watch Group, Articulo, has linked most of the attacks on journalists last year to police and official officials.
Ramirez said, "You die in Mexico because they want to stop you."
The murders have made a clear cold effect.
No one remembers the death of Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
The body found a note that was signed by the Zetas cartel, saying, "I'm here because of my news."
A computer keyboard and hearing, with a broken head.
After the assassination of President Miroslava Breach in Chihuahua, the northern border state chose to close certain publications like El Norte.
After the death of the authorities in 2004, others continue to act as El Manana did from Nuevo Laredo.
In 2010, Dario de Ciudad Juarez, with the headline on the front page of the Dario de Ciudad Juarez, voted to the drug cartels, "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their own countries, even from their own countries.
It's a bourgeois decision.
It's hard to find a job in prison, and they're still waiting for the road.
Sometimes, three months after the flight from Veracruz, four women and four women are taken in 2015 with a photograph taken from Ruben Espinoza, an apartment in Mexico City.
A dance made every day with these high-risk decisions for those who stay and continue to work.
Sometimes Ibarra, who wants to be a joke, says she's afraid to tell her drug dealer.
"Mexican is going to hell, and that's why I'm busy."
One of the closest comets of the past came up in the middle of the night, while the finals were getting ready to be completed, Riodoce was sitting outside the office and drinking beer, and he started playing his phone.
A series of armed conflicts involving bars and security forces near Mazatlan, a settlement on the coast, have resulted in 19 confirmed deaths.
The war continued to rage, just as it was promised in a series of folders around it.
I think they put the cell phones on Riodoce's website.
The previous page would have been changed the next day.
The sirens began to pass near, and there was another weapon around them.
Bojorquez quickly looked around to see if they were on tape.
If they were afraid, they wouldn't even show.
Under the roof portrait of the newspaper's new editors, his middle finger was cut to see the whole Sinaloa, and Riodoce's frame was following his footsteps.
"How do you think you can shut up," said Bojorquez, "when Javier was killed, trying to send me out to get him out of the street?"
He used a cupboard to escape his enemies.
It looks like a ghost at first sight, but it's a terrible ghost.
Researchers have now explained that the very best defense of the first findings of an incredible creature of the size of a Canadian miner is now that it has been identified by scientists as ‘Mona Lisa’.
She was so well protected that they could understand that money is a red cup of coffee and that they could say it was a serious past.
The report in Current Biology identified it as one of the best safest protected dinosaurs and the best dinosaur species in the world.
Fossil is a species of nodozor that has been living 110 million years in the middle of the Kretase Dönemi.
He was well-known, and he was surprised by the researchers who identified him as a 'real miracle'.
The finest fossil found in its own type, according to reports from National Geographic.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk found Suncor Millenium Madeni in North Alberta Canada near Fort McMurray.
He shot a strange thing on his back and decided to look closer.
The fossil released into the center was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
Over the next six years, 2,500 pounds (1100 kg) of wild animals were taken out of the forest.
The result is now ready to settle down after such a long period of work.
The science writer Caleb Brown, who was a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum you created, said, "If you're a little short of your eyes, you can believe you're almost asleep."
'As one of the best and best protected dinosaurs in science's history, it's gonna be Mona Lisa's dinosaurs.'
Researchers have found that the presence of the food that is likely to eat is a serious threat to the dinosers who are likely to eat it.
He used red and white camouflage to protect from very heavy dinosaurs, and he used a protective technique known as anti-landing, which has been used for many days by animals.
Scientists say that while it has been stolen by larger dinosaurs, it is more likely that it will have a better relationship with the environment and that it will defeat its enemies.
One of the 110 million nodozor families who were born in May was born in the first place, and is currently held at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
Researchers have now completed their work, and they have given Mark Mitchell the name Mark Mitchell in Boreaopelt, one of the more busy music technology that takes more than 7,000 hours to get him out.
Dr. Mitchell and the international scientific team have been able to provide a wide range of evidence on the form, size, and body.
The animals have discovered a way of defending a wide range of animals, and they have discovered that the upper part of your creation is more fragile than the lower part of it.
Despite the spread of anti-semitism, it's amazing because it's very popular for animals that have to be squatting around the size of Boreopelta today.
This means that the dinosaur has seen enough pressure from eating dinosaurs, and that my husband tends to face it as a way of life.
But the most attractive animals that use the anti-semitism (e.g. clothes, zebrals, or armadillos) are much smaller and more obvious to be a horse, which means that it was faced with a serious difficulty to survive.
Brown said, "Devasa shows how dangerous dinosaurs can be in Kretase, a powerful trapping animal.
It also revealed that the chemical analysis of the dynoser's organic compounds in the currency is a red coffee.
To find out what people are eating at the end of the meal, they continue to feed their animals for the comforts of life.
They believe that when Dinozor died, he fell into a lake and was driven to the sea, there he joined the super-heavy ocean surface.
At that time, Alberta was so hot that South Florida was so hot that it probably had more water and oceans than it is now.
Brown said, "Nodozor, completely covered and protected, at the same time, really appreciates that the animal's original form has been protected in a three-dimensional way."
'So, as the animal looks in Crete early today, it looks just the same today.
You don't need any more imagination to rebuild it. If you're a little short of your eyes, you can believe that he's almost asleep.'
The Kretas, the two-footed giant dinosaurs, were on their way to York.
Whatever the king of all, Tyranosaurus rex lived millions of years after the fierce dinosaur that might have been stolen by a team's wonderful fathers.
Among these are 38 ft (11.5 m) length and 6 tons of a monster.
The latest findings believe that scientists who took place in the Current Biology report believe that Borealopetta was driven to the sea after her death and was placed in the grave.
We were created on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk when Suncor Millionium Madeni was discovered near Fort McMurray in North Alberta Canada.
According to the museum, it's the best-deserved steel dinosaur that has ever been found inside and outside the museum.
The natural average is 18 ft (five meters) around and up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg) in weight.
The two lines out of your ears are 20 inches long.
Researchers believe that there is now a high level of traffic in the western part of Canada as far as the sea is concerned.
But the dinosaur's tomb was uniquely detailed.
This particular type of fossilized residue has been so well protected that the core parts still cover the dust particles of the dinosaur’s head.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, it's not until he wins the piano.
No matter how much I look at him, it's so incredible.
Fossylated iron pieces still cover the tiny iron plates that point to the head of the dinosaur at the point.
The right leg is stretched by itself, and the five fingers are stretched straight up.
I can read the money on the foot."
Don't come from your mouth when I'm white.
The soul of every human is the soul of a white teeth and an aesthetic smile.
When people apply to whitewashing their teeth, he warns that oral laser applications should be kept away from products sold on the market or on the Internet.
"The whitening of teeth, the chemical substances applied by dentists, or the porcelain surface of the teeth, can be supplied to the skin, which is no longer the color of the teeth," says Nukhet Berk.
Berk, who reported that many diseases prevented the protection of the tooth health from developing, shared the following information:
The teeth of young people are generally white unless they have a defect or genetic factors in their teeth.
Because of age, the formation of teeth and the frequent use of cigarettes, amphibians, or hair dyes, teeth are more colorful in years.
The whitening of the teeth, with chemical substances applied by dentists or with no deformity on the face of the teeth, can be provided with an inch of porcelain surfaces, which are applied to minimum or never removed from the face of the teeth.
The teeth should never be whitewashed with products sold on the market or on the Internet.
Because these substances are colored in a way that won't change my face again.
Since 2011, the University has provided elderly, disabled and sleeping parents with "Home Dish and Oral Health Service".
The 65-year-old Royal Gunger, who was sentenced to 24 years' bed in the wake of his death, said, "It's been news of this service of my wife's passing away."
We've been looking for her. They'll be here in a minute.
He said, "I don't deny my dental care if it's not for this service."
"My mother lives in bed for 7.5 years because of her age."
When I came to the hotel, I saw the parts of this service, and I called immediately.
We've been getting this service regularly for four years.
I have a problem with my teeth, and when the doctors come, they're looking at me.
He used the words "very nice."
There is no need for health insurance for a service that is completely free of charge.
What's going on in the Turkish army?
My dear students, especially at the U.S. High Army meeting last day, made very interesting decisions in the form of the Marine Forces.
It was brought to the command of the Force, not a paramilitary, but a security guard.
It's an application that's never seen in our system.
So how did that happen?
Force Commander Oramiral Bünt Boston has completed his term, and he's already going to be pregnant...
And it happened.
Now, the command order has come to the Vessel Society, the only one in the area.
In the past, Veise Pasha, who had been the winner and who had been arrested for a while, had to be ordered by the normal order.
But the government didn't want him.
I'm trying to tell you a very special story. If we start at the most, 1, 3, 4 and 5 commanders were not trained.
In this case, there was only one room in the Marine Forces.
He was supposed to be brought in the empty mask: the two-digit Doanma Commander of the Military Visual Society.
Then what happened?
Colonel Adnan Özbal, who was found during the sixth century, was arrested by the government.
Now look at this table!
Oramiral Veysel is standing there, but he's wearing a lower-ranking command!
It's an ordinary, your boss's orders.
What's going to happen next?
A paramiliar who is superior to rubella can't do the order of an unhindered horogenere.
He can't order, he can't.
In this case, the Veysel Kösse will not be able to handle this attack, if he is not loved by the embezzlement, he will be used today or tomorrow.
And this is a message that has already been conveyed to him by the government: “Taste the agony of the Passover.”
The information I wrote this morning was published in hours after yesterday, but the situation hasn't been explained yet.
Now let's see what's going on!
The government has been opposed to this or that because it did not want to, it has forced its use and forced its command to replace a security officer in the 6th century and has breached the sense of our weapon's traditional "Question".
There's some politics in the business, but we don't know what's behind it.
Maybe we'll always get to know each other soon!
My favorite lessons, I've tried to tell you very briefly above, especially that it's important for the Turkish army.
It's not just a row.
For example, it's more important than the end of the 10th class, the 10th class, the 11th class.
It's more important than the first time in general, the second time in general.
We lived in Istanbul.
Commander Garp Head is after...
He's got two hours.
Okay, two.
We arrived in 1922, and our troops will carry out a great campaign and defeat the Greek army.
There are valuable names to be expected for the command of the army at this stage.
One of Rephet (Bele) Pasha.
He's being offered military command, but he says, "I can't go to his command."
Another name is Jacob Shavki Pasha.
It's at Atatürk's Harp Academy...
He loved, valued, chosen "Hodam" a valuable and noble command that took place in various wars.
In 1919, he was arrested by the military and civil lights of Turkey and sailed from England to the island of Malta.
And when he turns to the earth, he says, "I will not ask for the command of the army, and he says the same thing: 'The command of the west is not mine, I will not order it'."
But Father thanks him very much and accepts the command of one of our two troops.
The third is a very colorful name...
Al-Yhsan (Sabis) Pasha.
A very speaking, regular soldier.
Iraq, Kafkas, Iran, and various commanders.
He's being chased by the English people to Malta, escapes from there and comes to Ankara on the North.
When he was offered military command, Ali Ihsan Pasha says, "I will not fight in the order of Izmet, who is independent of me."
But it's assured...
But let's see, after the mission has begun, the Commander Garp Chief of Command, who is in charge of the mission, is constantly engaged in discussions with Ismet Pasha, the incident is taking place, and the army is underway...
And it's just a short time before the big deal, and it's taken over and it's loved to be jealous, and instead, it's Nurettin's Passover.
After all, Ali Ihsan never repairs the bridge with Fathertürk.
The issue of neutrality in the Turkish army is not only in the war but also in the conflict.
Of course she has to go.
The last example of this is the Visual Society.
How did an activist find out the answer to the question "Whose Sides?"?
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell died.
A day after he came to New York City, he sat on the bed of Airbnb, who was rented by St. Louis, and started visiting Facebook on his phone.
It's time for someone from high school to share.
"Police killed a child at the age of 18, and he's still sleeping in the street."
She was surprised to discover that no one else shared this information in her speech, closed her Facebook and opened her Twitter.
@TheePharoah was repeatedly tweeted as a user called takama.
The rapist from St. Louis' district, Michael Brown's death was a live tweet, killed by an unarmed black and white cop in Ferguson Missouri at the age of 18.
There he shared a picture of Brown's dead body in the street for four hours.
Ferrell thought to himself, "This wild."
But death wasn't new to him or his community.
He left his phone to return to tweets about people's gathering in Canfield Drive the same night.
There were photos of a man who said he was the father of the police, the people who shouted, and the Browns, who said, "The Ferguson police killed my unarmed son a little ago!"
A group of protestors from a police community watched a live crowd with a dog standing in front of them.
In another video, another cop said, he built his gun and cried out, "I'm gonna kill all of you... animals."
Ferrrell remembered saying, "This isn't crazy."
'This is not a kind of murder we're dealing with.
That's when I felt real.
I was angry and crying."
One turn left the ticket, and the next day he went home.
He took his six-year-old daughter from his father's house and decided to go with him the next morning to Ferguson.
Ferrell and Ferguson will come to the movies on August 11th, a new document called "The Streets Who?".
It's a story of the lives of the protest and the love and loss of the people who live and live in that community and who are filled with the benefits of their journeys.
Ferrell, wearing a flower dress and wearing a suitable piece of sand, drove his car back to Ferguson that morning to talk about "the experiences of the criminals and the situation of the blacks."
He said, “Do you remember what I taught you that black people should fight for their faith?”
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed a child at the age of 18, and that's not true.
I couldn't take it." Ferrell said later.
"Today those who are here... are the end of the past.
You must know, see, and grow up in it.
Only in the area of activism and organisation should we not develop better at the same time, knowing the parts of the black experience and the state of the blackness and freedom, what we should do in order to free ourselves.
If I'm lucky for him to live as long as I can't experience it personally, there's no difference between any black woman and child.
I feel like I'm going to do something bad to him to protect him from these."
When they came to Ferguson, they were in South Florence, where they were waiting to talk about the matter that was before the police station and that Mr. Darren Wilson was no longer convicted, and they were on the South Florencen road to a new camp for activists.
There Ferrell and her daughter were contacted by local workers who were preparing a packaged meal.
The counters were ready and helped to get them to the protest hall.
It was slowly forming a new type of activity for Ferrrell.
While studying at the University of Missouri, the Minority Students of the University said, "My university turned completely after August 9th."
"I had no experience in caring for you.
He came from himself."
Weeks later Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's directors in the evening show.
The Folaan said that Lucas Alvarado-Farar, himself and his own visual manager, wanted to know the end.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document it, or are you trying to find a story that you can use?"
This doubt was generally expressed by a man in a state of total whiteness; to come and escape his pain and anguish...
As Folayan explained in a report near her, "We have heard that the voices of the people born in Ferguson are not affected, and we have decided to do differently."
He has already made contact with Damon Davis, the director of the region, who is known for acting in connection with the death penalty.
He's got Ferrell involved in the project, and the other six districts have been watching this in the next few years after Brown was shot.
David said, "This is a record that no one can speak for us, nor can anyone speak to us; we are the ones who speak."
"This was the basic thing for me, how these people will be represented, because this is how I will be represented."
He said, "Even if it isn't about Ferrell's experiences, he proved that the film participants were the most open, so he spoke.
As a result, "Whose Sides"? It points to the personal ways of Ferrell's life, like being loved and married to his wife.
Ferrell, laughing at his first encounter, said, "I felt like a rock."
"I realized that there could be a lot of sadness when doing this work and raising black people."
Ferrell's story also enhances the role of black sex women in the Black Lives Matter movement and re-enter the market.
In 2012, after the murder of BlackLivesMutter, young Trayvon Martin was killed in #BlackLivesMutter, two of his three social media gangs are identified as homosexuals.
"The black women in the leadership generally took the initiative," Ferrell said, "and this is because we have been fighting for many years as long as we are.
The women of the North must bear all the weight of this."
And he said, "Indeed, black women and many black women follow it."
And then Ferrell insists, "This is when there's nothing in the sort of action that's happening" and when it's not selected by his identity.
He says, "He was the one who drove this energy."
"It's not a coincidence that he's in front of you, because you're going to lose a life in these parts as a black woman.
You can feel her energy from the screen."
At the same time, news cameras in Ferguson have already gone, but there are alarming sexual connections between the public and the police.
Ferrell's been waiting two and a half years for the car shutting down during a show.
The socio-political atmosphere in the area of my home is known as "carmasa" in one word.
Still, the song that Ferguson went out on the streets is about three years ago.
"To fight for our freedom is our duty.
Winning is our job.
We need to love each other and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our sins."
Kyrie Irving: The world's not cool!
Irving, speaking to the NBC Sports, "The World's Not a Burden."
Set up the world.
They're treating people with fear of such things.
Oh, man, don't ask too much.
Because the more information you get, the more information it gets.
That's crazy.
Is the world right?
Or is he turning around in a way that's completely out of his mind?
I think you should investigate this.
I'm telling you, they're lying to us.
They're lying to us!
Irving, "I believed that I wanted to believe for years."
I thought the world was falling apart.
Do you really think we're back in the solar system?
There's nothing they've sent back.
He's not coming back!
The information they've given us is so unsatisfying.
It's real here.
You just need to call this truth.
"Do you understand what I'm saying?"
Kyrie Irving, who claimed the world was right, is fighting 24.4 in the form of Cleveland Cavaliers and 5.9 in the middle of the season.
A similar equation: Manufacturer uses Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
In the middle of the room in New York Friedman Gallery, there are a number of hundreds of faces, all of them with white, black and brown, all of them with the same color, almost inconsistencies.
This 30-ported manufacturer, Heather Dewey-Hagborg, was created by Chelsea Manning's earpieces and cut hair.
After breaking his secret diplomatic messages on WikiLeaks site with channel, 35-year-old history analyst Manning sent his hair cut off from Fort Leavenworth Prison.
The name of the new sergeant opened in August 2th is Ménásipa.
This is an example of a three-day sentence of a trans-wife and a former adviser, Manning, who was forgiven by Barack Obama, who spent three days in prison with Dewey-Hagborg, which was combined with computer science and technology.
We're looking at DNA algorithms from Manning and using this gene data to create 30-ports, not just how DNA data can be processed (many ways and determinations that can be processed) but also how often it was used, perhaps with a little more rational.
Bradley Edward, who was born as a more aggressive woman, was sentenced to 20 crimes in 2013 under the Sixth Cassul law, computer fraud and theft.
He was taken by the prison, so he had only one photo: he was sitting on the driver's chair, sitting on the sidewalk of Manning, sitting on his own side of a flat-tear, black-white shirt.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was successful in the 2012 Dha Garip Zünsier project.
In this, the manufacturer produced a photo of what these people could look like and a photo of what they could do.
He just got an e-mail from Paper Magazine right now.
"They were reporting with Chelsea Manning while he was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait that could co-operate with this letter," explained Dewey-Hagborg, in the press presentation of the new sergeant.
It wasn't even a visit, it wasn't a photograph, so they got to Chelsea, and they asked him if he didn't hear about a DNA portrait.
The author and his prisoner were friends of many letters within two years, not waiting for change.
Even Shoili Kanungo, who was an illustration by Shoili Kanungo, brought out of the midst of a printed book, printed by Chelsea, which is a self-evidently inspired book that you can see as a future.
It was a happy experience for Obama to ask for Manning's courage after a few days after the book was actually on the market, after seven years of suffering in a prison in Kansas.
When Donald Trump found new, possible ways to find new ways to expose the cut-offs he wanted to make war against the government and the transexcendental soldiers, there is also a serious and powerful thing about this currently open order.
When all of this was asked about the strange timing, Dewey-Hagborg said, "The events are happening for a reason."
A writer who wrote on the wall of their houses, whose signature in Manning's huge sizes was placed under this (in the heart of the "i" letter in the spring), called for the end of the "sex, sex, sex and cultural "auto-distribution".
He's got his mitochondrial DNA in front of the wall: many C's, G's and A's written with the bullet.
In addition to 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the manufacturer's sociological dictionary), Dewey Hagborg wanted to tell us how amazing it is that we look like each other as at least biological creation.
"What I hope people will get out of this is not to worry about how clear and objective the issue of who we are and how intelligent our genetic data is."
"The DNA data can tell a lot of different stories, and that's 30 of these stories."
A page from a short line of novel that went through the last part of a room in a single room.
This is where Manning, the King Kong type, the United States of America, comes out of the Disciplinary East with a hug.
"They've interrupted your speech, they've won."
"Never mind his prayer."
The artist from Philadelphia said, "This came directly from a letter he wrote to me."
"Even when I'm talking about it, it's still like my balls. "
Manning hasn't seen him as a person yet, but when he sees him, he'll be greeted with masks of his own genetic elements, which are gathered in the middle of the room as a protestant.
Like everything on the surface, it was done in particular to Manning's size (5"2, Manning's size).
Dewey-Hagborg, about portraits, said, "I used to put them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a lot of them."
"I wanted him to be treated like a group of people who had been formed with Chelsea, who was like a movement behind his release."
Northwestern's educational mission and Oxford University's staff are running from the Chinese
The police said that after the death of a man in a large apartment in Chicago, a man was found suspected of starting a train at Northwestern University and Oxford University employee.
Cook's government records; on the market day, Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau claimed to be the first to be arrested for murder without prejudice to Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56).
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau (26) died after he was beaten several times.
In a warning published by the Chicago Police Department on 27 December, he said he found a body.
The members received a phone call, reached Grand Plaza Apartments, and found a lot of deep inside the victim's body.
Official sources said Cornell-Duranleau had been reported dead on the scene and the police were actively calling for two suspects to be shot by the detectives as a murder.
He's been doing research at the University of Northwest since 2007 on microbiology and immunology.
Alan K. Cubbage, the assistant of the university's liaison assistant, said that he had received an e-mail from Alan K. Cubbage, who ordered Lathem to join the university campus in the Northwest.
"This is a crime scene under investigation by the necessary authorities and the University of Northwestern cooperation in this investigation."
Warren is an outstanding asset assistant at Oxford University.
He said, "We're in touch with the United Kingdom police and we're ready to help the U.S. investigation authorities in any way that they need."
I was also told that Warren's colleagues were in shock and wanted to be in submission.
Chief of Communications from the Chicago Police Department said Anthony Guglielmi strongly encouraged the suspects to submit to the authorities.
Guglielmi said, "The police have ideas about where they are, but our efforts are undermining it."
Guglielme said he helped find the suspects of local, regional and national authorities.
Guglielmi said that the police had received a phone from the Grand Plaza building manager, who had received a secret note that something was still on display in 1008 areas.
The police identified the scene with horror.
The Guglielmi said it wasn't clear on 27th of July.
He said that Lathem and Warren were on the building and that they were directed to security cameras.
Guglielmi said, "We believe the student is connected to the victim to Latham."
A statement on the administration of the square in Grand Plaza said to the residents: "Police is still working on the time schedule and history of the victim and is investigating a number of aspects of a possible family situation."
Italy laid hands on the German ship
The Italian police explained that they had hand-helded a ship named Iuventa, which was located in the Central Akkadian in search of asylum operations, in the town of Lampedusa yesterday.
The police who shared the records of their telephone conversations with journalists, who also reported that they were members of the two members of the sample, reported that this operation was carried out during the investigation initiated by the Trapani Court in October 2016.
"They have also shown activity for the illegal movement of Libya-Italia," said the leading members of Jugend Rettet, at least three times, who have actually brought to Italy shelters from the boats of the Libyan people.
The accused Jugend Retett members are also involved in allegations that they have worked with some people from Libya Security.
In the above statement, they indicated that their predecessors would continue to save human lives and that they would appreciate the charges brought against them.
Along the lines of ships in the mission of the Italian Security and the European Union (EU) mission, nearly 9 international civil society organisations are also responsible for the search and rescue of refugees in Akdeniz.
The Italian Government has prepared 13 codes of conduct for the conformity of these institutions and has requested that they be signed.
Last minute: 5 shots of Banly, who attacked the Grand Duchessen
After an attack by the President of the City of Beleaguered City, he was arrested by the police and taken to custody by the police, and was arrested by the five officers of the former police officer Mahfuz Banly, who had been arrested by the TCDD.
According to the news report, the police and the Cevik Force team have cooperated with the Belgian team in a number of ways.
Russian Prime Minister Mutko, "We will soon complete the WADA road map"
Russian Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long to apply the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria to re-establish the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"A certain environment was completed when the road map criteria were replaced, with the cooperation of Rusada, UKAD (United Kingdom Anti-Doping) and the right to plan and test.
The WADA road map was updated in this connection." Mutko indicated on Thursday.
The president, recently published on the organization's website, appreciated the second part of the WADA Management Board's Road Map, which outlined the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA.
According to Mutko, it doesn't contain anything to worry about Russia.
"All things have been made known, and all things will come to pass.
The results will be served to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future."
What is there is a criterion on the list; Russia's anti-doping authorities, the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, who was approved by the WADA, have reported that the results of the government-supported doping investigations reported on the Russian sport by the Russian lawyer Richard McLaren.
He said to Mutko, saying, "When our anti-doping system accepts a failure, we're running the investigation too.
All the gears are in place.
But there is no government program, and we will not accept anything that is beyond our reach."
Mutko's words re-enacted the Russian Anti-Doping Commission of Independent People, Vitaly Smirnov.
The Russian press body Smirnov, speaking to RSport in early hours of the day, admitted his past problems in Russian anti-doping bodies but added: "We have many times said that the position and corrections created by the report are the opposite.
Nobody thinks he's going to accept the report without a need."
Rusada was arrested by the WADA for conducting doping controls inside Russia in the morning of November 2005 on doping scandal.
What is more, international experts and United Kingdom Anti-Doping (UKAD) have been authorized to design and coordinate this beautiful test.
Following a visit to the general centre of Moscow, UDA Director Olivier Niggli Rusada stated that he "had made the right move" to resume the work.
100 million people were watching!
In a short time, the video "Come to Join" reported the transfer of Negredo has reached 100 million people from 18 countries.
The video released by Quaresma, Pepe and Negredo dialogues was also shared on the Internet sites of important newspapers, such as Marca, L'Equipe, La Gazzetta dello Sport.
Error while retrieving parenthesis
Galatasaray, former President Faruk Süren, gave Dursun Özbek a hard language to convince Bukresh and Ndiaye, President for the transfer of Mircea Lucescu to Ankara.
Here's the special explanations the other guy made for Sabah's studies:
Lucescu-Ozbek's meeting, "We're done when we leave."
The Galatarians don't go empty, and their hands don't return empty.
Naïve Transfer: Galatasare is not going to the football club.
The footballer's coming to the president's feet.
Of course they know, if they want to open their hands...
But whoever's a player, the boss won't go to his feet.
You're giving Osmanlyspor $300 billion to the player who took $9 million...
It's not 7.5 million. It's going to be 9 million with bonuses!
You've already made a big investment, of course you're gonna play and 7.5 is 9...
Uzbek's creations: I don't want to be confused.
It's your job.
G.Saray's values are in orbit.
It's not just football, I'm all wrong.
And whoever alters it, it is the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the earth.
But as far as I can see, the members are happy!
Start-ups that will help your company not be later
Amy Errett wanted to measure the happiness of his work at the start-up, but the polls weren't working.
The answers were generally unknown, without help or worse.
Some of the employees were not sure for a long time if they were to prove anonymity.
Errett, who manages Madison Reed, a 75-person e-commerce company on hair care in San Francisco, says, "There has never been any restraint or flexibility."
And he called out for help.
A new kind of human resources are coming in to help companies understand how they feel about their start-up.
These are a programme designed to measure the activities of specific purpose workers and allow companies to make secret optional surveys, target specific groups and demographic groups, award anonymous and complaint aid to workers, and in some cases allow them to be given to workers who have a sense of failure in the establishment of direct management.
The company's founder, Jim Barnett, who measured the work of software analysis tools by companies, told Redwood City start-up, "There are now tools that monitor your health like Strava and Fitbit, but where is your company Fitbit?"
Errett, using Glint, says what his employees think and feel after three years.
The specific teams are represented by a map of a map showing which parts of the company are most concerned and which management is responsible for low-interest; thus, it can be explained why.
To be the next Uber, companies begin to understand that their workers should have knowledge of their culture; Uber, in a scandal where those who clearly describe the environment of punishment are described in a blog published by an old employee.
It's a very complicated job opportunity for start-ups like Glint.
The financial technology content website Let's Talk Payments estimates that the global management, management and adaptability industry can be valued at $118.7 billion by 2020.
The interest and activity of the Denver Colorado Central Start-up Converter, which helps to detect the bad behavior of companies, has increased between Uber's uninterrupted conflicts this year.
Convercent has 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber's recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to carry out personalized "air" checks, collect real-time hidden results, and draw out the bold maps of the problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous message that workers can detect wrong behavior.
If the president is charged, the complaints are going directly to the administration.
Coverent's founder and vice president Patrick Quinlan said, "The people's court has taken over the editors."
Quinlan said: If a company, if it does wrong or does not behave ethically to its employees, it may be opposed to the consequences of the continuum, workaholics or cases, even if the editors do not enter the circle.
The restaurant owner, Ruby Tuesday, who worked more than 25,000 in 500 locations, uses more than a year to inform the Convercent workers of their priorities and procedures and to facilitate access to the company centre.
When he wanted to report a problem he had to find a phone number or e-mail at the company's office, he was in an official complaint, hoping he would be taken seriously.
Ruby Tuesday's chief lawyer James Vitrano said that most of these were frightening and frustrating experiences, and that it was not a good way to follow the complaints that worked.
But now the company's use of Convercent can identify and solve problems that were previously hidden from managers (such as separation, tax or unfair financial application) in the city or country's districts.
Vitrano, managing the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday, said, "I can get closer to this whole experiment with 360 degrees of vision."
"We also protect our consciences against business".
In 2002 the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, after the collapse of the ethical values from Enron's scandal, took on more serious business, value, and employee-related issues in 2002, said Quinlan.
But after "social media came to themselves" the companies realized that they could not prevent the entry camps from being official.
He said, "Before technology was used to test reality, people used it as a strategy of hope."
Both Glint and the Convercent software are presented as a service and are being reimbursed for the use of their products.
This is a model and opportunity for investors to accept both start-up risks.
Convercent; Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital companies received $10 million on Saturday, and the total amount was $47 million.
Glint provided $10 million in the list of Bessemer Venture Partners and paid the total funding to $60 million.
These investments are not surprising when considering the nature, culture and risk factors of companies that are related to each other.
The research in the field of art shows that workers today expect more than they used to.
High wages and interesting projects are just minimum requirements in the recapitalised markets, such as Silicon Vadiz.
Workers want to feel accepted, valued, and given their time to a positive mission company.
Nina McQueen, co-chair of the global benefits and experience of LinkedIn, who used the Convercent and de Glint, said: "When people are happy to be in a company, when they feel that their voices are heard and what they do, they drink more than they do to be successful."
Investigators, when their portfolio companies do good work, earn a fortune; if companies, employees, and they feel good, they do good work.
If the third party analyzes the content and sense of the employees, it is not surprising that they find support.
It is important for cultural experts to have data on the working relationship.
But the data won't work if you don't move your company's responsibilities.
In fact, a company can make a wait for my change to come if I want it back from its employees.
And if the waiter doesn't come fast enough or never comes, he can cause a sense of disappointment and feel like a bunch of workers.
Russell Raath, who saw that the transaction management company had a speech manager at Kotter International and had made a lot of mistrust in the company's data collection, said, "If you want 4,000 forwards, you must be ready to speak 4,000."
"Because if you don't follow, those who work will think, 'Do you really hear me?
You all right?
And why should I care if you don't care?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who made monthly surveys, was able to move on the same day when a problem was reported in Glint.
And after I got back from the speedy workers of the decision-making mechanism and the communication quality, they reorganised various teams in the company and added communication training to solve their problems.
On Ruby Tuesday, the company receives new information about its employees, and it hopes that in the long run, it will be able to keep more workers in this type of engineering.
Vitrona said, "If you don't want to create a safe culture, you'll lose people."
And if you lose people, you will lose their clients.
And when you have lost the clients, you will lose the company."
It's a long day for the NCAA to remove two coaches every day.
It's 11 o'clock at night, and they're on their way to talk to a new coach station inside a team of UCLA football players.
Some of the forms are wrapped up in the tops of the school's first day of work.
These empty minutes for an important part of the team make the mid-day balance.
After three hours of training, the registered players will return to their places and work on their final exams before they return to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6.30 a.m.
Bruins said just before his return to the market, Jim Mora said, "It's a pity for these people the next three days."
The removal of two coaches on NCAA's day, which was designed to remove the burden on players, actually extended their days to at least five days until the end of the weekend.
That's why UCLA's first three training courses are scheduled to begin at 7:15 in the evening so that players can be in line with the complex program.
A coach is more likely to avoid two training days a day; Bruins is getting closer one week at the beginning of the camp, and he is practicing for the first time in Mora's sixth grade in Westwood during the writing school.
In the month of the year, they plan to train 18 coaches to 20 August before starting their official game preparations for the openings against Texas A&M.
Mora said that although new words were added to the hard work programme of the players, NCAA was supporting legal changes.
Mora said: "We shall certainly bear a heavy burden on them for three or four days, and that will be very hard."
"And they've been through this for a while; they're working, wonderful children.
I think we'll have more time when we get to his apartment, and it'll be really weird."
UCLA will stop training at the end of the camp; it's not easy to think that Luski Center's hotel is extended to the front of the train station and the end of the football pool, and that it's not easy to find out that the hotel is extended by Luskin Center.
The Bruins player's room is planning a slow start this week, but Mora admits that during the season these rooms can be a problem with emptying them.
Mora said, "We'll have sovereignty."
"It's not a lot of flying to think that someone's gonna rent a room and sit there and take a training video.
If there's a video training record, that's a good thing.
But we'll be safe there and we'll be safe up in 8 parking lot.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan."
increasing the power of history to combat Facebook fake news
Facebook's third party told story-makers that they would send more and more fake articles and show their findings under the original share; the world's largest translator social network is trying to fight fake news on Friday.
In a statement made on the company website, he said that he would use updated machine learning to identify possible frauds and send them to the story-makers and that he would show the results of this potentially historical verification under the original article.
Facebook is supposed to be one of the main points of the news that many people think the 2016 U.S. presidential election has affected the US.
In May, before the presidential election of the French electorate, the issue of the failure to eradicate the entire social media network of Germany's previous elections, and the issue of criminalizing the plan of cut-offs, also became a major policy for Europe.
On Friday, Facebook said in a separate statement made by Germany that a test of the authenticity of the new story was being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
In a blog, Facebook news source Sara Su said: "To see what stories the third party has told the story, people want more resources to decide on the basis of information."
Facebook added that it will continue to test the "relevant article" feature and that it will work on other changes in the news to reduce fake news.
Creating a line of novels: The story of a Kale in England
In the near past, little Scotney Kales took place in a Skeeze music club and became a hospital for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But right now, a line inspired by Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire-based, historical documentist, who had been inspired by Jamie Rhodes, who had witnessed a 700-year-old history of comfort in the Bewl Nehri Valley in Kent.
"I find it very nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years."
"How personal is it to keep this letter in my hand?"
One Kale, who lives as far as the Middle East from Edward's turn, points out families living in Scotland to be represented by a different artist (Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg).
This is not the first book to support Rhodes' archives: he also wrote the Dead People's Days and Other Stories in 2014, a project that was inspired by stories in the British Library.
"My eyes were filled with fingerprints on a letter written in the 1700s by a dual agent working for the King James's side."
"This is his fingertip!
And the letters are always dreaming because then you got a fire for the light.
For someone who's been here for 300 years, this smell feels like he's a bear.
Ah, I love the archives!"
It seems a lot better to support the National Trust and the England Branch and spend almost four months on a calendar ( "If I have to be honest, I've got a little bit too hot.")
He spent hundreds of valuables and ancient treasures on the walls of his property, researching and discovering the "new" valley in Victoria's days, researching the ruins, and working on the walls of his estate.
He talked to the curators, the speakers, and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustrations of the book, and then he walked through the fields and the remains of the old street.
And then at night, he was "drinking and writing."
National Trust is completely accessible, but it is not known in Scotland's detailed history that last heir Elizabeth Hussey died in 2006.
When Rhodes came ten years later, he was just starting to pick up the archive, and he described it as, "For centuries, aristocrats said, "Oh, throw it in the middle of the ocean."
Every day, they wrote letters from the English Empire and maps that defined the limits of who they had: "You think the people's differences will be difficult."
Let's go, guys!"
Some stories in the collection of The Laborer, who left the newly built village to join the village Isaiah in 1381, are used as a starting point to make a wider contribution to the English history of the village.
"Kent and Sussex have a record of his resurrection in 1380 in this book called the Sussex Family of the Swedes."
"The great Jesus started in this circle, and I thought it might be a good start point.
Maybe they're connected?"
Other stories are often related to the history of the street, such as the story of the Darrell family who saved a seven-year period of civilization during English Islam.
Or The Smuggler, 18th-century fugitive, who was thought to have filled his grave with rocks and reminisced his own grave, took the place of The Smuggler, who was taken from the village years later.
Darrell's most prominent Scottish family, "These guys seemed very orderly, they always paid for what they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrell men have resolved their debt crises to marry wealthy women, and I imagine them as a group of people who have the right to inherit.'
The next job is Rhodes, when he's looking for other text experiments.
In the late 20th century, I had a senator's office, and since then I've completed a two-week job for a series of novels about Elementméki, which was re-examined by nature.
But Scotney's got a different place in his mind.
"I'm sorry I left."
'Oh, now I have to face the real life that's going to be cursed.'
Meral Akshener's "Maho" reaction
The Millennium Movement Party has made a written statement on the social media and the use of the MHP in recent times by the Secretary-General.
The great social media and "some old dustists from the streets of MHP" used the expression "he's gone" to MHP, "he's been used to stop the MHP's existence after 12 months."
Grandmother said:
It's not as bad as the Turkish people's history doesn't matter, it's a criminal file, it's a mistake to move his hand if there's a misunderstanding."
"And now they have "the MHP Kocaeli Regional Development Board and 410 members and 215 members of MHP Bursa's New Year's Eve."
250 users, like 300 users, are being misdirected by the crowd with unfavourable messages.
In their newspaper columns, lies and deceptions are deeply rooted.
It's like there's no use in our hands, it's like there's no word to say that the number of mutatis mutandis in the past is not going to pass through the fingers of a hand.
The Great Catacomb, who was found in the term "word" about the U.S. government, said that it was attempting to mishandle the people and control their origins.
The mayor said, "The propaganda and campaigns are going to be different from the propaganda that comes back in the MHP field."
The MHP Secretary-General, who wanted to be an important and irrevocable actor of the Turkish politics of MHP, said about the applications:
The old Marchists are not able to destroy the place that the people of the Turkish people of the MHP have done.
All the resources that are made are in the back of the applied initial management methods.
Because politics and the media have focused their eyes on the MHP base.
There is no good work for our party when it comes to us, and there is no meaning in our refusal to use them now.
What's wrong with those who don't use their ideas from our party?
In their lives, people who don't touch MHP, who don't share our mothers, who don't understand our countries, who don't share our fight, who't get involved, who's always got a sense of living, who's got to find another job for them.
It is a great effort for the members of the Millennium Movement and those who do not touch the whole.
And he'll shoot his owner.
The Millennium Movement is the final race of the Turkish people, despite the difficult conditions.
In his explanation, the Great, "Millionsary Movement" is not available for people who have made MHP's target.
He said, "The roots of the ocean will not reach their goal, no matter what the foreign exchanges in the ocean are."
The MHP's Grandfather, who used to say "They're going to go crazy and die in the heat," said, inter alia, in explaining that the participants and the terrorist forces are going to be able to do anything from the CHP to the HDP; from there to the Persians, from the PKK to the PK, they will not be able to operate the right of the Turkish people to own their own destiny."
Today, Turkey's MHP, MHP-free, we've risen to new tactics and games for those who plan for Turkey; MHP-free government, MHP-free Meclis, we've been fighting for the rest of the time.
Now we're gonna break the games, we're gonna break the players.
He used the expression "MHP's patent is in MHP," saying to Meral Akshener: "As a former adult, Banker Bilo, says I'm going to take the Maho villagers to Germany, and then leave them in a mountain hut in the morning, so that the users of what they left behind will take you away and say, "I'm going to leave you on the side of my plane."
That's their problem, but they're the only ones we want to go to.
Kjaer signed up to Seville
He signed a formal contract with Kjaer, who transferred 12.5 million euros to Sevilla from the Lacivertian team, and who was the most successful defence transfer of the Spanish team.
The Danish star, she's going to wear a four-form in Seville.
Great ease with baby families from THY
According to the explanation made by the Thy Press University, the pilot’s flight group and the pleasure of the passengers continue to develop new ideas for a perfect journey experience that will make them feel more comfortable and more comfortable with the flight.
This is confirmed by the fact that children between 0 and 2 years of age and their families are being trained as "baby travel kite", which was prepared to travel between flights from August to August.
In the kitchen, prepared with a special-designed bag; a sub-module, the single-use mother's front, the chicken cream, the baby's losio, and the shampoo, the newly-rewolved sludge, and the snowflake.
Paraben, alcohol, and colourless chemicals were produced in the presence of the specific properties of the baby cell.
Washington, Changing Green Card Rules
According to media transfer, President Donald Trump said that there would be a new U.S. transfer plan that would change the Green Card rules.
Legal migrants are planning to drop to 50,000 rates per year, impose more rules for temporary work permits and family administration visas.
The new rules were offered by the Republicans and supported by the president.
The law of the Supreme Court will be discussed on both sides of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise money and make billions of dollars for tax advantages, and it will change the way Green Card is given to other U.S. citizens.
The law will reduce the movement of ashes and replace the existing regime.
This new application will lead to English-speaking situations, financial resources and the ability to benefit our economy.", said Trump.
Writers captured the Phenerbahce-Sturm Graz game
In two seasons I haven't found, I can't see, she's moved back to the corner and to the sight.
A "mangal heart" team, which was released in the absence of the Special Kocaman, was on trial to make a "stand with us" deal.
We can add to the game, positions or performances, but I haven't seen a game that worked and called for a long time.
The first game he identified, but today's apolls are on his own team; the commander at the scene of Fenerbach is now Valbuena.
When she was transferred, she had a problem of age, but Kocaman's words contained a "extraordinary character."
30 years ago, we gave the woman's name to Ríra Chalmumba.
If you win, the French player will be the hottest.
He was everywhere, and he joined all the passive organizations, took responsibility, and threw a bullet into the air.
Alper's pre-play, his second-ranking position, left Sturm Graz's team "fixed" in a long-term show.
He called for a regular formula to break a hard wall when he shut down the fenerbache round corner without throwing it off.
They're ruling a group, but they don't create an active passport in a kind of rap and punishment field.
This view can lead to the "needed" movement, but we're faced with a game that's not the only one that's in hand for the centrfors.
Either the team didn't trust the young player or it had to make some progress.
They couldn't get two net chances after the score 1-1.
The transitions were important, but the fight against players made it even better to take this side to the "gol" on the other side.
There'll probably be 1-2 more transfers until the market.
But the truth is, the biggest need for Fenerbach is the 12th...
We're in the middle of a very bright and beautiful season, this kind of game that's going to take the heart of the tribes trying to play ahead.
It's about Kocaman's machine building its core, and it needs a little more time.
They're in good condition as physical quality.
The quality of the game will also grow.
And you see that all footballers on the street are so clean.
For a new page, they've got a lot of needs for tonight's nights.
The height of sex robots is real and we need to be worried
In fact, a new report on the technological developments in the sex robotic sector is being issued in 2017 when you think you can't stop by any more than 2017.
Yeah.
Sex robots are a big thing now.
In the past five or ten years, a report has been published on the progress of sex robots.
We need to take them seriously, according to Nobel Sharkey, a professor of robot science and engineering at Sheffield University and the founder of the FRR.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eye, the shape of the air and the type of the tube.
Mr. Sharkey spoke about the release of the new report: "People laugh a little bit, but companies really love and we'll see more."
Modern sex babies were born into robots, especially human behaviors, which were made by artificial instincts.
Users can also choose from the color of the robot's eye, the meme-form, the type of hair, or the color of everything, and personalize their robots to match their own blood.
But the fact that many robots have "persons" to show a Stepford girl is even more disturbing.
Modern sex babies were born into robots with silicone.
For example, RealBotix robots allow users to personalize their own robots according to their character characteristics (e.g. their characteristics).
Then there are Roxxxy Gold sex robots with "Friit Farrah" and "Maternal" personality, developed by True Company.
True Company's website adds: "Roxxy Gold has as many as possible a personality as possible."
So whatever you love him, whatever you don't love him, doesn't love him.
There's also a spirit in the same day as real people.
It can be sleepy, it can be wanting to talk, or it can be in "smooth."
There are many disturbing aspects of the rise of sex robots: not only do you take the place of real human relations, but the qualities of a woman who obeys more than anything, the most competitive calls near Friit Farah.
On the Web site, True Company compares Roxxxy to a vibrator, but what for men.
"If she can be a vibrator (that's how it goes), why don't men be Roxxy?" the website.
What's wrong with these sex robots aren't just a party or sex players.
Their presence and their greater complexity indicate more darkness and deepness in our culture, and do not go back to the sexual desire by means of an optional addendum from the idea of gender equality.
Many men of nature will not find their sex robots, and the FRR will take place in the outer borders of their culture.
But flight crews can be a high-level teacher about the pace of our life.
And many people don't even have the right to be so weird or attack them if they're free money.
It's not unusual for a woman in White Saray to go out in the middle of a period when women's rights are threatened by sexual assault on women.
The Handmaid's Tale TV series is the most impressive side of the screen, not the images, the scientific bodies, or the visuals that show all the details, but how real it feels.
The Gilead community is a change, but it doesn't feel like it's a big change right now.
To create more physical similarity for real women (of course, in the presence of porn stars) to the extent that the purpose of these sex robots is technologically possible.
The Creator wants them to feel human beings in their touch and to imitate their movements of a real body.
But when the job comes to their "people", robots don't really represent women.
They can't leave their wives or leave them.
There's no activity or history, there's nothing to put their independence in place, or anything to destroy the total slave fantasy.
In other words, they are the chosen slaves.
Or 2017: careers.
U.S. Army Conviction: There are dead and wounded...
In the aftermath of an attack by President Kabil on the Karabakh River in Afghanistan, foreign military forces active in the country were targeted.
It was explained that 1 NATO army and 3 civilians were also injured in the explosion of lives, and 5 of the wounded were displaced by US soldiers and 1 was a translator working with NATO forces.
The official statement of NATO support forces (Resolute Support) in Afghanistan indicated that NATO forces had infected the construction bomber during a joint venture with the Afghan National Army.
It was explained that the wounded personnel were taken under treatment at the U.S. Army Hospital in Bagram.
There's no danger in the lives of the victims.
On the ground, the bomber's name indicates that the Taliban is a human being.
The big storm of the storm?
Show Mitt Romney as a right symbol
The fact that the political division of the U.S. electorate, which saved the U.S. electoral division, divided the family into micro-sized families became the reality of the Trump era.
About Christmas and Thanksgiving, the U.S. newspapers were full of how to cope with the crowd of neighbors who called on Trump.
We're all trying to expose our own filtering balloons.
If he's less talkin' about, it's the power to bring Trump's families together.
I appreciate this because my cousin, who lives in Chicago, and who lives in our family, is visiting us this week in New York.
He reminded me that association with an enemy would have a powerful effect.
Everyone who has known the community's brother for ten years who argued with him about politics in the White Sea is taking the same side, suddenly and strangely.
It's good at dinner table, of course, but it's so good for me that it puts these important risks in a broad context.
Sol was inspired by Trump, but the gravity of the president's creation created a right-wing power for all.
When we're talking about "normality" and Trump, one day we're talking about the fear that his strange behavior might no longer shock.
There's even a longer long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes the right communities against its own standards" and it looks like they're the symbol you're thinking of.
When Mitt Romney's madness comes to life, I find myself a nostalgic about the version of his life: the dog on the side of the car comes up 14 percent (but at least we knew what his tax was like) that both of them are really innocent.
When the storm hits, the next Community tax has to be on its mind just to be assessed as far as it is not measured.
We took our children to Central Park while we were on my way, and you need the biggest and best papers you can spend in the city when you work by the New York Parks Department.
The horses are huge, centrally cylindrical designs (all of them made strange images to the birds and animals to see with fear behind their own eyes) and are a playful music entertainer.
In other words, many of the city's clichés can be disappointing: high buildings are starting to come up frequently, the finish line is beginning to become known as not creating too much excitement, and the city's reality cannot be achieved.
It's been thirty-five years and I haven't come to the top of the day I've discovered that Swiss Cottage is a huge fight in Northern London.
What's more, when you're riding in Central Park, I'm still a strangely magical experiment, so two men at two years of age, one man at 11, and two women at 40 can go here and they can all spend very good time.
If I could give you a note to the hunter, I'd give him a full note, but no one's asked a lot of thanks.
On the other hand, I was asked to evaluate my "test" between 1 and 5 years this week before I passed my credit card.
The same thing in the coffee shop on my side of the street, and a note prefers to be compared to a 15-year-old relationship; for what was bought quickly...
Its effect is not just slowing down the need to be a free trade, but the pressure to win over an unneeded event on the server at the same time.
When a poor woman in Bonmarsh broke up into a marriage as an apology, I, in the middle of the pregnancy, gave her five years of trying to give me a credit card.
The speed is 41 degrees, and they've gone through the Mayos.
The people in Tunceli, where one of the hottest days of my life was living, had flown into the Munzur beaches.
In the morning, he tried to protect the young, the children, the old, the women and the men, from the hot springs that flowed on the beaches along the Munzur Square.
In particular, in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, France and England, the Tunisian peoples, such as Ege or Akdenis, have lost their beaches along the coast of Munzur Chay'.
Suna Tosun, who took the place among the pilgrims at the Munzur Beach, said, "I didn't want to celebrate the holiday in the west, but it was better to stay in our own villages in Munzur."
"There's no water in the world like Munzur's ice, and in these hot temperatures the Munzur surrounds us."
If the Hasan Major came from Germany, he said instead of Chechnya or Bodrum, they preferred the Munzur Cheat in Tunceli and therefore did not regret it.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital with his chest pain
This is the second time he left Pistorius prison to visit the hospital.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of the cancers in his cell that he said he was in.
Pistorius, who was sentenced to death by the defendants, was sentenced to death after being sentenced to death.
During the early hours of the Day 2013 lovers killed Steenkamp in Pretoria's house, shooting a toilet gate at his door.
Pistorius said he was in contact with someone who had kept his girlfriend in bed at night without an invitation.
The prosecutors explained that this time they thought that Pistorius was in the process of renouncing him for six years.
The National Movement Merci, South Africa, said he'd refuse to the Supreme Court and this year can be valued.
Pistorius, if the prosecutors succeed, he's against being sentenced for 15 years.
There's no death penalty in South Africa.
First hash profile won
The Presidency's organisation of the Diplomatic Works has succeeded in bringing prayers and prayers to South Arabia, at the Apatürk High Commissioner for Foreign Affairs, in their prayers and sights.
In front of the movement of his first capillary, relatives were joined by close relatives of about 200 members of the Eastern Hemisphere Terminal.
On the other hand, the Turkish Airways (THY) were divided into the north by the winds that flowed into the sacred fields.
And the Haqq chapter in Ankara has been won by Esanboga.
In Kabul, for the first time this year, it also took place the cities and the gas neighbours who were affected by the "unregular hac" of the "papers and cities" that were applied this year.
Two Bulgarian construction camps were held in Greece
According to the explanation of the Foreign Ministry and received by the BTV, two Bulgarian legal camps were held in Greece.
Two Bulgarians were arrested by the police on August 1st.
They were left on the same day as the investigation was ongoing.
The external work department told BTV that Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities were slowing down the controls on the pool camp and still cut down on those who were caught while they were being heard in undisclosed places for that purpose.
I'm going to run controls all over me.
Look, the judge said the court could be punished.
We're not going back to Holland until we find him.
JOEY Hoffman (22) went to Turkey to spend the first month with two friends.
By the way they drove Adana and Mersin, Joey Hoffman disappeared in Silifke on 8th of December.
His friends who came along, despite all the calls, told Hoffman about the situation to his family in the Netherlands.
And while the police were on their way to find a lost trip, his brother Robin Hoffman and his friends Angelo Durei went to Jaymy Gewald Adana.
ILANRA BASTIRIP DATA
Robin Hoffman, who was here at the police station, distributed missing messages to Adana and Mersin.
Robin Hoffman told them that they had received the last news on December 8, "We first called the police in the Netherlands."
Later, I went to Turkey with two of my friends, and we called the police here too.
We haven't found any clues that we haven't got until now.
He said, "We'll stay in Turkey until my brother gets a message."
Welcome to the Second World Trade Center
In Russia, the 2017 Pallet-Flight Young People's World Championship was the world's second world over 400 meters above sea level.
Young People and Sports Bank Osman Love, in his message, welcomed the Golden Creen, who won the gold medal with her message.
On the first day of the 2017 World Championship, the Palestinian Young People's Championship, organised in Russia, Ceren Adult became the second world water over 400 metres.
Ceren, taking his place in the great performance he showed in the park he fought with 8 finalists, lost his gold medal with only 27 cents.
When Elena Lopatina won the gold medal in Russia at 03.18.73 minutes from Russia, Ceren became the owner of the gold medal at 03.19.00.
Turkey is represented by eight men and eight women.
The last words were, "I think I'm dying, Mom."
Among those who died in London's Greenfell Tower, which has been declared 30 years ago, calling their mother at the fire, "I don't want to die, Mom, it's not fair."
"I thank you for everything you've done for me," said Italian Gloria Trevisan and his lover.
Among those who did not receive any information after his death, Gloria Trevisan, a 26-year-old Italian lover, sitting on the 23rd floor of a 24-storey building, also took a place.
A lawyer from Trevisan's family in northern Italy, Maria Cristina Sandri, said that according to the information they had from English adults, two young people who had lost their lives were sure to win.
The lawyer who asked that the families of young people live in a state of misery also asked the journalists not to hesitate to make an explanation on this matter.
I think I'm dying, mom.
The lawyer Sandra, Gloria, said that shortly after her fire came out, her mother called Emanuela Trevisan on the cell phone and that when she heard these last conversations, she was crying herself.
So Gloria Trevisan spoke to her mother two hours later, at about 1: 00 a.m. and she talked to her mother several times.
Trevisan, whose first conversation was more quiet, said, "Mom, it's bad things happen here, it's hot."
We're stuck, we're not getting out.
There's a little noise, but don't worry, we're waiting for rescue.
"We tried to open the door quickly, but there was too much noise, and the elevator wasn't working."
The last words of Gloria Trevisan's concern about the increase in the voice was changed:
Mom, my whole life is passing out before my eyes.
I think I'm dying.
There was a life I would have lived before; that's not fair.
I don't want to die and I want to help you financially.
I'm sorry I can't bother you again.
Thank you for everything you've done for me, Mom.
I'm going to paradise now, and I'm gonna help you out there.
This is the error of the Italian government
Both of them, Gloria Trevisan and my dear Marco Gottardi, both of whom graduated from the foreign school last year, were transferred to London in March when they were forced to find work in the north of the country.
Gloria Trevisan, who was able to earn only 300 euros in his country, started working a business in London in a short time of 1800 (about 2060 euros).
Lawyer Sandri, Gloria Trevisan's family had a hard time spending money, saying, "Hloria went to London to help her family."
Unfortunately, our young people have to leave the country to save their future and find work.
"The government must find an immediate solution to this."
Italy’s play which does not allow young people to work
Gloria's father, Loris Trevisan, also called out, "This is the fault of our government that forced us to flee to find work."
When the unemployment rate in Italy reached 12 percent, the gap between young people was 40 percent.
In the past few years, many young Italians have started to move to Europe to take the lead in England.
Last year alone, the number of young people who had to leave Italy was 110.
Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gottardi have also been identified as a drama for a country that has not allowed young people to work.
Redefine, softening milk products and chocolate IBH
Turn red and it can turn into a hole for your system.
But a new work implies the whole essence of the process: rich supply of raw protein and milk products can help to reduce the deaths of those who suffer from infectious diseases.
In the United States of America, 1.3 million people and 300,000 people are affected by this untreated health condition, resulting in seizures and vomiting, strokes or blood clots, loss of kilograms, and excessive fatigue.
Researchers at the University of Washington found that the main amino acid triptophane in the protein of the protease helps the development of the forgiveness cells that develop a persistent convulsions.
Chief researcher Dr. Marco Colonna said that he traveled through the caves to keep the microps stored in the food safe.
Cells that are able to stimulate transplantation are compared to cells that are encouraged to stop preventing injury by protecting painkillers from harming them.
If the water is too much for treatment, it can lead to disease.
In the trials, there was a type of type of forgiveness syndrome that caused resistance in patients carrying a specific bacteria in their stomachs.
And the bacteria need a triptophan, one of the protein structures, to encourage cells to emerge.
Professor Colonna said: 'We have linked the growth of the urea population, which is a part of the microbiology of the bacteria that is a part of the Lactobacillus reuter.'
The more triptophans in their blood, the more they have this forgiveness cell.'
If the same thing was happening in people, L. Reuter and triptofan could have developed a more stable, less flexible environment if they were to be able to survive.
Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragandas, a later researcher, found that while working on a variety of forgiveness cells that develop resistance, a group found that the test apparatus had these types of cells, but that the same group did not have it in different places.
The difference has been questioned as to the nature of bacteria, viruses and mandarins living on the mid-square can normally in other seas.
The blood vessels of Farler's cells were DNA sequenced, and six types of bacteria were found to be present in cases where there were no DNA.
Because they were exposed to a sterile environment, I was exposed to L. Reuter, who had a convulsive microbiology that was too weak to develop this type of type of apocalypse.
Researchers have expanded L. Reuter's fluid to understand how the bacterium's sorry system has been affected and then transferred to less than a fraction of the bacterium-free cells that have not been removed from the cells.
It turned into cells that stimulated the stability of the cells.
The active co-industrial, fat-induced, indole-3-activative acid, was found to be a side effect of triptofane metabolism known as indole-3-actic acid.
The number of cells increased by about 50 percent when triptofane levels in the brain were reduced by half, but the number of cells decreased by half when triptofane levels were lowered.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan said that people have the same resistance to germs and that most of us have L. Reuter L. in the mid-term channel.
It is not known that the triptofan side products from L. Reuters have not developed in humans as well as in rats, but in the case of people with chronic problems with triptophan.
He said, "It's something we'd like to encourage the development of these cells because these cells control the inner movement of the cells.
Potentially, in cases where L. Reuters is present, the high-level triptofan is due to the spread of this population."
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United has signed a "sense" with Nemanja Mattic.
After he went out to the first game on Saturday evening in front of Samdoria, Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has signed a "sense" with Nemanja Mattic.
A transfer of $40 million from Chelsea began at UEFA Super Cup in front of the UEFA Cup, which was against Real Madrid on Friday, the last season before the last transfer from the United States, and Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira, according to their estimates, was in position to attack them.
What is more, the Maviler season before the Asian season had a serious level of gambling condition that was left out in Asia, and only 45 minutes before the Mourinho Premier League season had to be improved.
Maurinho said, "He needs time, but he thinks about my experience, his wisdom, his thinking. "
"We'll help him get ready sooner."
When Mourinho began to form the first 11 for the beginning of the Mourinho season, like Matt, his new transfer friends Victor Lindelof and Romeo Lukaku and Aviva Stady came out of the game.
The Independent concluded that this week Mourinho still wanted 3 more transfers, but the club had already realized its own first four priority transfers, making it "a thing of the past."
"Thanks to the club for taking the fourth one."
"I'd be happier if they took four of them, but they've made a lot of effort for me."
197 people were sent to the hospital last year
According to the Swiss Social Refah Foundation, in 2005 the gender intolerance rate for 1 person rose to 8 percent in 2015.
Astrid Lindgren has been infected with 197 children and young people who have been sexually unhappy during the past year.
In the same hospital, a child psychopathist named Louise Frisen pointed out that he could be expected to become a more open society, saying, "It could be regarded as a general development in an open psycho-sex society that is also involved in sexual issues."
Sexual insatiableity is known to have no connection with sexual intercourse.
A drug operation in a drugstore
The Office for the Fight against Crimes and the Office of the Reserved Foreign Affairs Department organized an operation on behalf of F.T. 36, on behalf of the three-year General Assembly Hall in the country of Sokak.
At the call at the house, 33 extacy jails were held in a hospital.
The F.T., who escaped from the balcony, was caught and caught sight of him.
The F.T. has been registered to be known as the name after the security operations.
Transfer to New Malaysia
From the new team of Super Lig, the Evkur New Malatyaspor, who was wearing the Kassimasa style last season, connected Turgut Dogan Şahin to their colors.
According to an explanation made from a private club, a two-year contract was signed with a 29-year-old Canadian player in the transfer process.
In the statement, "Turgut Dogan Şahin has been awarded a two-year agreement with a Canadian player dressed in Kashimash.
It's good for our new Malatyaspor."
A micro-climate cable for entering your house and car with a British magic hand move
He became the first person in the country to be able to open the front door, access the office, and even operate his car with only one hand.
Steven Northam (33), with the head of the mine, has set his finger on the finger, and this service now represents the workplaces and people who want to simplify their lives by technology.
Winchester went to work with Dr. Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Hunts to ensure that the implant process can be applied to medical standards.
Technology, cats and dogs are like microchips and only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company will make changes in the house and in the car's locker to make it convenient.
This technology was put on both the house and the man who had a husband and a child's father and the BMW Z4, and the machine was working on hand.
The White Line Shower Blinks to the Tax Authorities
According to the military records for Time, a total of up to $24,000 had been issued by the owners of a maritime market in the south for an organization that contributed to the development of the United States of America last month.
When the president arrived, Marine One was also known as the green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, an organization that recognized American construction programs in the White Sea on 17 December.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and senior White Sarah members have traveled through the productions of 50 countries.
A helicopter built at Connecticut, a bed from Main, a gas truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
According to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the team responsible for the helicopter's operation requested the helicopter's presence only 36 hours before the helicopter's presence was transferred to a non-profit organization.
HMX-1's commander, an e-mail was sent to the Air Force Commander's Office one day before, "I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of it, because it was a very visible organization."
The message indicated that the helicopter's solar system would come for the 3rd organization in about 17 o'clock in the morning, and that it would stay between 6 and 9 o'clock in the evening.
Nott, if it was late to get out of White Saray, he added that a second flight team would need to be turned off because of the time limits.
While a security officer was in the airport, he was on the helicopter during the original flight safety organization.
It is not clear that the second flight consultant is not required in the end of the records provided to TIME.
The Hatch Law regulates the use of government property by federal employees for political purposes.
Records show that HMX-1 is questioning that the organization has not complied with this condition.
Commander, "We've been asked a question that doesn't violate the Hatch Law and we've been informed."
"It looks like you're trapped," said the Commander.
The "Made in America" organisation is officially designated by White Saray and does not enter the Hatch Law.
But official organizations are becoming political leaders.
The president of the organization, then the health services that continue at the Senate, were opposed to reform efforts and the government's reform efforts were delayed.
The use of the air transports known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new event.
The presidents must use these to travel.
But it's not likely that these will be used as a formal wish for only one picture shot.
On Saturday, Trup took note of the first campaign in Melbourne, Florida, and took note of the fact that it was full of messages about the use of Twitter account by the presidential plane.
The White Saray press assistant Lindsay Walters said: "The White Saray is excited by the production of 'Made in America' of products made by American workers from all 50 countries."
HMX-1 is often trained in the Washington area and is trained to leave the U.S. President in the summer to the White Sea.
In Germany, at the beginning of Trump Tammuz, HMX-1 performed 58 medical operations in the White Saray.
One expert said that the flight for the Made in America organization, the air traffic controller, was counted for the education needs within that month.
One helicopters that day spent 11 hours in support tasks that were not related to the beginning.
White Saray said they didn't charge any other tax agents in the organization for any other number.
A speaker from Sikorksky said that the helicopter was not involved in setting up a solar system.
HMX-1 doesn't keep the ticket records for the presidential flights, and it's hard to detect the final departure from the organization.
But according to the 2017 financial year of the Defence Force, the Defence Force's VH-3D airport will fly $24,340 per hour.
One record records the flight period of air transport from the centre of Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico Virginia in 30 minutes.
White Saray says the helicopter's real business drive is very low there.
Walters said, "It's very wrong to take a trip to the owners of the property, sometimes taking the chances of getting a job."
"It's the imaginations of the universe that captures the landscapes of the Western world within the personal, personal, visible, and year-olds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the Defence Department does not include personal routes, but it does include fuel, maintenance and contract routes.
At that time, White Saray's former press spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of helicopters for this organization.
Spicer said, "This week, I'm here to clean up what's been done in America."
"And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud of their national security contributions, and I think that hundreds of thousands, even if not thousands, are involved.
And I think that many Americans, like most Americans, are proud of all of us with their helicopters and other military teams.
And indeed, it is [a matter of] importance for him."
It's not clear that Trump didn't get in touch with helicopters when he was driving his sunglasses for his organization, but he got hit by the driver of an elevator.
In White Saray, Trup was laughing at the company products in his own philosophy with the media and the Sikorsky representatives.
The president said, "I know Sikersky very well." He said, "I have three of them."

According to B.M., the political role of Afghan democratic women
On the day of the beginning of his mission in Afghanistan, B.M. said women could represent the elections in the role of all members of the group.
B.M. Deputy Head of Mission Nicholas Haysom says that hundreds of women competed in council elections, fought for the help of three women, and had more than 30 percent of new registered voters.
"The role of women will not be underestimated," he said on Wednesday.
Elections only involve women as a whole and can be really symbolic and reliable if they are included in all parts of the electoral process.
The Afghan Council and the presidential elections will be held on 5 November.
Taliban was in danger of the electoral process when international military operations turned into the task of speaking.
These annual elections mark the first democratically elected government in a powerfully conflicting way.
Haysom said women's strong role would be shared by Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women registered with 3.6 million registered voters.

GMB interest in investments in the Glasgov factory of McVitie's
A union wants to be secure from McVitie's managers of the construction of the factory in Glasgow.
GMB Island told the company that it was silent about the future of investment in the Tollcross area.
Along with other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits also work for more than 500 people in the factory.
McVitie's owner Pladis said they've invested more than five million stars in the last few years in the region.
If there's a change in the operations, it added that workers and union representatives will be "to be informed."
In a letter to the company's core manager, GMB Iskošya asked McVitie's "to go through their concerns about providing funds for the modernisation of natural resources".
GMB-based organizer Drew Duffy said: "Thesis is deeply concerned about the need for the general manager to work and the future of Tollcross's investment plan.
For generations, families are working here and working hard in a situation where there is a high social shortage in the local community and in a situation where there is a shortage of people who have sufficient critical support for society.
When it comes to work, money, and pension perspectives, the Brexit approaches, further transition operations, and the chronic decline in production are urgently needed for four times the existence of a mammoth production in McGatie's northern airstrip."
A woman from Pladis said: "Thesis manager in Tollcross has received a letter more daily than the GMB Iskoša and the company will pay due credit to our generosity to the union representatives.
Two months ago, working at Tollcross and with GMB representatives, we held a regular meeting that clearly discussed a few problems.
Then we told our employees, like all the companies that work in an uncertain economic environment, that we were able to survive the reactor, that we were constantly reviewing our operations for all our work and our foundations.
He added: "In those years, we invested more than 5 million stars in the Tollcross test, especially in production bands and operational development.
We're fully aware of Tollcross's legacy as a production test, and those who work for any change in our tests operations and their union representatives will be the first to know."
For more than 4 years in the Concentration and the Utku.
The five-year-olds of the five-year-olds' club, the Neptune School and the Utku Yuvakuran.
On the website of the Football Federation (TFF) Turkey, where football data are available, it was seen that Beciktaş made a deal with two players until 31 May 2021.
The first professional contract, which was reached at the bottom of the black-white team on 19th of June 2008, began in the 2009-2010 season, in the form of the A team.
The 1991-born player, who was raised up to the team's captain, played 254 games in the game with the form of the Five-in-a-row.
Also on TFF's website, he received information that was signed on 31 May 2021 by Utku Yuvakuuran's bank account, which was included in the cadroit of the last season.
Utku was released on August 1, 2017, and the license was updated on the internet on August 2, 2017.
Utku Yuvakuuran has been in charge of games in the 21st-century League game in Pešiktash, where last season's rental took place.
The young hunter, with a black-white form, was only responsible for meeting the 2 Turkish Cup.
PSG warned Barcelona about Neymar's departure three years ago?
La League may have regretted Marco Verratti's concern.
In Paris, Saint-Germain, 189 million people were warned that they would not abandon Neymar after the offer of freelance, but would they warn Barcelona about the global record rain three years ago?
The League 1 team, Paul Pogba's 89 million-year-old team, moved to Manchester, United, with more than two sides ready to break the world's transfer record, moved the sensory offer to write the transfer cycle.
The PSG's contribution of $500,000 a week after taxes shows that Neymar will be the world's top player and the most successful professional sport at the same time.
Although it is known that the government of the Catalans has been angry with the way the club from Santos has been doing its best to listen to him since the 2013 development of Santos, it is known that Barcelona is angry about the way the offer is going and the way the Neymar is going to go.
Well, was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City Blaise Matudii expressed his interest in signing in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif made a strong warning to all the clubs who wanted to sign to one of the best players in PSG.
Al-Khalafi said: "I am not concerned because they know that if they attack one of our players, we will attack them and they will attack us."
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they refuse to sign one of our players, they will be among the losers."
It appears that the Spanish club Barcelona has opened this line at the beginning of this letter, expressing the interest of PSG's middle-class player Marco Verratti.
The PSG indicated that the Italian militia would not allow them to leave any condition, and Barcelona feels better about the benefits of this concern by losing Neymar from its greatest value.

6 Europe in the alive bomb list of Interpol
German journalist Die Welt wrote that last May, Interpol (International Police Organization) had sent a list of 173 people to security organizations in Europe with the potential to edit the terrorist attacks on the name of DEAS.
The 132 people on the list were reported to be from Iraq, North Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tajikistan and Bangladesh.
Six of them were listed as European citizens.
These people are described as coming from Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Bosnia.
A man who found a DEACH connection from Germany was reported to be a 27-year-old German citizen of Solingen.
It was said that the person who spoke about had gone to Syria before Egypt in spring 2012 and then to Turkey, and finally to Syria.
The statement made from social media accounts by DEAS in the middle of the crisis was recorded as stating that this person died in Rakka.
The German Security Organization has been informed that the press has not addressed issues.
The names of Interpol's list have been changed to the progress made in operations organised in Musul in the DEAS.
According to the World, the U.S. intelligence services sent this list to Interpol.
Interpol's list of words was also registered in May to police organisations in Europe.
The report that Die Welt, a German security officer, announced that some of the names of the ISIS on this list could be found in Europe in order to address some of the terrorist attacks.
The success of a soldier in a bomb can lose his sight of the 5-year-old Star
In Job, he shed blood on the success of young soldiers.
A mob gathered in the park in Karadolap Mahallesi to defeat his friends who were going to the army last night.
According to the idea, the M.K. and the U.A. bombers in the group were set on fire in time.
After the army was defeated, the group was divided.
The M.K. shot a hand in the ground while he was passing through the game area with the kids.
The child who sat at the bank in the parking lot was injured by five of the dirt from the ground.
At the same time, he was in the park's security cameras.
The wounded were removed from the hospitals around Ferhat Turan, Ercan Turan, Kader Balker, Star Ones, and the Inca ambulances.
The 5-year-old Star of Unus was reported to be facing the risk of losing his left eye.
The star's mother, Maryam Kaya, told DHA those moments.
Kaya, who said she was alive at the Tower when she was in her bed, started at 20 a.m.
It's been two hours.
The army's out of play.
Young people started breaking up.
It would have been our turn to finish.
That's when the gun broke out, it was right in front of me.
My tower's not good.
He's got 80 to 90 percent to lose.
We talked to the doctor, he said that.
They pulled out one of the lies in the other.
He said, "There's an operation, maybe 10 operations."
The suspect M.K. and the U.S.A. were arrested by the Office of Foreign Affairs teams.
After questioning the police, two people who had been convicted were arrested in court.
