Triumph of Right Peoples in Austria, they have 29 percent to total
According to preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria resulted in a significant decrease in the current large coalition, as well as a notable increase in the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (OSP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffers from particularly significant losses.
On the other hand, the Union's electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Governor of Carinthia Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphal return on the political scene at the national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain, with 29.8 per cent of the votes, the country's first political force, however, compared with the 2006 elections, they have lost 5.5 per cent of the votes.
The OVP, which with 25.6 per cent loss of nearly nine per cent of votes, is still worse.
This is the best results of the two major post-war parties; especially for the popular party, who has launched the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
In July, when the PSP left the coalition, the popular party had a considerable progress on the SPÖ.
But the electors are apparently punished for letting the government sink down.
From the first responses to the results, speculations regarding the possible resignation of the leader of the party and current vice-president Wilhelm Multer were made.
Observers believe this could occur from Monday at the special board of the party's management.
Such a change would make it easier to move ahead with the outcome of the election that remains the most likely, namely the renewal of the great partnership of SPÖ and OVP.
However, in view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the books (FPÖ) would have received 18 per cent and 11 per cent of the votes - socialists at the same time expressed the fear of a repeat of 1999, when the populace agreed with the populist parties (at the time, the FPÖ was still united, the BZÖ was separated) on a common government, which even caused sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Hayder, who has already stated that he was ready to cooperate with any party and that he intended to return to Vienna, at the national political stage, apparently on this evolution.
The last party to have access to Parliament was the Greens, but they were slightly lost and, among the Austrian political parties, withdrew from the third in fifth position.
Of course, no other party has broken the limit of four percent and has not access to Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relationships with India are likely to freeze
If the problem of the Czech researchers accused in India of illegal cafards was not solved, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said that it would be possible to recover some of the Czech-Indigenous Relations.
The Minister said it today in New York, after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem had not been resolved, then yes, some cooling would have occurred," he noted after the meeting, followed by a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee, speaking out, said that executive power could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
However, he noted that in the case of Petr Švácha, who had been convicted and sentenced to fines, the central government could negotiate with the local government, the Darjeling, the case under his jurisdiction.
"It's a problem that could be solved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
He could then request release under trial and wait for the trial in liberty, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirms that his partner expresses himself in the same way during the talks.
"The advice to appeal to a higher court, after which it may be thanked," said the head of the Czech diplomat.
The only way the Czech party can intervene in this case is to provide the defendants with "a competent legal support", said the Indian Minister.
He also said that such assistance had already been provided to them by India.
"We wish above all to keep with India the best relationships, which have a tradition that has continued for many years.
The Indians also recognize it," says Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he said to ČTK, he pointed out to his partner that the Czech Republic had given much importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We consider the imprisonment and accusation of these Czech researchers to be a great disgrace," he said.
The Minister mistakenly asked whether he had obtained from India the promise to deal with the matter.
"I've already received a lot of promises," he said.
A Czech Arbitrary for the Seabed
It is close to an electronic wall map, on which Australia and the adjacent marine areas are represented.
But he is not interested in the continent, but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent seabed.
This area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is a member of the United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
His head, the head of the division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, followed the presentation and full time.
The back to work and enthusiasm characterize the refreshing atmosphere.
The bottom of the sea hides a little known world so far, rich in natural resources.
Oil, minerals and other mineral resources can be found there, but also living organisms for the unknown, which can contain the key to the development of a anti-cancer medicine.
A wider background than the land is closed
Literary states have begun to swirl in our days in the new sub-marine territories.
According to a United Nations convention, they serve in accordance with their rights, which they agreed in 1982 to Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is especially true of what is called the Continental Shelf, which is often extended to hundreds of miles on the coast of the country.
The latter may, according to the Convention, claim exclusively to all the resources of the continental Shelf.
"To simplify, it is considered as a continental Shelf part of the seabed and its subsoil, which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the limits of the litral sea, often beyond the two hundred thousand marines that represent the exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request that the country concerned submits to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental Shelf must be supported by a broad scientific and technical documentation based on sustainable prospects and cost-effective metrics.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the Commission with legal and scientific assistance.
To date, the Commission has made five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For the moment, only the last three countries mentioned have known the success," adds Mikulka.
Australia's success, which is the first to significantly expand its sub-marine assets, has recently been known as a global detention.
New Zealand has also received from the territory - the extension of the seabed, which has been allocated to the Commission last week, up to 1.6 million square kilometres, representing the extension of the country by six.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in prospects.
The benefits they will reap in the future of the exploitation of the seabed will be, as they plan it, inestimable.
Progressively, other countries will, in turn, apply for them.
They can do so within ten years of ratifying the Montego Bay Convention.
There, at the end of the Continental Shelf, begins the ocean floor area, proclaimed by the Convention "common heritage of mankind".
There, no more state plays an exclusive position.
The right to extradition in this area is granted by an international institution established by a convention.
"However, we do not mistake it, the bottom of the sea is not a Clondike," said exaggerating Director Mikulka, explaining that "these areas are clearly defined and their scheme is laid down in a contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the seabed today is also part of the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former member states of the East in the framework of the Interoceanmetal Joint Organization.
This was achieved in 1991, under the Convention, as well as by investors from several other States, the status of the one called "a pioneer investor".
It has the right to extract in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaii and the Kiribati.
The area envisaged by the investor is slightly beyond the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The background is moving there, it is a sort of underground response of the Tatras.
"It is possible to extract it on a stretch with a total area of 75 000 square kilometres.
The area is rich in polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," states Ind Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
Robert Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of such a conclusion.
It recalls a small dust of land, or well, with a little imagination, the mythical Shoem, which, according to legend, is the animal of the Golem.
The German special forces were on the ground for the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had requested Germany's help in resolving the hostage crisis - experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but they never went through the action.
More details on the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists taken from Egypt are available.
According to instructions from the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, the German special forces also directly participated in the rescue operation.
Thus, both federal military specialists and GSG 9 officials of the federal police and the federal criminal police office, as well as experts in logistics of the Technische Hilfwerk were on the scene of liberation.
As the Ministry spoke to him last night, the German forces were not finally required, the prisoners had released their prisoners and had fled when they recognized the need for freedom by force.
The Government of Egypt would have accepted the assistance offered by Germany to integrate it into the support force.
"This has not happened so well," said a spokesman from the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The rebels had taken the group of tourists from five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian, and eight Egyptian escorts.
After their removal from the desert to the south of Egypt, the hostages were crossed into the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the purchasers remains until now, as well as the details of the release or possible payment of interest.
Those who have been saved have been in good health for a long time, except in Cairo.
Steinmeier stated that the released hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He said nothing about the details of the liberation.
In Berlin for the moment, no information was provided on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine "Bild", five vacations and special forces should have landed on a Airbus from the Air Force and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
The United States Chamber rejected the rescue plan
The first room of the American Congress has failed to cover the saving plan of the financial markets of $700 billion.
The Dow Jones was in the ambiguity.
By 227 votes to 206, the Chamber of Representatives of the United States rejected the Security Plan for the Government's financial markets.
Despite all the calls made by the President of the United States George W. Bush and the political men at the head of the two parties, the programme that had to overcome the chaos of the financial markets had not been achieved by the majority.
In a dramatic manoeuvre, participants were desperate to convince the opponents of the property-based plan of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic representatives during the debate, had called on Members to vote in favour, even though the plan was imputable.
"It is difficult to have political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he said.
During the vote, the Dow Jones dropped more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of the investors that the statutory rescue plan could be achieved.
It takes some time before the end of the vote, then, after the announcement of the vote, to lose again.
Experts are now planning new serious disturbances on international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, approval and room of Members and Senate is required.
The organizers report a growing number of reservations
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In the case of reservations for the next month, according to one study, the number of cases increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even more than 30 per cent.
Despite the weak conjunctive perspectives, the taste of German travel remains unsatisfied according to this study.
With regard to reservations for the winter season, travel agencies recorded more than 31 per cent of business for the same period the same year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencys (DRV) trusted in Berlin Monday.
According to the Research Institute for the GfK Markets, the growing number of reservations already dominates the months of the autumn.
Thus, the sales figure would have been reduced to about 11 per cent compared to 2007, according to the DRV.
The sources of these results are the figures of the GfK, which analyzes monthly data on reservations from 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
The travel reservations made since late August 2008 would be recorded.
Due to the low dollar rate, travel to the United States would be requested in particular, the DRW stated.
There, the increase in reservations would rise to about one third.
On the other hand, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as our opposition, would be destinations especially sought by the Germans.
The organized trips are particularly requested, explained the president of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising prices of energy and food products, the costs would be "more easily calculated for the customer than for an individually organised travel".
Consumers can save money among others with reductions in advance bookings or all inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months have also been well maintained although an increase in sales figures will be reregistered over the last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the beer party
The hits of Ballermann or Apres-Ski continue, of beer in litres and celebrities in Tyrolian costumes to design.
An event at the beer festival.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I, we didn't have a big deal in common.
She's a blonde, animator of television and wears a Tyrolian costume measured.
I have hair covered, I'm a student, and my dress is an opportunity.
But one thing is related to us: at least three minutes at the beer festival, and the photographers are already hanging on us and filling their memory card - very smooth, and this is my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
Tyrolian good market costumes seem to reach their goal.
As a tourist of the beer festival and normally living in the north of the Weißwurst square, my feeling of well-being in traditional costumes has so far been limited.
But once on Teresa's place, it's half worse.
Each or almost wears a Tyrolian suit or leather pants; no one has the air blown or affected by shame - it's completely normal.
Only the table of my Tyrolian costume gathers some strange eyes at the stand of bananas-chocó.
A bavaroise makes me realize that I would have been badly attached to my table: "to the left means free, to the right, to the left, to the left, to the left."
Unfortunately, I tripped my ass from the back to the left.
"That's better," she told me and insisted.
Others don't give themselves so bad for these flitt subtils and wear simple lights, which are written on "Too drink to get dressed!" and expose us to their back-trains without being invited there.
The young man in the exhibitionist attitude is named Bob, comes from England and comes for the first time at the beer festival.
He finds it "gorgeous" with a "oooooo" extended.
He told me all of this after he calmed down from the hat he had been wearing before.
Right next to this fire mouth, everyone thinks it's a powder.
So Bob's one of those "squawking bastards" sadly famous.
Others have no chance of getting rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, fishermen of rescuers are running on the party's place and need to care for poor beekeepers.
Instead, nurses intervene - always by four, they train their city covered with tentacles.
This works for most visitors of the beer festival: it's empty, it's full.
Those who sit in the circle of boots under the roof are not visible.
"These are those who can no longer appreciate," I was asked by one of the rescuers in response to my question and then disappeared in the mine.
Victim of an accident identified by the police
A 63-year-old child who died in the hospital after being injured by a vehicle was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in a Friday after noon accident in the city on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but then died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested because he suspected of having a dangerous conduct.
He has been released from prison.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons.
Before Turkey thought to join the European Union, the European powers had a strong urge to sink into its backyards.
On the east side of the Bosphore, 20 may not be, from Asia, one of the most beautiful religions of his empire's ambition is lost.
Hydarpasha was designed in a neo-renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
That's at least what the guides tell us.
The monument is equipped with horses at the bottom of the platforms, round-the-clocks of observation to each of its angles, such as some German provincial fairs.
The stones are salts.
The whole building is ruined.
But once inside the stolen ticket, we have no doubt about the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German association, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a late player in the game of imperialism, wanted to achieve its medieval ambitions of domination through this iron path that reaches Damascus, Baghdad and the most known land under the name of Saudi Arabia.
But the German imperialist ambitions came to an end during World War I.
His iron ways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregularity.
The relative isolation of its region around it, engulfed by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is over.
. The British and the forces of the empire further advance Egypt and push the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there were also bad news for Hyderpasha.
In 1917 a train loaded with explosive munitions destroying its subtile completely .
The Turkish sources said it's sabotage.
Since then, it slowly falls into ruin, covered in the ruins of history.
But today, the railway passage to Anatolia and all the eastern points, at least symbolicly serve to highlight the expansion of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
Insulation relative to its region around it, engulfed by the frozen borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish Government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I was on a train headed by the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit Turkish MP AKP Suât Kiniklioglu, one of the experts in foreign policy.
The next morning, after a 10-and-a-half-hour trip, followed by the burning rails that the cadence reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital, presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning the two to its German past.
However, the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an example of a change of Turkish consensus.
He suspects the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the general district of the AKP, an ultra modern structure, specifically built in stone and steel, in a development area, surrounded by half-constructed commercial centres and many landscapes in which middle-class managers - men and women meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a right-wing politician from any other part of Europe.
It's a suit, a tie, and it even has a Black Berry.
" The aim of this foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he said.
Turkey was cut off from its back country.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case of each other.
She had to do both.
"but, at some point, did I ask whether Turkey should choose?"
"Turkey," he said, "he doesn't want to have to choose between them."
He then pointed out a point that almost all those I could talk to were told with my heart: Turkey's railway not only goes to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, is therefore both a benefit for Europe and the United States and for Turkey itself.
With Turkey's integration, the message seems to draw a Europe traveling metaphorically on the roads to Asia and the Middle East.
From returning to Hydarpasha station, after another night without sleeping, I thought of these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in large part, be found in the hands of Turkey.
While I was waiting for the terminal, the Ferry to cross the Bosphore, I reminded me of the period during which Turkey had been called "the disease of Europe".
At least there is no doubt about the continent that might claim this fascinating country.
Memories of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown wrote: Music director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (born 11 September) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the next year, the fantastic heart of young people, Proteus.
The heart should include at least 21 years of age, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who had been more than 20 years of age refused to leave the heart.
The name "Proteus" (who changed in form according to mythology) represented the heart's will and ability to manage any type of music that was presented to him, whether it was magic or Messianic.
Musical versatility produced by such a young heart was often impressive, always exciting, and this thanks to the inspiration of one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remains constant throughout the years.
Remember how Tod repeated to us "let music speak for herself."
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all there, in music.
So sing!"
Its baguette technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if it never appeared as a dictatorship.
Whatever the musical standard, it was much higher.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If a driver was supposed to be called a knight, it's good Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the years 1962 to 1982, when he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I've seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever missed me, and sometimes they've even inspired me.
Tod Handley held this combination of personal size and modesty.
He hated drivers who, according to him, "focus only on certain people."
He'll miss a lot of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett wrote:
Your neurology by William Woodruff (born 25 September) states that "in 1946, he had resumed his studies in economic history in Oxford, and became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while doing a BSc, a MA and a PhD".
That's what comes out of Woodruff's letter in Beyond Nab End, but that's not right.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at Nottingham University, and at the same time he finished PhD thesis on the British plastic industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; he was published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at Houblon Norman, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to emulate this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition " Flamenco and life " because his photographs in black and white, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They attracted me to the fact that they were simple and the strength they transmit and because they always treat protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that transmits a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second season for Honda's super sales
In November, Honda will start marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had a good habitat, this new monovolume has an even larger internal space.
This adds some refined mechanisms, which increase the comfort of conduct and allow for more substantial savings.
A revolution confronts a revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Honda Jazz presents a very similar line to the previous model, the changes in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before considering the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz is six years after the first generation market was placed on the market.
First of all, it is noted that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter period than that of other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a sales phenomenon on other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where Honda Jazz was the most commercialized car in 2002 and also in 2008.
In Japan, nearly one million Honda Jazz has been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less than a million cars sold in six years, is located in the second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow him to increase his sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007, the Japanese brand market sold 83,000 Honda Jazz in 2009, it considered selling 100,000, which would represent a 17% increase in sales on the European market.
On the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8,000 Jazz since 2002 which is 6.7% of Honda sales in Spain.
The officials of the Spanish branch are hoping to sell 2,000 Jazz in one year.
It is precisely the exit of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to pay most of the sales in Spain.
In fact, market leaders expect the year to end with a sale of 22,000 cars, namely 4000 cars in 2007, a down of 16%.
As a result of this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese market also hopes to obtain a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this market part when the new model comes out.
This is the Insight, a hybrid with five doors and a large compact - 4,37 meters long - on which the company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars per year throughout the world.
According to markets and according to the estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50 per cent of the Insight sales will be made to the United States, while the other half will be distributed between the Old Content and Japan.
The Insight commercial launch is scheduled during the first three months of the next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz has increased its dimensions.
Its length is 3.90 metres (five cm in addition), its width is 1.69 metres (two cm in addition) and its distance between its axis is 2.50 meters, which is an increase of five cm.
On the other hand, the height does not change to 1,52 meters.
The dimensions also increase the inner space.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of an essence reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of the buffer - which has a double system - can contain up to 399 litres, 19 litres of capacity in excess of the first generation buffer.
These dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, as the Honda Jazz 1.2L buffer capacity is 379 litres.
The other innovation - in addition to external elements such as rear lights or panoramic roofs - is improving access to rear seats.
The doors that provide access to the rear seats have an 80-degree opening angle, part of the back door of the first Jazz which was opened with a 67-degree angle.
Engines are also new to this second generation of Jazz.
At the start of its marketing, this small model will be equipped with two propellants of 1,2 and 1,4 litres.
The two engines have an i-VTEC technology that reduces the consumption of gas and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine more powerful and which increases the engine's regime.
The first engine 1,2 litres develops a power of 90 horses at 6,000 tr/min and 114 Nm at 4,900 tr/min.
This propeller - reaching 78 horses on the former Jazz – presents a total of 5.3 litres per 100 km and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
With regard to the previous propeller, the previous generation had reached 83 horses, now reaching 100 horses.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L of 100 horses has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres per 100 km and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
The 'beautiful vehicle' that avoids collisions
In order to improve the development of disaster prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired, this time by nature, particularly by the bees.
The Japanese company created a robot that avoids accidents by imitating the flight of bees.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, and represents the first steps to collision prevention technologies.
Engineers from the Advanced Technical Centre of Nissan Motor Co. have built this small robot in collaboration with the Advanced Science and Technology Research Centre of the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director-General for Public Relations for Technology and Research and the Development of the Marks Management, the BR23C is the core of the Nissan security shield.
This robot will allow vehicles on the brand to prevent collisions.
During his flight, each bee created its own personal space of an oval shape that is very similar to Nissan safety bottle.
But most importantly, these are the eyes of the bee, able to see in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
In order to acquire this visual function, engineers have identified what is called Laser Range Finder.
It detects the obstacles that are at a distance of two metres and within 180 degrees, calculates the distance up to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor immediately to avoid the obstacle.
"When it detects an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by bending its 90-degree or more wheels to avoid collision.
The greatest difference in relation to any other existing system is that the evasion management is entirely instinctive.
If that were the case, the robot would not be able to react fast enough to avoid the obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Migration Laboratory and the main engineer of the project.
Unlike a bee, the robot can not be turned up or down or in diagonal; it can only move in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotational function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
" Every second of this device shall only process information and act on the basis of these data.
There is no need to preserve the information or intuitive software of pre-manufactured manuals, which is why it can continue with only a few dozen memory KBs.
This may surprise us, but we don't talk about giga-octettes of memory, or even megaocettes."
This represents the first car development of new anti-collision prevention technologies, a technology that will be introduced in serial cars in a decade after Nissan.
The robot walks with lithium-polymer batteries, which are smaller and last longer than lithium-ions batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device to a satellite GPS navigation system to guide the driver to its destination by avoiding road barriers.
They're afraid of being hypothetized.
It must be acknowledged that the United States Treasurer, in addition to having a lot of liquids to make plans, is not a genius.
Faced with the crisis, and to avoid Americans embarking on mortgages with solvency banks, they have created a game to learn not to fail: Bad Credit Hotel.
It's the bad credit hotel... or stories.
The working aspect of this accommodation and especially of the Hotel Master makes us think of several times if it is a good time to ask for a loan.
And, especially, where to do it.
Of course, this game provides useful but not detailed information.
It's another game reserved for teenagers.
What if the game is over?
Because a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, because it's unnecessary to buy a house
Morgan Stanley opens his capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced his entry into his Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will spend nine billion dollars to take 21% of its capital, a new welcome by a strong drop in his Bourse course.
A week after the opening of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9 per cent of the ordinary operations of Morgan Stanley at a unit price of $25.25, or a total of $33 billion.
The held price is less than 19 per cent at the accounting value of the securities until 31 August.
MUFG will invest six billion additional dollars in the acquisition of convertible securities by providing it with a 10 per cent return and a conversion price of $31,25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global operation would be based on an average unit price of $29, or 28 per cent above its current course.
However, Morgan Stanley lost 6.79% to $23.07 to 1700 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to banking status," said John Mack, Director-General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which should allow him to diversify his activities, but to pass it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis requires Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a more prudent attitude than before.
The arrangements presented Monday also show that the agreement has been amended over the last few days: last Monday, Morgan had just announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares in Japan for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, explained to Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, "We believe that participation would be entirely composed of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover them."
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley 7% below their accounting value.
And the operation will be translated by a dilution of about 20% of the benefit by action.
The agreement provides that MUFG may be able to convert in one year half of its preferential securities into regular shares if these last exchanges more than 50% above the conversion price, or approximately $47 for a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that MUFG's capitals will allow him to seize investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
However, a group spokesman refused to comment on the strategic projects of the two new alliances.
Following the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should show a ratio of solvency Ter One of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan has claimed to have "cleaned" his balance since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been trying for the group, which has seen its course of Bourse as a half-year-old, while the cost of insurance against a default risk on its debt was increased.
This cost was reflecting Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's large investment banks after the failure of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's raid, announced that he had raised $15 billion, in part with Berkshire Hataway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa, Quito, this Monday.
Refund the Republic around the twenty-first century socialism.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, at the invitation of his colleagues and friends, was the third person who voted in favour of a new Constitution.
The mission is fulfilled because 64% of the voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results of 80% of the suffering.
According to these results, "no" received 28 per cent, 7 per cent of the injuries were zero and 0.7 per cent were white votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, half of the suffering would have to be increased.
On Sunday, two polls from voting offices and a non-governmental organization report a wide victory of "yes" between 63 per cent and 70 per cent.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on Monday night the victory of his draft Constitution.
"Constitution has triumphed in a terrible way," he said, commending the Ecuadorians at the governorate's headquarters in Guayaquil, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
As well understood, Rafael Correa was blessed by Chávez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The silence, which took place in peace under the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was based on a text on 444 points confirming the "new socialism" defended by the President.
The draft Constitution devotes the power of the State to the economy, subjecting it to the "development planning" of a country that lives primarily from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and loans sending its migrants.
By Korea, elected in 2006, the project also provides strengthened powers to the Head of State, which will be able to carry out up to two consecutive mandates for four years and will have the possibility of disbanding the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that it would use this power and would set up a new mandate in February 2009.
In addition, the Constitution consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to place in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50 per cent of the population lives below the poverty level.
Finally, it provides for the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as an starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 ottags were released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack against the rapists of the 11 tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held captive for ten days in the desert were gathered this afternoon after healthy and safe in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released by an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently, the hostages arrived at 1530 hours on board a special aircraft at the Al-Maza military base, hosted at Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, on board helicopters to the Maadi hospital, a residential bathroom in Cairo, for examinations.
They are in "good health", and "no money has been paid" to the rapists," said Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna on the tarmac.
Arrested on September 19 at a Safari in 4x4 on the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the border of Egypt, the Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been stolen from one cache to another by 35 unknown rapists.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and a Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the manager of the Egyptian agency, organizer of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 members of the special forces, on board two helicopters, had launched the attack on the night just before dawn.
"An exchange of fire cuts has occurred, and half of the rapists have been killed, others moving," said the manager who demanded the anonymity.
He indicated that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "clear" unit had been sent to the Sudan, where they had received support from German and Italian commands.
The head of Italian diplomat Franco Frattini mentioned Belgrade, where he found the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result through professionalism and the effectiveness of our men of secret services, special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The guard, the Sudanese army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on board which was found by the rapists, killing six, including the Chadian chief, and arresting two.
The army had claimed that they were linked to a rebel group of Darfur, the Sudan-Unit Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which was immediately deposed.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A discussion on the financing of culture takes place in the minority and deals with this electoral campaign.
That's better.
But a sector of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will be raised to deny the misdemeanor sums given to small museums, archives, archeological caves or national historical places that grow from hunger?
What politicians will remind the federal government that he ignores its monuments and heritage buildings?
What in Quebec, like Canada, do we not have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros on the restoration of the only Chinan castle in the Valley of Loire?
In our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of the heritage is part of American culture and that it must be protected by all citizens, elected and all government departments, in concert.
In Quebec, the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers in 211 companies of history, heritage, archives and genetics are concerned about browsing history, preserving with three museums of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
These are often the shepherds of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision makers launch their bulldozers against our old stones and forgotten cemeterys.
When, a court for history and heritage?
The Governments of the Benelux nationalize a part of the Fortis Bank
The Benelux states come to the aid of the Belgian and Dutch banks, as the first European banking institution in the event of depression following the sudden downturn of the credit market crisis in the United States, partly nationalised. The three countries support a total of EUR 11.2 billion, this financial institution and insurance that also have interests in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, in this case, also calling on the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition officer.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis has been increasing for more than a year, it is for the Fortis bank. In some respects, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will acquire almost half (up to 49 per cent) of the bank's capital in each country.
The bank is undoubtedly selling part of its shares, including, firstly, the activities, mainly insurance, which it acquired in the last year of the Dutch organization ABN Amro.
The last week, Fortis actions began a vertical fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed in the bank.
The analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to let her go to the fail.
Nothing but Friday, the company's actions fell by 12 percent to reach its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, more than two thirds of their value has been lost.
Given the current value of the actions, the total value of the group's capital is around EUR 14 billion, which, according to company leaders, is not realistic.
The management of the company accuses the uncertainty of the Atlantic, in relation to the adoption of the US savings plan of $700 billion, to be the source of the loss of the Fortis actions.
Monday, the paper has already benefited from a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank as the new Director-General.
The financial body was also looking for private buyers, but had not yet received a proposal on the ground.
In the past, the Belgian Government announced that investors should not be concerned, that they should not lose their money.
No panic was felt in the circle of the bank's clientele and no agency was taken into custody.
In Hungary, Fortis owns independent agencies and has also acquired lease companies.
A nest in the pool.
In the United States, health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate on the basis of information on their drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes that include the use of information on the prescription of medicines, in all cases, according to the person concerned.
This kind of program must be found among independent hands, but it is worth trusting its chicken in a nest." Richard Dicket, the program creator used to manage the prescriptions of drugs in Washington Post.
Insurance companies rely on the insurance premium and capital secured in the event of damage, on the health status of the client present, and if they feel that the risk is too high, they do not even provide it.
In the past, they sent the candidates to a medical examination, and they signed an insurance contract with them only after they had been informed of the results.
For ten years, Dick has found a much less expensive procedure: from a number of identifications, it is easily available to pharmaceuticals, the data on the purchases of medicinal products of the person in the eighteen months of school. From this, the program itself determines what disease the person is suffering and what his health is.
For example, if this person regularly buys strong doses of cholesterol reduction, this refers to an extremely high blood fat rate, which results in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some determine at the same time a risk coefficient, so there is no greater thing to do to the insurance agent than the papercase. However, few problems may still appear.
Among the disadvantages of this program is the fact that a medicine can be used for various purposes. For example, some mixtures may be used against migraine or heat pumps, but may also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by the insurance companies to be an undermining risk factor, while the others are not.
Companies have developed research and analysis of data. They must ask the patient for permission before collecting the necessary information from the pharmaceutical.
In the meantime, they are bound by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their shortcomings in the past.
For a while, some companies are also dealing with the results of laboratory analysis, and they are related to the data on drug consumption. In this way, they are able to provide a more precise portrait of the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and the control of use has become increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope is limited to practitioners and insurance.
A proposal for a law on the extension of the control circle of the authorities concerning enterprises specializing in the provision of data is currently before the Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and that is why he has developed more before his programme, which would require the transmission of data to the exclusive agreement of the person concerned.
It is another question to know whether the person concerned is really free to give his or her consent because if he refuses, insurance does not constitute an insurance contract with him.
Thus and finally, the lungs depend on the wellness of the yard.
Marseille's Global Menu
The European Union and India are multiplying by two trades.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit on other issues, mostly global.
Today, there will also be a French-India summit where cooperation in nuclear energy will be a major issue.
The European Union recognized that India was an emerging democratic power to which it needed to give a wider voice in international affairs, but the Member States had not yet been able to agree on their support to New Delhi for its nomination as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
They are also not too anxious to deal with this question yesterday at the 9th summit held in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as the current President of the Union, as well as the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the head of the diplomat, Javier Solana, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years they would multiply by two commercial exchanges, which means an increase of a good hundred billion euros.
In view of the fact that trade between 2000 and 2007, the trade in goods has gone from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be an ambitious objective.
In this sense, they have agreed on a legal point of view on the 26 bilateral conventions with India on civil flights. Thus, air exchanges can also take their place in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with one another, India, which is the EU's first trading partner, and New Delhi, which is only the ninth place among the EU's partners.
The summit focused on global affairs.
The Afghan and Pakistani situation was severely condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the need for a United Nations conference on this issue was raised.
The completion of the Doha commercial cycle was also requested, although both had a large share in the current deficit.
The EU has confirmed that it remains faithful to the energy and climate programme, in particular that it would like to reduce at least twenty percent of its toxic wastes by 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as the need for a global market to be passed at the climate conference next year, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent by 2050.
They would also like to prevent price increases in food goods, and they supported the convening of an international working meeting to review the financial crisis.
The head of the Indian State is now in the French capital, where at a bilateral meeting he is prepared to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders for a value of EUR twenty billion for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to the press agency's information, the agreement would take 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian editors at the International Hall of the Book of Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian editors present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, make your most important international in the exchange of rights.
The International Chamber of the book of Frankfurt is waiting for this edition, with more than 7 thousand exhibitors coming from 101 different countries that will occupy 171,790 square metres of the Salon with more than 403 thousand titles in the exhibition, and Turkey as an guest of honour.
This will be the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Goods and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government at the opening ceremony of the Italian Papillon: in fact, Italy will be present institutionally, with a point Italy-264 square metres.
It will be followed by your meeting with the press in the Room Structure, on the 5.0board of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospects of the edition position in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign authors' books is gradually reduced in relation to the total Italian production, and in particular in relation to adults and children.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire disappeared a year ago.
Steve Fosset's plane plane, the billionaire disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the wilderness of Nevada, was found.
Debris were found on a beach 3,000 metres high, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the California border with Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
The sheriff of Madeira County, John Anderson, raised the remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that it is good for Steve Fosset to travel on the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore explained that no human remains were found on the plane or around.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) reported that a team of investigators sent to the premises identified the device: it is well for the Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset decolla of Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fosset were found by a couple around their apartment of Mammoth Lakes.
It is two documents bearing the name of Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, the money of the species and a pulse.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had gained a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
At the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of flight alone.
Three years later, he had turned the world into a plane and without a ladder.
Among all these recordings, he also had to fly to 15445 metres high on the Andes, but with a couple.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect.
A 4x4 out of the common original and well-defined design, marked lines, wide surfaces and clean angles.
Here, in synthesically, Glk, the last child of the street "compacts" of the house of the star, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a fresh air in this sector.
Just by its contents outside standard, unexpected and non-conventional will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms, starting on October 17th.
Thus, the advertising battalion that will accompany the start of the new car will take place in an undisputed mode of communication, through a future 3D display campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of maxi exhibitions, described in three different phases, will dominate the heart of the Milanian shopping, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special moons distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real size and three-dimensional format.
In fact, we'll have the impression that when we look at the image, the car comes out of the display.
Then, through the use of innovative technology Elimina8, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recompensated in a single image.
Clearly, with this publication, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new in the stereotyped area of the motorist communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to stimulate the interest of future acquisitions? We'll see.
Here's the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they're risking Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls who are now ashamed of Italy? They are part of the "Ultras Italy" group that has been following the Italian national team for years, and who have never had serious problems so far.
He's never been hit with the opposites.
The extraction of the group is right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verone, Padue, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (or in reality) of Campania and the Pouilles have been added.
They had three-coloured drawers on which their city of origin appeared: Saturday evening, they were all removed so that they could not be identified.
They're inspired by the English typhoes.
In Bulgaria, they found a real Nazi typhoes, that of Levski.
Figc has made available the Italian typhoes, 144 tickets for the party: all nominals, and therefore easily controlled.
And the Viminal had all of them controlled: among those who were involved in Sofia, no one had a Daspo in progress, no one had been forbidden to attend a stadium.
Four Italian typhoses who had been in charge of stage crime had no right to the ticket, and could not move.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the actions that will come from the Bulgarian police, and will then take measures: in this case, it may be that typhoses arrested or identified in the riots will have a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that prohibits frequent Italian states, but also Europeans.
In short, our hooligans will no longer stand in the city.
Good luck.
But now it is the time of fear-emulation: that is, others are at risk of adding to the hundreds of fifty-firsts.
"We must increase this fire immediately, and do not legitimize who behaves like this" supports the Viminal.
So, "Keep your eyes open, especially in view of the game of the national team of Wednesday in Lecce"
In the Puules there is actually a small nursery of Italian Ultras.
Tomorrow, the Observatory will meet Tuesday, the Casms, which can even count on a section of the Sea, namely secret services, which deal directly with stage problems.
"Duce-Duce Hearts, and the arm stretched during Mameli's hum? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime."
Here's the opinion (expressed in a very unpleasant way) by Domenico Mazzilli, who has been the director of the Viminal Observatory (he has taken the position of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferrizzi).
Mazzilli was previously a prefect in Trieste, where he lives as a supporter of the Ultras Italy group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli said, that in Bulgaria, paying Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behavior of these 150-200 typhoes has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adding the Observer No. 1 to the crimes must be attributed to the country in which the fact occurs.
So far, this group has remained in the rules, now we will see clearly what has happened, and we will evaluate it for the future.
But we're also talking about syllables against Mammel's hum: those are not crimes either, but if you let me, they're not cops..."
