I don't think I'm ready for the investigation.
Mary's answer to the question of the desk.
They'll figure it out.
We don't have school tomorrow.
Rome wasn't built in one day.
I like to dance.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Why didn't you come?
Tell them we're here.
We need you.
We didn't have secrets.
Why do you learn French?
I have a green shirt.
You're much faster than me.
Tom is now living in Australia.
Look at me and listen to me.
You want me to tell him?
Give it to Tom.
Peter loves Jane.
Keep laughing.
I refuse to let that happen.
Good morning.
Do you like snow?
You look disappointed.
Tom knows all about them.
Did you sleep all the time?
Tom's a crazy kid.
That's right.
We're talking a lot.
Tell me what you're gonna do in the exams.
I don't think two languages are enough.
Can you lend me your car for tonight?
Where exactly did you put him?
Her daughter's sick.
I think we should tell them.
You should be grateful.
Tell him to come and see me.
Tell him not to come.
I'm going to the church with the car.
You're much smarter than me.
Who's left?
Where exactly did you put it?
Write everything down.
Germany is in Central Europe.
I'm shy.
Tom doesn't laugh.
Amy's coming home at three.
I showed him my room.
The man wants to know the truth.
She went home.
Tom doesn't want to know French.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom noticed that Mary was wearing a new dress.
I'm unemployed.
I won't lose it.
I'm trying to be happy.
Tom teaches me French.
Are you asking me to stay?
Find Tom.
Are you sure you want to go with Tom?
Tom couldn't understand Mary's play.
Tell them I'm innocent.
The fish's not my favorite.
Sit down.
Do you have anyone?
He's a teacher of the Holy Jesus.
You'll see.
I'm not satisfied with this.
They're lost again.
Tom would do anything for you.
Is it okay?
Who's the title of your new book?
Are you kidding me?
Could I know where you're working?
Can anyone explain it to me?
Who is this?
We have to tell him.
His jokes really kill me.
You've paid too much.
Are we sure we want to catch Tom?
We want to do it right.
I ate the meat.
Flowers and trees need clean air and water.
They've got wine.
How can we find Tom?
He says he still loves me, but I don't believe him at all.
We put green on the house.
The time and place of the meeting are closed.
Tom's here.
How are things in Boston?
I've got promotion recently.
Millie doesn't drink water.
There are exceptions.
I love flowers.
They won't talk.
Tell him I'm here
Don't play here.
Please close the door.
The cord is good for health.
I wonder if Tom forgot to tell Mary he had to.
What would you tell her to do?
He loves him.
Tom said he didn't want to eat anything.
I'll stop.
Tom worked in Australia.
You're competitive.
I was wrong.
I wish I wasn't Canada.
What's missing is not gold.
I asked Tom to play guitar.
He's hitting my cell phone.
He threw his dirty clothes on the floor.
Are you a journalist?
Tom is a head higher than me.
Where can we buy it?
It's 2:30 now.
Everyone knew you.
This book is yours.
Tom knew who was from his house.
Where's the oven?
You offered me.
We loved them.
You're not my father.
You're not Canadians.
Who's that?
Tom forgot his suitcase on the train.
They killed our asses.
My name is not Cussey.
I saw the girl.
We're still in Boston.
Try it.
The phone's ringing.
Tom lives in Boston.
Thomas lives in a community with hippies.
The water is hot.
You have to hide.
I'm already working.
She likes to run.
Tom didn't want to touch her.
It was urgent.
You're wearing exact scars.
Has anyone come?
Tom's the only Canadian here.
Tom's gonna live.
It was too late.
These are not fish.
This is a phrase.
We need more volunteers.
Are you really Canada?
People today play a more important role in folk culture than in the past.
Tom is no longer my friend.
It's very clean.
Do you know when they'll be back?
It's easy for Tom.
Can you help us translate this text?
Did you wash your hair?
Did Tom see you?
We agree.
I walk every day.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
I have to go to school.
Did you shoot him?
We may need some.
This is a proposal.
How'd you get through the break?
Tom didn't tell me his secret.
We invited them in the evening.
Oh, we've been invited?
I'll warn you.
I'll try to find you.
What's your name?
I'm unemployed too.
Tom's house has been destroyed all the time.
Tom took Mary.
It's from France.
Why are you angry?
Tom was born in Boston.
You want to buy a house in Germany?
They're not happy.
Do you know who he is?
Did you see the baseball on TV last night?
Mary photographed her mother with her cell phone.
I wanted to die.
It's the same to me whether it comes or not.
I don't understand English.
It's not about money.
Would you like to see them?
You ruined him.
We learned to fly like birds and swim like fish, but we forgot how to live as humans.
I've learned a lot.
We don't trust strangers.
Tell her I'm busy.
I won't be late.
We need to know what happened.
Try not to think about it.
I want you, Tom.
Let me explain my position.
I've never stopped loving Mary.
You're not welcome here.
He's not there.
Are you 18?
I want to do sports.
Tom was alive.
Thomas's phone hit, but he didn't.
Can you teach me French?
The price was unlimited.
Almost.
Where's your friend?
Do you know any Greek myth?
It's over for 40.
What time are you leaving?
Tom gave Mary a legitimate French.
The captain has given us a great deal.
Go with him.
Why aren't you here today?
He tried to throw her away with love songs.
I'm married.
Tell them to help me.
The text is not read.
Tom called Mary.
Aren't you going to Australia to build stores?
What do you call that?
Lori's still in school.
My office is in the city center.
He's got two brothers.
You're not Canada.
I trained Boston years ago.
Tom denied Mary.
Tom has a dear brother.
I'll translate.
We stayed in Boston for three nights.
I'm starting to find you strong.
I don't want to wait so long.
Tom's wearing gloves.
The letters are written by the girl.
Someone's been screaming.
He didn't go to bed.
He speaks French fluently.
I'm taller than you.
Have you lost the evidence?
Are you afraid you don't lose your money?
Tell them to do the same.
Do you know when Tom will be back?
Tom has no red hair.
Can I borrow your earphones?
Why are you so happy today?
I'm innocent.
I think Tom's drunk.
Tom is your teacher.
The news made him happy.
We're enemies.
Who's got him?
We don't have a place to go.

This bus is going to the art museum.
We're in Boston.
He lives in Dubai.
I don't know what you're looking for.
Are they big?

Who is this?
Wake up.
He's got the woods.
I thought Tom liked the giraffes.
I don't have money with me.
He'll be watching you.
Tom and Frank are good friends.
How was Boston?
Tom claims he can speak French.
Tom put a rose on the wall.
We're very busy.
More powerful, please.
You're my friends.
Please breathe from your mouth.
The company cancelled the plan.
"Flights!" cried.
He worked hard.
I don't come here very often.
I'm gay.
You're easy.
Tom's not a hero.
I'm glad I could help.
Tom wasn't the one who killed Mary.
These keys aren't mine.
She was the last client.
You like white wine?
They made a mistake.
I say it and I repeat it.
Open the radio.
Tell them to come home.
I don't like rabies.
I couldn't sleep.
Are you studying Chinese?
There's a lot of money.
That won't happen again.
Russia is big.
The woods are friendly.
You ruined her.
I'm sorry, I can't sit for a long time.
I'm a judge of Harvard.
Tom died before his son was born.
Look what I can do.
You can't do anything.
I don't want you to tell her.
Tom has a friend who lives in Boston.
What brings you here?
I made myself sleepy.
I won't lose!
It's a good investment.
The snow was hard to see.
Don't make excuses.
Thomas bought something.
He's got a house.
The girl's got an ass horse.
Tom's a little jealous.
I still want to marry you.
Now it's your chance.
You can choose which book you want.
Where are your clothes?
Tom's not a Canadian.
I'm talking.
The best way to learn English is to go to America.
You thought I was Canada?
I'll be with you.
I haven't got an answer in my letter.
Can I borrow your wallet?
Is everyone ready for the trip?
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
I'm reading it.
I want to talk to Tom.
You shot him.
Tom is Turkos.
Can you get rid of the ten six?
Don't stop!
I'm the only one who didn't have to.

He's smart.
When are you leaving for a break?
It's Anita's house.
Tell her it's urgent.
He likes to play soccer.
How old were you when you left Australia?
He didn't stay cold.
Tom gave us some apples.
Let's be honest.
I'm going to Athens.
I know.
I fell into the woods.
He's talking like a truck.
When are you reading?
He hasn't answered yet.
Where's the money?
I'm looking for evidence that he's not telling the truth.
I don't agree with you.
No one could have imagined it.
It's gonna be hard.

Why do you hate the Canadians so much?
I can't lie to him.
I'm from Norway.
That's a horse or sometimes?
I'm grateful she's done.
And I'm kind of tired.
Are you sure you don't think of things?
Don't make excuses.
He's walking late.
Come with us.
No one wants to take responsibility.
Is his father Japanese?
Watch out, please!
Are you sure you hit the last button?
Tom was dangerous.
What time does it start?
I'm blind now.
I'd think about it.
Tom's from Australia.
Where do you want to eat?
That would never have happened in Boston.
I like to play piano.
They didn't know me.

Who cares?
Tell me what you want.

All the visitors have left.
Who killed Tom?
I'm proud of my brother.
Take it with you.
Come out.
I wish I had been born a Canadian.
You're hopeless.
You're hopeless.
What did you promise to do?
I didn't take part in the debate.
Note: In English, we greet the nations, the days of the week, and languages.
Tom loved me.
You were lying.
I trust you.
Aren't you going to Australia to make things worse?
How many times have you met Tom?
My name is Cyril; I'm glad to meet you.
He's got nice legs.
His current behavior confirms what we have been doing.
You'll eat.
The problem is you're not Canadian.
We're not happy.
Tom's sleeping.
Is he coming?
Tell us where to go.
Sam broke up and was at Layla's toilet.
When I grow up, I'll be a pilot.

Kate never celebrates her birthdays.
How much do you want to pay?
Aren't you happy?
Forgive Tom.
Tom is a little younger than your daughter.
That's exactly what you need right now.
I did some research.
Do you feel tired?
"It's still rain, huh? My feet are still pumping in the mud." "There's a lot of sand on the beach.
I went to London.
I love dogs.
Are you afraid you don't lose your money?

Would you like to see them?
The birds are red.
Find me a bottle.
I need more money.
They all speak French.
Whenever I hear this song, Tom comes back.
We've been making rounds for an hour trying to find the hotel.
I'm not a tree.
I'm eating.
Your friend's here.
I'm over three.
Don't put sugar on the coffee.
I'd like you to stay with me.
If you're wrong, give it up, if you're right, don't talk.
It's lucky.
It makes me laugh.
Tom trusts you.
Where were you yesterday?
Tom is John's brother.
Are you sure Tom can do this?
He's got a lot of money.
The good I want you to be honest with me, but I'll tell our mother.
The girls looked at each other.
Brazil is the largest country in South America.
I like running.
Sam says it about your safety.
I never eat meat.
The distributions do not need to correspond to a natural quantity. Anything can be a place of distribution enough to determine the addition between the distributions and the multiplication with a large size.
His money is in the bank.
I'm so shy.
I love my country.
We went to a serious debate.
They're here.
Maybe someone likes Tom.

"Why don't you go?" "Because I don't want to."
You were a thief.
I'd like to see the party.
As he hit the phone, Tom woke up.
Tom can't help Mary today.

I'm going to start with a tomato cup...
I need you.
Are you okay?

One in four is eight.
Can I try it?
You're much faster than me.

Tom has a brother.
Who shot them?
She's writing me all those days.
Fuck it.
It's a crime you couldn't come.
Write something.
It took me three hours to drive from Boston here.
Tom put his nose in the window.
You're smaller than me.
She's eating.
I need your car.
Tom thinks Mary killed John.
I'll find them.
I arrived at 2:30.
You might be right.
The oxygen is necessary for burning.
All right?
You're unbelievable.
Tell her I'm innocent.
My brother lives in Boston.
What are you reading?
Okay, thank you.
Only I can save you.
Where's a cure?
Tom spent money on Mary.
Tom's not driving fast.
His current position confirms what we've been thinking.
Tom told me he'd like to repair Boston.
Where's the wizard?
The experiment failed.
It's more likely.

He must be sick.
I'm shy.
We'll make a visit to our friends.
I'm sick of constipation.
And talking about genocides, it's Columbus Day today.
Sam took another camera.
I want some hot oranges.
The entrance of the toilet is very fragile.
Is Tom from Boston?
Do we really have to leave now?
Would you like coffee or tea?
Tom, I'm afraid we'll find our client.
Where's your house?
Tom wrote a lot of songs.
They made a decision.
He wrote the book.
I haven't given them to Tom yet.
You're still alive.
I'll never forget that night.
I don't know if I have time.
I hope to see them.
I'm not going to reveal her secrets.
Mary's answer to the question of the desk.
Tom said he thought I was impressed.
I'm dying at least once a month.
I want to eat some cheese.
He shot her.
I can't look for that word in the dictionary.
Answer the question.
The problem is you're not Canadians.
I'll be in the car.
Who's the title of your new book?
He lives in London.
I lost the last two lessons.
I'd like him to give me an explanation.
Where did you learn to speak French?
Tom failed.
Open your book on page ten.
This elevator is out of operation.
There were so many people in the room that after violence I could move.
He'll visit his uncle.
What do people eat for breakfast in Australia?
Tom has smooth eyes.
How many tickets did you get?
If you're busy, I'll help you.

We're here first.
I'm smarter than him.
I'd like to cancel my ticket.
Who taught you French?
You're very handsome.
Come on in, please.
I ate something.
Tom's leaving tomorrow.
Don't do anything you'll regret.
This book is very small.
I was very hungry.
Run!
They all started running.
When's Tom reading?
We'll kill you.
You're big enough to do it yourself.
"What would you like?" "I would like a dog."
You're working hard.
Tom wants to live in Boston.
It's really a beautiful theory, the only minority I think it's probably common in all the philosophical theories.
Why don't I be surprised?
I was in Boston in October.
I wasn't at that meeting.
He's spending a lot of money on shoes.
Tom has decided to leave Boston.
I'm good at keeping secrets.
I'm very nervous now.
I thought you were Japanese.
He's got a lot of fun here.
Who saw you?
It's bigger than that.
Please get back what I'm saying.
You don't need a friend.
Europe is an expert.
I wonder why Tom didn't talk to Mary.
Language is the vehicle of thought.
Do you really believe these stories?
Mike's the tallest of three.
Did you ask them to wait?
She's crying.
He'll work.
I guess you're Canadians.
Yeah, I know.
Will Tom die?
I'd like to go see a movie.
A lot of questions remain to be answered.
I like Irish music.
Give me a bottle.
What's your height?
I wanted to be in Paris.
The French are hard language.
I don't want to talk to Tom right now.

I want soup.
Here?
Where did you find the key?
Can that be wrong?
Tom doesn't fit the hot and cold summers here, and that's why he went up the mountains.
Bill, take the phone with you tonight.
I'll help in any way I can.
Please tell me your opinion.
Tom's waiting for you.
It's not Italian, is it?
She gave it to me.
I'll pay you.
He had a lot of pornographic magazines in his room.
Let's just leave her alone.
I just got back from Australia.
Tom was very friendly.
You're drunk!
Thomas is a rich man.
Tell us about Tom.
Thank you.
Are you awake?
Algeria is very different from the United States.
It wasn't a happy experience.
He teaches us French.
You're so beautiful you don't need a little bit.
Why do you want to go to Turkey?
He ran as fast as they could take his feet.
I like fishing.
I don't like these sweets.
The back door was broken.
I feel younger again.

I brought you something.
I thought I was asleep.
Our teacher is a real idiot.
Tom wasn't ready to talk about it.
We've built them up.
Tom was impressive.
H Mary's a prisoner with strangers.
We'll shoot.
I'm sorry.
Where's the exit?
It was dark when I came home.
Life is hard.
Who's Tom talking about?
Your father won't buy it.
Tom opened the door.
Here I am.
I hope you'll respond again.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Talk to me later.
Put the book on the others.
The bird is in heaven.
Tom took Mary.
Mike, how's it going?
Tom married Canada.
Tom says he's going to Boston in October.
You want me to tell him?
You saved us.
What are you sending?
Can I borrow a mollusc?
We only have three choices.
Celenna's behind the snow.
You need to talk to Tom.
Tom worked in Australia.
I want money.

Aren't you a teacher?
Tell him we're busy.
Tell her to help us.
Tom stayed.
Thank you. You're fantastic.
Will Israel be attacked in Iran?
I like to cry.

I got up early this morning.
Tom's helping Mary.
It'll protect you.
Tom's driving.
My father is rich.
Are you new?
I remember that word.
I'll decide.
Tell them you're not ready.
I showed her my room.
It's not hard French.
Someone's calling.
We found her.
Where are you sleeping?
His hair was tight.
Everything repeats the same mistake.
I don't want to open the window.
Steven's dead.
We can't stop you.
What language did I speak in Switzerland?
Help me get him up.
Are they Japanese?
Why does he hate you so much?
Let Tom swim.
How long have you been a teacher here?
Try to stay active.
This is a bed.
I want to get to the hotel before nightfall.
Are you drunk?
He tried to write a statement.
What are you gonna tell them?
Where are you going?
My father's missing.
I want to tell you something.
He's using you.
He's not back in Okinawa anymore.
I thought you were Canadian.

Do you really believe that Tom would come out with me?
Did you wear your hair?
I've got ten pounds.
How far?
He likes music.
Aren't you happy?
We could see the sunglasses from the window.
I've been drinking, drinking water.
It's not fish.
Tom wins.
He didn't come to the last meeting.
I want to leave Boston.
He doesn't speak many languages.

Tom wore a red shirt.
He's studying law at the university.
Tom answered.
Tom's reading a newspaper.
Welcome to Boston.
How many schools are in your city?
Let me talk, please.
This book doesn't deserve to be read.
Ask as many questions as possible.
Tell him the truth.

Kafe, please.
"Everyone's making a mistake."
I still have to run the hospital.
We need to close the windows.
It's not a gift.

No, I don't see CNN.
I have more money than you do.
Take it seriously!
I'm writing.
The roses are beautiful.
Tom wants to stay.
"How are you?" "All right, thank you."
Hold your hands and your hands in the trunk.
Even though it was calculated, I'm still exhausted.
Do you know who he is?
I'm waiting for your help.
Paul is smarter than Otto.
It's Chinese.
Tom's parents are both Canadians.
I'll miss you.
He's tired.
The accidents are inevitable.
Why are you angry?

We're not your parents.
Stop worrying.
Tom's gonna kill Mary.
You've had a good time in Japan.
It's a little late for coffee.
And you're leaving?
We've improved enough.
He'll be ready soon.
The fires broke automatically.
I'm done writing.

I think she likes it.
What are we doing in here?
Tom's gonna cause you.
Tom is one of Mary's friends.
I'm sorry.
There are dangers that threaten both men and women.
Whoever follows a lot of jokes doesn't drink one.

How do you know so much about Thomas?
You sell your hands before you eat?
They think they're good musicians.
Tom built a robot.
It's important to read a book from a young age.
Tom heard Mary.
The apples are red.
Were you busy last night?
- Yes, sir.
"Are you tired?" "No, not at all."
There's no difference whatsoever to choose.
The stars came out.
Tell them to do the same.
Your clothes always burn.
Many young families live in this area.

Where are you?
Everyone likes money.
Let her write me.
I was proud of you.
I'm not speaking French.
I'll listen.
You can get a ride.

I'm sure you and Tom will be happy.

You agree?
Tell her you're not ready.
The bridge's low.
Save yourself.
Do we have anything to bite?

I'm not cut.
Your French are good.
This is a movie for men.
Tom can stay here.
Tell them we'll be ready.
Millie's very nice.
I want to tell you something.
I don't want you to tell her.
That word has three lessons.
Don't worry, I'm sure I can find someone else!
This is an initial situation.
I like to study French.
Where's the wizard?
Tom's running late.
The game is made of wood.
You like the good afternoon?
I wanted to tell him something, but I didn't.
Tom also intends to do this.
I'll escort you to the airport.
He'll be ready.
Keiko sings.
I couldn't do it without you.

Looks like Mary doesn't understand why she had to.
I'm British.
We're going back to the ship.
When did you get up?
Were you busy last night?
My car's in bad shape.
How long have you been?
They open the door.
I've already done it.
Bob's not only playing guitars, but also fun.
Come with us!
No one's gonna talk.
I can't protect him.
Why did you dance with him?
I went to the river for fishing.
Come home early.
It was an accident.
You like baseball?
Do I love you?
I hope Tom's right.
They felt ashamed of the fact.
Friend of mine, Tom.
Do you want one of these?
Tom wants an exemption.
I'm American.
I was able to solve the problem this morning.
Tom and Mary fell in love with each other.
They got home on Park Street.
I'm not worried about you.
Give her a minute.
We won't let this happen.
If I have permission today, let's go to the beach.
Sam is welcome to our house.
We're all armed.
You're easy.
Those apples are big.
Mary's very attractive.
Tom took Mary away.
You want me to tell them?
Tom loves me.
I'm from Greece.
Don't give them to him!
Come on!
I know where the key is.
I can't run so fast.
You were naked.
I respect her.
Are you sure Tom can do this?
I think you're eating.
I speak French every day.
Can I borrow your earphones?
I don't like dogs.
Thank you!
Is he asleep?
You're not going to be alone.
I'm innocent.
Your clothes always smell bad.
When's Tom going to school?
Did you call Tom?
I agree with his plan.
I want to leave early today.
Tell her your theory.
Tom's patient.
Do you have a lot of friends?
Our team needs your help.
Tom's my guy.
You were scared.
We need volunteers.
Do you have any?
Forgiving others is an act of kindness to you.
Tom's a sexist.
I fell.
Who's this dog?
Tell Tom not to do it here.
No one asked.
Good evening.
He didn't say anything.
You need to help him.
I had doubts.
Tell them I'm busy.
Tom's studying after tonight.
What's a Soviet study?
Thank you for helping me!
What did you ask them to wait for?
If you can, follow me, please.
Tom's dressed in black.
That's hard for you, isn't it?
It needs a solution.
Stop him.
Tom decided not to answer the question.
I don't even know why I'm here.
Tell them everything.
I hate myself.
She's a rich woman.
Tell her you're not ready.
I'm very busy.
I won't need it.
Don't leave me alone.
He asked them to take off their shoes.
Are you speaking French?
Please don't tell your parents that.
I went hunting.
I teach French.
How'd it go on Saturday?
They need money.
I need his help.
One of Tom's kids lives in Australia now.
This proposal has never been translated.
You're a patient woman.
You don't love me!
The dogs started to bite.
You've seen an important element.
No one wants to die.
Tom's married to a celebrity.
I like to swim in the sea.
You can go, if you want, that depends on you.
"What's going on in the yard? I'm weird." "I have no idea."
Boston is my favorite city.
Where are you going?
What else happened to us in the kitchen?
You're bigger than that.
Tom's got a good desk.
Will you send me a message to Tom?
This is a woman we can trust.
Tom's gone.
I want him.
They're drinking some beer.
I'll stop you.
This car was built in Japan.
Tell Tom I'm in Australia.
When did you go to Boston?
You can't eat the soup with a chicken.
I'm back in Japan.
Tom returned to Australia.
I didn't see that.
I'd buy it if I wasn't a rat.
When I first met her, she was about 30.
I'm not your teacher.
I'm very happy.
It's too late.
You like this flower?
I've decided to leave tomorrow.
Tom started eating.
Did you play tennis last night?
What would he order at the restaurant?
You need to clean the table.
We'll use what we have.
I can't give up what I need in a suitcase.
Tom's dog is well trained.
The sky is waiting for the sunset.
That's for Tom.
Tom asked me if I was crying.
Tell me you'll do it.
Get 'em out of here.
It's unacceptable for us.
I got a minute.
Are you sure that's what Tom said?
Tom showed something to Mary.
I want you to help.
These are from Greece.
Who ate it?
I'll forgive you.
This is the best way.
The stone is heavy.
Tom's cooking well.
You'll be free.
I'll be ready tomorrow.
Tom can't speak French well.
We don't have the right equipment.

Do you know the answer?
Do whatever you want.
If I don't get on a chair, I can't get on the roof.
I'm having a bath every day.
How old are you?
You like your car?
Our teacher's advice saved us.
We're not gonna stop now.
I'm sure we'll see Tom again.

Life begins when we realize who we really are.
I don't know anything about her.
I like to swim.
They speak French.
I like to write in French.
Tom can't talk to girls.
Bring the key.
Tom told me he wanted to go to Boston.
Please follow me.
Why exactly is Tom doing this?
I'll watch TV.
This is not a reason.
It looks like honey.
Good day, isn't it?
I thought you were Japanese.
The price of this car has a discount of fifteen percent.
How are you?
Tom went too late to sleep.
That's the absolute truth.
He died ten years ago.
I can't remember who gave me this information.
Tom needs Mary.
He was supposed to meet him at the cafeteria.
That was a mistake.
No one was born a master.
Tom will maintain a national emergency system.
Is the fuel price down?
Never lie.
Another world is powerful.
It's beautiful.
I think it's better not to be rude.
There's no one in there.
You always called me from the house.
Most Americans are born of immigrants.
Maria didn't understand the question.
Can I help you?
It's easy to get sleepy when I see TV.
I want to see them all.
Tell him I won't be there.
Why did Tom ask that question?
How long have you been when you left Australia?
The knife on the table wasn't much more expensive for the meat, so I used my juice.
I was lucky.
You're hopeless.
He's got an ass dog.
I just want to help you.
Tom's basically good at anything he does.
The break is coming.
He's got a ticket.
Who else helped you?
Mary's not buying bread.
Cut the bread in a sliced patch on a fingertip.
I agree with the proposal.
Tom slept too.
Tom was my best friend.
I'll find it.
Tell them we'll be ready.
You're much smarter than me.
I'm not too busy right now.
Tom's very kind.
Is he a good man?
Tom loved me.
You're not a teacher.
I can't work for this company anymore.
The water is cold.
I feel sorry.
Do you like rap?
Tom's back from Boston.
I'm good at giving advice.
Tom hates his life.
Thank you, you're amazing!
Tell him I'm busy.
Tell you you can't do it.
Tom wore an old couple shoes.
You're welcome.
I didn't believe him until he came and talked to me in detail.
Read it.
That's the danger.
Australia is a beautiful country.
Would that change?
I tried to hide my disappointment.
I like both of them.
None of these speak French.
As far as I know, he's not married.
Mary's playing soccer.
The piano's music calms the soul.
Where's your father?
Is everything ready?
Help me!
Thank you for your interest.
I won't fail.
You have many friends.
I'm going to the Lord.
I'm sure Tom's going.
My favorite color is the orange.
They know you're here?
Tom's wrong.
Have you ever fished in this river?
I'm ready.
Tom's dreaming.
The doctor will give me an injection.
It's not tall.
You'll never change.
You're mine.
What exactly did you tell them?
Would you like to start?
I would like to know all the European languages.
What's he gonna order in the restaurant?
You have to listen to me.
Stop resisting!
Tom and Mary could have finished it by 2:30 if they had worked a little faster.
Tom knew I was busy.
We'll find it.
I'm weird.
I'll eat here.
This is a Japanese chicken.
Take off his glasses.
It's good to dream.
He had a headache.
Which one is my right?
Tom doesn't speak French.
I've gone to ten foreign countries so far.
You underestimated me.
Finally, symmetrically, these two continue to be under repair.
Horreya.
I wasn't angry.
That's not my key.
You're doctors.
My decision to study abroad surprised my parents.
The door is at the end of the road.
Let go of the balls!
He was a hero.
I refuse to let that happen.
I visited my friend Tom yesterday.
The team's already making preparations at 5:30 in the morning.
You're unbelievable.
Tom has two cats.
Tom's not good at cooking.
We don't speak French.
You have my keys.
Tom is the killer.
"Are you tired?" "No, not at all."
I thought Tom would be interested.
I feel very secure here.
Turkey was stronger than Greece.
Are you for or against the war?
I think Tom's better.
I need it.
Tell them you'd like to leave.
You think this is a game?
You're better than that.
We'll follow you.
I lost my train this morning, which I usually take.
He was trying to kill me.
He's lost his sight.
It's worth an effort.
I'll be here.
Shall we get a movie?
Tom sold his house in Boston.
The neighbors are friendly.
My cousin's dog is dead.
I'm still looking for Tom.
What did they say?
Do you need them?
He's leaving for Tokyo tomorrow.
First of all, he doesn't like calling a grandpa.
Tom wanted answers.
They just left.
Tom is Mary's boss.
Why are you so strict with yourself?
Tom's eating cat food.
The computer is new.
That book is written in French.
Tom's running fast.
Tom put his hands back into his pockets.
Tell him you lied.
I've only eaten.
Mary answered the question from the desk.
They wanted to steal the car.
You like my new shirt?
You'll wish.
Who's the title of your new book?
We know each other well enough.
Mary doesn't really like Tom, even though she says he likes him.
I'm Richard.
We went to baseball.
Tom gave me this letter.
How many students do you have?
Tom wasn't in Boston last week.
You don't have a school today?
Tom's still on the Park road?
We've been drinking all night.
I got the list.
February is the second month of time.
The gloves don't have teeth.
Can you give me the keys?
I want to warn you.
Why don't you answer me?
He said he'd check it out.
Coffee's small.
The share of the debts is very low.
I haven't paid Tom yet.
This is a game for four players.
Tell them I'm here.
Tom tried to protect his children.
Tom's not wearing gloves.
Did you know that?
This is an old letter.
What's your favorite color?
I want Tom.
You made the same mistake again.
I'm not too busy.
I want to die.
Did you eat anything?
I guess you're better than Tom.
The city I grew up is very beautiful.
Tom's writing too fast.
The problem is you're not Canadians.
He'll understand.
I'm sorry.
My homeland is all over the world.
Tom's gonna be ready.
You look busy.
Are they talking about Tom?
I love Hetomi.
Do you want to be famous?
I forgot to buy flowers in Mary.
I'm not a professional.
Who belongs to this car?
Tell them to leave.
He worked hard.
Let him help us.
Tom likes adventures.
Were you there?
He's working.
I don't like the surprises.
Jane was angry.
We'll wait.
I think Tom has three choices.
We'll be together.
Tom agreed to give us a meeting.
In our health!
We'll save you.
He's wearing a white cotton shirt.
Why did you stop?
I thought you were a Canadian.
Is that the powder yours?
Tom's cooking bread once a week.
I went in.
Let's get him a drink.
I think he's innocent.
Who's your woods?
Where's Tom eating breakfast?
Tom couldn't believe the news.
Are you from Australia?
If you've got something to say, cut it.
Do you want to be clear?
You're unheard of.
I had a good idea.
It's not written in French.
I wrote it for her.
He's got two brothers.
You wanted to kill Tom?
Is it hard to know Greek?
What's the matter today?
I'll take care of everything.
It's been a shame now.
Hymenus is my favorite time.
I don't know what my mother is.
We're about to move to Boston.
Where can I buy a hotel?
Have you read it yesterday?
Tell her you'd like to help.
We heard a powerful explosion.
Are you sleeping, Tom?
My father cut the wood with a spring.
We know him.
You like to cook Japanese food?
Can I talk to the scanner?
Are you sure you don't want me to talk to Tom about it?
The presidential election is not a fair competition.
He hit me for my success.
Tom's been working hard.
Tom saw me.
That's incredible!
Tom often appears on TV.
There must be a reason.

Tom's favorite color is blue.
The winter will soon end.
Try not to think about it.
They're not alive.
Where did Tom come from?
Tom said he'd probably go for a party with Mary Monday.
I thought you could help me.
I should've been with them.
You work hard.
I love the giant shoes.
When I'm done with what I'm doing, I'll come.
How many days have you been in Boston?
They arrived there before the wedding.
Millie's learning Swahili.
The gun was the killer.
I heard Tom was in Australia.
Tom will help you.
We have two girls.
Just say what you want to say.
You made a lot of mistakes.
You're incredibly stupid.
Did he love you?
I want everyone to stay under the same roof.
We all want to do it this evening.
I miss Boston.
We have three kids.
You're not Japanese.
Tell him I'm ready.
Linda likes to eat chocolate.
He's trying.

Don't leave me here alone.
Tom and Sue have been known since 1985.
Are you talking Chinese?
I have two mother languages.
I won't tell you.
What happened?
We heard the announcement that you went through the tests.
There are happy people and sad people.
We're not the only Canadians here.
I'm looking for Tom.
What was I thinking?
Tell them I'm here.
I thought you were Canadian.
I thought you were Canadians.
Where's her family?
Tom runs every day?
Thank you for helping me!
I don't want them.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
I want to thank everyone for their prayers.
Open fire!
We went every Sunday to the church.
Tell her we'll be ready.
Can I accompany you as the exit?
He's still studying.
I don't want them.
Tom's gone.
She's not my wife.
I want to know what's in the box.
He's younger than your sister.
When do your breaks begin?
Tom's gone crazy.
What did you tell them?
I've already talked to Tom about it.
Vatican is the smallest state in the world.
I want to drink some water.
I'm not sick.
He was busy.
Get out of my office!
What would you advise me to do?
Tom doesn't hate you.
The computer you're using is late.
I left the door open.
Let him not come.
He ate all the honey.
I'm not kidding.
I'm sorry.
It's different.
I just moved.
What did you expect Tom to buy?
You're smarter than that.
I want this TV.
He's tired.
In an hour, we're going to be over.
I'd like to write a book about Cyprus.
Tom's breaking the table, right?
Tell them your theory.
I could have found my wallet if I had done this.
Where's the Greek duty?
I'm your woods.
Tell her you're sick.
Where are your keys?
Tom died in 2013.
I'm writing a letter to Maria.
Tom and Mary are in love.
I'm sure I'll find a way.
Why are you so sad?
The cars will be here tomorrow.
You want some water?
Say it.
As far as I know, Tom could be dead.
Is he smart?
Tom is always willing to help.
I'll see you tomorrow!
Tom and I are both Canadians.
We're students.
Does anyone know Japanese?
Tom's not smart.
He was born rich.
That's a sign.
Tom agreed reluctantly.
I'm playing violins.
Get your things together and get out of here.
You'll be surprised what you can learn in a week.
I don't know where you're going.
I want a green one.
We need to get out of here.
They told me to wait here.
Why are you so sad?
Tom had to walk to school when he was a kid.
They lied to me.
Only we can warm them up.
Maybe someone should like Tom.
He's always working a lot.
You ruined him.
When did you get here?
I know myself very well.
We'll find one.
I told my friends.
I think we could help each other.
I live in Milan.
Tom wouldn't believe us.
Am I your friend?
I can admire other people, but I've never tried to be someone else beyond myself.
I don't trust women.
I suggest you read this book.
Can you find it?
Please correct the next proposal.
Tell me if I need to make some changes.
What is the most widely distributed book in the world?
In the air, it's drying the sail.
Is this book yours?
You're much smarter than me.
Tom's about the same age as you.
That's the goal.
My brother's crying very powerful.
Can you take it here?
We need more coffee.
I'm fine, thank you.
I'll be ready.
What are you gonna drink?
What color is your dress?
No one will know.
She decided to cut the cigarette.
We're closing at 2:30.
I never hit Tom.
Looks like he lied.
You won't like what I'm going to say.
When are you leaving?
What time is it opening up?
I don't know French.
You ruined him.
Out of your mouth and out of God's mouth!
You shot her.
You like them.
Water's not enough.
Does she eat the honey?
You'd better stay here.
Tom is a year older than Mary.
We're all trying to help you.
The girl is beautiful.
I'll come with you.
Where's the money, Tom?
Where are you working?
They're actors.
Can you speak my language?
Aren't you gonna go to Australia to make things happen?
I like your shirt.
Tell them I'm ready.
I'm in bed.
Australia is a beautiful country.
Of course, every religion has its own rules.
I know where Tom was born.
Take a walk until you see the post office and then turn right.
You don't have to talk so hard.
Tom's eating too much.
There were so many people in the room I could hardly move.
It's going to fall.
You're ready.
We recognized it.
It's dieting.
You're sick.
Tom's a subject.
I underestimated him.
Are you really Canadians?
I suddenly started taking weight.
How many Canadian friends do you have?
This is Ali's book.
It was my husband's idea.
Tom wanted Mary.
I've got ten balls.
I appreciate that.
Have you paid all the bills?
You bought flowers?
Tom's close.
You told her.
Don't touch the sky of the dog.
Tom's angry with us.
I bought you a red triangle.
Tom made Mary cry.
He won a phone.
You look tired.
Not many people like Tom.
You're stronger than me.
Tom's still in Australia.
I heard you.
Ask me tomorrow.
Tom tells me he doesn't care if you like it or not.
To forgive others is an act of kindness to yourself.
My goal is to learn your language.
Are you sure you hit the last button?
I thought you were Canadian.
It was a bad choice.
Take my pants.
I woke up and saw that my wallet was missing.
What have you eaten?
I think I can hear them.
My neighbor's name is Tom.
I trained Tom several times in Boston.
We've got wine.
Did you tell them about us?
Close your eyes for three minutes.
At first, I couldn't understand it.
They like fruits in Tom.
That was my box.
He started singing.
He speaks French.

Yankev and Sheyne are friends.
This opera has three actions.
We'll listen.
Why is Tom doing this?
Please don't touch me.
That student is Tom.
Mary has beautiful eyes.
Mary's a smart girl.
Come with me, Tom.
"Are you tired?" "No, not at all."
No one translates my proposals!
I like vegetables.
Tom will decide.
I want you to die.
No one lives there.
Look at my arm.
Tell them not to be late.
Are you sure you don't want me to talk to Tom about it?
I'm proud of you.
The sea is green.
They're bigger than you.
Do you mind?
Why are you angry?
Tell them I'm ready.
He's smart though he's worth it.
The wedding is safe.
He doesn't drink coffee.
Do you need them?
He's a man at the door.

Most participants are from Australia.
Tom ate fast.
Tom arrived in October.
They'll buy something.
You don't have to let your son always be his own.
Why did you lie about this?
Tom changed color.
I didn't sign anything like that.
Tom's clean.
I guess you're Canadian.
The book is open.
We'll put it down.
Do you often give your car to Tom?
He had a lot of trouble in Rio de Janeiro.

It's a return.
That's not fair.
I'm gonna be the best.
I married Canada.
I need to get back to work.
Your kids will be safe with Tom.
Give me another chance.
Let me introduce you.
If the time permits it, we leave tomorrow.

We were both tired.
Thomas knows Mary's right.
I'll bring them to you.
And Tom and Mary are Canadians.

Are you sleeping?
He asked me what he said.
The door is locked.
This song is for you.
Tom has a daughter.
I've always been there.
It's hot today.

I see you have a Greek name.
What's your favorite song?
I've seen a lot of things.
We killed them.

Let's make a quick break.
It's free.

The Greeks urged the party, not for their logic, but for their actors, to warn them to take a deep breath, as they were preparing for a future big proposal; so a party represents a stop.

They pulled off the scene.
I live in Taschendi.
Have you already set it all up?
I'll sleep here.

I like your house.
Tom contacted Mary.
Why did Tom buy a new car?
Tom wore a white shirt.
Tom would have been overprotecting me.
You were perfect.
How much do you want?
The distributions do not need to correspond to a natural quantity. Anything can be a place of distribution enough to determine the addition and multiplication with a large size.
I haven't seen a tetrophilic man here for a week.
He's praying alone.
Did you tell him?
I'm Paula.

We're both very tired.
You're not Canadians.
Mary was born a son.
Did you close the window?
You look like bosses.
You like French wines?
Who pays?
You tried.
You're wrong, I didn't say that.
Amelia stole my heart.
Millie's going to school.
Do you have money?
No one understands me.
Turn your teeth after every meal.
Tom gave Mary good advice.
He's buying the computer.
Can you make a toast?
I like that shirt.
I'm talking to you.
The triangles in my garden are beautiful.
I'll accompany you.
She doesn't want to talk about it.
We're always wrong.
What if something went wrong?
I thought you were at work.
He likes the landscape.
Tom told Mary to get up.
The worst is over.
Tom just finished writing a letter to Maria.
There's a hospital near here.
Is Mary Tom helping her?
He gave me a roll.
I'm shy.
They had three sons.
I didn't want milk.
I'm not going to disappear.
Got it?
Today is Sunday.
What are you going to leave behind?
He doesn't have a gun.
Tom doesn't come here often.
One more step, and I'd have been bitten.
I haven't tried.
He's a man at the door.
Where's Tom?
Tom said he liked snow.
I'm talking about yourself, please.
Our husbands are Polish.
Our people don't go on a trip to the oven.
Most people want to hear only their own truth.
You've been lying.
When are you going to Japan?
Where's Tom sleeping?
Tom saw me.
I'll be with Tom.
I can't do anything for you.
You're drunk!
I'll be ten in the next month.
That's for you, Tom.
I'm afraid of you.
We're all Canadians here.
This is an interconnected approach.
I don't like this town at all.
Tom has a son and a daughter.
It may have changed.
I married a Canadian.
Tell her you don't need it.
I called her for the movie.
The dog eats a honey.
Tom tried to comfort his wife.
You don't want to talk to me, do you?
A good dress ensures a meeting, but a good mind a meaningful relationship
Who blew the car?
This probably affected their decision.
Tom is better in French than in English.
I remember them.
Are you working this morning?
I don't know how Tom gets out.
There's no one sitting here.
Are you talking to me?
A small step for man, a giant wave for humanity.
You need to hear the truth.
Tom knows you.
Give me three minutes.
Tom wants to stay here.
I'd like a taste of Portuguese.
I'm in charge.
That's not true.
We demand actions, not words.
Everyone went to the same bar.
What's Tom talking about?
Tom told Mary he always lived in Boston.
There's a lot of rumors in Iceland.
We'd stay more if we had more time.
Let's order two bottles.
I'm weak.
I finally found a job.
Don't leave me like that.
Tom's back from Australia.
Excuse me, what time is it?
It doesn't surprise me.
I'll give you Tom's address.
When did you get back from Tokyo?

Tell him I won't do this.
First, second, third, fourth, fifth, seventh, seventh, eighth, ninth, 1st, tenth... last.

Come with me to the south corner of France!
Tom forgot his suitcase in the train.
I gave him his father's hat to build a doghouse.
I just finished.
He's not Algerian.
When Tom gets here, I'll pay the money I promised.
First the immigrants, then you.
Can you shut this up?
Can you cool the cheese?
I don't like taking a risk.
Tell them to go and worry.
Tom's taller than me.
Do what you think.
Stop there.
I'll talk.
Are you sure?
Her eyes were red from the ceiling.
Are you taller than Tom?
I went to the park with Mary last night.
I'm the only one who didn't have to.
He's smart.
I could do it this morning.
I thought you were Canadian.
He can't even write or read.
I'm sorry, what time is it?
We have three kids.
Tell them to help me.
Tom was dressed like a girl.
How's the pantelon?
I like my coffee to be hot.
Tell them we're busy.
I like the way you think.
Tom refused to listen.
When will he come home?
Tom's good at cooking.
He's desperate.
Do you have a tattoo?
That's the beginning.
"May I help you?" - "No, thank you, I just miss."
Mary protected her husband.
You're not Japanese.
Lufah!
Tom stayed calm.
They say you can usually judge people from the company they have.
We have nothing.
My shoes are bigger than yours.
I'd like you to miss the meeting tomorrow.
We like music.
Can you slow down a little bit?
I don't have a girlfriend.
The news made them happy.
I visited her in Germany.
Tom's already gone home, but Mary's still here.
Tom's drinking coffee.
We don't eat.
We all made a mistake.
This Saturday we can make free calls.
You don't have a good eye.
I wanted to die.
Where's your wife?
You're following?
I can read without glasses.
Tell me your address.
We have what we deserve.
Let's talk about it.
You don't trust me, do you?
My job is to teach English.
That brings me great joy.
Tell them I won't do this.
I like Boston very much.
I'd like to help you.
I'm sorry.
You'll be safe with Tom.
Try to tell him to help us.
Excuse me, speak English?
You're late yesterday.
We're students.
Why are they angry?
I hope she's okay.
I'm human.
Everyone likes money.
Tom's talking to Mary.
Tom did a lot of great things.
There are five fish in my office.
Tom's not driving fast.
Thomas is smarter than Mary.
The style is up in the office.
Are you going to stay?
Tom and I are getting married in October.
Sit down!
I love the beer.
Who were you talking to?
You have to sleep.
Who broke it?
What's your excuse?
Apparently Tom's too schooly.
Wait for me there.
Why don't you help me?
You think you can catch me?
Tom got three months on his body.
Tom claimed he was innocent.
He's smiling.
Your face is red.
You're not ready.
Tom and Mary are coming here now.
You're not Canada.
He said something.
She advised him to take the medicine.
Tom is my greatest brother.
Don't underestimate me.
The couch's disgusting.
I'm a big fan.
Are you sure Tom's not busy?
Who's sick?
Thomas has a Turkish friend.
I like jazz.
Tom's got a tougher mind.
Are you sure you hit the right button?
Good morning!
Are you satisfied?
We sent the products yesterday.
You'll cry.
You have something on your fingers.
How often do you wash your clothes?
Tom has a high moral standard.
I'm in danger.
Tom was wearing gloves.
Tom forgave Mary.
Tell them who we are.
You went to the casino.
Don't be afraid to make a mistake when you speak English.
I can't help you this week.
You don't have to say such things when there are children around.
I'll never forget you.
I thought you were Canadians.
We recognized them.
I heard the news on the radio.
Do you miss Tom?
His wife doesn't even know why he died.
You need to see this movie.
He was driving safely.
Tom knows I'm Canadian.
I lost my card for lunch.
There was no time.
After the accident, the injuries were transferred to the hospital.
We have to finish it all by Monday morning.
We have to work very hard.
As you wish!
Who are your parents?
I played tennis.
And I don't like wearing shoes with the rest of them.
We're both planning to go to your party.
Thank you for coming!
Tom sang.
He's funny.
What did you ask him?
He's running now.
It's very piantic for me.
What I want now is a bottle of cold water.
We'd like to order 18 tons of oil.
Tom handles the French quite well.
Why did you shoot her?
Let's keep going.
I want to talk to my lawyer.
She likes flowers.
I think he's lying.
This elevator can transport ten people at a time.
Freedom is not free.
He teaches us French.
You're sick!
You think I'm a lawyer?
I'm the only one who doesn't want to.
We have to hurry to get to the station tomorrow.
What are Tom's priorities?
Tom has a brother in Boston.
I want to talk to you.
Tom decided to go to Australia.
Tom didn't want to do it.
Tom taught Harvard.
It's cold. Why don't you set up a horseman?
We'll save you.
Are you ready?
Only for adults.
I don't know.
Tom loved Mary.
He wanted to see his boss in Tokyo before he left for America.
Come early.
How many letters did you send to Tom?
I've been seeing him for months.
I forgot her attack.
I want you back to Boston.
They're crazy.
You're a liar.
We're not open.
I'm drinking milk.
I admire you.
I didn't go to the zoo.
These are my loved ones.
One speaks English and the other is Japanese.
When are you planning on getting married?
They're writing.
What can I do about it?
I can't imagine what it means to be there.
It was English.
I had no doubt.
I'm not even tired.
It's beautiful.
What do you want me to say?
Tom doesn't eat red meat.
The roads are covered by snow.
Well, I have a proposal to make.
I don't remember the exact date.
He's smart.
What are you gonna tell them?
He quit smoking.
When do you eat dinner?
Would you like a glass of red wine?
It's just drinking water.
I can't forget her beauty.
You sell your hands before you eat?
Tom's playing tennis.
Everybody's got secrets.
Don't lie to me again.
I don't have any brakes.
I like to help others.
What animal is big?
I'll wait until October.
You know how to use it?
They're lucky.
The decision is mine.
You want to tell her?
You hid the truth from me.
His answer was negative.
I get it.
You're still alive.
How old is he?
Let her not come.
Is Tom really a Canadian?
Tom plays tennis every day.
It's not cheap.
She's a very attractive woman.
The bottom is learned.
How can we do that?
You think you could help me cut the garden this evening?
I can't eat cheese.
You're too young.
It's in the middle of the floor.
I want to go to Korea.
Tell Tom I'm for a club.
I want an eviction.
I'm tired.
It's my dinner today.
We're willing to negotiate.
The girl wants to know the truth.
Have I ever asked you to work Sunday?
I feel guilty.
I had a dream.
Follow him.
I appreciate the coffee.
There's a doctor.
It's unlikely it's coming today.
My father hasn't eaten dinner yet.
Melanie thinks the situation is very bad.
Tom ignored Mary's warning.
He was rich.
My daughter is Canadian.
But I wasn't blind, I'd buy it.
Wait for us here.
“ Are you speaking English? ” — “No, this is my first lesson! ”
We'll die if we stay here.
You want to eat chicken?
I have a friend.
He didn't understand Mary's joke.
Are you gonna tell them?
It's very sweet.
Who brought you here?
We made our break in the river.
Who closed the door?
Are you sure you don't want me to talk to Tom about it?
Take my wife.
Put your clothes in here.
Is Mary your daughter?
I'm not an atheist.
I want the book.
You need to help him.
He's drinking beer.
It's Thomas' birthdays today.
My wife is a doctor.
Someone gave you something.
I'm on TV.
Tom bought an entire car.
Tom's got a lot of money.
You don't have a way.
Why are you smiling?
Didn't I tell you not to close the door?
Please don't touch me.
I got you a present.
You're not poor.
We're going to visit Tom.
My colleague and I are doing the same job, but he has been promised promotion very soon.
She likes oranges?
Are you mad at me?
You have to write a letter.
Tell her I'm ready.
I'll wash the dishes.
I like snow.
Tom saw Mary today.
I was born in Boston.
They believe me.
You killed her.
They'll find her.
I don't care about modern art.
We killed them.
You're so beautiful!
Tom's great.
Tom says he needs help.
Why did you shoot them?
He's got a lot more than I expected.
Who was right?
I want to watch TV.
I got him down.
Speak French.
She's married to a dentist.
We're still shocked.
He'll find it tonight.
I'm the coach.
Who's going to lead?
The park was allowed.
Our dog has lost a lion.
Tell Tom we'll be ready.
Tom's playing golf.

Welcome to our country!
What's your favorite color?
Tell us about it.
Don't worry!
I wake up once a week.
Tom's smarter.
Tom started it.
Tom doesn't know where to wait for Mary.
I still love Tom.
That's an incredible result.
I like it, and I need to learn a lot of foreign languages.
I love you, Tom.
Tom has gray hair.
We shot him.
You got three cars, right?
Tom will find us.
It depends on you.
I don't remember having invited you.
Tom stole Mary's watch.
What have you got there?
Tom's gonna change.

You're very handsome.
Are the Belgians legal in Australia?
I didn't give it once.
He loves his son.
I'm very disappointed.

Where did you get it?
Doctors have a difficult problem.
There are three situations in the mall.
Keep digging.
I like to help others.
I need water.
Are you sure you don't want me to talk to Tom about it?
Yankev was deeply affected by the history of Borekh.
I don't mind them.
He must be an American.
When do we have to deliver the report?
Who stole Tom's bike?
We don't want her.
This room is used as a kitchen.
Who are you talking about?
Someone sings.
How much spring roll did you eat?
The flower is ice cream.
I like this room.
But you really want to know, all you need is to ask.
What's this girl?
Know you.
He's the hero.
I didn't eat it.
Our shop is not open.
You underestimated them.
Get out of here.
Tom stole Mary's computer.
She's not white.
The man they're talking about has been dead for a long time.
Tom and Mary didn't agree to anything.
I'm desperate.
It's closing!
When did you smoke for the last time?
We all agreed with Tom.
Tom's house is close to the beach.
We're about to hit a wall.
This tea is good.
This is the last warning.
Give us three minutes.
You'll learn to speak English fluently!
That's great!
Say it to the Hungarians!
I know his address.
I want to know when the meeting starts.
I know he's lying.
Actually, you're absolutely right.
You like white chocolate?
The wounds are broken.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
I'd like to visit Athens's beginnings.
This relationship is very powerful.
You'll be busy tomorrow.
Can you give me a better explanation?
Can you see the star tonight?
Ask him when the next plane leaves.
You're alive.
Look around.
Tom said he knows Mary's secret.
That's the absolute truth.
Did he accept it?
I got someone to clean up my house.
I'll get you something.
We found them.
Mary knows what she's doing.
Tom really wants to help.
They did not understand the question.
I'm listening to music.
I'll call you in an hour.
I'm done writing.
I'm in Boston.
I got a valuable lesson.
Where can I find an ATM?
Let's thank him.
I want to get to the hotel before nightfall.
He's very sick.
Where's the toilet?
You're the special one.

It sounds dangerous.
The tree is straight.

I'll find her.
I'm working at a bank.
I want to go see a movie.
They're teachers.
You're perfect.
I want to know what his name is.
Tom's gone.
Why are you so disappointed?
Go to Tom to help Mary.
Get Tom on the phone at 2:30.
The dog slept on the couch.
They need you.
How old are your brothers?
Tom bought a car in Mary.
It's almost dawn.
I was wrong.
Tom studied in Boston.
I'll show you.
He wants to live in the city.
I'll never see you again.
From here and beyond, you should read more.
I've never had such a problem.
Did we win?
I'm not very good at this.
Were you alone?
I'm not accusing anyone.
Tom missed me.
I have to go to bed.
Tom hasn't called yet.
Tom wanted a divorce.
I need money.
You were in the army?
You're a good journalist.
You've got a good plan.
I'm not going to buy anything today.

Don't leave me here alone.
He's a good athlete.
Tom is my friend.
Tom's parents married in Boston.
What did Tom show you?
Are you tired?
I woke up early this morning.
Tom stayed.
I'll go to the beach.
The bus just left.
I was in the mountains.
I've started to get used to living in Boston.
If you lose your wallet in the middle of the night, you're tired.
Tom reads French.
He's lucky.
Has the new trainer improved the quality of the team?
We left at 2:30.
Let me do my job.
Smoking is prohibited in school.
I don't ask for money.
Don't tell me you're sorry for me.
What direction did he go?
Tom can't walk.
I'm proud of my brother.
I don't believe what Tom says.
Are we leaving now?
You'll learn.
I want to see them again.
He was murdered.
You're bigger than me.
We're doctors.
Do you think you could help me get rid of the bushes this evening?
Is Tom drinking?
I'm ready to go.
Who died?
Tom runs every day.
Tom couldn't understand why Mary had made that decision.
You're Canadian, aren't you?
I'll have to tell them.
Have you read this book?
Tell you I'm not here.
I won't go to Australia for a year.
Right.
We're honest.
I woke up at five.
Tell them we'll be ready.
Who taught you French?
Tom had a black cat.
I'll buy one.
Tom would never have done that.
Tom opened three candles.
We're gonna kill him.
Are you sending him a message?
I'll show you the city.
I want to close the door.
Why did you do that?
He's lost in the woods.
How far is it from Brno?
Let's hope it works.
Tell you you're sick.
I was hiding.
Is that so?
What are you going to eat today?
Tom is Canadian.
Are you kidding?
They have warned us.
Tom's got a lot of thinking.
Wait here.
In his eyes, he was perfect.
Can you find him?
He's strong, generous and, careful, kind.
They're Canadians, aren't they?
I'll learn French.
Tom sings pretty well.
I was tired.
You're perfect.
Tell him it's important.
Why did you do that?
I'm eating.
Try to stay active.
I admire you.
Tom came to Japan from Australia.
He's my best friend.
Let's talk about it.
Your father won't buy it.
He may have his faults, but I'm going.
Tom lost a book.
"There'll be live music in Pick-Nick." "What kind of music?"
He made tea.
I would like you to miss the meeting tomorrow.
Don't talk to me about religion.
They don't understand me when I speak German.
I have a apartment in Boston.
Is your car black?
I'd like to work this afternoon.

Mary's a lucky girl.
Tell him I'm not here.
Tom is the only Canadian I know.

He's my husband.
The Persians are not hard.
Tom's a liar.
I'm not accusing anyone of any particulars.
Tom was happy.
Your husband teaches me Italian.
I speak a lot of languages.
Tom shot them.
We're trying.
Is this a panic?
You know, the night's death I've got a staff, because it's gonna start me off with a sedative.
I left the bank with permission.
Why don't you tell them?
Is he asleep?
Where's the school?
I don't care about politics.
Are you crazy?
I'm very tired.
What do you want me to do?
What do you understand?
Tom has never used the Internet.
When did you start using fax contacts?
If I hadn't been there, I'd have bought it.
Sometimes he returns home late.
We were in Boston.
Wait a minute, please.
I can't forget her smile.
I'm going home today.
I've got ice cream.
We've got the best food in town.
I had a hard time.
What do they want?
Anna can't find a job.
This man is not my husband.
Tell them we're busy.
You shot us.
Here's my album.
What fruit is red?
Tom and Mary agreed with us.
He's stronger than me.
Everyone likes money.
Go get Thomas.
I'm bigger than him.
Tell him why you can't go.
You were right.
Life is like a big highway.
There's a cook in the fridge.
The bus is going home.
Bring Thomas.
Where's the post office?
Tom's calling the pies.
Tom loved Mary very much.
Who ruled the Pedemont?
Who teaches you French?
Let's get him out of here.
Stay in your car.
You're two years younger than me.
Thomas bought something.
Tom will forgive us.
Tom says he saw who approached Mary's car.
Welcome home.
Do you love me?
He hasn't returned to Okinawa.
What did he do with all the money?
Where's Tom playing?
The Committee on Urban Planning accepted our proposal.
You're the only Canadian in our school.
My dog is smaller than yours.
My father died ten years ago.
Tell her why.
You're not thirty.
Because I hate you.
I love Lian.
Tell me why Tom was missing.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Why don't you try talking to the police?
I don't trust this driver.
You won.
Mary was born a boy.
Were you alone?
I'm 25 years old.
Don't take your mask off.
Tom ate.
Where's my mollusc?
He's dead.
I'm not gonna tell anyone about her.
Tom is learning French.
Tom's funny.
You're blind.
I know it was you.
Tom and Mary said they don't have to do it again.
Tom didn't die of cancer.
I don't understand you at all.
The girls are working.
Len, they want to talk to you.
We have everything we want.
We need to leave him here.
Where are Mary and Tom?
You missed me.
Security's been down.
I'm so happy now.
What time did you get back?
Tom was trying to make Mary feel better.
He chased me.
Let's talk.
Tom gave a gift to Mary.
He read it and answered it.
Do you know where Holly is?
You should talk to Tom about it.
I don't think it's been three years.
Where did you find the keys?
Some people do strange things.
You can't hear me.
Nobody trusts you.
Give me your names.
What exactly did Tom do?
I'll see you at the hospital.
He's been looking for it at the University.
I wasn't here last week.
Tom hit me.
He's my son.
That student is Tom.
You're right.
Because I hate you.
I have evidence.
I'm having a bath every second day.
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
Who sent it?
I gave him my address.
I'm drunk.
Peter opened the door.
They killed her.
Were you happy?
Tom doesn't like beer.
Tell me how you went to the exams.
I ran home.
Tom broke it.
Ton took care of it.
Do you think Tom will help us?
Eat the soup now that it's hot.
Carlos was on the hill.
Tom stole his ring.
Tom fought with Mary.
I can't promise you anything.
Tell him I'll do it.
Guys, thank you so much for coming here today!
Tell him I'm busy.
He wants to know the truth.
You can't eat here.
It's eight to four.
A little trick in front of the stage is normal before a society.
Let's do it!
We worked as ants.
I went outside.
You'll like it.
Now it's up to you.
Tell him I'm busy.
I didn't sleep.
He's been betrayed by the news.
You like snow?
These are Tom's.
When did you decide to leave Harvard?
Do you want them?
To forgive others is an act of kindness to yourself.
I'm a failure.
We haven't talked to Tom yet.
We stopped at the shop.
I lost my dog.
You have to wait.
We need you here.
Tom said he liked the idea.
Tom just returned from Australia.
You want me to tell her?
This coffee came from fresh water.
Mr. Jackson is teaching us French.
It's too big.
Please, give me this book.
You bought a return ticket?
I touched her.
Don't leave me here alone.
You have to listen to me.
I'll wait here at 2:30.
Do you know how to use it?
Ten less than two is eight.
I'm happy.
Why are you lying?
There are many words I don't understand.
We have to fix things.
Mary saw Tom get out of the hotel with Concita.
Were you happy?
You have to write a book.
Thomas is Mary's husband.
It's very unfair now.
The bread is fresh.
Animals run.
Tom's moving late.
I think you know who I am.
Your family needs you.
Get down.
The paper is white.
He wore a gleco.
We both had a lot of fun.
Tom broke it.
We need a map.
Who's missing?
You hit me.
Don't be shy.
Are you busy?
What's that?
He's not married.
Bob helped me.
My tongue is complicated.
They're tired.
Stop smoking.
I want to go to school.
Did you cry?
Tom opened the kitchen door.
Try this sweet cheese.
Keep the base with both hands.
Tell her I'm busy.
All planes are clear.
That's a joke.
I guess you're better than Tom.
Don't lie to me!
Tom wasn't at all busy.
We want meat.
When was the last time you did something for the first time?
I'll stay.
She doesn't like this game.
Tom's gonna tell the truth.
Open the box.
Are you home?
I couldn't find my hotel address.
Did you break him?
Don't leave the doors open.
I like the honey.
Don't touch the sky of the dog.
This is the worst hotel in town.
Keep your eyes closed.
Tom was glad everyone had enough food.
Where's your stuff?
Who did you give him?
Tell her to come here.
Emily lives in Melanie's house.
Would you like to learn French?
Did he love you?
Tell her I'm sick.
Who are you working for?
You're my friend.
Which one is your book?
He's superfluous.
Did Tom have a gun?
We're not friends with Tom anymore.
Tom was happy.
Did you sleep here?
There are islands on the sea.
Who do you want?
What did we do?
Can I?
His coffee price fell.
I like that shirt.
To develop properly, these plants need a land that does not contain much moisture.
You want me to tell them?
They believed you.
Tell her you lied.
I made a deal.
I can't read that.
Can I borrow your earphones?
He's not there.
We have what we deserve.
I like these.
It's hot. I'm gonna clean up the air conditioner.
Tom went to the bathroom.
You can sit down if you want.
What's your favorite prize?
Go ahead and make room for the others.
Tell her you don't need him.
I want to try something new.
I haven't seen him lately.
They'll catch us.
Take it easy!
Give me some time.
Emily stole my heart.
Do you need ice cream?
Is he speaking English?
Tell them to come home.
Take it with you.
I'd like to see it.
We met him when we went there.
I have to tell him.
Are they cute?
My choice will be on Saturday, 29 November 2014, at 10:30 p.m.
When did Tom get those shoes?
I don't know where Tom's bags are.
Tell them I won't do this.
I'm not very good at this.
I was hoping to see Tom.
We're all Canadians here.
Tom made some mistakes in the test.
Tom's gonna cook.
I was scared.
It's better to know someone how to fish than to give him a fish.
I was so angry.
I see.
Honestly, I don't like it.
Tom will listen.
Were you alone?
We need more drivers.
I think you're on the right path.
He's making me laugh.
I'm in a friend's house.
Have you ever slept?
I thought it was a bad dream.
We know what the problem is.
I don't think so.
I'm Mexican, speaking Spanish.
I have a special relationship with my aunt.
I need your help.
Tom wanted to know French.
What are Tom's chances of winning?
Tom doesn't need a lawyer.
Are you speaking Spanish?
You're weak.
Where's the paper?
Go home with your feet.
Tom's gonna cry.
Where's he staying?
When are you coming?
We're ready to help.
Are you ready?
Let them not come.
That's not true.
The knife on the table wasn't more expensive to cut the meat, so I used my juice.
Is that your car?
I fell in love with her.
Tom came here last night.
Who asked you?
We sailed from Boston to Chicago.
Is this where the bus stops?
Stop him.
Tom decided to stay until 2:30.
Tell her it's important.
I like to sing.
Tom lost all his money.
How about Tom?
Tom has something to tell you.
How many hours did Tom work yesterday?
Why are we poor?
Tom's cool from the middle and the top.
I hope they find Tom.
I'm waiting for you from both of them.
Bring them with you.
Give me your money.
What can you say in English?
French is not easy to speak.
It's not me.
Can you answer?
I have to check before the seven.
How many oranges did Tom eat?
"What do you want to know?" "Everything."
Tom continued to help Mary.
Tom will decide October.
Tom will help Mary.
Close the window before you get out.
I wasn't at his funeral.
I didn't think it would be so easy to do it.
Wait a minute.
Tom's gonna catch Mary.
Tom ignored Mary's advice.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
Are you sure you don't want me to talk to Tom about it?
I'm your doctor.
Look at that tall building.
The city has changed a lot since then.
These are ours.
Our team has good players.
I always put my team first.
I have many friends living in Boston.
That's not fish.
Emily's doing the lessons she's got for the house.
I like music like that.
Maria played the role of an elderly lady in the exhibition.
They'll survive.
France's president is Paris.
Tell her to go and worry.
I think I'm in love with Tom.
The bathroom isn't very clean.
I'm learning Spanish.
I'd like to help you.
I didn't like it.
The wings are red.
We were both very depressed.
Why did you wear a red jacket?
Tom and Mary remained good friends.
Are you speaking a language other than English?
Tom's too late.
How often do you eat outside?
I'm 19 years old.
When do you have birthdays?
Did you know Tom well?
I was in the right place at the right time.
Are you sure you hit the last button?
It's not hard to know English.
The date will be specified later.
Nobody's coming.
If you're busy, I'll help you.
I've got a bad thing to do.
I appreciate it.
Your friend's here.
I'm 30 years old.
How was the beach?
You're Tom's daughters, right?
Tom drank a bottle of wine.
I've told you things I've never told anyone else.
Tom put his hands on him.
It's very strange.
I like China.
Tom smokes.
I'll never be as rich as Tom.
You're not a dog.
You like white wine?
He'll find it tomorrow.
I just said a lot of shit.
The house's broken down.
Take the book to the office.
Can I see your birth certificate?
Tom can't tell you anything.
We need him.
Meat meat?
I saw you on TV.
I'm not your teacher.
I'll buy one.
I understand you.
If you can, please follow me.
He started talking to the dog.
They all got out running out.
They speak English and French in Canada.
He's blind.
Tell them it's important.
The party is Sunday.
We're all Canadians here.
Listen to how it spins.
Tom sent you?
Tom's been crying.
I've lost my style.
How is this word expressed?
He saved me.
I've got an idea.
Where's the bank?
Don't move.
I'm waiting for your help.
It's almost 2:30.
What is it?
Who knows the answers?
I read this book last week.
Tom has black circles under his eyes.
We weren't talking about Tom.
They trusted you.
You think this is a game?
I just finished the bathroom.
We're not gonna change anything.
Look what I did!
Tom is Harvard's decision.
You have thirty days.
Tom bought a little gift to Mary.
The Russian language is a Slovenian language spoken as a mother in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and is widely used, although without official recognition, in Latvia, Estonia and many other countries, which were the republics of the former Soviet Union.
Tom said they'd come.
Many tourists visit Boston every year.
I'm bigger than that.
Why don't you tell them?
I'm still trying to find Tom.
"How long have you been?" "I'm twenty-three years old."
Get some water.
I wish I had been born in Canada.
Are you sure you hit the last button?
We recognized them.
There's a lot of money left.
That's unfair.
In Japan, the new school year begins in April.
You must be very proud of Tom.
How did you guys get in?
Tell her I don't want to go.
I'm not coming back.
Tom calls his car at least once a week.
The investigation is easy.
This is my grandmother.
What do you usually do?
I have other plans for him.
Are you speaking French?
It's possible.
We're close enough.
Tom took F to the gym.
Did you see who did it?
We're not millionaires.
Let's thank them.
You'll see the difference.
Don't tell Tom about the party.
I don't know why Tom's not here.
He never forgets his money.
It's almost 20 years.
You have to stay.
I didn't vote.
Are you mad at Tom?
My parents live a meaningful life in space.
He lost all his money in the casino.
I love green peppers.
You made the same mistake.
She said she had a good face.
What are you gonna say to Tom?
Thomas found me.
We're very busy.
I can live without water.
We've given your orders the highest priority.
We're making a mistake sometimes.
Could I use it?
They killed her.
My car's abrasive.
I have to tell you the truth.
You never trusted me.
We don't know where Tom went.
Who's the boss now?
I'm pregnant.
Can you teach me some French?
I'll show you how it works.
What did you say about us?
These are our children.
Dick worked hard to solve this problem.
I'm not Italian.
I want to meet Tom.
The text is intelligible.
We need more volunteers.
You're more powerful than these.
Tom's in his ass room.
The scissors fell off the tree.
Tom says he's eating.
I'm not staying in Boston.
Who's this dog?
Tom's waiting for Mary for at least an hour.
Most of them are Canadians.
Now you're cooking.
Are you sure Tom can do this?
Are you sure you don't remember?
Tom likes to fuck.
Who's Tom talking to?
Shoot them.
Are you talking Japanese?
You're going to be upset.
Are you talking my language?
Can we talk?
Is lunch today?
Do you know where Holly is?
This table is empty.
One of Tom's kids lives in Australia now.

With the rain stopped, the game started again.
Tom has my keys.
He looks happy.
We've been well prepared.
Are you happy?
Tom will forgive you.
You like to make me sleep, don't you?
Is he there?
He's very cute.
They'll listen to us.
I fell early.
We'll have to wait.

Anything else?
Tom's stupid.
Are you going to Boston next week?
You look happy today.
I want you to stay.
We'll put it down.
That's easy to say, hard to do.

We didn't know who it was.
Is your car black?
I'm sending them a message.

I love her and she loves me.
Were you happy?
Our woodsman is stupid.
Thomas's laughing.
Come on, please.
